J	Beck, MW; Hagy, JD; Le, CF				Beck, Marcus W.; Hagy, James D., III; Le, Chengfeng			Quantifying Seagrass Light Requirements Using an Algorithm to Spatially Resolve Depth of Colonization	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Depth of colonization (Z (c)) is a useful seagrass growth metric that describes seagrass response to light availability. Similarly, percent surface irradiance at Z (c) (% SI) is an indicator of seagrass light requirements with applications in seagrass ecology and management. Methods for estimating Z (c) and % SI are highly variable making meaningful comparisons difficult. A new algorithm is presented to compute maps of median and maximum Z (c), Z (c,med), and Z (c,max), respectively, for four Florida coastal areas (Big Bend, Tampa Bay, Choctawhatchee Bay, Indian River Lagoon). Maps of light attenuation (K (d)) based on MODIS satellite imagery, PAR profiles, and Secchi depth measurements were combined with seagrass growth estimates to produce maps of % SI at Z (c,med) and Z (c,max). Among estuary segments, mean Z (c,med) varied from (+/- SE) 0.80 +/- 0.13 m for Old Tampa Bay to 2.33 +/- 0.26 m for Western Choctawhatchee Bay. Standard errors for Z (c,med) were 1-10% of the segment means. Percent SI at Z (c,med) averaged 18% for Indian River Lagoon (range = 9-24%), 42% for Tampa Bay (37-48%), and 58% for Choctawhatchee Bay (51-75%). Estimates of % SI were significantly lower in Indian River Lagoon than in the other estuaries, while estimates for Tampa Bay and Choctawhatchee Bay were higher than the often cited estimate of 20%. Spatial gradients in depth of colonization and % SI were apparent in all estuaries. The analytical approach could be applied easily to new data from these estuaries or to other estuaries and could be incorporated routinely in assessments of seagrass status and condition.

Using GPS-surveyed intertidal zones to determine the validity of shorelines automatically mapped by Landsat water indices	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Satellite remote sensing has been used extensively in a variety of shoreline studies and validated using aerial photography. This ground truth method only represents an instantaneous depiction of the shoreline at the time of acquisition and does not take into account the spatial and temporal variability of the dynamic shoreline boundary. Landsat 8's Operational Land Imager sensor's capability to accurately delineate a shoreline is assessed by comparing all known Landsat water index-derived shorelines with two GPS-surveyed intertidal zones that coincide with the satellite flyover date, one of which had near-neap tide conditions. Seven indices developed for automatically classifying water pixels were evaluated for their ability to delineate shorelines. The shoreline is described here as the area above and below maximum low and high tide, otherwise known as the intertidal zone. The high-water line, or wet/dry sediment line, was chosen as the shoreline indicator to be mapped using a handheld GPS. The proportion of the Landsat-derived shorelines that fell within this zone and their alongshore profile lengths were calculated. The most frequently used water index and the predecessor to Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), was found to be the least accurate by a significant margin. Other indices required calibration of their threshold value to achieve accurate results, thus diminishing their replicability success for other regions. MNDWI was determined to be the best index for automated shoreline mapping, based on its superior accuracy and repeatable, stable threshold value.																	0303-2434					MAR	2018	65						92	104		10.1016/j.jag.2017.10.007								WOS:000418312200009

Human-driven loss of hydrologic connectivity by roads, artificial channels and water flow regulation appears to be the reason behind mangrove mortality in this ungauged wetland. In this study, we determined the CGSM's current state of hydrologic connectivity by combining a remote sensing technique, termed as Wetland Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), with a hydrologic study of river water discharge. For this research, we processed 29 ALOS-PALSAR acquisitions taken during the period 2007-2011 and generated 66 interferograms that provide information on relative surface water level changes. We found that change in water discharge upstream on the main tributary of the CGSM could explain at most 17% of the variance of the change in water level in the CGSM. Fresh water inputs into the wetland were identified only when the mean daily water discharge in the river exceeded 700m(3) s(-1), which corresponds to only 30% of the days during the period. The interferogram analysis also revealed that artificial channels within the wetland serve as barriers to water flow and contribute to the overall loss in hydrologic connectivity. We recommend increasing fresh water inputs from the Magdalena River by reducing water regulation of fresh water from the river and improving connectivity on either side of the artificial channels crossing the CGSM. This study emphasizes the potential of the application of wetland InSAR to determine hydrologic connectivity in wetlands that are completely or poorly ungauged and to define the necessary guidelines for wetland hydrologic restoration.																	1748-9326					FEB	2018	13	2							024003	10.1088/1748-9326/aa9d23								WOS:000423452800002

An airborne remote sensing case study of synthetic hydrocarbon detection using short wave infrared absorption features identified from marine-harvested macro- and microplastics	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The abundance and distribution of plastic debris in natural waters is largely unknown due to limited comprehensive monitoring. Here, optical properties of dry and wet marine-harvested plastic debris were quantified to explore the feasibility of plastic debris optical remote sensing in the natural environment. We measured the spectral reflectance of microplastics (< 5 mm) from the North Atlantic Ocean, macroplastics (> 5 mm) washed ashore along the USA west coast and virgin plastic pellets over a wavelength range from 350 to 2500 nm. Compared to the spectral variability of multi-colored dry macroplastics, the measured dry marine-harvested microplastic reflectance spectra could be represented as a single bulk average spectrum with notable absorption features at similar to 931, 1215, 1417 and 1732 nm. The wet marine-harvested microplastics had similar spectral features to the dry microplastics but the magnitude was lower over the measured spectrum. When spectrally matched to the reference library of typical dry virgin pellets, the mean dry marine-harvested microplastics reflectance had moderate similarities to low-density polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene and polymethyl methacrylate. This composition was consistent with the subset sampled with the Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and what has been reported globally. The absorption features at 1215 and 1732 nm were observable through an intervening atmosphere and used to map the distributions of synthetic hydrocarbons at a landfill and on man-made structures from airborne visible-infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) imagery, indicating the potential to remotely sense dry washed ashore and land-origin plastics. These same absorption features were identifiable on wet marine-harvested microplastics, but the ability to conduct remote sensing of microplastics at the ocean surface layer will require more detailed radiative transfer analysis and development of high signal-to-noise sensors. The spectral measurements presented here provide a foundation for such advances towards remote detection of plastics from various platforms.																	0034-4257	1879-0704				FEB	2018	205						224	235		10.1016/j.rse.2017.11.023								WOS:000423007700018						
J	Yu, X; Wang, YB; Liu, XY; Liu, X				Yu, Xiang; Wang, Yebao; Liu, Xiangyang; Liu, Xin			Remote sensing estimation of carbon fractions in the Chinese Yellow River estuary	MARINE GEORESOURCES & GEOTECHNOLOGY												Reliable and consistent carbon fraction estimates are crucial in studying the role of coasts in the global carbon cycle. Remote sensing offers the potential to estimate carbon fractions with its advantages of large spatial coverage and real-time surveys. Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption was generally used as a proxy to estimate dissolved organic carbon (DOC). However, the CDOM-DOC relationship varies by region and remains inconstant. Thus, the correlation between the reflectivity of visible band and DOC concentration was directly adopted in DOC estimation and performed well in former studies. Atomic groups of the various components of carbon fractions produce electronic transition by absorbing photons, and this process occurs both in the visible bands and in the near-infrared bands. Thus, the wide range of absorption band provides an approach to estimate carbon fractions using the correlation between the reflectivity of the whole visible/near-infrared bands of optical satellite sensors and carbon fractions. A new ratio band combination was developed and performed well in carbon fraction concentration retrievals, and the yielded estimation accuracies (R-2>0.77, RPD >2.02) were sufficient to map the spatial distributions of carbon fractions with the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer image.																	1064-119X	1521-0618					2018	36	2					202	210		10.1080/1064119X.2017.1297876								WOS:000424062100006						
J	Luitel, B; Villarini, G; Vecchi, GA				Luitel, Beda; Villarini, Gabriele; Vecchi, Gabriel A.			Verification of the skill of numerical weather prediction models in forecasting rainfall from US landfalling tropical cyclones	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The goal of this study is the evaluation of the skill of five state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems [European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), UK Met Office (UKMO), National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), China Meteorological Administration (CMA), and Canadian Meteorological Center (CMC)] in forecasting rainfall from North Atlantic tropical cyclones (TCs). Analyses focus on 15 North Atlantic TCs that made landfall along the U.S. coast over the 2007-2012 period. As reference data we use gridded rainfall provided by the Climate Prediction Center (CPC). We consider forecast lead-times up to five days. To benchmark the skill of these models, we consider rainfall estimates from one radar-based (Stage IV) and four satellite-based [Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission - Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA, both real-time and research version); Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN); the CPC MORPHing Technique (CMORPH)] rainfall products. Daily and storm total rainfall fields from each of these remote sensing products are compared to the reference data to obtain information about the range of errors we can expect from "observational data." The skill of the NWP models is quantified: (1) by visual examination of the distribution of the errors in storm total rainfall for the different lead-times, and numerical examination of the first three moments of the error distribution; (2) relative to climatology at the daily scale. Considering these skill metrics, we conclude that the NWP models can provide skillful forecasts of TC rainfall with lead-times up to 48 h, without a consistently best or worst NWP model.

J	Watson, EB; Corona, AH				Burke Watson, Elizabeth; Hinojosa Corona, Alejandro			Assessment of Blue Carbon Storage by Baja California (Mexico) Tidal Wetlands and Evidence for Wetland Stability in the Face of Anthropogenic and Climatic Impacts	SENSORS												Although saline tidal wetlands cover less than a fraction of one percent of the earth's surface (similar to 0.01%), they efficiently sequester organic carbon due to high rates of primary production coupled with surfaces that aggrade in response to sea level rise. Here, we report on multi-decadal changes (1972-2008) in the extent of tidal marshes and mangroves, and characterize soil carbon density and source, for five regions of tidal wetlands located on Baja California's Pacific coast. Land-cover change analysis indicates the stability of tidal wetlands relative to anthropogenic and climate change impacts over the past four decades, with most changes resulting from natural coastal processes that are unique to arid environments. The disturbance of wetland soils in this region (to a depth of 50 cm) would liberate 2.55 Tg of organic carbon (C) or 9.36 Tg CO(2)eq. Based on stoichiometry and carbon stable isotope ratios, the source of organic carbon in these wetland sediments is derived from a combination of wetland macrophyte, algal, and phytoplankton sources. The reconstruction of natural wetland dynamics in Baja California provides a counterpoint to the history of wetland destruction elsewhere in North America, and measurements provide new insights on the control of carbon sequestration in arid wetlands.																	1424-8220					JAN	2018	18	1							32	10.3390/s18010032								WOS:000423286300032

While significant advances have been made in mangrove mapping using remote sensing, no study has documented long-term changes in mangrove extents in Sierra Leone-one of the most vulnerable countries in West Africa. Such understanding is critical for devising regional management strategies that can support local livelihoods. We utilize multi-date Landsat data and cloud computational techniques to quantify spatiotemporal changes in land cover, with focus on mangrove ecosystems, for 1990-2016 along the coast of Sierra Leone. We specifically focus on four estuaries-Scarcies, Sierra Leone, Yawri Bay, and Sherbro. We relied on the k-means approach for an unsupervised classification, and validated the classified map from 2016 using ground truth data collected from Sentinel-2 and high-resolution images and during field research (accuracy: 95%). Our findings indicate that the Scarcies river estuary witnessed the greatest mangrove loss since 1990 (45%), while the Sierra Leone river estuary experienced mangrove gain over the last 26 years (22%). Overall, the Sierra Leone coast lost 25% of its mangroves between 1990 and 2016, with the lowest coverage in 2000, during the period of civil war (1991-2002). However, natural mangrove dynamics, as supported by field observations, indicate the potential for regeneration and sustainability under carefully constructed management strategies.																	1424-8220					JAN	2018	18	1							12	10.3390/s18010012								WOS:000423286300012						
J	von Holdt, JR; Eckardt, FD				von Holdt, Johanna R.; Eckardt, Frank D.			Dust activity and surface sediment characteristics of the dustiest river in southern Africa: the Kuiseb River, Central Namib	SOUTH AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL												Previous remote sensing studies (2005-2008) have identified Namibia's Kuiseb as the dustiest river in southern Africa. The purpose of this study was to extend the dust event record through to 2014, and to examine the nature of the surfaces from which this satellite imagery indicates these dust plumes originate. The new 10-year record confirms the delta as the dustiest geomorphological unit (54% of plumes), followed by the gravel plain (28%) and then the river (8%). No dust originated from the Namib Sand Sea dunes or interdunes. Field observations provided detail about the geomorphological and sedimentological setting of the landscape components. The laboratory analysis focused on the size characteristics of 153 surface sediment samples collected from the Kuiseb main channel, its terraces, delta, gravel plain surfaces and tributaries, dunes and interdune. This study has identified that surface sediments suitable for dust production increase towards the coast with particular dusty' floodplain surfaces between Swartbank and Rooibank and the Kuiseb delta. We suggest that silt crusts formed as the flood water dissipate, provide a main source of potentially entrainable material for emission. The crusts consist entirely of silt- and clay-sized materials, with a maximum of 97%<63m, 39%<10m and 6%<2m. Anthropogenic disturbances of the surfaces are potentially playing a role in the production of dust, with the area undergoing significant development.																	0373-6245	2151-2418					2018	100	1					104	121		10.1080/03736245.2017.1339627								WOS:000423739500006						
J	Xiao, L; Lang, Y; Christakos, G				Xiao, Lu; Lang, Yichao; Christakos, George			High-resolution spatiotemporal mapping of PM2.5 concentrations at Mainland China using a combined BME-GWR technique	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												With rapid economic development, industrialization and urbanization, the ambient air PM2.5 has become a major pollutant linked to respiratory, heart and lung diseases. In China, PM2.5 pollution constitutes an extreme environmental and social problem of widespread public concern. In this work we estimate ground-level PM2.5 from satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD), topography data, meteorological data, and pollutant emission using an integrative technique. In particular, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) analysis was combined with Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) theory to assess the spatiotemporal characteristics of PM2.5 exposure in a large region of China and generate informative PM2.5 space-time predictions (estimates). It was found that, due to its integrative character, the combined BME-GWR method offers certain improvements in the space-time prediction of PM2.5 concentrations over China compared to previous techniques. The combined BME-GWR technique generated realistic maps of space-time PM2.5 distribution, and its performance was superior to that of seven previous studies of satellite-derived PM2.5 concentrations in China in terms of prediction accuracy. The purely spatial GWR model can only be used at a fixed time, whereas the integrative BME-GWR approach accounts for cross space-time dependencies and can predict PM2.5 concentrations in the composite space-time domain. The 10-fold results of BME-GWR modeling (R-2 = 0.883, RMSE = 11.39 mu g/m(3)) demonstrated a high level of space-time PM2.5 prediction (estimation) accuracy over China, revealing a definite trend of severe PM2.5 levels from the northern coast toward inland China (Nov 2015 Feb 2016). Future work should focus on the addition of higher resolution AOD data, developing better satellite-based prediction models, and related air pollutants for space-time PM2.5 prediction purposes.																	1352-2310	1873-2844				JAN	2018	173						295	305		10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.10.062								WOS:000423007600028

In this paper, we analyze the spatio-temporal variability of the Chlorophyll-a detected by the ocean color sensor (CHLA(sat)) in BMCZ in order to understand its environmental variability. We use the MODIS-Aqua CHLAsat monthly composites imagery from 2002 to 2015, and applied two statistical methods: the correlogram-based robust periodogram to identify, over a broad spectrum of temporal, the most significant periodicities, and the pixel gradient distribution to study the spatial-temporal gradients within the BMCZ and variations over the continental shelf and coastal waters. Our results point out to the predominance of the annual cycle over most of the investigated area, although an area from latitude 37 degrees S in direction NE, alongshore of Uruguay to Brazil, evidences interannual periodicities, possibly related to variations in the discharge of the Rio de la Plata associated with the El Nino phenomena. The ocean color spectroradiometric signature in terms of pixel gradient presents a relatively high variability (similar to 0.0 to 0.65 mg m(-3)); in particular the high values of the pixel gradient correspond to saline front of the estuarine system of Rio de la Plata, and to the strip of the platform that extends along the isobaths of 80 m (coast of Uruguay), especially in the center and south of the study area.

Regional patterns of physiological condition determine giant kelp net primary production dynamics	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Photoautotrophs vary the concentration of photosynthetic pigments in response to changing environmental conditions. In the ocean, the chlorophyll a to carbon ratio (Chl:C) has been used as a proxy for the physiological condition of phytoplankton, and there is laboratory evidence that the growth rate of juvenile giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera), a coastal foundation species, is positively related to Chl:C under nutrient-limited conditions. We examined the relative roles of nutrients and light in determining Chl:C dynamics and if fluctuations in Chl:C were related to changes in canopy biomass and net primary production (NPP) from sites spanning 750 km of the California coast. Seventy percent of the variability in canopy Chl:C was explained by a combination of photosynthetically active radiation and seawater nitrate concentration. In the periodically nutrient-limited waters of the Southern California Bight, changes in Chl:C positively resembled changes in available nitrate, whereas Chl:C negatively tracked changes in light for the more nutrient-replete central California coastline. Values of Chl:C were positively related to residuals from an autoregressive model of kelp biomass at the southern California sites indicating that Chl:C is a proxy for physiological state of the kelp canopy. NPP estimated through correlations with kelp biomass and lagged Chl:C compared well to established field-based estimates. These results open the possibility of assessing giant kelp physiological condition from estimates of Chl:C modeled from sea surface irradiance and nitrate concentration, which in turn can be used to estimate giant kelp primary production over large spatial and temporal scales using future remote sensing technologies.																	0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2018	63	1					472	483		10.1002/lno.10753								WOS:000423029300030

Historical changes in the shoreline positions and inundation based on projected sea-level scenarios of 0.5 and 1 m were assessed for Nagapattinam District, a low-lying coastal area in the southeast coast of India, using high-resolution Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data; multi-dated Landsat satellite images of 1978, 1991, 2003, and 2015; and census data of 2011. Image processing, geographical information system, and digital shoreline analysis system methods were used in the study. The shoreline variation indicated that erosion rate varied at different time scales. The end point rate indicated the highest mean erosion of - 3.12 m/year, occurred in 73% of coast between 1978 and 1991. Weighted linear regression analysis revealed that the coast length of 83% was under erosion at a mean rate of - 2.11 m/year from 1978 to 2015. Sea level rise (SLR) impact indicated that the coastal area of about 14,122 ha from 225 villages and 31,318 ha from 272 villages would be permanently inundated for the SLR of 0.5 and 1 m, respectively, which includes agriculture, mangroves, wetlands, aquaculture, and forest lands. The loss of coastal wetlands and its associated productivity will severely threaten more than half the coastal population. Adaptation measures in people participatory mode, integrated into coastal zone management with a focus on sub-regional coastal activities, are needed to respond to the consequences of climate change.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JAN	2018	190	1							51	10.1007/s10661-017-6426-0								WOS:000422680800051

An assessment of commonly employed satellite-based remote sensors for mapping mangrove species in Mexico using an NDVI-based classification scheme	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Optimizing the classification accuracy of a mangrove forest is of utmost importance for conservation practitioners. Mangrove forest mapping using satellite-based remote sensing techniques is by far the most common method of classification currently used given the logistical difficulties of field endeavors in these forested wetlands. However, there is now an abundance of options from which to choose in regards to satellite sensors, which has led to substantially different estimations of mangrove forest location and extent with particular concern for degraded systems. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of mangrove forest classification using different remotely sensed data sources (i.e., Landsat-8, SPOT-5, Sentinel-2, and WorldView-2) for a system located along the Pacific coast of Mexico. Specifically, we examined a stressed semiarid mangrove forest which offers a variety of conditions such as dead areas, degraded stands, healthy mangroves, and very dense mangrove island formations. The results indicated that Landsat-8 (30 m per pixel) had the lowest overall accuracy at 64% and that WorldView-2 (1.6 m per pixel) had the highest at 93%. Moreover, the SPOT-5 and the Sentinel-2 classifications (10 m per pixel) were very similar having accuracies of 75 and 78%, respectively. In comparison to WorldView-2, the other sensors overestimated the extent of Laguncularia racemosa and underestimated the extent of Rhizophora mangle. When considering such type of sensors, the higher spatial resolution can be particularly important in mapping small mangrove islands that often occur in degraded mangrove systems.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JAN	2018	190	1							23	10.1007/s10661-017-6399-z								WOS:000422680800032

This paper presents a novel remote sensing algorithm for the retrieval of spatially distributed gage height data in coastal waters with emphasis on nearshore waters using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data. The algorithm was trained using the Artificial Neural Networks toolbox in the MATLAB program and over 4 years (2007-11) of cloud-free MODIS Aqua data for waterleaving reflectance as well as ground truth measurements collected daily from U.S. Geological Survey stations along the Louisiana Gulf Coast. The algorithm was validated using 3 additional years of independent data sets, which were not used in the algorithm training and collected from 2012 to 2014. Cross-validation results indicated that the gage heights derived from the new algorithm were in good agreement with observed height, as evidenced by the high linear correlation coefficient of 0.8465 and low root mean square error of 0.2238 m. The new algorithm makes it possible to produce daily, spatially distributed gage height data for coastal management and resources development in shallow coastal areas where there are no gages.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JAN	2018	34	1					220	228		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-16-00161.1								WOS:000422738000021						
J	Ahmed, A; Drake, F; Nawaz, R; Woulds, C				Ahmed, Asib; Drake, Frances; Nawaz, Rizwan; Woulds, Clare			Where is the coast? Monitoring coastal land dynamics in Bangladesh: An integrated management approach using GIS and remote sensing techniques	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												This paper draws upon the application of GIS and remote sensing techniqueS to investigate the dynamic nature and management aspects of land in the coastal areas of Bangladesh. The geomorphological characteristic of the coastal areas is highly dynamic where land erosion and accretion with different rates remain a constant phenomenon. This study focuses on three coastal zones: western, central and eastern that comprise the entire coastal area of the country. At its core, this study uses the past 30 year Landsat satellite images. This research reveals that the rate of accretion in the study area is slightly higher than the rate of erosion. Overall land dynamics indicate a net gain of 237 km(2) (7.9 km(2) annual average) of land in the area for the whole period from 1985 to 2015. The results also demonstrate that the rates of both erosion and accretion are higher in the central zone compared to the western and the eastern zones of the coastal area. This is the first time that the entire coastal areas of Bangladesh have been considered for assessment. This study also recommends that coastal managers, planners and policymakers to consider the identified dynamic trends of coastal land before opting for any specific measure. Constant monitoring using the GIS and remote sensing techniques would be a viable management for this purpose. This study has identified some causes of land dynamics, particularly for the three coastal zones, that might be helpful for policymakers in identifying the nature of interventions needs to be taken for specific coastal zones.																	0964-5691	1873-524X				JAN 1	2018	151						10	24		10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2017.10.030								WOS:000418973100002						
J	Shumack, S; Hesse, P; Turner, L				Shumack, Samuel; Hesse, Paul; Turner, Liam			The impact of fire on sand dune stability: Surface coverage and biomass recovery after fires on Western Australian coastal dune systems from 1988 to 2016	GEOMORPHOLOGY												This study aims to determine the common response of coastal sand dunes in Western Australia (WA) to fire on decadal time-scales, in terms of ecological-geomorphic-climatic interactions to test the hypothesis that fire plays a role in coastal dune destabilisation. Fires are commonly suggested to have contributed to widespread dune reactivation in Australia and globally, a hypothesis that is relatively untested. We used data from the Landsat Thematic Mapper, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, and Operational Land Imager missions to monitor changes in surface coverage on coastal sand dunes in south-west WA after fires. We analysed 31 fire scars from 1988 to 2016 in two Landsat scenes on the west and south coast of WA. Recovery ratios derived from the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were used to monitor patterns in post-fire biomass and surface cover. Recovery ratios are correlated with indices of bum severity, and meteorological data to investigate relationships. We also used Maximum Likelihood Classification to monitor changes in bare sand area. Results suggest that recovery followed a strongly consistent pattern, and is characterised by rapid vegetation cover re-establishment within six to twelve months. Prior to this, some aeolian activity may have occurred but without substantial surface changes. Initial germination and/or resprouting were followed by steady growth up to seven years, where NDVI typically neared pre-fire values. Some variation in early recovery occurred between the west and south coast, possibly owing to relative proportions of reseeding and resprouting plants. A log regression explained 75% of the recovery pattern (79% on the south coast). Precipitation had some ability to explain recovery up to nine months post-fire (r(2) = 029 to 0.54). No relationships were observed between estimates of bum severity and recovery. After nine months, the biggest cause of spatial variation in recovery was the pre-fire community composition and related seedbank or resprouting density. Image classification did not identify any new blowout features except where fires were not the primary cause. Results suggest that fires are not presently contributing to the destabilisation of coastal dunes in south-west WA. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Widyatmanti, W; Sammut, J				Widyatmanti, Wirastuti; Sammut, Jesmond			y Hydro-geomorphic controls on the development and distribution of acid sulfate soils in Central Java, Indonesia	GEODERMA					8th International Acid Sulfate Soils Conference	JUL 17-23, 2016	Univ Maryland, College Park, MD	Int Union Soil Sci, Working Grp Acid Sulfate Soils	Univ Maryland			Coastal planning policies and regulations in Indonesia have not adequately considered acid sulfate soils (ASS) as a constraint on development. Aquaculture is often undertaken in unsuitable areas, and fish and shrimp culture systems, in particular, fail after a short period of production because of the impacts of ASS on pond water quality and, subsequently, on fish and shrimp health. This study describes a mapping approach based on an understanding of the hydro-geomorphic controls on the formation and the distribution of ASS in Central Java, Indonesia. The underlying approach was to identify associations between ASS development and distribution within estuarine hydro-geomorphological units (HGUs). This study utilized a multi-level methodology involving multi-resolution, remotely-sensed data and GIS analysis, coupled with field and laboratory-based data, to obtain hydro-geomorphic and soil information at different mapping scales. An estuary classification scheme for Central Java identified river, tide and wave-dominated estuaries as the dominant estuary types. HGUs were identified in each estuary type to define the relationships between landform development processes and pyrite concentration in soil layers. Thirty-nine HGUs were classified based on landforms, marine and fluvial hydrology, geomorphic processes, land use, and vegetation types. Field and laboratory assessment of soil properties were undertaken to identify the horizontal distribution of ASS in the HGUS and its vertical character in soil profiles. In contrast to previous studies, the results showed that estuaries located in low-energy environments on the north coast have low (< 0.1%) pyrite concentrations in 90% of their HGUs. Decades-old intensive aquaculture and dredging activities, that led to repeated oxidation and leaching, were identified as factors for low pyrite "concentrations. On the south coast, the combination of a high river and marine energy environment created scattered landforms with soils that have very high (4-9%) pyrite concentrations. These ASS-bearing HGUs mostly developed in low energy estuarine environments overlying former high river energy environments. The information generated for each HGU facilitated the development of an ASS mapping model that incorporates knowledge on the relationship between soil and landform formation in Central Java estuaries. Knowing where ASS occur is essential to minimize the risk of environment degradation. Using multi-resolution, remotely sensed data decreases cost and labour, compared to more traditional mapping approaches, especially to identify sampling sites for field surveys. The resulting maps and mapping methods will improve land capability assessment for brackishwater aquaculture and other coastal land use in Indonesia.																	0016-7061	1872-6259				DEC 15	2017	308						321	332		10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.08.024								WOS:000413282100031						
J	Phillips, SR; Costa, M				Phillips, Stephen Robert; Costa, Maycira			Spatial-temporal bio-optical classification of dynamic semi-estuarine waters in western North America	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The use of standard ocean colour reflectance based algorithms to derive surface chlorophyll may have limited applicability for optically dynamic coastal waters due to the pre-defined coefficients based on global datasets. Reflectance based algorithms adjusted to regional optical water characteristics are a promising alternative. A class-based definition of optically diverse coastal waters was investigated as a first step towards the development of temporal and spatial constrained reflectance based algorithms for optically variable coastal waters. A large set of bio-optical data were collected as part of five research cruises and bi-weekly trips aboard a ship of opportunity in the west coast of Canada, to assess the spatial and temporal variability of above water reflectance in this contrasted coastal environment. To accomplish this, in situ biophysical and optical measurements were collected in conjunction with above-water hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) at 145 stations. The concentrations of measured biophysical data varied considerably; chlorophyll a (Chla) (mean = 1.64, range: 0.10-7.20 mu g l(-1)), total suspended matter (TSM) (3.09, 0.82 20.69 mg l(-1)), and absorption by chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) (a(cdom) (443nm)) (0.525, 0.007-3.072 m(-1)), thus representing the spatio-temporal variability of the Salish Sea. Optically, a similar large range was also found; particulate scattering (b(p)(650nm)) (1.316, 0.250-7.450 m(-1)), particulate backscattering (b(bp)(650nm)) (0.022, 0.005-0.097 m(-1)), total beam attenuation coefficient (c(t)(650)) (1.675, 0.371-9.537 m(-1)) and particulate absorption coefficient (a(p) (650nm)) (0345, 0.048-2.020 m(-1)). An empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis revealed that R-rs variability was highly correlated to by (r = 0.90), b(bp), (r = 0.82) and concentration of TSM (r = 0.80), which highlighted the dominant role of water turbidity in this region. Hierarchical clustering analysis was applied to the normalized R-rs spectra to define optical water classes. Class 1 was defined by the highest R-rs values, particularly above 570 nm, indicating more turbid waters; Class 2 was dominated by high Chla and TSM concentrations, which is shown by high R-rs at 570 nm as well as fluorescence and absorption peaks; Class 3 shows strong fluorescence signatures accompanied by low TSM influence; and Class 4 is most representative of clear waters with a less defined absorption peak around 440 nm. By understanding the bio-optical factors which control the variability of the R-rs spectra this study aims to develop a sub-regional characterization of this coastal region aiming to improve bio-optical algorithms in this complex coastal area.

Sky radiance at a coastline and effects of land and ocean reflectivities	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												We present a unique case study of the spectral sky radiance distribution above a coastline. Results are shown from a measurement campaign in Italy involving three diode array spectroradiometers which are compared to 3-D model simulations from the Monte Carlo model MYSTIC. On the coast, the surrounding is split into two regions, a diffusely reflecting land surface and a water surface which features a highly anisotropic reflectance function. The reflectivities and hence the resulting radiances are a nontrivial function of solar zenith and azimuth angle and wavelength. We show that for low solar zenith angles (SZAs) around noon, the higher land albedo causes the sky radiance at 20 degrees above the horizon to increase by 50% in the near infrared at 850 nm for viewing directions towards the land with respect to the ocean. Comparing morning and afternoon radiances highlights the effect of the ocean's sun glint at high SZA, which contributes around 10% to the measured radiance ratios. The model simulations generally agree with the measurements to better than 10%. We investigate the individual effects of model input parameters representing land and ocean albedo and aerosols. Different land and ocean bi-directional reflectance functions (BRDFs) do not generally improve the model agreement. However, consideration of the uncertainties in the diurnal variation of aerosol optical depth can explain the remaining discrepancies between measurements and model. We further investigate the anisotropy effect of the ocean BRDF which is featured in the zenith radiances. Again, the uncertainty of the aerosol loading is dominant and obscures the modelled sun glint effect of 7% at 650 nm. Finally, we show that the effect on the zenith radiance is restricted to a few kilometres from the coastline by model simulations along a perpendicular transect and by comparing the radiances at the coast to those measured at a site 15 km inland. Our findings are relevant to, for example, ground-based remote sensing of aerosol characteristics, since a common technique is based on sky radiance measurements along the solar almucantar.																	1680-7316	1680-7324				DEC 4	2017	17	23					14353	14364		10.5194/acp-17-14353-2017								WOS:000416941000003						
J	Gade, M; Kohlus, J; Kost, C				Gade, Martin; Kohlus, Joern; Kost, Cornelia			SAR Imaging of Archaeological Sites on Intertidal Flats in the German Wadden Sea	GEOSCIENCES												We show that high-resolution space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery with pixel sizes smaller than 1 m(2) can be used to complement archaeological surveys on intertidal flats. After major storm surges in the 14th and 17th centuries ("Grote Mandrenke"), vast areas on the German North Sea coast were lost to the sea. Areas of settlements and historical farmland were buried under sediments for centuries, but when the surface layer is driven away under the action of wind, currents, and waves, they appear again on the Wadden Sea surface. However, frequent flooding and erosion of the intertidal flats make any archaeological monitoring a difficult task, so that remote sensing techniques appear to be an efficient and cost-effective instrument for any archaeological surveillance of that area. Space-borne SAR images clearly show remains of farmhouse foundations and of former systems of ditches, dating back to the times before the "Grote Mandrenke". In particular, the very high-resolution acquisition ("staring spotlight") mode of the TerraSAR/TanDEM-X satellites allows detecting various kinds of remains of historical land use at high precision. Moreover, SARs working at lower microwave frequencies (e.g., that on Radarsat-2) may complement archaeological surveys of historical cultural traces, some of which have been unknown so far.																	2076-3263					DEC	2017	7	4							UNSP 105	10.3390/geosciences7040105								WOS:000419192500014						
J	Olsen, KG; Nettles, M				Olsen, Kira G.; Nettles, Meredith			Patterns in glacial-earthquake activity around Greenland, 2011-13	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Glacial earthquakes are caused by large iceberg calving events, which are an important mechanism for mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet. The number of glacial earthquakes in Greenland has increased sixfold over the past two decades. We use teleseismic surface waves to analyze the 145 glacial earthquakes that occurred in Greenland from 2011 through 2013, and successfully determine source parameters for 139 events at 13 marine-terminating glaciers. Our analysis increases the number of events in the glacial-earthquake catalog by nearly 50% and extends it to 21 years. The period 2011-13 was the most prolific 3-year period of glacial earthquakes on record, with most of the increase over earlier years occurring at glaciers on Greenland's west coast. We investigate changes in earthquake productivity and geometry at several individual glaciers and link patterns in glacial-earthquake production and cessation to the absence or presence of a floating ice tongue. We attribute changes in earthquake force orientations to changes in calving-front geometry, some of which occur on timescales of days to months. Our results illustrate the utility of glacial earthquakes as a remote-sensing tool to identify the type of calving event, the grounded state of a glacier, and the orientation of an active calving front.																	0022-1430	1727-5652				DEC	2017	63	242					1077	1089		10.1017/jog.2017.78								WOS:000418852500012

Ocean biota, in particular phytoplankton plays a fundamental role in regulating the Earth's energy balance. Atmospheric carbon is fixed by these organisms and further phytoplankton acts as primary producers in oceanic food webs. Space based observations using ocean colour sensors have provided unique information about the global distribution and temporal variability of oceanic phytoplankton. India has made significant progress in developing ocean colour science and have launched two ocean colour sensors namely OCM-1 and OCM-2. The data provided by these remote sensing instruments, on phytoplankton distribution around Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal has been extensively used to understand marine ecosystem, as well as for identifying productive regions for potential fishing zones. This paper provides a review of work done in India during the last three decades in the broad field of space based marine biology.																	0369-8203	2250-1762				DEC	2017	87	4					629	640		10.1007/s40010-017-0439-5								WOS:000418819200012

A Multi-Sensor Approach for Assessing Mangrove Biophysical Characteristics in Coastal Odisha, India	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES												Mangroves around the world play a major role in coastal ecosystem processes by mitigating erosion and serving as a barrier against storm surges. India holds approximately 5% of the world's mangroves, over half of which are found along its east coast. Situated in the state of Odisha, Chilika Lagoon and Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary are two wetlands of local importance in need of effective management. This study demonstrated the use of Terra, Landsat, and Sentinel-1 satellite data for spatio-temporal monitoring of mangrove health at these two sites. Several indices, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Enhanced Vegetation Index, were examined to develop biophysical prediction tools and derive a 17-year time-series (from 2000 to 2016) of leaf chlorophyll (CHL), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP). The long-term analysis revealed phenological patterns in the biophysical characteristics such as high values during wet season and low values during the dry season. Correlations between biophysical characteristics and meteorological factors revealed a time lag exists in response to precipitation and associated runoff. In contrast, surface temperature did not show any lag in response time. This study also utilized Sentinel-1 radar data for the first time for Odisha mangroves to show seasonal variability in LAI, GPP, and CHL. The results from radar data were consistent with optical sensors and proved useful for capturing the rainy season, where data were limited due to cloud cover. This study revealed the advantages of using a multi-sensor approach for monitoring mangrove health and defining future monitoring protocols.																	0369-8203	2250-1762				DEC	2017	87	4					679	700		10.1007/s40010-017-0441-y								WOS:000418819200015

Optical Detection of Diatom Bloom in the Coastal Waters of Bay of Bengal Using Oceansat-2 OCM	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES												Phytoplankton blooms are the indicators of marine ecosystem health status and their monitoring is a key component in the effective management of coastal and oceanic resources. It remained as a challenge in the coastal waters due to the presence of suspended sediments and dissolved organic matter which interferes with the phytoplankton signal. Several methods and techniques were developed to detect, map and monitor the phytoplankton blooms in the coastal waters using in situ and satellite data. To address this issue ISRO took an initiative to monitor and identify the phytoplankton blooms in the North Indian Ocean to be specific in the coastal waters. As part of this program, the blooms are monitored using Oceansat-2 Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM-2) data all along the East coast of India. This paper presents a case study in the bloom dominated coastal waters along Off Godavari delta covering Kakinada and Yanam in the East coast of India. In-situ measurements collected onboard during a bloom event are optical parameters like Remote Sensing reflectance, R-rs(lambda), Water leaving radiance L-w(lambda) from the Hyperpro-II under water radiometer, absorption due to phytoplankton, a(ph)(lambda), from the spectrophotometer, biological parameters of phytoplankton cell counts and HPLC pigments. From the in situ biological measurements, it is confirmed that the bloom was dominated by with diatom species of Skeletonema costatum with a high concentration of Fucoxanthin as the biomarker for diatoms from the HPLC pigment analysis. Based on these results obtained, optical detection of the bloom species using spectral discrimination of R-rs for different cell enumerations was considered and further spectral derivative analysis (first to fifth order) has been carried out to identify the peaks to detect the bloom forming species. The criteria considered as the minima in the second order derivative (d lambda R-2(rs)) for identifying the peak to discriminate the spectra of the bloom forming species. From the analysis, a unique peak at 483 nm which is identified in particular to S. costatum species in the coastal waters which are identified from the chlorophyll product derived from OCM-2. From the results observed, it can ensure that diatom blooms can be detected from OCM-2 using 490 nm spectral band.																	0369-8203	2250-1762				DEC	2017	87	4					867	878		10.1007/s40010-017-0455-5								WOS:000418819200029

These features include Ijang/Ili or hill fort defenses as well as trail segments. In delineating the area with potential archaeological features, a close reading of conquistador accounts of Juan de Salcedo in 1572 and Alonso Quirante in 1624 was performed. Also geographic information systems (GIS) least coast path predictive modelling as well as visibility analysis was implemented in order to model the evanescent market (Allegre, 1998) encounter that took place at the coastal settlements.																	2352-409X					DEC	2017	16						127	148		10.1016/j.jasrep.2017.10.005								WOS:000417374600012

Coastal landuse and land cover change and transformations of Kanyakumari coast, India using remote sensing and GIS	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES												The coastal landuse and land cover features in the South West coast of Kanyakumari are dynamically regulated due to marine and terrestrial processes and often controlling by natural and anthropogenic activities. The primary objective of this study is to estimate the decadal changes and their transformations of landuse and land cover (LULC) features under Level II category of USGS-LULC Classification System using Landsat ETM+ and TM images using Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) algorithm for the period 2000-2011. The classified LULC features are categorized as beachface land cover, cultivable lands, plantation and shrub vegetation, fallow land, barren land, settlements and built-ups, water bodies, and mining area, etc. The geo-database is prepared for LULC feature class with an attributes of name, location, area and spatial distribution, etc. It shows the larger area in beachface land cover (sandy beaches, foredunes, uplands, Teri dunes (laterite) and associated nearshore landforms), plantations, cultivable lands, fallows, and barren lands are converted into built-ups and it increases more than twice in the period of 10 years. Using GIS techniques, the analysis of change detection matrix reveals that the total area of 45.90 km(2) in different LULC features periodically shifted or transformed from one state to another one or more states, i.e. the beachface land cover area of 1.24 km(2) is encroached for built-ups and 0.63 km(2) for placer mining during the decade. Meanwhile, the area of 0.21 km(2) in this cover is transformed into wetlands and saltwater bodies. During the past decade, the expansion of area in the built-ups and settlements are directly proportional to the growth of population, which produces severe threat to the coastal resources. Accuracy assessment of classified images shows the overall accuracy is estimated as 81.16% and 77.52% and overall Kappa coeffient statistical values of 0.83 and 0.76 for the year 2000 and 2011 respectively. Ground truth verification of the extracted LULC features performed using 120 samples (10 samples per class) reveals that the accuracy of classified features is 89%. This indicates the acceptable accuracy of the classified LULC features for landuse and land cover change studies. The geodatabase of LULC features is used as primary source for sustainable land resource management in the coastal region. (C) 2017 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

Mapping of coastal landforms and volumetric change analysis in the south west coast of Kanyakumari, South India using remote sensing and GIS techniques	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES												The coastal landforms along the south west coast of Kanyakumari have undergone remarkable change in terms of shape and disposition due to both natural and anthropogenic interference. An attempt is made here to map the coastal landforms along the coast using remote sensing and GIS techniques. Spatial data sources, such as, topographical map published by Survey of India, Landsat ETM+ (30 m) image, IKONOS image (0.82 m), SRTM and ASTER DEM datasets have been comprehensively analyzed for extracting coastal landforms. Change detection methods, such as, (i) topographical change detection, (ii) crossshore profile analysis, (iii) Geomorphic Change Detection (GCD) using DEM of Difference (DoD) were adopted for assessment of volumetric changes of coastal landforms for the period between 2000 and 2011. The GCD analysis uses ASTER and SRTM DEM datasets by resampling them into common scale (pixel size) using pixel-by-pixel based Wavelet Transform and Pan-Sharpening techniques in ERDAS Imagine software. Volumetric changes of coastal landforms were validated with data derived from GPS-based field survey. Coastal landform units were mapped based on process of their evolution such as beach landforms including sandy beach, cusp, berm, scarp, beach terrace, upland, rockyshore, cliffs, wave-cut notches and wave-cut platforms; and the fluvial landforms. Comprising of alluvial plain, flood plains, and other shallow marshes in estuaries. The topographical change analysis reveals that the beach landforms have reduced their elevation ranging from 1 to 3 m probably due to sediment removal or flattening. Analysis of cross-shore profiles for twelve locations indicate varying degrees of loss or gain of coastal landforms. For example, the K3-K30 profile across the Kovalam coast has shown significant erosion (-0.26 to -0.76 m) of the sandy beaches resulting in the formation of beach cusps and beach scarps within a distance of 300 m from the shoreline. The volumetric change of sediment load estimated based on DoD model depict a loss of 241.69 m(3)/km(2) for 62.82 km(2) of the area and land gain of 6.96 m(3)/km(2) for 202.80 km(2) of the area during 2000-2011. However, an area of 26.38 km(2) unchanged by maintaining equilibrium in sediment budgeting along the coastal stretch. The study apart from providing insight into the decadal change of coastal settings also supplements a database on the vulnerability of the coast, which would help the coastal managers in future.

The in-situ data of water nutrient concentration was collected during the period 2002-2010 by COMAPS from the coastal waters of Gujarat and Maharashtra for the development of algorithms as a part of the application of remote sensing for biochemical cycling in the ocean. Multiple regression analysis was used to develop models for the nutrients and suspended sediments and the results showed the strong correlation between the water nutrients under study and suspended sediment variables with the remote sensing data, having the validated R-2 value of 0.7472 (Total Nitrogen),0.8744 (Total Phosphorus) and 0.971 (Suspended Sediment) respectively in marine waters. The models helped understand the seasonal variability and were also applied to one of the latest sensor VIIRS, which came up with the same results as those derived from MODIS. Thus the models can be used for the real time monitoring of water quality and for the development of an alert system using remote sensing data from both MODIS and VIIRS sensor systems.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				DEC	2017	21	6					917	927		10.1007/s11852-017-0561-1								WOS:000416870600017

The dynamic oceanographic pattern in this area influences the distribution of this pelagic fish. Understanding the relationship between the distribution of fish and environmental factors is important in exploring fisheries resources. This study used Rastrelliger kanagurta fishing-catch data during the high-catch season in the second quarter, which was from April to June (2008 and 2009), and satellite data of chlorophyll-a (chl-a), and sea surface temperature (SST) from MODIS-Aqua. The study aimed to identify the relationship between fish distribution with chl-a and SST constructed using the Generalized Additive Model (GAM), detect the potential fishing grounds, and determine the impact of climate change on fish distribution based on temperature projection of IPCC-AR5-RCPs. The distribution of Rastrelliger kanagurta was significantly associated (p < 0.0001) with the preferred range of chl-a at 0.30-0.40 mg/m(3) and SST at 30.00-31.00 degrees C. The potential fishing ground maps showed that areas with high potential catch were located near the coast to offshore (3-20 M), with acceptable level of map accuracy at 83.34%; with kappa value at 0.70. Increased temperature of 1.80 degrees C resulted in movement of potential fishing grounds to the southern part of Makassar Straits leading to the archipelagic waters of Spermonde. In contrast, increased temperature of 2.60 degrees C and 3.30 degrees C resulted in lesser potential fishing grounds area which shifted further to the south. The results of this study indicated applicability of remote sensing in contributing to optimal fishing effort and decision making for long-term management of Rastrelliger kanagurta resources.

Although many TSS retrieval models have been published, the general inversion method that is applicable to different field conditions is still under research. In order to obtain a TSS remote sensing model that is suitable for estimating TSS concentrations with wide range in estuaries and coasts by Landsat imagery, after reviewing a number of Landsatbased TSS retrieval models and improving a comparatively better one among them, this study developed a quadratic model using the ratio of logarithmic transformation of red band and near-infrared band and logarithmic transformation of TSS concentration (QRLTSS) based on 119 in situ samples collected in 2006-2013 from five regions of China. It was found that the QRLTSS model works well and shows a satisfactory performance. The QRLTSS model based on Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper), ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) and OLI (Operational Land Imager) sensors explained about 72 % of the TSS concentration variation (TSS: 4.3-577.2 mg L-1, N = 84, P value < 0.001) and had an acceptable validation accuracy (TSS: 4.5-474 mg L-1, root mean squared error (RMSE) < 25 mg L-1, N = 35). In addition, a threshold method of red-band reflectance (OLI: 0.032, ETM+ and TM: 0.031) was proposed to solve the two-valued issue of the QRLTSS model and to retrieve TSS concentration from Landsat imagery. After a 6S model based atmospheric correction of Landsat OLI and ETM + imagery, the TSS concentrations of three regions (Moyangjiang River estuary, Pearl River estuary and Hanjiang River estuary) in Guangdong Province in China were mapped by the QRLTSS model. The results indicated that TSS concentrations in the three estuaries showed large variation ranging from 0.295 to 370.4 mg L-1. Meanwhile we found that TSS concentrations retrieved from Landsat imagery showed good validation accuracies with the synchronous water samples (TS S : 7-160 mg L-1, RMSE: 11.06 mg L-1, N = 22). The further validation from EO-1 Hyperion imagery also showed good performance (in situ synchronous measurement of TSS: 106-220.7 mgL(-1), RMSE: 26.66 mgL(-1), N = 13) of the QRLTSS model for the area of high TSS concentrations in the Lingding Bay of the Pearl River estuary. Evidently, the QRLTSS model is potentially applied to simulate high-dynamic TSS concentrations of other estuaries and coasts by Landsat imagery, improving the understanding of the spatial and temporal variation of TSS concentrations on regional and global scales. Furthermore, the QRLTSS model can be optimized to establish a regional or unified TS S retrieval model of estuaries and coasts in the world for different satellite sensors with medium- and high-resolution similar to Landsat TM, ETM + and OLI sensors or with similar red bands and near-infrared bands, such as ALI, HJ-1 A and B, LISS, CBERS, ASTER, ALOS, RapidEye, Kanopus-V, and GE.																	1991-959X	1991-9603				NOV 30	2017	10	12					4347	4365		10.5194/gmd-10-4347-2017								WOS:000416560600002

Improving geological mapping of the Farasan Islands using remote sensing and ground-truth data	JOURNAL OF MAPS												We integrated satellite imagery (Landsat-8) with ground-truth data to produce a detailed and complete geological map of the Farasan Islands, off the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia at a scale of 1:100,000. This new map improves upon past efforts by expanding the mapped lithologies on the islands into four categories. We used different techniques to enhance this lithological differentiation, including band combination with ratio stretching and supervised classification techniques based on direct field validation. The former was used to distinguish differences in reflectance values across sets of bands to create a classification image from typical reflectance patterns. The geological feature boundaries were constrained by open-source high-resolution satellite imagery (WorldView-2) as well as field observations. The resulting map clearly distinguishes between different geomorphic and geologic features, including lineaments and lithologies. As the Farasan Islands are relatively remote and not easily accessible, with an area of 739 km(2), these imagery-analysis techniques were an effective tool for using remote sensing data to produce new and better mapping products of this important area.																	1744-5647					NOV 15	2017	13	2					900	908		10.1080/17445647.2017.1401492								WOS:000418848000001

Mapping critical areas for migratory songbirds using a fusion of remote sensing and distributional modeling techniques	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Of the 338 species identified as Nearctic-Neotropical migrants occurring in North America, 98.5% have been recorded in Texas. The seasonal migration of these birds is a well-studied natural phenomenon individuals weighing < 15 g will cross in the Gulf of Mexico approximately 965 km non-stop, completing a total distance of 1900-3200 km over the course of 26-80 h. The physiologically demanding nature of this feat makes the Texas coastline crucial to the success of these species. We used a fusion of multi-spectral remote sensing data and distributional modeling techniques to generate and evaluate predictive maps identifying critical areas for migratory passerines on the Texas coast. Imagery acquired from Landsat 8 OLI, maps provided by United States Geological Survey and the Texas Department of Transportation, and migratory bird occurrence records from the eBird citizen-contributed database were used to build predictive distribution models using three algorithms. Using the AUC to compare model performance, the Random Forest produced the most accurate distribution model, followed by MaxEnt, and Support Vector Machine (0.98, 0.81, and 0.79, respectively). We interpreted, from Boosted Regression Tree analysis, that elevation is the single most influential factor in determining migrant occupancy, with vegetative biomass the least influential predictor. Our approach here allows conservation biologists a more sophisticated approach to identifying critical areas for migratory passerines across large spatial extents in a short amount of time.																	1574-9541	1878-0512				NOV	2017	42						55	60		10.1016/j.ecoinf.2017.09.007								WOS:000418985600007						
J	Liu, YL; Wang, X; Ling, F; Xu, S; Wang, CC				Liu, Yaolin; Wang, Xia; Ling, Feng; Xu, Shuna; Wang, Chengcheng			Analysis of Coastline Extraction from Landsat-8 OLI Imagery	WATER												Coastline extraction is a fundamental work for coastal resource management, coastal environmental protection and coastal sustainable development. Due to the free access and long-term record, Landsat series images have the potential to be used for coastline extraction. However, dynamic features of different types of coastlines (e.g., rocky, sandy, artificial), caused by sea level fluctuation from tidal, storm and reclamation, make it difficult to be accurately extracted with coarse spatial resolution, e.g., 30 m, of Landsat images. To access this problem, we analyze the performance of coastline extraction by integrating downscaling, pansharpening and water index approaches in increasing the accuracy of coastline extraction from the latest Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery. In order to prove the availability of the proposed method, we designed three strategies: (1) Strategy 1 uses the traditional water index method to extract coastline directly from original 30 m Landsat-8 OLI multispectral (MS) image; (2) Strategy 2 extracts coastlines from 15 m fused MS images generated by integrating 15 m panchromatic (PAN) band and 30 m MS image with ten pansharpening algorithms; (3) Strategy 3 first downscales the PAN band to a finer spatial resolution (e.g., 7.5 m) band, and then extracts coastlines from pansharpened MS images generated by integrating downscaled spatial resolution PAN band and 30 m MS image with ten pansharpening algorithms. Using the coastline extracted from ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) 5.8 m MS image as reference, accuracies of coastlines extracted from MS images in three strategies were validated visually and quantitatively. The results show that, compared with coastline extracted directly from 30 m Landsat-8 MS image (strategy 1), strategy 3 achieves the best accuracies with optimal mean net shoreline movement (MNSM) of -2.54 m and optimal mean absolute difference (MAD) of 11.26 m, followed by coastlines extracted in strategy 2 with optimal MNSM of -4.23 m and optimal MAD of 13.54 m. Further comparisons with single-band thresholding (Band 6), AWEI, and ISODATA also confirmed the superiority of strategy 3. For the various used pansharpening algorithms, five multiresolution analysis MRA-based pansharpening algorithms are more efficient than the component substitution CS-based pansharpening algorithms for coastline extraction from Landsat-8 OLI imagery. Among the five MRA-based fusion methods, the coastlines extracted from the fused images generated by Indusion, additive a trous wavelet transform (ATWT) and additive wavelet luminance proportional (AWLP) produced the most accurate and visually realistic representation. Therefore, pansharpening approaches can improve the accuracy of coastline extraction from Landsat-8 OLI imagery, and downscaling the PAN band to finer spatial resolution is able to further improve the coastline extraction accuracy, especially in crenulated coasts.					ling, feng/0000-0002-0685-4897												2073-4441					NOV	2017	9	11							816	10.3390/w9110816								WOS:000416798300002

Accurately monitoring the distribution of S. alterniflora is urgent and essential for developing cost-effective control strategies. In this study, we applied the One-Class Classification (OCC) methods of Maximum entropy (Maxent) and Biased Support Vector Machine (BSVM) based on Landsat time-series imagery to detect the species on the middle coast of Jiangsu in east China. We conducted four experimental setups (i.e., single-scene analysis, time-series analysis, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series analysis and a compressed time-series analysis), using OCC methods to recognize the species. Then, we tested the performance of a compressed time-series model for S. alterniflora detection and evaluated the expansibility of this approach when it was applied to a larger region. Our principal findings are as follows: (1) Maxent and BSVM performed equally well, and Maxent appeared to have a more balanced performance over the summer months; (2) the Maxent model with the Default Parameter Set (Maxent-DPS) showed a slightly higher accuracy and more overfitting than Maxent with the Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small samples sizes (AICc)-selected parameter set model, but a t-test found no significant difference between these two settings; (3) April and December were deemed to be important periods for the detection of S. alterniflora; (4) a compressed time-series analysis modelincluding only three variables (December NDVI, March green and the third Principal Component in January, PC3)yielded higher accuracy than single-scene analyses, which indicated that time-series analysis can better detect S. alterniflora than single-scene analyses; and (5) the Maxent model using the reconstructed optimal variables and 70 training samples over a larger region produced encouraging results with an overall accuracy of 90.88% and a Kappa of 0.78. The one-class classification method combined with a phenology-based detection strategy is therefore promising for the application of the long-term detection of S. alterniflora over extended areas.					liu, huiyu/0000-0003-3976-481X												2072-4292					NOV	2017	9	11							1120	10.3390/rs9111120								WOS:000416554100035						
J	Kennedy, D				Kennedy, David			'Gates': a new archaeological site type in Saudi Arabia	ARABIAN ARCHAEOLOGY AND EPIGRAPHY												The availability of high-resolution satellite imagery of Saudi Arabia on publicly available platforms such as Google Earth and Bing Maps has been transformational for archaeology. Within just a few years tens of thousands of sites previously unrecorded and scarcely known to the academic world have been mapped. Especially rich in sites are the successive lava fields (harret) stretching from southern Syria through Jordan and down the west coast of the Arabian Peninsula to Yemen, and characterised by the stone-built structures known to the Bedouin as the works of the old men'. Sites now being revealed include many types familiar from previous research in the wider region but also others of a form previously unknown. Gates' are one such type, found in large numbers in and around the Harret Khaybar in west-central Saudi Arabia. They are stone-built, the walls roughly made and low as with other works', but quite unlike them in form. Identification, mapping, and preliminary interpretation imply an early date in the sequence of the worksperhaps the very earliestbut no obvious explanation of their purpose can be discerned. Fieldwork is a desideratum.																	0905-7196	1600-0471				NOV	2017	28	2					153	174		10.1111/aae.12100								WOS:000416245100003						
J	O'Connell, JL; Mishra, DR; Cotten, DL; Wang, L; Alber, M				O'Connell, Jessica L.; Mishra, Deepak R.; Cotten, David L.; Wang, Li; Alber, Merryl			The Tidal Marsh Inundation Index (TMII): An inundation filter to flag flooded pixels and improve MODIS tidal marsh vegetation time-series analysis	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Remote sensing in tidal marshes can provide regional assessments of wetland extent, phenology, primary production, and carbon sequestration. However, periodic tidal flooding reduces spectral reflectance, especially in the near and short-wave infrared wavelengths. Consequently, marsh vegetation time-series products that lack tidal filtering, such as those provided by MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), may not reflect true vegetation trends. We created a new Tidal Marsh Inundation Index (TMII) for processing daily 500-m MODIS surface reflectance data and calibrated it with a Spartina alterniflora salt marsh pixel on Sapelo Island, GA. Ground-truth data for TMII was extracted from a PhenoCam, which collected high frequency digital photography of the TMII calibration pixel. To identify the best wavelengths to include in the TMII, we compared goodness of fit metrics from generalized linear models (GLMs). Predictors for these GLMs included suites of normalized difference indices from the literature as well as other band combinations. We also explored including a phonology parameter that could scale TMII relative to vegetation development. Ultimately, TMII was based on the normalized difference of green and shortwave infrared reflectance in combination with a phenology parameter composed of the moving average of the normalized difference of near infrared and shortwave infrared reflectance. This final index allowed a single optimized decision boundary to identify flooding across the annual growth cycle. When compared to ground-truth data from the PhenoCam, the TMII classified flooded conditions with 67-82% and dry conditions with 75-81% accuracy, respectively, across training, testing and validation datasets. We applied TMII to new S. alterniflora marsh MODIS pixels on Sapelo Island, GA as well as on Plum Island, MA. For these new pixels, TMII classified marsh flooding with 77-80% overall accuracy. We also demonstrated how users can apply TMII filtering in a MODIS workflow to create vegetation time-series composites within S. alterniflora, Spardrza patens and Juncus roemerianus marshes. We showed how a new user can validate and optimize TMII in their application, either by comparing it to inundation data or by validating the filtered vegetation time series against field data. We also compared TMII-filtered composites to the existing MODIS MOD13 16-d Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) product. TMII-filtered composites generated less noisy time -series that fit field data better than MOD13. TMII filtering was most important on Sapelo Island, where the tide range was high and vegetation was sparse. Results were less dramatic when TMII was applied to different marsh species within the Gulf Coast sites with lower tidal ranges, but TMII-filtering still improved vegetation time series. Thus, preprocessing MODIS imagery with the TMII effectively identified most inundated pixels. The TMII represents a step forward for wetland remote sensing that will be useful for improved estimation of phonology, biomass and carbon storage in coastal marshes.																	0034-4257	1879-0704				NOV	2017	201						34	46		10.1016/j.rse.2017.08.008								WOS:000412866400004

Envisat's Advanced Along-Track Spectral Radiometer (AATSR) features dual-view thermal infrared measured brightness temperature. Using bands 11 mu m and 12 mu m in nadir and forward (55) view and a total column water vapour (TCWV) product from Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), we obtain four measurements per pixel. We retrieve three surface emissivities epsilon(lambda,theta) per pixel calculated from simulated surface temperatures related to 11 mu m/nadir view values. We define emissivity "classes" for different snow grain sizes from angular and spectral field measurements of snow grain size and emissivity above snow and ice from Hori et al. (2006, 2007): fine, medium, coarse, suncrust, and ice. Remaining pixels are either indistinct between classes, unclassified, or invalid. Temperatures above the freezing point label pixels as wet. Analysing 26 AATSR scenes in 2007 and 2008, we retrieve a high portion of classification in Greenland, Antarctica, and the sea ice of the Hudson Bay. Steep and heterogeneous topography may cause invalid and unclassified pixels in Eurasia. Close to coasts we generally find a higher snow temperature and a large number of wet pixels.																	0034-4257	1879-0704				NOV	2017	201						181	195		10.1016/j.rse.2017.09.006								WOS:000412866400014

Monsoon winds play similar roles in the upper oceanic circulations of the both seas. But the distinct patterns of chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration are observed between the SCS and the AS. The Chl a concentration in the SCS is generally lower than that in the AS in summer (June-August); the summer Chl a concentration in the AS shows stronger interannual variation, compared with that in the SCS; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived data present higher atmospheric aerosol deposition and stronger wind speed in the AS. And it has also been found that good correlations exist between the index of the dust precipitation indicated by aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and the Chl a concentration, or between wind and Chl a concentration. These imply that the wind and the dust precipitation bring more nutrients into the AS from the sky, the sub-layer or coast regions, inducing higher Chl a concentration. The results indicate that the wind velocity and the dust precipitation can play important roles in the Chl a concentration for the AS and the SCS in summer. However aerosol impact is weak on the biological productivity in the west SCS and wind-induced upwelling is the main source.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				NOV	2017	36	11					61	67		10.1007/s13131-017-1138-4								WOS:000414992900008

Movement, distribution and marine reserve use by an endangered migratory giant	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												AimUnderstanding the spatial and temporal variation in the distribution of migratory species is critical for management and conservation efforts. However, challenges in observing mobile marine species throughout their migratory pathways can impede the identification of critical habitat, linkages between these habitats and threat-mitigation strategies. This study aimed to gain insight into the long-term residency and movement patterns of the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) and to reveal important habitat in the context of R.typus usage of existing Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). LocationSouth-eastern Indian Ocean. MethodsSatellite telemetry was used to remotely track the long-term movements of 29 R.typus, and to quantify shark usage of the existing MPA network. From the tracking data and environmental predictors, nonlinear models were developed to predict suitable R.typus habitat throughout the south-eastern Indian Ocean. ResultsThis study includes the first documented complete return migrations by R.typus to Ningaloo Marine Park, which was found to be an important area for R.typus all year-round. We found that while existing MPAs along Australia's west coast do afford some protection to R.typus, telemetry-based habitat models revealed large areas of suitable habitat not currently protected, particularly along the Western Australian coast, in the Timor Sea, and in Indonesian and international waters. Main conclusionsAnimal-borne telemetric devices allowed the gathering of long-term spatial information from the elusive and highly mobile R.typus, revealing the spatial scale of their migration in the south-eastern Indian Ocean. Suitable habitat was predicted to occur inside conservation areas, but our findings indicate that the current MPA network may not sufficiently protect R.typus throughout the year. We suggest that telemetry-based habitat models can be an important tool to inform conservation planning and spatial management efforts for migratory species.																	1366-9516	1472-4642				NOV	2017	23	11					1268	1279		10.1111/ddi.12618								WOS:000413545900005

Pelagic bioregionalisation using open-access data for better planning of marine protected area networks	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Systematic conservation planning (SCP) to design marine protected areas (MPAs) has traditionally focused on species distributions or benthic habitat features that drive the determination of conservation priorities. Pelagic ecosystem protection is usually incidental because these ecosystems are often data poor and are difficult to visualize in a planning context. Pelagic ecosystems, however, face increasing and cumulative impacts from threats such as overfishing and climate change, and a precautionary approach is required to protect both known and unknown biodiversity patterns and ecosystem processes. Data-driven pelagic habitat classifications are important when planning for habitat protection in the absence of sufficient in-situ data. In this study, we describe a method for creating a bioregional map of the upper-mixed layer of South Africa's pelagic realm. We selected relevant variables and parameters that best reflect key ecosystem properties at broad, meso, and local scales. We conducted a hierarchal cluster analysis using open-access sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll-a (chl-a), net primary productivity (NPP), mean sea level anomalies (MSLA), and seabed slope and depth data. The resulting map delineates three bioregions subdivided into seven biozones and sixteen pelagic habitats within South Africa's continental Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). This habitat map was incorporated into SCP of a proposed expanded MPA network that includes offshore protected areas and meets National objectives. The proposed network will increase protection of the pelagic realm (>30 m depth) of the EEZ from 0.002% to 6.0%. We contend that bioregional analyses based on publicly available remote-sensing data are useful for identification of offshore habitats, especially when robust biological data are unavailable, as a framework for ecosystem reporting, and for inclusion in a systematic design for a representative offshore MPA network. Further research should focus on modelling and mapping the permanence of pelagic habitats and different spatio-temporal scales of variability, validating habitat boundaries with biological data, and understanding the threats and efficacy of achieving pelagic protection through management mechanisms like MPAs.

Several light detection and ranging (LiDAR) studies have been carried out in the temperate climate zones of Europe, but only a few in Mediterranean landscapes. Our study is based on the first LiDAR survey carried out for an archaeological purpose in Turkey and one of the first in the Mediterranean that have been planned, measured and filtered especially for archaeological research questions. The interpretation of LiDAR data combined with ground-observations proved extremely useful for the detection and documentation of archaeological remains below Mediterranean evergreen vegetation and dense maquis. This article deals with the methodological aspects of interpreting LiDAR data, using the Kolophon data as a case study. We offer a discussion of the strengths and limitations of LiDAR as an archaeological remote sensing method and suggest a best practice model for interpreting LiDAR data in a Mediterranean context.

Satellite imagery is useful for assessing particle transport from land to sea. However, in the oligotrophic and shallow waters of tropical lagoons, the bottom reflection of downwelling light usually hampers the use of classical optical algorithms. In order to address this issue, a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model was developed and tested. The proposed application concerns the lagoon of New Caledoniathe second longest continuous coral reef in the worldwhich is frequently exposed to river plumes from ultramafic watersheds. The SVR model is based on a large training sample of in-situ turbidity values representative of the annual variability in the Voh-Kone-Pouembout lagoon (Western Coast of New Caledonia) during the 2014-2015 period and on coincident satellite reflectance values from MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). It was trained with reflectance and two other explanatory parametersbathymetry and bottom colour. This approach significantly improved the model's capacity for retrieving the in-situ turbidity range from MODIS images, as compared with algorithms dedicated to deep oligotrophic or turbid waters, which were shown to be inadequate. This SVR model is applicable to the whole shallow lagoon waters from the Western Coast of New Caledonia and it is now ready to be tested over other oligotrophic shallow lagoon waters worldwide.

This computer vision algorithm estimates dense 2-D 2-component velocity fields from the observable motion of foam patterns in the surf zone. Despite challenging image data resolution and quality, comparison of OF surface current estimates with measurements by an acoustic Doppler velocimeter reveals its ability to capture both wave-towave fluctuations and low-frequency variations. The method is also successfully applied to the monitoring of a "flash rip" event. This paper shows clearly the high potential of this method in the nearshore, where the rapid development of webcams and drones offers a large number of applications for swimming and surfing safety, engineering and naval security, and research purpose, by providing quantitative information.																	0196-2892	1558-0644				OCT	2017	55	10					5790	5797		10.1109/TGRS.2017.2714202								WOS:000413653200030						
J	Cao, YF; Xu, LL; Clausi, D				Cao, Yongfeng; Xu, Linlin; Clausi, David			Exploring the Potential of Active Learning for Automatic Identification of Marine Oil Spills Using 10-Year (2004-2013) RADARSAT Data	REMOTE SENSING												This paper intends to find a more cost-effective way for training oil spill classification systems by introducing active learning (AL) and exploring its potential, so that satisfying classifiers could be learned with reduced number of labeled samples. The dataset used has 143 oil spills and 124 look-alikes from 198 RADARSAT images covering the east and west coasts of Canada from 2004 to 2013. Six uncertainty-based active sample selecting (ACS) methods are designed to choose the most informative samples. A method for reducing information redundancy amongst the selected samples and a method with varying sample preference are considered. Four classifiers (k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and decision tree (DT)) are coupled with ACS methods to explore the interaction and possible preference between classifiers and ACS methods. Three kinds of measures are adopted to highlight different aspect of classification performance of these AL-boosted classifiers. Overall, AL proves its strong potential with 4% to 78% reduction on training samples in different settings. The SVM classifier shows to be the best one for using in the AL frame, with perfect performance evolving curves in different kinds of measures. The exploration and exploitation criterion can further improve the performance of the AL-boosted SVM classifier but not of the other classifiers.																	2072-4292					OCT	2017	9	10							1041	10.3390/rs9101041								WOS:000414650600071

However, the methods used to derive these products have to be evaluated, so the associated uncertainties are known. The performance of three atmospheric correction methods, the near infrared (NIR), the shortwave infrared (SWIR), and the Management Unit of the North Seas Mathematical Models with an additional modification (MUMM + SWIR), and derived chla products based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer AQUA (MODIS) images acquired from 2002 to 2014 over the west coast of Canada and the United States were evaluated. The atmospherically corrected products and above-water reflectance were compared with in situ AERONET (N similar to 650) and above-water reflectance (N similar to 34) data, and the Ocean Color 3 MODIS (OC3M)-derived chla were compared with in situ chla measurements (N similar to 82). The statistical analysis indicated that the MUMM + SWIR method was the most appropriate for this region, with relatively good retrievals of the atmospheric products, improved retrieval of remote sensing reflectance with bias lower than 20% for the OC3M bands, and improved retrievals of chla (r = 0.83, slope = 0.89, logRMSE = 0.33 mg m(-3) for +/- 1 h). The poorest chla retrievals were achieved with the SWIR and NIR methods. These results represent the most comprehensive satellite data analysis of MODIS retrievals for this region and provide a framework for the MUMM + SWIR method that can be further tested in other coastal regions of the world.																	2072-4292					OCT	2017	9	10							1063	10.3390/rs9101063								WOS:000414650600093

Therefore, there is a strong need to validate the OLCI products to be sure that the technical capabilities provided will be used in the best possible way in water quality monitoring and research. The Baltic Sea is an optically complex waterbody where many ocean colour products, performing well in other waterbodies, fail. We tested the performance of standard Case-2 Regional/Coast Colour (C2RCC) processing chain in retrieving water reflectance, inherent optical properties (IOPs), and water quality parameters such as chlorophyll a, total suspended matter (TSM) and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the Baltic Sea. The reflectance spectra produced by the C2RCC are realistic in both shape and magnitude. However, the IOPs, and consequently the water quality parameters estimated by the C2RCC, did not have correlation with in situ data. On the other hand, some tested empirical remote sensing algorithms performed well in retrieving chlorophyll a, TSM, CDOM and Secchi depth from the reflectance produced by the C2RCC. This suggests that the atmospheric correction part of the processor performs relatively well while IOP retrieval part of the neural network needs extensive training with actual IOP data before it can produce reasonable estimates for the Baltic Sea.																	2072-4292					OCT	2017	9	10							1070	10.3390/rs9101070								WOS:000414650600100

Since human activities as well as natural disturbances pose major threats to the coral reefs, these livelihoods may also be at risk. Currently, no comprehensive information on the status and condition of coral reefs in this area is available for this resource management. We determined the changes of coral reef habitat over a period of 20 years from 1994 to 2014 using a satellite Landsat multi-temporal image substantiated with in situ measurement data collected in 2014. The spectral value of coral reefs was extracted from multi-temporal Landsat imagery data, while the diffuse attenuation coefficient of water was obtained by using statistical analysis between the ratio of live coral cover and the spectral value of the visible bands. By using the unsupervised classification integrated with the data ground truth, it is stated that there has been a decline in live coral cover over a period of 20 years from 7716 ha in 1994 to 4236 ha in 2014, with a degradation rate of 174 ha/year. Based on the results, the ratio of the coral cover in the coral reef transects varied from the average of 24% for live corals to 96% for coral rubbles, implying the degraded status of coral reefs in the study area.																	0916-8370	1573-868X				OCT	2017	73	5					623	645		10.1007/s10872-017-0422-4								WOS:000412313300008						
J	Ma, P; Dai, XY; Guo, ZY; Wei, C; Ma, WC				Ma, Pin; Dai, Xiaoyan; Guo, Zhongyang; Wei, Chao; Ma, Weichun			Detection of thermal pollution from power plants on China's eastern coast using remote sensing data	STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT												The acceleration of the industrialization process in China has increased the demand for electricity and triggered a power-plant building boom, especially along China's eastern coast, where the economy gets off early and enjoys a fast development. The thermal plumes, residual chlorine, nuclides and other pollutions produced by the thermal and nuclear power plants have exerted an impact on the coastal eco-environment. To monitor the thermal pollution from the power plants at Yueqing Bay on the eastern coast, in this research, the distribution of sea surface temperature (SST) surrounding the power plants is obtained by using the SST retrieval methods developed for Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), HJ-1B infrared sensor (IRS) and Terra moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The comparison of the SST retrieval results before and after the operation of power plants indicates that the total area of sea waters that is impacted by the thermal discharge from the two power plants at Yueqing Bay is approximately 17.95 km(2), with the highest SST rise of 4.5 A degrees C appearing over the waters around the outlet of the Huaneng Yuhuan power plant on the eastern shore, whereas the highest SST rise around the Zheneng Yueqing power plant on the western shore reaches 3.8 A degrees C. The intensity and scope of influence of the thermal discharge mainly depend on the installed capacity of power plants, coastal terrain, and tide. Although the area where the SST rise is more than 3 A degrees C is not large, thermal discharge still has an impact on bay ecosystems due to the relatively closed nature of the bay environment. Due to the influence of rising water temperatures on the reproduction and individual evolution of fish, shrimp, crabs, shellfish and other aquatic creatures, in the long term, the thermal pollution from coastal power plants will affect the volume of natural fishery and biological resources throughout the waters. The quantitative retrieval results also suggest that relative to MODIS data, Landsat ETM+ and HJ-1B IRS data with a high spatial resolution are more applicable to the estimation of small-scale SST, and IRS data with a high temporal resolution are more helpful in the study of spatio-temporal variability of thermal plumes from coastal power plants.																	1436-3240	1436-3259				OCT	2017	31	8					1957	1975		10.1007/s00477-016-1293-8								WOS:000413233000005

A simplified three-dimensional shallow landslide susceptibility framework considering topography and seismicity	LANDSLIDES												Shallow landslides are a prevalent concern in mountainous or hilly regions that can result in severe societal, economic, and environmental impacts. The challenge is further compounded as the size and location of a potential slide is often unknown. This study presents a generalized approach for the evaluation of regional shallow landslide susceptibility using an existing shallow landslide inventory, remote sensing data, and various geotechnical scenarios. The three-dimensional limit equilibrium model derived in this study uses a raster-based approach that uniquely integrates tree root reinforcement, earth pressure boundary forces, and pseudo-static seismic accelerations. Contributions of this methodology include the back-calculation of soil strength from a landslide inventory, sensitivity analyses regarding landslide size-pixel size relationships, and the determination of shallow landslide susceptibility for a landscape or infrastructure considering various root, water, and seismic conditions using lidar bare-earth DEMs as a topographic input. Using a distribution of inventoried landslide points and random points in non-landslide locales, the proposed methodology demonstrated reasonable correlation between regions of high landslide susceptibility and observed shallow landslides within a 150-km(2) region of the Oregon Coast Range when the water-height ratio was 0.5. The method may be improved by considering spatial hydrologic conditions and geology more explicitly.																	1612-510X	1612-5118				OCT	2017	14	5					1677	1697		10.1007/s10346-017-0810-2								WOS:000410840000009

Holocene fluvial valley fill sources of atmospheric mineral dust in the Skeleton Coast, Namibia	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Western Namibia is a significant global source of atmospheric mineral dust. We investigate the relationship between dust and source sediments, assessing the sustainability of dust flux. Remote sensing studies have highlighted specific ephemeral fluvial systems as important contributors to dust flux, including highlighting sections of valleys that are the origins of dust plumes in the period 2005-2008. Little is known however about the specific within-valley dust sediment sources, particularly whether dust is derived from modern ephemeral channel floors or older valley fill sediments, many of which have been reported in the region. As part of a region-wide analysis of aeolian dust flux, we investigate the sediment properties of atmospheric dust samples and valley sediments from the Huab valley, one of the principal regional dust sources. Trapped dust samples contain up to 88% very fine sand and silt when collected samples are disaggregated prior to analysis. Valley fill surface samples comprise 80% very fine sand and silt, and the surface of the modern ephemeral channel 30%. Valley fill sediments were sampled at depths up to 3.6m below the present surface and reveal Holocene depositional ages from 0.6 +/- 0.03ka back to 9.79 +/- 0.73ka. These sediments contain 30% to 6% very fine sand and silt, with levels decreasing with depth and age. Aeolian bedforms in the valley system (nebkhas on the fill surface and climbing dunes on valley margins) indicate that aeolian processes under the influence of strong seasonal easterly winds likely result in dust being winnowed out of the valley fill surfaces, with sandy bedforms being constructed from the coarser component of the fill sediments. The volume of valley fill sediment suggests dust sourced from Holocene sediments is likely to continue into the future regardless of flow conditions in the modern channel system.

Abrupt increases in aerosol volume concentration and shifts of size distributions towards larger sizes, which are associated with increase in wind speed and atmospheric water content, were systematically recorded during the summertime at a distance of at least 80 km from the coast. Chemical imaging of aerosol samples showed an increased contribution of highly hygroscopic particles during the intrusion of the sea breeze. Besides a significant fraction of marine aerosols, the amount of internally mixed marine and mineral dust particles was also increased during the sea breeze period. The number fraction of marine and internally mixed particles during the sea breeze reached up to 88% in the PM1-2.5 and up to 62% in the PM2.5-10 size range. Additionally, numerous particles with residuals of liquid coating were observed by SEM/EDX analysis. Ca-rich dust particles that had reacted with anthropogenic nitrates were evidenced by Raman microspectroscopy. The resulting hygroscopic particles can deliquesce at very low relative humidity. Our observations suggest that aerosol hygroscopic growth in the Negev Desert is induced by the daily sea breeze arrival. The varying aerosol microphysical and optical characteristics perturb the solar and thermal infrared radiations. The changes in aerosol properties induced by the sea breeze, relative to the background situation, doubled the shortwave radiative cooling at the surface (from -10 to -20.5Wm(-2)) and increased by almost 3 times the warming of the atmosphere (from 5 to 14Wm(-2)), as evaluated for a case study. Given the important value of observed liquid coating of particles, we also examined the possible influence of the particle homogeneity assumption on the retrieval of aerosol microphysical characteristics. The tests suggest that sensitivity to the coating appears if backward scattering and polarimetric measurements are available for the inversion algorithm. This may have an important implication for retrievals of aerosol microphysical properties in remote sensing applications.

Mapping capable faulting hazard in a moderate-seismicity, high heat-flow environment: The Tuscia province (southern Tuscany-northern Latium, Italy)	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												This study is focused on potential evidence of capable faulting affecting Southern Tuscany-Northern Latium, a region of high heat flow and moderate to low seismicity. Here we refer to this region as Tuscia, the Latin name for the land of the Etruscans. The review of the evidence for active tectonics in this area has allowed us to identify several potentially active/capable faults, mapped using a combination of analysis of digital terrain models with remote sensing and local geological information derived from bibliographic data and different scale maps. Active and capable faulting is certainly more evident in the eastern sector of Tuscia (Chianti-Cetona Ridge, Pienza, Amiata and Bolsena caldera). However, even in the western Tuscia (e.g. Colline Metallifere and Tyrrhenian coast), capable faulting may be hypothesized along numerous structural elements. The characterization of active faulting potential, in terms of geometry, slip types and rates, in such a high heat-flow environment, beyond its usefulness in improving the assessment of fault displacement and earthquake hazard, also helps to improve knowledge of the stress field and structural setting of the many geothermal fields in the area. This allows new useful insights into geothermal exploitation and hazard (e.g., induced-triggered seismicity). Moreover, this new knowledge of active tectonics and capable faults of the hinterland sector of the Northern Apennines may also provide useful insights into the siting processes of highly hazardous and strategic structures and, more generally, in land use planning and management of infrastructures, especially during emergencies.

A comparison of spectral macroalgae taxa separability methods using an extensive spectral library	ALGAL RESEARCH-BIOMASS BIOFUELS AND BIOPRODUCTS												Remote sensing is one the most promising approaches to coastal area cartography, including mapping algae forests. After discrimination of algal communities from other benthic habitats, next step is species discrimination (from other algae). Spectral signature provides the most complete remote description to characterize any algae. In this work spectral signatures are studied from the point of view of taxa separability to assess the potential use of remote sensors to map seaweed in coastal waters. Three approaches were tested: Red-Green-Brown colorimetry (sRGB), optimal spectral boundary separation based on True Skill Statistics (TSS-OB), and pigment absorbance band detection by Derivative Spectroscopy (DS). An extensive spectral library of 36 algal species present in the Atlantic Galician coast (NW of Spain) is used to test and validate these methods. The results show that the three broad taxa of red, green and brown algae can be separated by all three methods (Cohen's kappa of 0.697, 0.891 and 0.910, respectively). The TSS-OB and the DS approaches provide almost perfect classification (despite some anomalous specimens), with DS being slightly better. The sRGB approach, useful for in situ photographic classification, also provides good results.																	2211-9264					SEP	2017	26						463	473		10.1016/j.algal.2017.04.021								WOS:000411731800052

This paper is part of an interdisciplinary collaboration between atmospheric scientists and wind engineers with the objective of conducting a comprehensive analysis of the field measurements and weather scenarios related to nonsynoptic wind systems in this area. The downburst that struck the Livorno coast of Italy at about 1310 local time 1 October 2012 is investigated as a relevant test case for such severe wind events. The wind velocity records detected by ultrasonic anemometers, part of a monitoring network created for the European "Wind and Ports'' and "Wind, Ports and Sea'' projects, are analyzed and decomposed in order to inspect the main statistical features of this transient event. The analysis of the meteorological precursors to this event is carried out making use of model analyses, standard in situ measurements, remote sensing techniques, proxy data, and direct observations. The results obtained bring new insights into a downburst's onset and detection in the Mediterranean, its evolution at the local scale, and possible connections to specific synoptic-scale weather conditions like secondary cyclogenesis in the lee of the Alps.																	0027-0644	1520-0493				SEP	2017	145	9					3507	3527		10.1175/MWR-D-17-0018.1								WOS:000409406600006

Radars of various types have been used in ornithological research for about 70 years. However, the potential of radar wind profiler (RWP) as a tool for biological purposes remains poorly understood. The aim of this study is to assess the suitability of RWP for ornithological research questions. 2. A 1290 MHz RWP at the south-eastern coast of the Bay of Biscay has been known to exhibit seasonally occurring nocturnal signals attributed to migrating birds. As a first step to verify the origin of these seasonal patterns, historical radar data from 2010 to 2012 were analysed, and both bird patterns and temporal occurrence were identified in RWP data at different levels of the signal processing. A thermal-imaging (TI) camera in conjunction with moon watching was used as verification systems at the radar site to confirm the ornithological origin of the radar echoes. The simultaneous data on spring migration served as a basis for the identification of biological signatures (qualitative parameters) on time-series level (raw data) and to derive quantitative migration parameters (flight altitude, migration traffic rates) thereof. Finally, the quantitative measurements of the TI camera and the radar were compared considering meteorological conditions. 3. The approach allowed identifying reproducible criteria based on time series to calculate migration traffic rates and altitudinal flight distribution. General flight directions were only available in the final wind data. In clear weather conditions, the calibration methods coincided well with the wind profiler data. 4. Findings show that wind profiler raw data offer reliable information on migration intensity, flight altitudes and flight directions in a variety of meteorological conditions. The method presented can be applied as a complement to present efforts to use weather radars for large-scale bird monitoring. Furthermore, it is also interesting for the meteorological community to refine signal-processing methods.

Remote Sensing techniques are the most promising ones to deliver a satisfactory result in this regard. In our study, the objective was to retrieve performance level of certain image processing techniques vigorously used for the purpose to delineate coastline automatically and they were tested against two images acquired almost on the same period by LISS III and LANDSAT ETM+ sensors. The algorithms used in the study are Water Index, NDVI, Complex Band Ratio, ISODATA, Thresholding, ISH Transfirmation techniques. Accuracy of the shoreline detection by classifying the image in land and water has been tried to be estimated in three ways, firstly with comparison to the visually interpreted high resolution google earth image, secondly field collected GCP data of reference points of classes and thirdly the raw image itself. But problem in temporal disparity caused the constraint doing accuracy assessment from the first two reference data and maps along the coast. As a whole although four techniques among six, show satisfactory results namely density slicing, ISODATA classification, Water Index and ISH transformation technique, in the case of LISS-III and ETM+, Water Index (with kappa value being 0.95 for LISS-III and 0.97 for ETM+) and Intensity-Hue-Saturation transformation techniques give better performance. Sensor to sensor variation might have introduced certain differences in shoreline detection in images of same season with similar tidal influence.																	1865-0473	1865-0481				SEP	2017	10	3					321	330		10.1007/s12145-017-0289-3								WOS:000407240900003

Digital shoreline analysis system-based change detection along the highly eroding Krishna-Godavari delta front	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Coastal regions are highly vulnerable to rising sea levels due to global warming. Previous Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2013) predictions of 26 to 82 cm global sea level rise are now considered conservative. Subsequent investigations predict much higher levels which would displace 10% of the world's population living less than 10 m above sea level. Remote sensing and GIS technologies form the mainstay of models on coastal retreat and inundation to future sea-level rise. This study estimates the varying trends along the Krishna-Godavari (K-G) delta region. The rate of shoreline shift along the 330-km long K-G delta coast was estimated using satellite images between 1977 and 2008. With reference to a selected baseline from along an inland position, end point rate and net shoreline movement were calculated using a GIS-based digital shoreline analysis system. The results indicated a net loss of about 42.1 km(2) area during this 31-year period, which is in agreement with previous literature. Considering the nature of landforms and EPR, the future hazard line (or coastline) is predicted for the area; the predication indicates a net erosion of about 57.6 km(2) along the K-G delta coast by 2050 AD.

In this study, ten areas located along the western coast of the Korean Peninsula are investigated with respect to remotely sensed water quality indicators derived from NASA MODIS aboard of the satellite Aqua. We found that there was a strong seasonal trend with spatial heterogeneity. In specific, a strong six-month phase-lag was found between chlorophyll-a and total suspended solid owing to their inversed seasonality, which could be explained by different dynamics and environmental settings. Chlorophyll-a concentration seemed to be dominantly influenced by temperature, while total suspended solid was largely governed by local tidal forcing and bottom topography.

Instead of a triple crop scheme like other areas in the Delta, a prawn and rice rotational cultivation scheme was initiated to facilitate agricultural production in Kien Giang. In this paper, the ecosystem services (ES) generated from the agriculture ecosystem under the prawn and rice rotational crops (PRRC) were assessed using an integrated approach. The specific ES identified here include water and nutrition regulation in the soil together with climate regulation in favor of the cultivated crops. A multi-disciplinary approach including remote sensing, GIS, social surveys and statistical analysis was adopted to comprehensively evaluate the geographical, biophysical, economic and social aspects of the ES. Firstly, Landsat 8 images were processed with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NVDI) and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) to identify the areas cultivating PRRC. The accuracy of image classification was assessed by ground truthing and we found an 80% coincidence between the simulated results and the field observations. Then, the social survey was conducted using face to face interviews at 50 local households to collect data related to farming practices. Economic values of ecosystem services were obtained using the revised market methods by annual crop yields per unit area. The mean estimated value of ES provided through the PRRC was 1300 USD/ha/year (standard deviation of 600 USD/ha/year) which accounted for 38.1% and 59.4% of the averaged economic revenue and net benefit, respectively. The analysis of social survey data revealed the factors having the greatest effects on ecosystem services values were selling prices of prawn and farming experiences. Finally, results were synthesized with GIS to describe how ES values vary across the research area which facilitates effective communication of the importance of ES concepts to policy makers regarding land use planning and natural resources management decisions.

The results show: (1) Qinzhou Bay coastal morphology change degree was strong in 2006 -2012 and the coastline changed greatly. Originally part of the natural shore segments which had twists and turns were gradually filled into artificial coast, the coast constantly advanced to the sea, coastline became regular and straight; (2) The change degree of coastline was relatively small in 2006-2008, the average artificial coastline increased 8.86 km/a, the average artificial reclamation area was 20.79 km(2) /a; in 2008-2012, the change range of coastline was the greatest, coastline changed most severely, the average artificial coastline increased 16.07 km/a, the average artificial reclamation area was 58.52 km(2) /a; however, in 2012-2014, coastline change degree relatively slowed, the average artificial coastline increased 4.04 km per year, the average artificial reclamation area was 3.464 km(2) /a. (3) Compared to the studies of predecessors, the innovation of this paper is that it is the first to carry out the detailed research on coastline evolution caused by reclamation engineerings of the Qinzhou Bay, then formed the change results on coastline that caused by intense human activities in the Qinzhou Bay, provided the area of the marine environment protection with full and accurate data.																	1233-2585					AUG	2017	24				2		188	194		10.1515/pomr-2017-0082								WOS:000411490000025

Detecting shoreline changes in Chabahar Bay by processing satellite images	SCIENTIA IRANICA												Monitoring coastal areas is an important parameter in the sustainable development and protection of the environment. The expansion of constructions in Iran's southern coasts has not only led to the destruction of geomorphological landforms, but has also changed the process of erosion and sedimentation in coastal areas. Nowadays, remote sensing data are considered as the most efficient source of information for the study and interpretation of coastal landforms, tidal levels, changes in coastline, depth of water, and so forth. The purpose of this study is to investigate the changes in the coastline of Chabahar Gulf, located on the coasts of the Oman Sea by using remote sensing techniques. This study examined and interpreted qualitative and quantitative changes of the coastlines in a forty-two-year period. Different supervised classification methods were used from which the most accurate one was ultimately chosen. The classified images were divided into two classes of land and water, and the changes of these two classes between 1972 and 2014 were extracted. The net change results indicate that in the forty-two-year period, 1,832,436 m(2) of the land has been added to water class, and 7,004,844 m(2) of water has been added to land.

Hydrodynamic control of microphytoplankton bloom in a coastal sea	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												The influence of hydrodynamics on phytoplankton bloom occurrence/formation has not been adequately reported. Here, we document diurnal observations in the tropical Bay of Bengal's mid-western shelf region which reveal microphytoplankton cell density maxima in association with neap tide many times more than what could be accounted for by solar insolation and nutrient levels. When in summer, phytoplankton cells were abundant and the cell density of Guinardia delicatula reached critical value by tide caused zonation, aggregation happened to an intense bloom. Mucilaginous exudates from the alga due to heat and silicate stress likely promoted and stable water column and weak winds left undisturbed, the transient bloom.

Recurring Emergence of the Mud Islands on Shelf of the Arabian Sea along the Makran Coast of Pakistan - Historical Perspective using Remote Sensing Techniques	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA												Recurring emergences of mud islands on shelf of the Arabian Sea, along the Makran coast of Pakistan are now known to be submarine mud volcanoes. They are expressions of enhanced extrusions of fluidized mud and gases coupled with compressional tectonics in convergent margin settings. Since 1945 the Malan island has emerged four times, and some other mud islands have also been emerging repeatedly, at their own positions. The first known emergence, during November 1945, was concurrent with an earthquake of magnitude 8.0 (M8.0), the 2nd and 3rd emergences, in March 1999 and November 2010 respectively, were not related apparently with earthquakes. The 4th emergence concurred with the Awaran earthquake (M7.7) of 24th September 2013. Landsat images of March 1999 and November 2010 emergences indicate appearance of round-shaped island of 4.4 and 5.2 hectare area, followed by erosion and disappearance. The island was composed of mud breccias and circular vents spewing mud slurry and methane gas. The emergence of Malan island, in March 1999 and November 2010 was compared with earthquake data before and after the emergences. The earthquakes data, two years before March 1999 and November 2010 emergences and two years afterwards, shows correlation with both small and large earthquakes, prior to the emergence, in the radius of over 400 km. It is proposed that mud islands develop in response to the episodes of enhanced mud extrusion, which inturn are related with the enhanced compressional and/or seismic events. These events are followed by periods of relative quiescence characterized by normal activity of mud extrusion and marine erosion.																	0016-7622	0974-6889				AUG	2017	90	2					201	208		10.1007/s12594-017-0700-1								WOS:000408991300011

Dead Sea, Jordan	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												This article presents and analyses the results obtained from Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) techniques applied to ERS-1/2, ENVISAT, ALOS-PALSAR, COSMO-SkyMed, and Sentinel-1A datasets over the Lisan Peninsula, located in the southern part of the Dead Sea, Jordan. The novelty comes from the integration of three different wavelengths to study the dynamics of a salt dome. The monitoring activity entirely covers the period extending from 1992 to 2016. Five displacement maps have been produced, carefully checked and then fused to provide a total cumulated map of the displacements in the area. The ground movements have been analysed by comparison with in-situ tectonic observations collected by various authors since the mid-1980s. The study shows an episodic rising of the Lisan diapir. The presented results can be useful to update the knowledge of the displacement rates occurring in the area and to better comprehend the complex dynamics of the Lisan Peninsula.

J	Alves, FC; Rossetti, DD				Alves, Fabio Correa; Rossetti, Dilce de Fatima			Late Holocene coastal dynamics and relative sea-level changes in the littoral of Paraiba, northeastern Brazil	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												A preliminary analysis of a segment of the Paraiba littoral in northeastern Brazil revealed a prograding shoreline in a coast currently characterized by estuarine transgressive depositional systems. Detailed study of coastal geomorphology is of relevance to reconstruct the sea-level history in this shoreline. Such investigation can help improve the record of past sea-level curves of northeastern Brazil, an issue still open to debates. In this work, we explored remote sensing imagery for the geomorphological characterization of this prograding shoreline and combined this information with geological field data aiming to establish the various phases of shoreline progradation. In addition, we also analyzed the potential forcing factors responsible for the morphological changes in the eastern section of the littoral of Paraiba during the late Holocene, comparing changes with other prograding shorelines along the east coast of Brazil. Geomorphological interpretation was based on the analysis of Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) images acquired aboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite 1 (ALOS-1). Geological data comprised dating of sand samples by the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) technique for the establishment of the chronological context. The coastal deposits are represented by a cuspate morphology and numerous internal beach ridges that prograded seaward from a roughly north-south trending palaeocliff. The chronological data indicate shoreline progradation during the past 2.1 +/- 0.1 ka, after the mid-Holocene sea-level fall. Several prograding episodes occurred during this time, some not matching with proposed sea-level rises punctuated upon the overall fall. Together with the regional geological context of the study area, we propose that eustatic sea-level was not the only factor triggering coastal progradation in this region.																	0309-1333	1477-0296				AUG	2017	41	4					375	392		10.1177/0309133317709744								WOS:000408111600001						
J	Singha, S; Ressel, R				Singha, Suman; Ressel, Rudolf			Arctic Sea Ice Characterization Using RISAT-1 Compact-Pol SAR Imagery and Feature Evaluation: A Case Study Over Northeast Greenland	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) polarimetry has become a valuable tool in space-borne SAR-based sea ice analysis. The two major objectives in SAR-based remote sensing of sea ice are, on the one hand, to have a large coverage and, on the other hand, to obtain a radar response that carries as much information as possible in order to characterize sea ice. Single-polarimetric acquisitions of existing sensors offer a wide coverage on the ground, whereas dual polarimetric or even better fully polarimetric data offer a higher information content, which allows for a more reliable automated sea ice analysis at a cost of smaller swath. In order to reconcile the advantages of fully polarimetric acquisitions with the higher ground coverage of acquisitions with fewer polarimetric channels, hybrid/compact polarimetric acquisitions offer an excellent tradeoff between the mentioned objectives. With the advent of the RISAT-1 satellite platform, we are able to explore the potential of compact dual pol acquisitions for sea ice analysis and classification. Our algorithmic approach for an automated sea ice classification consist of two steps. In the first step, we perform a feature extraction followed by a feature evaluation procedure. The resulting feature vectors are then ingested into a trained artificial neural network classifier to arrive at a pixel-wise supervised classification. We present a comprehensive polarimetric feature analysis and classification results on a dataset acquired off the eastern Greenland coast, along with comparisons of results obtained from near-coincident (spatially and temporally) C-band fully polarimetric imagery acquired by RADARSAT-2.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				AUG	2017	10	8					3504	3514		10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2691258								WOS:000407706200007						
J	Duru, U				Duru, Umit			Shoreline change assessment using multi-temporal satellite images: a case study of Lake Sapanca, NW Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The research summarized here determines historical shoreline changes along Lake Sapanca by using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Six multi-temporal satellite images of Landsat Multispectral Scanner (L1-5 MMS), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (L7 ETM+), and Operational Land Imager Sensors (L8 OLI), covering the period between 17 June 1975 and 15 July 2016, were used to monitor shoreline positions and estimate change rates along the coastal zone. After pre-possessing routines, the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), and supervised classification techniques were utilized to extract six different shorelines. Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), a toolbox that enables transect-based computations of shoreline displacement, was used to compute historical shoreline change rates. The average rate of shoreline change for the entire cost was 2.7 m/year of progradation with an uncertainty of 0.2 m/year. While the great part of the lake shoreline remained stable, the study concluded that the easterly and westerly coasts and deltaic coasts are more vulnerable to shoreline displacements over the last four decades. The study also reveals that anthropogenic activities, more specifically over extraction of freshwater from the lake, cyclic variation in rainfall, and deposition of sediment transported by the surrounding creeks dominantly control spatiotemporal shoreline changes in the region. Monitoring shoreline changes using multi-temporal satellite images is a significant component for the coastal decision-making and management.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				AUG	2017	189	8								10.1007/s10661-017-6112-2								WOS:000405440300028	28688069

Advantages and limitations of glacier mapping, applied so far, in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia are discussed in detail. Glacier parameters such as the equilibrium line altitude, snowline and mass balance were given special attention in understanding the complex cryosphere-climate interactions, particularly using remote sensing techniques. Glaciers in the inner and the outer tropics were considered separately based on the precipitation and temperature conditions within a new framework. The applicability of various methods to use glacier records to understand and reconstruct the tropical Andean climate between the Last Glacial Maximum (11,700 years ago) and the present is also explored in this paper. Results from various studies published recently were analyzed and we tried to understand the differences in the magnitudes of glacier responses towards the climatic perturbations in the inner tropics and the outer tropics. Inner tropical glaciers, particularly those in Venezuela and Colombia near the January Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), are more vulnerable to increase in temperature. Surface energy balance experiments show that outer tropical glaciers respond to precipitation variability very rapidly in comparison with the temperature variability, particularly when moving towards the subtropics. We also analyzed the gradients in glacier response to climate change from the Pacific coast towards the Amazon Basin as well as with the elevation. Based on the current trends synthesised from recent studies, it is hypothesized that the glaciers in the inner tropics and the southern wet outer tropics will disappear first as a response to global warming whereas glaciers in the northern wet outer tropics and dry outer tropics show resistance to warming trends due to the occurrence of cold phases of El Nido-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) together. Mountain glaciers in Ecuador show less retreat in response to the warming trend, probably due to high altitudes (above 5750 m), in comparison to glaciers in Colombia and Venezuela. However, elevation-dependent warming (EDW) is a major concern in the tropical Andes. In a nutshell, smaller glaciers at lower altitudes in the inner tropics and the southern wet outer tropics near the Amazon Basin are disappearing faster than other glaciers in the tropical Andes.

J	Defriez, EJ; Reuman, DC				Defriez, Emma J.; Reuman, Daniel C.			A global geography of synchrony for terrestrial vegetation	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim: Previous work demonstrated a pronounced geography of synchrony for marine phytoplankton and used that geography to infer statistical environmental determinants of synchrony. Here, we determine whether terrestrial vegetation (measured by the enhanced vegetation index, EVI) also shows a geography of synchrony and we infer determinants of EVI synchrony. As vegetation is the basis of the terrestrial food web, changes in spatio-temporal vegetation dynamics may have major consequences. Location: The land. Time period: 2001-2014. Major taxa: Plants. Methods: Synchrony in terrestrial vegetation is mapped globally. Spatial statistics and model selection are used to identify main statistical determinants of synchrony and of geographical patterns in synchrony. Results: The first main result is that there is a pronounced and previously unrecognized geography of synchrony for terrestrial vegetation. Some areas, such as the Sahara and Southern Africa, exhibited nearly perfect synchrony, whereas other areas, such as the Pacific coast of South America, showed very little synchrony. Spatial modelling provided the second main result, namely that synchrony in temperature and precipitation were major determinants of synchrony in EVI, supporting the presence of dual global Moran effects. These effects depended on the time-scales on which synchrony was assessed, providing our third main result, namely that synchrony of EVI and its geography are time-scale specific. Main conclusions: To our knowledge, this study is the first to document the geography of synchrony in terrestrial vegetation. We showed that geographical variation in synchrony is pronounced. We used geographical patterns to identify determinants of synchrony. This study is one of very few studies to demonstrate two separate synchronous environmental variables driving synchrony simultaneously. The geography of synchrony is apparently a major phenomenon that has been little explored.																	1466-822X	1466-8238				AUG	2017	26	8					878	888		10.1111/geb.12595								WOS:000405190600003

Hyperspectral remote sensing imagery combined with field validation were used to map and characterise the 300-km coast including shore type, land cover and vehicle track footprint. Adjacent to Ningaloo Marine Park, only sparse coastal vegetation cover was present. However, there exists an extensive (1256 km) vehicle track network with the highest densities near accommodation nodes and sandy beaches (over 65% of tracks). Areas managed for conservation had fewer tracks and the lowest track density (0.3 km/km(2)) compared to pastoral stations (similar to 1.9 km/km(2)). The cumulative lengths of tracks were highest on pastoral stations used for livestock grazing, coastal access and camping (945 km out of the total of 1256 km of tracks). The fragility of the arid landscape and this assessment of off-road vehicle impact obtained through detailed mapping of tracks indicate the need for management measures to mitigate the damage and cope with the increasing numbers of visitors.

Discriminating the biophysical impacts of coastal upwelling and mud banks along the southwest coast of India	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Coastal upwelling and mud banks are two oceanographic processes concurrently operating along certain stretches of the southwest (Kerala) coast of India during the Southwest Monsoon period (June-September), facilitating significant enhancement in plankton biomass. Mud banks have scientific and societal attention from time immemorial, predominantly due to the large fisheries associated with them. In this paper, for the first time, the specific biophysical roles of these oceanographic processes have been discriminated, based on a focused 18 weeldy/fortnightly time-series study (April to September 2014) in a mud bank-upwelling area (off Alappuzha, southwest coast of India). In conjunction with standard hydrographical and satellite remote sensing data, we utilised a FlowCAM to track the biophysical linkage in terms of plankton composition abundance and size structure at three locations (Ml, M2 and M3) in the study area. During the Pre-Southwest Monsoon (April-May), the entire study area was warmer with low nitrate concentration in the surface waters, which caused lower biomass of autotrophs compared to the Southwest Monsoon (June-September). By the onset of the Southwest Monsoon (June), drastic hydrographical transformations took place in the study domain due to the Coastal upwelling, reflected as the surfacing of significantly cool, high nutrient and hypoxic waters. Concurrently, mud bank formed at location M2 due to the presence of relatively high-suspended sediments in the region, creating a localised calm environment conducive for fishing activities. In response to the hydrographical transformations in the entire study area during the Southwest Monsoon, the autotrophic plankton biomass and size structure experienced significant change. The micro-autotrophs biomass that was low during the Pre-Southwest Monsoon (av. 0.33 +/- 02 mgCL(-1) at surface and av. 0.07 +/- 0.04 mgC L-1 at subsurface) noticeably increased during the Southwest Monsoon (av. 1.6 +/- 0.4 mgC L-1 at surface and av. 13 +/- 02 mgC L-1 at subsurface). The seasonal mean bio-volume of micro-autotrophs followed the same pattern in all three locations with the dominance of smaller individuals during the Pre-Southwest Monsoon (av. 55 +/- 4.4 x 10(3) mu m(3) individual(-1) at surface and av. 67.1 +/- 38.4 x 10(3) mu m(3) individual(-1) at subsurface). Relatively large phytoplankton dominated during the Southwest Monsoon (av. 77.3 +/- 5.5 x 10(3) mu m(3) individual(-1) at surface and av. 903 +/- 4.9 x 10(3) mu m(3) individual(-1) at subsurface). Similar spatial change in the plankton composition, biomass and size structure in all three locations suggested the dominant role of coastal upwelling, and not the mud bank, in shaping the dominant autotrophic plankton in the study domain. The nutrient enrichment in the region associated with the coastal upwelling facilitated the predominance of a classical short food chain capable of supporting large fish stocks. In addition to relatively calm mud bank, the hypoxic, cool upwelled waters that existed in the subsurface induce the fish stock to concentrate in the surface waters, making the relatively calm mud bank and adjoining areas a rich fishing ground for the native fishers.

In particular, we examine data from a filter spectrometer, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi National Polar Partnership (NPP) orbiter, and an airborne grating spectrometer, the Jet Population Laboratory's (JPL) hyperspectral Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer (PRISM) sensor. We solve the destriping problem using a variational regularization method by giving weights spatially to preserve the other features of the image during the destriping process. The target functional penalizes "the neighborhood of stripes" (strictly, directionally uniform features) while promoting data fidelity, and the functional is minimized by solving the Euler-Lagrange equations with an explicit finite-difference scheme. We show the accuracy of our method from a benchmark data set which represents the sea surface temperature off the coast of Oregon, USA.

The results showed that coastal features such as tidal flats and tidal inlets in the bays changed significantly over time. The studied bays are in a ring shaped geomorphic spatial pattern characterized by shallow water, and they were concentrically ringed by tidal flats and coastal plains before the early 1980s. Later, however, a number of ponds appeared between the coastal plains and tidal flats. The extent of sediment infill for each bay in the 1980s was greater than that in the 1970s. The conversion of flat -inlets and the erosion/deposition change of tidal inlets in these four bays during study period were not synchronized. Each bay was in a state of flood asymmetry, and both the net fine and net coarse sediment deposition took place in the 1970s. From the late 1960s to the early 1980s, Dingzi Bay was characterized by flood asymmetry, and its tidal asymmetry ratio increased. The Jinghai and the Wuleidao bays were in a state of flood asymmetry, and their tidal asymmetry ratios decreased, while Rushan Bay was in a transition state from flood to ebb asymmetry. However, intensive human activities over the last 30 years, especially the construction of coastal ponds, has greatly changed the hydrology and sedimentation of these bays, causing profound changes in geomorphic features; furthermore, these changes have guided the evolutionary process of the bays. Our results suggest that the intensive human activities were key factors that caused changes in the geomorphic evolution of the studied tidal embayments, especially the sudden change from a state of rising flood asymmetry to ebb asymmetry in Dingzi Bay.

Both branches eventually contribute to the greater Agulhas Current system and thus play a part in the global ocean circulation. In addition, these currents have important effects on the local conditions for marine life. In this study, the NEMC and the SEMC are investigated based on a comprehensive, multidisciplinary survey of the east coast of Madagascar in 2008. Results from conductivity-temperature-depth stations, underway measurements with thermosalinograph and fluorometer, and ship-mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler are discussed along with concomitant remotely sensed data. Maximum core velocities of > 150 cm s(-1) were observed in both the NEMC and the SEMC. The SEMC appeared as a nearshore southward jet, which extended at its widest nearly 200 km offshore. Near the southern tip of Madagascar, the SEMC was flanked by reverse velocities: a northeastward current about 30 km wide along the coast and a northeastward offshore current greater than 140 km wide suggesting the presence of the South Indian Ocean Countercurrent. The NEMC had the structure of a narrow nearshore jet, with weak currents beyond 100 km offshore. Volume transport for the upper 1,100 m was estimated to be 22 Sverdrup (Sv) for the SEMC and 48 Sv for the NEMC. The high NEMC transport compared with earlier estimates might be because of anomalously high influx of the SEC during the measurement period. Off the south coast, an undercurrent below 900 m carried an equatorward transport of 3.1 Sv. No undercurrent was observed in the north, but a geostrophic velocity minimum and a similar vertical velocity shear between surface and subsurface currents were found at the level where such a countercurrent has been previously observed from direct measurements.

Some show to align with Ophiuchus, too. Both constellations are related with the mythological circle of the deities as a dual entity. This astronomical phenomenon is supported by myth, archaeological finds, historical texts, artistic representations and astronomical academic tradition. The seventeen temples-altars chosen for survey cover a major chronological and geographical area. Ten temples are of Apollo and seven are of Asclepius: the Pythios Apollon in Gortyna and associated Lebena Asclepius temple (Crete), the Apollo Maleatas and associated Altar within the Asclepeiion of Epidaurus, and the Asclepius temple of Epidaurus (Peloponnese, mainland Greece), Apollo Deiradiotes and an Asclepius temple close to the town of Argos (Peloponnese, mainland Greece), the temple and oracle of Apollo Clarios and Apollo Temple at Notion (Ionian coast, Asia Minor, Turkey), the Temple of Apollon Lairbenos (Phrygia, Asia Minor, Turkey), the Asclepius Temple, Apollo Kyparissios and an Antonine Apollo temple at the island of Kos, and Asclepius Temple with Apollo Oikos at Messene (southern Peloponnese). Most of the Asclepius Temples (healing centers) are associated with temples (some oracular), altars or worship houses of Apollo. In our analytical work, Apollo and Asclepius function as complementary dualities who corroborate on religious prophecy and healing. On cult sites associated with ceremonial healing and curative practice, the alignment of the temples show the use of star markers in architectural planning: astronomical signs associated with myths of the actual gods, prevail. Through present study, we have shown that intangible and tangible cultural heritage are connected. The astronomical orientation of the temples is studied for their azimuth, angular altitude of the horizon and celestial declination, through applied remote sensing techniques, making use of Google Earth maps and associated astronomical tools.

Satellite remotely sensed LST has the advantages of global coverage and consistent periodicity, which overcomes the weakness of ground observations related to sparse distributions and costs. For human related studies and urban climatology, canopy layer urban heat island (CUHI) based on air temperatures is extremely important. This study has employed remote sensing methodology to produce monthly CUHI climatology maps during the period 2000-2013, revealing the spatiotemporal characteristics of daytime and nighttime CUHI during this period of rapid urbanization in Shanghai. Using stepwise linear regression, daytime and nighttime air temperatures at the four overpass times of Terra/Aqua were estimated based on time series of Terra/Aqua-MODIS LST and other auxiliary variables including enhanced vegetation index, normalized difference water index, solar zenith angle and distance to coast. The validation results indicate that the models produced an accuracy of 1.6-2.6 degrees C RMSE for the four overpass times of Terra/Aqua. The models based on Terra LST showed higher accuracy than those based on Aqua LST, and nighttime air temperature estimation had higher accuracy than daytime. The seasonal analysis shows daytime CUHI is strongest in summer and weakest in winter, while nighttime CUHI is weakest in summer and strongest in autumn. The annual mean daytime CUHI during 2000-2013 is 1.0 and 2.2 degrees C for Terra and Aqua overpass, respectively. The annual mean nighttime CUHI is about 1.0 degrees C for both Terra and Aqua overpass. The resultant CUHI climatology maps provide a spatiotemporal quantification of CUHI with emphasis on temperature gradients. This study has provided information of relevance to urban planners and environmental managers for assessing and monitoring urban thermal environments which are constantly being altered by natural and anthropogenic influences.																	2072-4292					JUL	2017	9	7							641	10.3390/rs9070641								WOS:000406676800004

Shellfish site suitability was assessed by means of a methodology based on Spatial Multi-Criteria Evaluation (SMCE), which provided the framework to combine mathematical models and operational oceanography products. Intermediate level criteria considered in the analysis included optimal growth conditions, environmental interactions, and socio-economic evaluation (e.g. organic carbon deposition; distance to harbour). Results showed that the whole coastal area comprised within 0 and 3 nm is highly suitable for farming of mussel, while the area comprised between 3 and 12nm is divided between a highly suitable northern part, and a less suitable southern one. Seven different scenarios of development of shellfish aquaculture industry were explored. The introduction of a new species, and the assessment of the exposure to storm events are specific aspects taken into account in development scenarios. Results show that the degree of suitability for shellfish aquaculture in this area would not change dramatically with the introduction of oyster farming. Furthermore, results highlight that: (i) the growth potential in this area is high; (ii) the space with suitability index >0.5 increases when prioritizing the optimal growth condition criteria, and (iii) the socio-economic is the most restrictive Intermediate Level Criteria. Results were discussed by deriving general lessons concerning the use of SMCE in aquaculture space allocation, from the specific application in the Northern Adriatic Sea. Challenges and opportunities related to the proposed methodological framework, with particular reference to the use of resources provided by remote sensing and operational oceanography by means of mathematical models, were also discussed. Results can support a science-based identification of allocated zones for aquaculture in order to avoid conflicts, and promote sustainable aquaculture in the Mediterranean Sea, where the space for these activities is becoming increasingly limited.

Long-term mean values of station-based and satellite-based rainfall data, correlation between them, Standard deviation of monthly average and anomaly components, and standard deviation of satellite based data error are analyzed. Variation of satellite-based data error with elevation and distance from coasts is the major focus of this study. The results show that, especially the anomaly component of satellite-based rainfall data error is much higher at low-elevation regions and coastal regions compared with high-elevation regions and interior regions.

Inventorying and Monitoring Nighttime Light Distribution and Dynamics in the Mediterranean Coast Network of Southern California	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Light pollution has been of increasing concern as it relates to protected areas. As such, natural resource managers need information on the distribution, intensity, and dynamics of nighttime lights in protected areas. We examine the extent of nighttime light brightness from 1992 to 2012 in the Mediterranean Coast Network (Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, Channel Islands National Park, and Cabrillo National Monument) using the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System, which has provided global annual nighttime light imagery at 0.9 km pixel resolution. Nighttime lights appeared stable in Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, decreased in Cabrillo National Monument, and are extremely low in Channel Islands National Park. However, the mean brightness values in Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area and Cabrillo National Monument were very high compared to all other National Parks. Indeed, both were comparable to the two National Parks in the USA with the highest mean brightness values (Cuyahoga Valley National Park, Hot Springs National Park). Monitoring night light extent, intensity, time series, and change detection using remote sensing should be a standard practice for all protected areas managed by the National Park Service due to the no-cost nature of the data and ease at which analyses can be undertaken. The DMSP data and calibrated products can be used to monitor long-term changes in light distribution and intensity while the higher-resolution Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite data can be used to show changes in light distribution and density throughout the year and can be used to test how policy or ordinance changes impact light pollution.

It varies spatio-temporally over large waterbodies and its well distributed measurement on field is tedious and time consuming. Generally, normalized difference turbidity index (NOT!), or band ratio, or regression analysis between turbidity concentration and band reflectance, approaches have been adapted to retrieve turbidity using multispectral remote sensing data. These techniques usually provide qualitative rather than quantitative estimates of turbidity. However, in the present study, spectral similarity analysis, between the spectral characteristics of spaceborne hyperspectral remote sensing data and spectral library generated on field, was carried out to quantify turbidity in the part of Chilika Lake, Odisha, India. Spatial spectral contextual image analysis, spectral angle mapper (SAM) technique was evaluated for the same. The SAM spectral matching technique has been widely used in geological application (mineral mapping), however, the application of this kind of techniques is limited in water quality studies due to non availability of reference spectral libraries. A spectral library was generated on field for the different concentrations of turbidity using well calibrated instruments like field spectro-radiometer, turbidity meter and hand held global positioning system. The field spectra were classified into 7 classes of turbidity concentration as <5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-25, 25-45, 45-100 and >100 NTU for analysis. Analysis reveal that at each location in the lake under consideration, the field spectra matched with the image spectra with SAM score of 0.8 and more. The observed turbidity at each location was also very much falling in the estimated turbidity class range. It was observed that the spectral similarity approach provides more quantitative estimate of turbidity as compared to NDTI. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

An optical remote sensing approach for ecological monitoring of red and green Noctiluca scintillans	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												An ecosystem disruptive bloom of red Noctiluca scintillans (hereafter Noctiluca) was observed in coastal waters of the north-western Bay of Bengal during April 2014. Based on the principle of phytoplankton group/species specific remote sensing reflectance (Rrs), a technique of detecting green Noctiluca and diatom was developed earlier using Rrs at 443, 488, and 531 nm of Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer-Aqua (MODIS). This was appropriately modified to detect bloom of red Noctiluca in coastal waters of the Bay of Bengal. Additional Rrs data at longer wavelengths viz. 667 and 678 nm were included in the existing algorithm, and the spectral shapes were accounted to detect the bloom of red Noctiluca. The classification scheme discriminates red Noctiluca from the green form of the same species and diatom. Phytoplankton group/species products were generated using the modified approach and validated with the reported events of red and green Noctiluca blooms in the Indian coastal waters. The present study also highlights two specific results based on MODIS retrieved time-series phytoplankton group/species image analysis: first, the observation of coexistence of diatom, red, and green Noctiluca in coastal waters of the northwestern Bay of Bengal, and the second, phytoplankton community shift resulting in red/green Noctiluca proliferation following diatom.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2017	189	7							330	10.1007/s10661-017-6037-9								WOS:000404652900027	28601960

This paper analyzes the effects of coast reclamation on Gross Domestic Product growth and the quality of inshore seawater in the Tianjin Binhai New Area. Remote sensing and a Geographic Information System were used to extract the information of coastal reclamation. The correlation between the area of coastal reclamation, GDP growth and the quality of inshore seawater was analyzed and a decoupling elasticity model was used to explore trends in the relationship between economic development and coastal reclamation. Results showed that coastal reclamation activities played an important role in promoting economic development, but greatly damaged the ecological environment. Although the relationship between coastal reclamation and economic development has weakened during the last three periods, the influence on the environment will continue because of the cumulative effects of pollution. To maintain a balance between coastal reclamation, economic development and environmental protection, (1) coastal reclamation planning must address both economic and environmental outcomes; (2) environmental deficiencies from existing coastal reclamation projects must be rectified; and (3) the legal system regulating coastal reclamation needs to be refined and strengthened.																	2045-2322					JUN 20	2017	7								3850	10.1038/s41598-017-04155-0								WOS:000403643900003	28634414

In this study, vulnerability due to tsunami disaster in coastal area of East Java Province Indonesia was carried out. Appropriate input criteria were derived from Digital Elevation Model data, satellite remote sensing and survey data. The criteria applied were elevation, slope, coastal proximity, river proximity, coastal type, and land use. Five classes of vulnerability were defined from low to high vulnerability. Digital Elevation Model from Aster GDEM was applied for creating elevation and slope map, while ALOS satellite image was used in land use mapping. Moreover, vector map of East Java coastal area was used for creating coastal type, coastal proximity, and river proximity map. Analytical hierarchy process was applied in the calculation of parameter's weight, and it described that elevation was the highest weight. The area that identified as slightly high and high class of tsunami vulnerability spread in the coastal area which has a lower elevation and predict as inundated area. Most of the area was urban areas with low vegetation density. The high vulnerability areas were mostly found in the coastal area with the sloping coast type. The result presented here can aid as a basic data for city planning related to disaster mitigation and for the evacuation process and management strategy during disaster.																	2186-2982	2186-2990				JUN	2017	12	34					115	122		10.21660/2017.34.2726								WOS:000406909300019

Alexis			Post-Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Monitoring of Louisiana Salt Marshes Using Landsat Imagery	REMOTE SENSING												The Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the second largest marine oil spill in history, contaminated over a thousand kilometers of coastline in the Louisiana salt marshes and seriously threatened this valuable ecosystem. Measuring the impacts of the oil spill over the large and complex coast calls for the application of remote sensing techniques. This study develops a method for post-Deepwater Horizon oil spill monitoring of the damaged marsh vegetation using Landsat imagery. This study utilizes 10 years of Landsat data, from 2005 to 2014, to examine the longevity of the oil spill's impacts on the marsh vegetation. AVIRIS data collected between 2010 and 2012 are used to validate the Landsat results. Landsat imagery documents the significant effect of oiling on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of the marsh vegetation in 2010 and 2011 (p < 0.01 in both cases). These results are corroborated by the AVIRIS data, which recorded the most severe impact in May 2011 followed by progressive recovery in October 2011 and October 2012. The Landsat imagery, combined with relevant environmental information and appropriate statistical tools, provides a robust and low-cost method for long-term post-oil spill monitoring of the marshes, revealing that the major aboveground impacts (at 30 m scale) of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on Louisiana salt marshes lasted for two years. The method presented is applicable for other hazardous events whenever pre-event referencing and long-term post-event monitoring are desired, thereby offering an effective and economical tool for disaster management.																	2072-4292					JUN	2017	9	6							547	10.3390/rs9060547								WOS:000404623900038						
J	Lantz, TC				Lantz, Trevor C.			Vegetation Succession and Environmental Conditions following Catastrophic Lake Drainage in Old Crow Flats, Yukon	ARCTIC												Increases in the frequency and magnitude of disturbances associated with the thawing of ice-rich permafrost highlight the need to understand long-term vegetation succession in permafrost environments. This study uses field sampling and remote sensing to explore vegetation development and soil conditions following catastrophic lake drainage in Old Crow Flats (OCF). The data presented show that vegetation on drained lake basins in OCF is characterized by two distinct assemblages: tall willow stands and sedge swards. Field sampling indicates that these alternative successional trajectories result from variation in soil moisture following drainage. Increased willow mortality on older drained basins suggests that intraspecific competition drives self-thinning in shrub thickets. This finding, combined with data from paleoecological studies and contemporary vegetation in OCF, suggests that willow stands on drained lake basins are seral communities. These results also indicate that the increase in number of catastrophic drainages that occurred between 1972 and 2010 will alter regional vegetation in ways that affect wildlife habitat, permafrost conditions, and local hydrology.																	0004-0843	1923-1245				JUN	2017	70	2					177	189		10.14430/arctic4646								WOS:000403713600006

Informing conservation strategies for the endangered Atlantic sturgeon using acoustic telemetry and multi-state mark-recapture models	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Causes of non-intentional mortality may pose conservation challenges for long-lived, migratory species. Recovery attempts for Atlantic sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus populations in the USA have mainly involved closures of targeted fishing, but bycatch mortality from fisheries targeting other species remains a significant obstacle. Natural and fishing mortality levels are highly uncertain and difficult to separate, but quantifying spatial and temporal patterns of movements and total mortality can directly inform management policies regarding fishing activity that affects sturgeon. 2. Subadult sturgeon were tagged with acoustic transmitters to track their movements with receivers deployed in active fishing areas within the New York Bight. Multi-state mark-recapture models were used to quantify seasonal patterns in survival and migration while accounting for detection probabilities of tagged fish. 3. Movement patterns of sturgeon were highly variable among seasons along the Long Island Coast, with frequent south-westward movements during the increase in sea surface temperature in spring. North-eastward movements were most pronounced during winter, when temperatures were lowest. Sturgeon were less common along coastal Long Island during summer. 4. Larger fish transitioned among strata more frequently, but also had slightly lower survival than smaller fish, which may result from selectivity for larger individuals caught incidentally in bottom trawl or gillnet fisheries. Weekly total mortality rates, including both natural and fishing mortality, averaged 0.24%. Highest weekly survival rates were observed during periods of decreasing sea surface temperature in autumn and winter, while lowest survival was observed during periods of increasing temperature in spring and summer while sturgeon migrated through areas of known bycatch. 5. Policy implications. Movement and survival patterns of Atlantic sturgeon suggest that late spring, coinciding with periods of ocean bycatch in fisheries along the coast of Long Island, is a particularly sensitive period for Atlantic sturgeon. Conservation efforts could target these few weeks using real-time observations from acoustic telemetry and remote sensing technologies to implement in-season fishery closures, thereby reducing incidental mortality of Atlantic sturgeon. Such bycatch management measures would aid in recovery attempts of a long-lived, migratory population with endangered status.																	0021-8901	1365-2664				JUN	2017	54	3					914	925		10.1111/1365-2664.12799								WOS:000401239100025						
J	Ruiz-Fernandez, J; Oliva, M; Garcia-Hernandez, C				Ruiz-Fernandez, Jesus; Oliva, Marc; Garcia-Hernandez, Cristina			Topographic and geomorphologic controls on the distribution of vegetation formations in Elephant Point (Livingston Island, Maritime Antarctica)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This article focuses on the spatial distribution of vegetation formations in Elephant Point, an ice-free area of 1.16 km(2) located in Livingston Island (South Shetland Islands, Antarctica). Fieldwork carried out in January 2014 consisted of floristic surveys and designation of a vegetation map. We have examined these data in a GIS environment together with topographical and geomorphological features existing in the peninsula in order to infer the factors controlling vegetation distribution. This has allowed quantifying the total area covered by the four different vegetation formations distributed across the peninsula, proliferating mainly on bedrock plateaus and Holocene raised beaches. Grass formation is essentially composed of Deschampsia antarctica, distributed almost exclusively on raised beaches, and covering 4.1% of the ice-free surface. The remaining three formations are fundamentally composed of cryptogam species. The first of which is fruticose lichen and moss formation, present on high bedrock plateaus and principally formed by lichens such as Usnea aurantiaco-atra. The next is the crustose lichen formation, spreading on bedrock plateaus near the coast populated by bird colonies. In this case, ornitocoprophilous lichens such as Caloplaca regalis, Xanthoria elegans and Haematomma erythromma are predominant. Together, both formations have colonised 5.1% of the peninsula. The last variety, moss carpet and moss cushion formation, occupies 1.4% of the deglaciated surface, spreading primarily in flooded areas, stabilised talus slopes, and bedrock plateaus as well. Therefore, the total surface colonised by vegetation is 12.2 ha, which comprises 10.5% of the peninsula. Due to the retreat of the Rotch Dome glacier, 20.1 ha remain ice-free since 1956 (17.3% of the deglaciated area). Ever since, even though the Antarctic Peninsula has registered one of the most significant temperature rises on Earth, vegetation has only colonised 0.04 ha of this new space, which merely represents 0.3% of the vegetated area in Elephant Point.

While there is reasonable agreement for the AOD comparisons, the direct comparisons of in situ-derived to AERONET-retrieved AAOD (or SSA) reveal that AERONET retrievals yield higher aerosol absorption than obtained from the in situ profiles for the low aerosol optical depth conditions prevalent at the two study sites. However, it should be noted that the majority of SSA comparisons for AOD(440) > 0.2 are, nonetheless, within the reported SSA uncertainty bounds. The observation that, relative to in situ measurements, AERONET inversions exhibit increased absorption potential at low AOD values is generally consistent with other published AERONET-in situ comparisons across a range of locations, atmospheric conditions and AOD values. This systematic difference in the comparisons suggests a bias in one or both of the methods, but we cannot assess whether the AERONET retrievals are biased towards high absorption or the in situ measurements are biased low. Based on the discrepancy between the AERONET and in situ values, we conclude that scaling modeled black carbon concentrations upwards to match AERONET retrievals of AAOD should be approached with caution as it may lead to aerosol absorption overestimates in regions of low AOD. Both AERONET retrievals and in situ measurements suggest there is a systematic relationship between SSA and aerosol amount (AOD or aerosol light scattering)-specifically that SSA decreases at lower aerosol loading. This implies that the fairly common assumption that AERONET SSA values retrieved at high-AOD conditions can be used to obtain AAOD at low-AOD conditions may not be valid.				andrews, elisabeth/A-7104-2018	andrews, elisabeth/0000-0002-9394-024X												1680-7316	1680-7324				MAY 16	2017	17	9					6041	6072		10.5194/acp-17-6041-2017								WOS:000401432200005

Previously KB HABs detection primarily relied on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Aqua (MODIS-A) satellite, depending on its remote sensing reflectance signal at the 678-nm chlorophyll fluorescence band (Rrs678) needed for normalized fluorescence height and related red band difference retrieval algorithms. VIIRS, MODIS-A's successor, does not have a 678-nm channel. Instead, our NN uses Rrs at 486-, 551-, and 671-nm VIIRS channels to retrieve phytoplankton absorption at 443 nm (a(ph443)). The retrieved a(ph443) images are next filtered by applying limits, defined by (i) low Rrs551-nm backscatter and (ii) a minimum a(ph443) value associated with KB HABs. The filtered residual images are then converted to show chlorophyll-a concentrations [Chla] and KB cell counts. VIIRS retrievals using our NN and five other retrieval algorithms were compared and evaluated against numerous in situ measurements made over the four-year 2012 to 2016 period, for which VIIRS data are available. These comparisons confirm the viability and higher retrieval accuracies of the NN technique, when combined with the filtering constraints, for effective detection of KB HABs. Analysis of these results as well as sequential satellite observations and recent field measurements underline the importance of short-term temporal variabilities on retrieval accuracies.

Particular focus is given to the German Bight in the North Sea as a prime example of a heavily used coastal area, and Svalbard as an example of an Arctic coast that is under strong pressure due to global change. The COSYNA automated observing and modelling system is designed to monitor real-time conditions and provide short-term forecasts, data, and data products to help assess the impact of anthropogenically induced change. Observations are carried out by combining satellite and radar remote sensing with various in situ platforms. Novel sensors, instruments, and algorithms are developed to further improve the understanding of the interdisciplinary interactions between physics, biogeochemistry, and the ecology of coastal seas. New modelling and data assimilation techniques are used to integrate observations and models in a quasi-operational system providing descriptions and forecasts of key hydrographic variables. Data and data products are publicly available free of charge and in real time. They are used by multiple interest groups in science, agencies, politics, industry, and the public.

Morphologic monitoring of tidal flats has become increasingly important with respect to achieving sustainable development targets. Remote sensing is an established technique for the measurement of topography over tidal flats; of the available methods, the waterline method is particularly effective for constructing a digital elevation model (DEM) of intertidal areas. However, application of the waterline method is more limited in large-scale, shifting tidal flats areas, where the tides are not synchronized and the waterline is not a quasi-contour line. For this study, a topographical map of the intertidal regions within the Radial Sand Ridges (RSR) along the Jiangsu Coast, China, was generated using an iterative approach on the waterline method. A series of 21 multi-temporal satellite images (18 HJ-1A/B CCD and three Landsat TM/OLI) of the RSR area collected at different water levels within a five month period (31 December 2013-28 May 2014) was used to extract waterlines based on feature extraction techniques and artificial further modification. These 'remotely-sensed waterlines' were combined with the corresponding water levels from the 'model waterlines' simulated by a hydrodynamic model with an initial generalized DEM of exposed tidal flats. Based on the 21 heighted 'remotely-sensed waterlines', a DEM was constructed using the ANUDEM interpolation method. Using this new DEM as the input data, it was re-entered into the hydrodynamic model, and a new round of water level assignment of waterlines was performed. A third and final output DEM was generated covering an area of approximately 1900 km(2) of tidal flats in the RSR. The water level simulation accuracy of the hydrodynamic model was within 0.15 m based on five real-time tide stations, and the height accuracy (root mean square error) of the final DEM was 0.182 m based on six transects of measured data. This study aimed at construction of an accurate DEM for a large-scale, high-variable zone within a short timespan based on an iterative way of the waterline method. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This study extracted coastlines of Qinghai Lake and surrounding lakes in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau from multitemporal remote sensing data from 1973 to 2015. The geomorphological processes and the reasons for area and coastline variations were then analyzed. The results showed that: the changes of the total lake area were divided into three stages: the stable decrease stage (1973-1988), the fluctuant decrease stage (1988-2005), and the rapidly increase stage (2005-2015). The changes of Qinghai Lake area and Gahai Lake area showed a similar trend as the total lake area. The Erhai Lake area fluctuated from 1973 to 2004 and then increased from 2004 to 2015. Haiyanwan Lake was isolated from Qinghai Lake in 2003 and was linked into Qinghai Lake in 2006, again. The lakes area variations, excluding Erhai Lake and Shadao Lake, were positively correlated with the variation of the Qinghai Lake level, and estuary area variations were significantly negatively correlated to the lake level, indicating that the higher lake level led to more land being submerged. The evolutionary processes of lakes in the Shadao Region were influenced by aeolian sand and lake water balance experiencing relatively low precipitation and strong evaporation. Erhai Lake was also influenced by river runoff from Daotang River. Sediment loads from rivers flowing into Qinghai Lake, except for Buha River, were relative low and only slightly influenced the estuary. Aeolian sand transported by the lake waves and currents from west coast to east coast will form subaqueous barriers, the Shadao Region land area will increase slowly, and the coastline of the Shadao Region will extend towards the lake. Therefore, the diameter of Qinghai Lake from the west to east coast will become shorter, while the diameter from the south to north coast will become longer in future. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Based on these data, we tested whether patterns in macroalgal diversity and distribution along European intertidal rocky shores could be explained by a set of meteo-oceanographic variables. The variables considered were salinity, sea surface temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, significant wave height and tidal range and were compiled from three different sources: remote sensing, reanalysis technique and in situ measurement. These variables were parameterized to represent average conditions (mean values), variability (standard deviation) and extreme events (minimum and maximum values). The results obtained in this study contribute to reinforce the EMBOS network approach and highlight the necessity of considering meteo-oceanographic variables in long-term assessments. The broad spatial distribution of pilot sites has allowed identification of latitudinal and longitudinal gradients manifested through species composition, diversity and dominance structure of intertidal macroalgae. These patterns follow a latitudinal gradient mainly explained by sea surface temperature, but also by photosynthetically active radiation, salinity and tidal range. Additionally, a longitudinal gradient was also detected and could be linked to wave height.

J	Ozturk, D				Ozturk, Derya			MODELLING SPATIAL CHANGES IN COASTAL AREAS OF SAMSUN (TURKEY) USING A CELLULAR AUTOMATA-MARKOV CHAIN METHOD	TEHNICKI VJESNIK-TECHNICAL GAZETTE												The evolution of cities over a specific time period and the determination of relevant trends are important to simulate for the proper development and planning of a city. In particular, coastal areas experience intense pressure from developers with respect to settlements, tourism, trade and industry, and built-up areas are being observed near coasts. The inability to direct development and control growth is destroying natural resources in coastal areas at a rapid pace. Thus, determining these trends is the key component for ensuring the protection of natural resources and planned growth. Because a complete estimation of urban expansion is not possible, likely changes can be determined using simulations. In this study, a 30-year urban expansion simulation (2004-2034) was obtained using land use/land cover (LU/LC) data for 1987 and 2004 at Samsun (Turkey) coastal areas and using the Cellular Automata-Markov Chain (CA-Markov) method. To verify the method, urban expansion simulation for the year 2014 was compared with real LU/LC data for the same year, and the kappa value was found to be 0,82. To determine LU/LC, Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI satellite images were used, and the analyses were realised in a geographic information system (GIS) environment. As a result of the study, the CA-Markov Chain approach integrated with GIS and remote sensing was shown to be effective in the study of urban growth dynamics. Using the simulation for the year 2034, probable urban expansion in the 20142034 period was estimated as approximately 3683 ha and the probable destructions of absolute agricultural lands, forests and pastures were predicted as approximately 968 ha, 228 ha and 24 ha, respectively.																	1330-3651	1848-6339				MAY	2017	24			1			99	107		10.17559/TV-20141110125014								WOS:000401236500014

Therefore, measurement of SST has been done from ships, buoys, offshore platforms, and satellites. During past decades satellites are being increasingly used, because datasets over wide areas can be obtained. In this paper, moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board Terra and Aqua SST products were examined and validated for coastal waters in the Yellow Sea by using the in situ buoy data. A strict match-up method was adopted in view of the complexity and variability of coastal area, resulting in 154 and 164 match-ups for Terra and Aqua, respectively. The MODIS SST agreed well with in situ buoy SST, with squared correlation coefficients R-2 of 0.989 for Terra, and 0.987 for Aqua. Relative to in situ SSTs, the satellite-derived SSTs had a bias of 0.23 degrees C and 0.06 degrees C, a standard deviation of 0.79 degrees C and 0.85 degrees C, and a root mean square error of 0.83 degrees C and 0.85 degrees C, for Terra and Aqua. The differences between MODIS and in situ SST exhibited apparent seasonal variations. The accuracy of MODIS SST products for spring and summer were lower than those for autumn andwinter, which could be caused by frequent sea fog along the southern coast of Shandong Peninsula. The SST bias approximately depended on wind velocity; low wind velocity could enhance the diurnal SST amplitude and the bulk-skin temperature difference. However, there is no significant dependence of the bias on air-sea temperature difference or surface flow velocity.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				MAY	2017	10	5	1				1667	1680		10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2651951								WOS:000399682500001

However, due to some limitations related to the instrument interferometric concept and its challenging data processing, SMOS SSS maps still display significant artifacts and biases, especially close to the coast, mainly due to the presence of Radio Frequency Interferences (RFI) and Land-sea contamination (LSC).

J	Porter, SN; Branch, GM; Sink, KJ				Porter, Sean N.; Branch, George M.; Sink, Kerry J.			Changes in shallow-reef community composition along environmental gradients on the East African coast	MARINE BIOLOGY												Abiotic determinants of community composition on shallow reefs are seldom examined at a scale transcending biogeographic regions, and knowledge for the western Indian Ocean is sparse. To address this deficit, turnover in reef community composition was quantified, using gradient forest analyses, along gradients of nine abiotic variables collected in situ or via remote sensing at 54 sites across and within three bioregions: Tropical Western Indian Ocean (Tropical WIO), Delagoa and Natal, spanning 4800 km of east African coastline (5.2-31.1 degrees S). All oceanographic variables differed significantly among bioregions. At a scale across bioregions, wave height declined northwards, while temperature increased. Values for suspended inorganic sediments, chlorophyll-a concentration [chl-a], turbidity and nutrients were all lowest in Delagoa, in association with the scarcity of rivers there. The most novel and unexpected finding was that the northwards decline in wave action was more strongly associated with changes in community composition across bioregions than any other variable. Temperature was the second-most important variable at that scale. Within bioregions, temperature and [chl-a] had strongest relationships with community composition in the Tropical WIO. By contrast, in Delagoa, reef profile, susceptibility to sand inundation and reef heterogeneity were most strongly associated with community composition; and in Natal, depth, turbidity and suspended sediment were foremost. Variables of greatest importance within bioregions distilled to (1) those influencing food/energy supply ([chl-a], turbidity, depth and suspended sediments), which were of particular importance in the Tropical WIO and Natal bioregions, and (2) those altering sand inundation and small-scale current dynamics of reefs (profile, heterogeneity and depth), which were leading factors in the Delagoa Bioregion.																	0025-3162	1432-1793				MAY	2017	164	5							101	10.1007/s00227-017-3130-0								WOS:000399218700005

The results indicated that the metal flux had been increasing since the 1980s. Enrichment factor values (Pb, Zn and Cu) suggested only slight enrichment. The proportion of anthropogenic Pb changed from 9% to 15% during 2000-2014. Coal combustion might be an important contamination source in the Dongshan Bay. The historical variation in the metal flux reflected the economic development and urbanization in the Zhangjiang drainage area in the past 30 years. According to the Landsat satellite remote sensing data, the urbanization area expanded approximately three times from 1995 to 2010. The delta C-13 values (-21%o to 23%o) of the organic matter (OM) in the sediments indicated that the OM was primarily sourced from aquatic, terrigenous and marsh C-3 plants. Nitrogen was mainly derived from aquatic plants and terrigenous erosion before the 1980s. However, the total organic carbon (TOC) contents, total nitrogen (TN) contents and delta N-15 had been increasing since the 1980s, which suggested that the sources of nitrogen were soil erosion, fertilizer and sewage. In addition, the TOC and TN fluxes in the Dongshan Bay had significantly increased since the 1980s, which reflected the use of N fertilizer. However, the TOC and TN fluxes significantly decreased in the past decade because environmental awareness increased and environmental protection policies were implemented. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Geotechnical investigators performed conventional observations/measurements at the two sites using traditional reconnaissance methods, and virtual observations/measurements using sUAV-based remote sensing and structure from motion (SfM) computer vision. Two types of sUAV platform/sensor combinations were evaluated for this study. Comparisons between the traditional and sUAV-based reconnaissance methods were performed and observations are discussed. The sUAV-based point cloud models of the sites were between 770 and 2,600 points per square meter depending on the camera that was used, with average model dimensional error ranging from +/- 1.0 to +/- 3.5%. Lateral spread displacement measurements from the UAV-based three-dimensional models were generally within 9cm of the lateral spread displacements measured in the field, and measured vertical deformations from the models generally agreed well with the deformations reported by previous investigators. This study demonstrates that sUAVs can be useful instruments for post-disaster geotechnical surficial site reconnaissance. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Vinci, G; Bernardini, F				Vinci, Giacomo; Bernardini, Federico			Reconstructing the protohistoric landscape of Trieste Karst (north-eastern Italy) through airborne LiDAR remote sensing	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS												The archaeological landscape of Trieste Karst (north-eastern Italy) is rich in protohistoric hill-forts built from the Early/Middle Bronze Age to the Late Iron Age. Airborne LiDAR data have been analysed for the archaeological prospection of a central Karst sector and several spatial analyses have been carried out. The high-resolution LiDAR-derived images allowed to identify several previously unknown fortified structures, ranging from small lookouts to large settlements within a complex landscape including enclosures, ancient clearance stone cairns and field divisions. Our results allowed to recognize small-scale clusters of protohistoric sites visually interconnected and arranged around a central large site. These territorial entities, considerably smaller than those previously proposed by other scholars for the Karst Bronze Age, probably had a role in the strategic control over routes leading from the coast to the inner Karst across the central Karst ridge. According to available chronological data, the formation and occupation of such cultural landscape could be tentatively dated to the Bronze Age. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Carr, JR; Stokes, CR; Vieli, A				Carr, J. Rachel; Stokes, Chris. R.; Vieli, Andreas			Threefold increase in marine-terminating outlet glacier retreat rates across the Atlantic Arctic: 1992-2010	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY					IGS Symposium	JUL 10-15, 2016	Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA	IGS	Scripps Inst Oceanog			Accelerated discharge through marine-terminating outlet glaciers has been a key component of the rapid mass loss from Arctic glaciers since the 1990s. However, glacier retreat and its climatic controls have not been assessed at the pan-Arctic scale. Consequently, the spatial and temporal variability in the magnitude of retreat, and the possible drivers are uncertain. Here we use remotely sensed data acquired over 273 outlet glaciers, located across the entire Atlantic Arctic (i.e. areas potentially influenced by North Atlantic climate and/or ocean conditions, specifically: Greenland, Novaya Zemlya, Franz Josef Land and Svalbard), to demonstrate high-magnitude, accelerating and near-ubiquitous retreat between 1992 and 2010. Overall, mean retreat rates increased by a factor of 3.5 between 1992 and 2000 (-30.5 m a(-1)) and 2000-10 (-105.8 m a(-1)), with 97% of the study glaciers retreating during the latter period. The Retreat was greatest in northern, western and south-eastern Greenland and also increased substantially on the Barents Sea coast of Novaya Zemlya. Glacier retreat showed no significant or consistent relationship with summer air temperatures at decadal timescales. The rate of frontal position change showed a significant, but weak, correlation with changes in sea-ice concentrations. We highlight large variations in retreat rates within regions and suggest that fjord topography plays an important role. We conclude that marine-terminating Arctic outlet glaciers show a common response of rapid and accelerating retreat at decadal timescales.																	0260-3055	1727-5644				APR	2017	58	74					72	91		10.1017/aog.2017.3								WOS:000416835100009						
J	Oloo, OJ				Oloo, Okuku Josephat			ASSESSING THE ACCURACY OF REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES IN VEGETATION FRACTIONS ESTIMATION	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS												This study aimed at exploring different remote sensing (RS) techniques for quantitatively measuring vegetation and bare soil fractions in dune ecosystems along the Kenyan coast. The accurate measurements of field samples are required by Kenya Wildlife for environmental monitoring. The current methodology for measuring fractions (ecological surveys) is biased, expert dependent and subjective, and for this reason, remote sensing techniques have been explored to find a better cost-effective alternative. Three methods were carried out to estimate different vegetation coverages in field samples and to analyze their performance: classification of photography's taken by hand-held camera, unmixing of aerial photographs, unmixing of Crop scan and Field spec spectral measurements. For these purposes 32 plots of 1x1square meters distributed in 4 transects were selected and measured in the dune ecosystem. According to the field spectral measurements, different targets (lichens, vascular plants, mosses, and bare soil) showed a large spectral variation and overlapping between their spectral signatures. Therefore, classification methods and unmixing techniques led to poor results since they are based upon the spectral signature of the targets. The hand held camera method proved more accurate than Field Spec, Aerial photograph and Crop Scan. Therefore, from the remote sensing methods, this is the best method when considering accuracy. The performance of this method could be improved by adding an extra band (Infrared for instance). This extra band would allow operators to identify and classify better different kind of vegetation in the image.																	2225-8531					APR	2017	6	1					106	129		10.4314/sajg.v6i1.7								WOS:000406048600007

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Israel's location in a semi-arid region along the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea makes the prediction of winter precipitation socially and environmentally important. In 1982, Tzvetkov and Assaf proposed a connection between heat content (HC) in the Eastern Mediterranean (EM) in fall and precipitation over Israel in the following winter. We revisit their hypothesis using 21 years of remotely sensed sea surface temperature and sea surface height. The HC of the EM's upper layer is derived from these remotely sensed measurements under a reduced gravity approximation. Our results show a correlation of R = 0.6 between HC in the fall off the coastline of Lebanon and precipitation in Haifa, Tel-Aviv and Jerusalem. The depletion of HC during winter correlates moderately (R = 0.4) with precipitation in the three cities. Thus, according to our analysis, the upper layer HC in the EM in fall significantly impacts winter precipitation over Israel. Still, from a separate analysis, the atmospheric short-term condition seems to be important as well.																	0899-8418	1097-0088				APR	2017	37	5					2492	2501		10.1002/joc.4860								WOS:000398859700023						
J	Levin, N; Jablon, PE; Phinn, S; Collins, K				Levin, Noam; Jablon, Pierre-Elie; Phinn, Stuart; Collins, Kerry			Coastal dune activity and foredune formation on Moreton Island, Australia, 1944-2015	AEOLIAN RESEARCH												The stabilization process of coastal dunes is complex, involving feedback mechanisms and lag times between changes in climatic conditions, vegetation establishment and dune movement. In this study our aim was to examine changes in dune activity and in the establishment of foredunes on Moreton Island, Australia. We used historical aerial photos, satellite images and Lidar data to quantify changes in bare sand areas, dune movement rates, foredune development and coastline changes between 1944 and 2015. We used wind data (1957-2016), to quantify changes in sand drift potential (DP) and in wind directionality, and wave data (1977-2016) to examine changes in wave height and wave direction. We found that transgressive dunes on Moreton Island have started stabilizing in the early 1970s, after a series of continuous foredunes developed on the eastern coast of Moreton Island, in spite of the increase in DP values. Foredunes have started establishing in the 1960s and 1970s during a period of lower wave height and decreased wind directionality. Once established, these foredunes have diminished sand supply to the transgressive dunes, causing a phase shift in the state of dune activity on the island. Coastal dune activity should therefore be examined over time scales of several decades at least, in order to quantify trends and to understand the underlying and causes to observed processes. Understanding the factors responsible for foredune formation is important for explaining dune stabilization on Moreton Island. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, creating comprehensive and detailed maps of ocean and coastal environments has been hindered by the high cost of operating ship-and aircraft-based sensors. While a number of groups (e.g., academic research, government resource management, and private sector) are engaged in or would benefit from the collection of additional seafloor mapping data, disparate priorities, dauntingly large data gaps, and insufficient funding have confounded strategic planning efforts. In this study, we addressed these challenges by implementing a quantitative, spatial process to facilitate prioritizing seafloor mapping needs in Washington State. The Washington State Prioritization Tool (WASP), a custom web-based mapping tool, was developed to solicit and analyze mapping priorities from each participating group. The process resulted in the identification of several discrete, high priority mapping hotspots. As a result, several of the areas have been or will be subsequently mapped. Furthermore, information captured during the process about the intended application of the mapping data was paramount for identifying the optimum remote sensing sensors and acquisition parameters to use during subsequent mapping surveys.																	1424-8220					APR	2017	17	4							701	10.3390/s17040701								WOS:000400822900042

Land-use/land-cover change: a key to understanding land degradation and relating environmental impacts in Northwestern Sinai, Egypt	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Land degradation and environmental impacts are major impediments to the utilization of land in many arid and semiarid regions of the world and are a major issue in the Northwestern Sinai (NWS), Egypt. Monitoring and detecting of land-use/land-cover (LU/LC) changes and land degradation are very important for the planners, governments and the scientific communities, particularly where there are increasing pressures from human and natural activities on the adjacent environment. Water-logged, saltaffected soils, coastal erosion and sand dunes encroachment are serious environmental hazards resulting in the wasteland and geoenvironmental risks. Presently, attempts have been made to analyze and determine the changes in LU/LC of NWS. The present work utilizes image processing and GIS techniques to determine most of the causes that result in intensive land degradations and recommends appropriate remedial measures within the NWS. Multi-temporal remote sensing data and ASTER GDEM were used to map the LU/ LC change areas. Many image processing techniques and statistical analysis were applied to draw numerous thematic and geospatial distribution maps for the degraded lands. The results showed that the rapid change in LC was attributed to human activities which led to heavy deteriorations of NWS environment. Also, the prevalence of natural risk corresponding to coastal erosion, water level rising and sand dunes encroachment increase the susceptibility of hazards to the NWS area. The current study provides decision makers and resources managers with appropriate remedial measures that are necessary to avoid severe future environmental difficulties within the NWS.

It can be considered one of the most extreme examples on the Mediterranean coast of severe pathologies associated with urban development on coastal landslides. The resort, with 416 dwellings, was partially built on a deep-seated landslide which affects a soft formation composed of dark graphite schists. In November 2015, the City Council officially declared a state of emergency in the resort and 24 dwellings have already been evacuated. We have used two remote sensing techniques to monitor the landslide with the aim of identifying and measuring a wide range of displacements rates (from mm/year to m/year): (1) PSInSAR, exploiting 25 ENVISAT SAR images acquired from May 2003 to December 2009, and (2) photogrammetry, considering the output from two Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flights made in June 2015 and January 2016 and the outdated photos from a conventional flight in 2008. The relationship between the geology of the site, data from PS deformation measurements, building displacements, rainfall and damage observed and their temporal occurrence allows a better understanding of the landslide kinematics and both the spatial and temporal evolution of the instability. Results indicate building displacements of up to 1.92 m in 8 years, a clear lithological control in the spatial distribution of damage and a close relationship between the most damaging events and water recharge episodes (rainy events and leaks from swimming pools and the water supply network). This work emphasises the need to incorporate geohazards into urban planning, including policies to predict, prepare for and prevent this type of phenomenon.

J	Kulshreshtha, A; Shanmugam, P				Kulshreshtha, Anuj; Shanmugam, Palanisamy			Estimation of underwater visibility in coastal and inland waters using remote sensing data	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												An optical method is developed to estimate water transparency (or underwater visibility) in terms of Secchi depth (Z(sd)), which follows the remote sensing and contrast transmittance theory. The major factors governing the variation in Z(sd), namely, turbidity and length attenuation coefficient (1/(c + K-d), c = beam attenuation coefficient; K-d = diffuse attenuation coefficient at 531 nm), are obtained based on band rationing techniques. It was found that the band ratio of remote sensing reflectance (expressed as (R-rs(443) + R-rs(490))/ (R-rs(555) + R-rs(670)) contains essential information about the water column optical properties and thereby positively correlates to turbidity. The beam attenuation coefficient (c) at 531 nm is obtained by a linear relationship with turbidity. To derive the vertical diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d) at 531 nm, K-d(490) is estimated as a function of reflectance ratio (R-rs(670)/R-rs(490)), which provides the bio-optical link between chlorophyll concentration and K-d(531). The present algorithm was applied to MODIS-Aqua images, and the results were evaluated by matchup comparisons between the remotely estimated Z(sd) and in situ Z(sd) in coastal waters off Point Calimere and its adjoining regions on the southeast coast of India. The results showed the pattern of increasing Z(sd) from shallow turbid waters to deep clear waters. The statistical evaluation of the results showed that the percent mean relative error between the MODIS-Aqua-derived Z(sd) and in situ Z(sd) values was within +/- 25%. A close agreement achieved in spatial contours of MODIS-Aqua-derived Z(sd) and in situ Z(sd) for the month of January 2014 and August 2013 promises the model capability to yield accurate estimates of Zsd in coastal, estuarine, and inland waters. The spatial contours have been included to provide the best data visualization of the measured, modeled (in situ), and satellite-derived Z(sd) products. The modeled and satellite-derived Z(sd) values were compared with measurement data which yielded RMSE = 0.079, MRE = -0.016, and R-2 = 0.95 for the modeled Z(sd) and RMSE = 0.075, MRE = 0.020, and R-2 = 0.95 for the satellite-derived Z(sd) products.

J	Quader, MA; Agrawal, S; Kervyn, M				Quader, Mohammad Abdul; Agrawal, Shefali; Kervyn, Matthieu			Multi-decadal land cover evolution in the Sundarban, the largest mangrove forest in the world	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Having one of the most vulnerable coasts of the world to climate change, Bangladesh and India are facing new challenges to protect Sundarban, the largest mangrove in the world, from adverse impacts of climate-driven changes. In this study, unsupervised classification of mangrove density is performed on Landsat images of folk time periods over 35 years (1975-77, 1989, 2000 and 2010) to identify the spatiotemporal evolution of the Sundarban mangrove, and infer the causes of observed changes. Specifically the influences of environmental and anthropogenic drivers on these changes are discriminated by correlating the observed change patterns with cyclones' tracks, erosion processes and areas of expected human influences as assessed by local stakeholders. Results highlight a very dynamic systerh, with rapid changes characterized by decreasing mangrove density, mainly in India, erosion and accretion. There is similar to 1.2% (or 11,500 ha) net erosion in 35 years in Sundarban, which remains limited relative to the documented high rate of sea level rise of 6 mm/yr. Mangrove density changes are attributed to cyclones, increased salinity and anthropogenic influences. Based on interpretation of the spatial pattern of density changes by local stakeholders, we conclude that the zones accessible to human activities are significantly more affected by land cover changes. Management policies of Sundarban by Bangladeshi and Indian authorities should acknowledge the important role played by natural or global drivers like sea level change, cyclones in affecting the mangrove as well as manage the localized anthropogenic pressures.

The in situ data showed a change in salinity of similar to 2-3 PSUs across the front on the northwest edge of the plume, corresponding to locations of vertical salinity variation of 5.5-7.5 PSU. Velocity magnitude outside of the inlet reached more than 2.3 ms(-1) seaward and a brackish lens in the upper 4.5 m of the water column, the spread of which contributed to the development of a plume. The volume of brackish water within the plume was estimated an order of magnitude larger than the volume output from the Calcasieu River within an entire ebb tidal period. This implies that the plume was formed during multiple tidal cycles and it sustained during the flood tides because only weak diurnal tides exist. Both satellite and in situ observations showed an interesting western intensification of the plume. An analysis to the momentum/vorticity equations suggests that the western intensification is due to the asymmetry of the vorticity-divergence relationship under the Coriolis force. This can also be enhanced by an ambient coastal current that strengthens the convergence at the front. Estuary plumes are shown as bright and dark features in two SAR images. Results from a radar model simulation and in situ water temperature data showed that the SAR observed plume features were dominated by the water temperature differences.

J	Pan, YQ; Shen, F; Verhoef, W				Pan, Yanqun; Shen, Fang; Verhoef, Wouter			An improved spectral optimization algorithm for atmospheric correction over turbid coastal waters: A case study from the Changjiang (Yangtze) estuary and the adjacent coast	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Remote sensing-based retrieval of the concentrations of water components relies largely on the accuracy of the atmospheric correction. Although a variety of atmospheric correction algorithms have been developed for turbid waters, the water-leaving reflectance is still underestimated in extremely turbid waters, such as in the Changjiang (Yangtze) estuary and the adjacent coast. To address this issue, this paper proposes an improved algorithm that is based on a spectral optimization algorithm (ESOA) with a coupled water-atmosphere model. The model combines an aerosol model that is constructed from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observation data and a simple semi-empirical radiative transfer (SERT) model (Shen et al. 2010) for water component retrieval. Four unknown parameters are involved in the coupled model: the relative humidity (RH), fine-mode fraction (FMF), aerosol optical thickness in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength tau(a)(lambda(0)) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration (C-spm). These parameters are estimated by a global optimization approach that is based on a genetic algorithm (GA) without any initial inputs. Validation results of the atmospherically corrected remote sensing reflectance R-rs(lambda) from matchups between Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data and in situ data show that the algorithm has satisfactory accuracy. The root mean square error (RMSE) and the absolute percentage difference (APD) are 0.0089 and 35.12, respectively. By contrast, the R-rs(lambda) values retrieved from the same matchups using the GOCI data processing system (GDPS) have higher RMSE and APD of 0.0104 and 69.15, respectively. The ESOA method can be implemented conveniently within the open source code of SeaDAS (v7.1) as an alternative and operational tool for atmospheric correction of ocean color data, including GOCI, MERIS and MODIS, over highly turbid estuarine and coastal regions, such as the Yangtze estuary, the Hangzhou Bay and most of the coastal ocean in Eastern China.

With the proliferation of marine leisure activities and the maritime conditions such as tides, rocks, typhoons, tsunamis, there are various types of marine accidents that have not been experienced before. Therefore, it is imperative to establish an information based system (like digital map or 3D distribution map) that can be utilized in marine safety fields such as accident and disaster prevention. In this investigation, it will be discussed the safety mapping for tidal channel connected directly with human life. A tidal channel is a waterway where occurs by the process of ebb tide and flood tide in the tidal flats. Since the shape (included exact depth) of tidal channel cannot be identified when a tide comes in, it must be considered as the main causes of the summer drowning fatalities. A map for tidal channel has been proposed by a 3D distribution map that can be identified the shape and location of tidal channel, and also, this map should be offered to marine tourist and maritime safety authority. A cartography based on image collected by manned aerial Photogrammetry or satellite has the insoluble limitations in terms of economy, time constraint and periodic for measurement. Due to temporary erratic overflow through the tidal amplitude, the information for tidal channel cannot be monitored in real time. Therefore, in the present investigation, a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) recently been actively used in the field of spatial information is considered in analyzing the status of tidal channel. First of all, the DEM (Digital Elevation Model) of tidal flats generates through UAV based auto-image, the distribution map for tidal channel expresses different colors by the height of topographic. A tidal channel encoding specific color (normally red) can be provided dangerous signal to the user. It can be identified the sea leveling at the certain time that can be measured whole shape of tidal channels, and also, provided a more realistic and readable information on tidal flats. The information provided through the tidal channel map was verified by comparison with the VRS GPS positioning solution. Since information such as the exact distribution location and shape should be considered as the first priority, the coordinates of the tidal channel was compared with the previously proven method, VRS GPS. As a result, it is determined that the location of attribute information and the 3D shape analysis value analyzed by UAV image can fully provide information within the convergence range. In this investigation, UAV image can be estimated on the location and shape of tidal channel by observing exactly at the time zone for flood tide. It can be fully expected that the UAV is contributed to preventing the marine accident in advance by maximizing the latent properties with regards to periodicity, accuracy, operation convenience and economy.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SPR	2017					79		199	203		10.2112/SI79-041.1								WOS:000403856800041

The study principally examines the effectiveness of the Indian policy pertaining to the disaster management in achieving its intended outcome, i.e. achieving effective mitigation and response to a disaster thereby minimising the casualties and losses to the community caused by the cyclone Phailin, India in 2013. It is also analysed how the implementation of the policy enabled the government of the Indian state of Odisha to minimize the casualties and damage to property, in stark contrast to the 1999 Super Cyclone in the same state of India where over 10,000 people died. This was a remarkable achievement considering the havoc anarchy among administration in the year 1999, when Odisha was challenged by the similar intensity cyclone.																	2212-4209					MAR	2017	21						350	359		10.1016/j.ijdrr.2017.01.002								WOS:000403533100035						
J	Kotilainen, AT; Kaskela, AM				Kotilainen, Aarno Tapio; Kaskela, Anu Marii			Comparison of airborne LiDAR and shipboard acoustic data in complex shallow water environments: Filling in the white ribbon zone	MARINE GEOLOGY												Shallow coastal areas of oceans, seas and lakes pose significant remote sensing and navigational challenges due to the transient nature of bathymetric features that characterize these areas (e.g., shoals and shoaling). Seabed data/ maps often represent these areas as "white ribbon" zones, where sparse data coverage presents a particular challenge to defining and enforcing sustainable use of marine resources. Given the lengthy perimeter of coastlines, there is a need for cost-efficient methods for producing high resolution maps of shallow areas. The research described here compares airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) with shipboard acoustic surveys around the Kvarken Archipelago of the northern Baltic Sea. The Kvarken Archipelago includes a unique, brackish shallow water marine environment with a number of moraines. The landscape of the area is characterised by fields of ridged, washboard-like De Geer moraines. The moraines combined with an ongoing glacio-isostatic uplift typical of the area, lead into succession of the elevated structures from the seafloor to land, where present seabed structures will rise on land in future. The ongoing modification of the environment by both climatic and geologic forces contributes to complex geomorphic and ecological feedback systems operating on a range of spatial and temporal scales. Airborne LiDAR can provide high resolution remote sensing data on shallow coastal areas. The technology is especially effective in areas with very shoal waters, like those found along the Finnish coast. LiDAR enables continuous detection of topographic (elevation) and bathymetric (depth) data and can thus generate continuous maps of transition zones between continental and marine areas. Environmental conditions such as water clarity and ice cover can affect LiDAR depth detection capabilities: these conditions require complementary accuracy assessment strategies. As LiDAR cannot determine detailed information on seafloor surface substrate, and anything on subsurface substrate type, geological conditions are determined through the application of acoustic-seismic. methods, sediment sampling and underwater video. Data from LiDAR surveys provide a detailed topographic and bathymetric map of the study area up to water depths of 14 m. The seabed bathymetry model shows a series of elevated, narrow, elongate features that appear throughout the study area. These parallel ridges represent the uppermost geomorphic features of the seafloor. Interpretation of acoustic bathymetric surveys indicates that these ridges are De Geer moraines. The general orientation of these moraines differs from that associated with older features of the northern Kvarken Archipelago. Eroded remnants of older De Geer moraines are overprinted at a high angle by the younger landforms. De Geer moraines in the study area thus represent two phases of deglaciation and finally the eastward ice-sheet/ice edge retreat. The combined approach of using LiDAR and acoustic bathymetric data provides new insights into past glacial dynamics of the Kvarken Archipelago and the Gulf of Bothnia.

The port construction, land reclamation, urban development and silt deposition in the Ningbo coastal zone have resulted in extensive coastline change. In this study, the spatio-temporal change of the Ningbo coastlines during 1976-2015 was detected and analysed using Landsat time-series images from different sensors, including Multispectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Operational Land Imager (OLI). Fourteen individual scenes (covering seven phases) of cloud-free Landsat images within the required tidal range of +/- 63 cm were collected. The ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) image of 2015 was used to extract the reference coastline for the accuracy assessment. The normalised difference water index (NDWI) and the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) were applied to discriminate surface water and land features, respectively. The on-screen digitising approach was then used to further refine the extracted time-series coastlines in the period from 1976 to 2015. Six relevant indices, length, length change, annual length change, fractal dimension (FD), average net shoreline movement (NSM) and average annual NSM, were calculated to analyse and explore the spatio-temporal change features of Ningbo coastlines. Results show that the length of the Ningbo coastlines increased from 910 km to 986 km, and the value of FD increased from 1.09 to 1.12, and the coastline morphology changed from sinuous to straight. The average NSM increased from 187 m to 298 m and the average annual NSM reached 85 m/year, indicating the advance of coastlines towards the sea at a high level. The spatio-temporal change patterns also varied in different areas. In Hangzhou Bay, significant advancement along the coastlines was experienced since 2001 mainly because of urban construction and land reclamation. In Xiangshan Bay, the forces of nature played a major role in coastline dynamics before 2008, whilst port construction, urban construction and island link projections moved the coastlines towards the sea. The coastline changes of Sanmen Bay were affected by the interaction of nature and human activities. All these observations indicate that forces of nature and human activities were the two important influential factors for the observed coastline change. In this case, the coastline complexity variation was considered responsible for various coastline patterns change of the Ningbo coast. In addition, erosion and accretion occurred in turn because of forces of nature and human activities, such as urban development and agricultural exploitation.				ling, feng/E-4811-2013	ling, feng/0000-0002-0685-4897												2220-9964					MAR	2017	6	3							68	10.3390/ijgi6030068								WOS:000398732200011

Despite their capacity for regeneration given ample sediment supply, saltmarshes are likely to disappear if they continue to be impacted by such activities without effective monitoring and protection. However, effective mon-itoring requires a combination of saltmarsh species mapping and short timespan change analyses, which are difficult to accomplish due to the widespread, rapid, and complex characteristics of saltmarsh replacement in the region. Integrating multi-source remote sensing data with a times-series strategy, this study constructed saltmarsh species maps for the Jiangsu middle coast with 89.4 % overall accuracy (similar to 16.1 % higher than that achieved by the individual image classification method). Subsequently, we used these maps to explore the interaction between saltmarshes and human activities by a dual-scale analysis: macroscale analysis, aiming at saltmarsh ecosystem wide processes, to reflect the general evolutionary trend for all saltmarsh species, and microscale analysis, focusing on a species-specific process, to reveal the focal response mechanism for Spartina alterniflora. The results show that: (1) In the past 20 years, over 97.6 % (227.72 km(2)) of the loss of native saltmarshes (Phragmites australis and Suaeda salsa) was caused by tidal flat reclamation, and the invasion of S. alterniflora poses a potential threat to the future wellbeing of the native saltmarshes. The limited remaining area of the native saltmarshes, together with their long regeneration time, suggests that future land replacement will be dominated by the interaction between S. alterniflora and reclamation. (2) Intertidal reclamation promotes the expansion of S. alterniflora, as revealed by high linear correlations (mainly with R-2 > 0.6) between the lateral expansion rate of S. alterniflora and reclamation. The prerequisite for this correlation was a sufficient width of S. alterniflora (850-1000 m for most of the coasts), and we propose that by maintaining this critical width, S. alterniflora will be capable of relatively rapid invasion after reclamation.

J	Legare, B; Mace, C				Legare, Bryan; Mace, Christopher			Mapping and Classifying Eastern Oyster (Crassostrea virginica) Habitat in Copano Bay, Texas, by Coupling Acoustic Technologies	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The Texas coast is characterized by an extensive array of shallow turbid embayments containing expansive oyster habitats and is home to a large Eastern Oyster (Crassostrea virginica) fishery. Mapping habitats in shallow (1-10 m), turbid environments is challenging, since direct visual access to the habitats limited. To quantify the extent of habitats, the integration of remote sensing and GIS technologies is used. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department coupled two acoustic technologies (sidescan sonar and echosounder) to map habitats within Copano Bay, a 181-km(2) shallow water embayment along the mid-Texas coast. Data were collected during 17 days from September 2013 to February 2014 and resulted in 159 km(2) of sidescan imagery and 375 km of single beam echosounder data. Individual echosounder transmissions were segmented and processed in ArcGIS 10.1 using the "Unsupervised Classification" tool. Using the classified echosounder data to identify objects located within the sidescan imagery allows for interpolation of habitat using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Habitat Digitizer ArcGIS Extension. A total of 25.9 km(2) of oyster habitat, 11.6 km(2) of shell, 26.4 km(2) of sand, and 95.1 km(2) of mud were digitized. The resulting habitat map had an overall accuracy of 86% from ground truthing accuracy assessments. This article provides methods for combining sidescan and echosounder acoustic technologies to accurately map habitats in shallow Texas estuaries.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				MAR	2017	33	2					286	294		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-15-00205.1								WOS:000397355700005

Methods for Investigating Sediment Flux under High-Energy Conditions on the Southeast Florida Continental Shelf using Laser Airborne Depth Sounding (LADS) in a Geographic Information System (GIS) Dataframe	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Laser Airborne Depth Sounding (LADS) bathymetric surveys conducted in 2001 and 2008 bracket two hurricane landfalls (Hurricane Ivan in 2004 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005) in Broward County, southeast Florida, thus providing an opportunity to investigate changes in bottom topography as a result of wave and current action. The seafloor in this region is characterized by a wide range of sedimentary features that are normally stabilized (held in place) by outcrops of carbonate bedrock and coral reefs. During high-energy events, however, the sedimentary deposits are partially mobilized by waves and currents. This methodological study used the two LADS bathymetric surveys to construct triangulated irregular networks (TINs, which are a digital means of representing surface morphology) surfaces using the ESRI (R) ArcGIS 3D Analyst extension. The two bathymetric TIN surfaces were compared to ascertain spatial gains and losses by landform. Comparison of TIN surfaces provides a means to estimate changes in sediment volume and infer variability in cross-shore sediment transport. Application of this methodological procedure is constrained to locations where seafloor features have been interpreted from the LADS bathymetry so that sediment volume changes can be related to specific landform units.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				MAR	2017	33	2					452	462		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-16A-00014.1								WOS:000397355700019

Case study from Byblos (Jbail, Lebanon)	JOURNAL OF CULTURAL HERITAGE												The ancient city of Byblos (Jbail, Lebanon) provides one of the primary examples of urban organization in the Mediterranean world. This multimillenary city bears an exceptional testimony to the beginnings of the Phoenician civilization. The site covers an area of 10 ha located along the coast. The present paper deals with the synthetic mapping of the archaeological site and its environment using remote sensing techniques. Very high-resolution imagery is vital for monitoring any archaeological site in its widest context. In the specific case of Byblos, the comparison of the Orbview 3, Ikonos 2 and Geo-Eye ldigital data indicates that a spatial resolution of about half-a-meter is necessary for archaeological purposes and particularly for mapping the walls and the buildings. The use of Corona archive acquired in 1970 allows mapping the archaeological site and its coastal environment before the Lebanese civil war. This multitemporal approach allows us to evaluate the sensitivity of the archaeological site to external factors, such as the coastal erosion, the cliff degradation, and the urban growth. It also helps to better plan the improvement of the site for touristic purposes. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

For that purpose, six bio-optical algorithms already documented and based on different approaches have been tested over a large in situ data set collected at different seasons and locations along the Vietnamese coast. The 005 algorithm (Gohin, Druon, and Lampert, 2002) presents the best performances and has been selected to assess Chla in the studied region. The notion of optimal bio-optical environment associated with the best performance of 005 has been introduced. For suspended particulate matter concentration, SPM, lower than 100 g.m(-3), and colored dissolved organic matter, a(cdom)(443), lower than 0.5 m(-1), Chla is estimated with an uncertainty of 36% and a bias of 5%. A Chla climatology has been generated and the temporal patterns (seasonal variability, long term trend, and irregular component) have been described using the Census-X-11 time series decomposition method. Three-dimensional hydrodynamical numerical simulations have been used to analyze the spatio-temporal patterns of Chla. The seasonal contribution dominates the variance of the signal, in good relationship with the dynamic of the mixed layer depth as well as with the occurrence of a seasonal upwelling induced by the summer monsoon. The irregular variability of Chla which may reach up to 35% of the total variance in the central part of the Vietnamese coast, can be explained through the surface kinetic energy and its standard deviation which is associated with small scales processes. A long term monotonic trend from about 2 to > 5%.yr(-1) (that is 20 to >50% from 2002 to 2012) have been noticed in different coastal areas where aquaculture activities exhibit a concurrence increase, ranging from 31% to 113% (in production weight) over the same time period. In situ measurements, and especially of nutrients, are however necessary to confirm the link between aquaculture activities and phytoplankton biomass long term evolutions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Predictions from machine learning ensembles: marine bird distribution and density on Canada's Pacific coast	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Increasingly disrupted and altered, the world's oceans are subject to immense and intensifying anthropogenic pressures. Of the biota inhabiting these ecosystems, marine birds are among the most threatened. For conservation efforts targeting marine birds to be effective, quantitative information relating to their at-sea density and distribution is typically a crucial knowledge component. In this study, we generated predictive machine learning ensemble models for 13 marine bird species and 7 groups (representing 24 additional species) in Canada's Pacific coast waters, including several species listed under Canada's Species at Risk Act. Predictive models were based on systematic marine bird line transect survey information collected in spring, summer, and fall on Canada's Pacific coast (2005-2008). Multiple Covariate Distance Sampling (MCDS) was used to estimate marine bird density along transect segments. Spatial and temporal environmental predictors, including remote sensing information, were used in model ensembles, which were constructed using 4 machine learning algorithms in Salford Systems Predictive Modeler v7.0 (SPM7): Random Forests, TreeNet, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, and Classification and Regression Trees. Predictive models were subsequently combined to generate seasonal and overall predictions of areas important to marine birds based on normalized marine bird species or group richness and densities. Our results employ open access data sharing and are intended to better inform marine bird conservation efforts and management planning on Canada's Pacific coast and for broader-scale geographic initiatives across North America and elsewhere.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				FEB 27	2017	566						199	216		10.3354/meps12030								WOS:000396051300015

Coastal morphodynamics of Tupilipalem Coast, Andhra Pradesh, southeast coast of India	CURRENT SCIENCE												Coastal zones are dynamic interfaces of land and water of high ecological diversity and critical economic importance. The boundaries, shape and size of this coast change constantly under the influence of both natural and anthropogenic factors. The study area, Tupilipalem is one of the proposal sites for constructing a major port, to be named Dugarajapatnam Port, along the east coast of Andhra Pradesh, India. We have used multitemporal satellite images of IRS P6 LISS-III and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS data from 2011 to 2015 to delineate changes in Tupilipalem coast. The subsequent short-term lagoon mouth closure and the long-term coastal erosion and accretion rates have been calculated for the periods between 2011 and 2015. Low river inflow, wind, tides, the movement of the waves and littoral currents play a key role in the closure of the lagoon mouth and also for the dynamic activities of erosion and accretion. Moreover, the impact on socio-economy and ecology of the study area during the lagoon mouth closure period has been studied.																	0011-3891					FEB 25	2017	112	4					823	829										WOS:000398128400036

During the bloom, some species produce toxic secondary metabolites (cyanotoxins) that are dangerous for humans and animals. Here, a multidisciplinary strategy for an early detection and constant monitoring is proposed. This strategy combines remote/proximal sensing technology with analytical/biotechnological analyses. To demonstrate the applicability of this strategy, four anthropogenically-impacted sites were selected along the Campania coast of southwestern Italy, in the so called 'Land of Fires'. The sites were observed using satellite and aircraft images during summer, 2015. Algal community composition was determined using spectrophotometric analysis for the detection of the cyanobacterial pigment phycocyanin (PC). Complementary metagenomic analysis revealed the taxonomic presence of cyanobacteria belonging to genera associated with strong eutrophic conditions. Key elements of this strategy are the combination and integration of applying different methodological approaches such as the parallel and combined use of satellite, aerial and in-situ data, the simplified multispectral image indexing and classification for a truly efficient method in detecting early blooms of cyanobacteria. The effectiveness of the strategy has been validated also by the specific taxa of cyanobacteria found in the examined areas that confirm the assumption that cyanobacterial blooms may serve as useful bioindicators of degraded water quality in coastal ecosystems. To our knowledge this is the first time that the presence of cyanobacteria has been observed in water bodies along the Campania coast.

Environmental drivers of decadal change of a mangrove forest in the North coast of the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												Mangrove forests provide important ecosystem services, but are under constant pressure from natural, anthropogenic, and climate change related disturbances. Environmental drivers on mangrove change at large spatial scales, other than sea level rise, are not well understood. In here, we use spatially explicit methods to identify the main environmental drivers of mangrove coverage change over a decade in the landscape of the North coast of the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. A post-supervised classification approach on seven SPOT 5 multispectral satellite images was used to construct thematic maps of mangrove coverage between 2004 and 2014. A linear regression model between the thematic maps was performed to estimate the mangrove coverage change rate per pixel. Climate surfaces for annual maximum, minimum and mean temperature, and annual mean and cumulative precipitation for the region were calculated for the period 1980-2009 using data obtained from the National Meteorological Service. The effect of environmental variables on mangrove coverage change rates was assessed with a boosted generalized additive model (boosted GAM). The lowest and highest overall accuracy obtained for the time series thematic maps were 87.14% (Kappa = 0.78), and 97.5% (Kappa = 0.95), respectively. The most influential environmental variables on mangrove coverage change were annual cumulative precipitation (21%), and annual maximum temperature (9%). Current climate change scenarios for the region predict an increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation, intensifying environmental stress on this ecosystem. Therefore, adequate management strategies are fundamental to help maintain the mangrove forest under changing environmental conditions.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				FEB	2017	21	1					167	175		10.1007/s11852-016-0486-0								WOS:000399030200015

Field surveys were used to assess and complement to the results of the remote sensing (RS)-based analysis. The RS-based biodiversity hotspot (BH) identification process was accomplished in three steps. The lands with native vegetation cover, including the national natural reserve lands, were first selected as the baseline BHs (BBHs). Then, after assigning resistance coefficients to each land use, the least accumulative cost (LAC) of the BBHs was calculated by distance analysis, while the normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) from the Landsat Thematic Mapper was reclassified into 20 grades based on the Euclidean distance to the main anthropogenic sources. Finally, the RS-based BH identification was realized through the logistic calculation of LAC less than a series of thresholds and NDVI more than 10. While the field survey-based BH identification was through the logistic calculation between HM potential ecological risks of low to moderate and BHs acquired by NDVI-based integrated assessments. The results proved that RS-based analysis could be an important surrogate for necessary field surveys to manage BHs along coasts.

Satellite remote sensing can be a useful tool for the management of such types of marine hazards, namely oil spills, mainly owing to the synoptic view and the good trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution, depending on the specific platform/sensor system used. In this paper, an innovative satellite-based technique for oil spill detection, based on the general robust satellite technique (RST) approach, is presented. It exploits the multi-temporal analysis of data acquired in the visible channels of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Aqua satellite in order to automatically and quickly detect the presence of oil spills on the sea surface, with an attempt to minimize "false detections" caused by spurious effects associated with, for instance, cloud edges, sun/satellite geometries, sea currents, etc. The oil spill event that occurred in June 2007 off the south coast of Cyprus in the Mediterranean Sea has been considered as a test case. The resulting data, the reliability of which has been evaluated by both carrying out a confutation analysis and comparing them with those provided by the application of another independent MODIS-based method, showcase the potential of RST in identifying the presence of oil with a high level of accuracy.

J	Su, LH; Gibeaut, J				Su, Lihong; Gibeaut, James			Using UAS Hyperspatial RGB Imagery for Identifying Beach Zones along the South Texas Coast	REMOTE SENSING												Shoreline information is fundamental for understanding coastal dynamics and for implementing environmental policy. The analysis of shoreline variability usually uses a group of shoreline indicators visibly discernible in coastal imagery, such as the seaward vegetation line, wet beach/dry beach line, and instantaneous water line. These indicators partition a beach into four zones: vegetated land, dry sand or debris, wet sand, and water. Unmanned aircraft system (UAS) remote sensing that can acquire imagery with sub-decimeter pixel size provides opportunities to map these four beach zones. This paper attempts to delineate four beach zones based on UAS hyperspatial RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) imagery, namely imagery of sub-decimeter pixel size, and feature textures. Besides the RGB images, this paper also uses USGS (the United States Geological Survey) Munsell HSV (Hue, Saturation, and Value) and CIELUV (the CIE 1976 ( L*, u*, v*) color space) images transformed from an RGB image. The four beach zones are identified based on the Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) textures. Experiments were conducted with South Padre Island photos acquired by a Nikon D80 camera mounted on the US-16 UAS during March 2014. The results show that USGS Munsell hue can separate land and water reliably. GLCM and LBP textures can slightly improve classification accuracies by both unsupervised and supervised classification techniques. The experiments also indicate that we could reach acceptable results on different photos while using training data from another photo for site-specific UAS remote sensing. The findings imply that parallel processing of classification is feasible.

J	Bulgarelli, B; Kiselev, V; Zibordi, G				Bulgarelli, Barbara; Kiselev, Viatcheslav; Zibordi, Giuseppe			Adjacency effects in satellite radiometric products from coastal waters: a theoretical analysis for the northern Adriatic Sea	APPLIED OPTICS												Biases induced by land perturbations in satellite-derived water-leaving radiance are theoretically estimated for typical observation conditions in a coastal area of the northern Adriatic Sea hosting the Aqua Alta Oceanographic Tower (AAOT) validation site. Two different correction procedures are considered: not deriving (AC-1) or alternatively deriving (AC-2) the atmospheric properties from the remote sensing data. In both cases, biases due to adjacency effects largely increase by approaching the coast and with the satellite viewing angle. Conversely, the seasonal and spectral dependence of biases significantly differ between AC-1 and AC-2 schemes. For AC-1 schemes average biases are within +/- 5% throughout the transect at yellow-green wavelengths, but at the coast they can reach -21% and 34% at 412 and 670 nm, respectively, and exceed 100% at 865 nm. For AC-2 schemes, adjacency effects at those wavelengths from which atmospheric properties are inferred add significant perturbations. For the specific case of a correction scheme determining the atmospheric properties from the near-infrared region and by adopting a power-law spectral extrapolation of adjacency perturbations on the derived atmospheric radiance, average biases become all negative with values up to -60% and -74% at 412 and 670 nm at the coast, respectively. The seasonal trend of estimated biases at the AAOT is consistent with intra-annual variation of biases from match ups between insitu and satellite products derived with SeaDAS from SeaWiFS and MODIS data. Nevertheless, estimated biases at blue wavelengths exceed systematic differences determined from match-up analysis. This may be explained by uncertainties and approximations in the simulation procedure, and by mechanisms of compensation introduced by the turbid water correction algorithm implemented in SeaDAS.

Tagged turtles were incidentally captured by recreational fishermen and rehabilitated at the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Gulfport, Mississippi. The average size of the core habitat areas (50% KDE (kernel density estimation)) was 1660.2km(2)3438.2 SD. Turtles displayed strong intra- and inter-annual site fidelity to the Mississippi Sound during the spring, summer, and autumn months. During the winter months, most turtles, probably influenced by water temperatures, migrated to nearshore waters of Louisiana on either side of the Mississippi River Delta. However, other migration strategies were also observed. Overall, these data indicate that the Mississippi Sound is an important developmental habitat for this critically endangered species. In addition, their wintering grounds in Louisiana are utilized by adult Kemp's ridleys and other sea turtle species as foraging grounds and migratory corridors. The high use of these areas by sea turtle populations increases the potential for negative impacts from anthropogenic disturbances (e.g. shrimp trawling, oil production, hypoxia) that occur there.

J	Nieto, K; Melin, F				Nieto, Karen; Melin, Frederic			Variability of chlorophyll-a concentration in the Gulf of Guinea and its relation to physical oceanographic variables	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The Gulf of Guinea represents a wide tract of the African coast with complex and rich coastal ecosystems undergoing various pressures. The seasonal variations of chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla) along the Gulf of Guinea (GoG) and their relations with physical oceanographic variables were analyzed using satellite observations covering the period 2002-2012. The effects of sea surface temperature (SST), sea level anomalies (SLA), winds, geostrophic currents, eddy kinetic energy (EKE), mesoscale eddies and fronts were considered on a monthly time scale. The analysis for each unit area was carried out on a chlorophyll index (IChla) computed as the product of the mean distance from the coast to the eutrophic threshold (1 mg m(-3) isoline) and the average Chla in the eutrophic area. The study, based on satellite derived Chla, was allowed by the unprecedented coverage given by the products distributed by the ESA Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC_CCI) resulting from the merging of data from several satellite missions. The physical variables served as potential predictors in a statistical Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) model. To account for the heterogeneous nature of the CoG, the analysis was conducted on eight systems that made up a partition of the whole region defined on the basis of the BRT model results and climatological properties. The western-most domain, from Guinea-Bissau to Sierra Leone, was associated with upwelling properties in boreal winter and appeared to share some characteristics with the overall Northwest African upwelling system. The region of Ivory Coast and Ghana also had upwelling properties but the main upwelling season was in boreal summer. In general upwelling conditions with cold SST, negative SLA, fairly strong frontal activity, and moderate winds, appeared as the environmental window most favorable to high IChia values. For these systems, the BRT model fitted the IChla data well with a percentage of explained total deviance D-2 between 70% and 91% when using only physical oceanographic variables. Finally, the systems associated with the coasts of Nigeria to Gabon showed some mixed properties, with D-2 values of 54-60%. Among these systems, a common feature seemed to be the importance of river discharge to explain IChia variations. Where possible (for the Niger River in the Nigeria system), the addition of river data as predictor in the BRT model resulted in a significant increase of D-2 to 75%. Further progress is needed to understand the observed relationships and to predict how they can evolve in the face of climate change. (C) 2016 The Authors.

J	Wang, Y; Li, GD				Wang, Yan; Li, Guangdong			Mapping urban CO2 emissions using DMSP/OLS 'city lights' satellite data in China	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A												China, the world's top CO2 emitter, is faced with pressure of energy-saving emission reduction. In the 2015 Paris Climate Conference (COP21), China announced its plan, aiming to cut down CO2 emissions by 60%-65% per unit of GDP in comparison to 2005's level by 2030. To achieve this ambitious goal, reliable national, provincial, and city-level statistics are fundamental for multi-scale mitigation policy-makings as well as for the allocation of responsibilities among different administrative units. However, China implemented a top-down energy statistical system. The National Bureau of Statistics only publishes annually both national and provincial energy statistics. Only part of cities released their statistics, which results in missing data in city-level energy statistics. This also affects data transparency and accuracy of energy and CO2 emission statistics, and as a result, increases difficulty in allocation of CO2 emission reduction responsibilities. In order to fill this lacuna, we employed a standardized remote sensing inversion approach for estimating China's city-level CO2 emissions from energy consumptions by integrating DMSP/OLS 'city lights' satellite data and statistical data. The end product is a map of city-level CO2 emissions in China. The most topping CO2 emitters are located in the major urban agglomerations along the more economically developed eastern coast (e.g. Yangtze River Delta, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Shandong Peninsula, and Pearl River Delta). Other regions with high CO2 emissions are Shanxi and Henan in Central China, as well as the Chengdu-Chongqing and Shaanxi in West China. Regions with low CO2 emissions are western China, and most of Central China and South China.																	0308-518X	1472-3409				FEB	2017	49	2					248	251		10.1177/0308518X16656374								WOS:000396922700002

To meet these new challenges, spill response plans need to be upgraded. An important component of such a plan would be models able to simulate the behaviour of oil in terms of trajectories and spatial distribution, if accidentally released, in deep water. All these models need to be calibrated with independent observations. The aim of the present paper is to demonstrate that significant support to oil slick monitoring can be obtained by the synergistic use of oil drift models and remote sensing observations. Based on transport properties and weathering processes, oil drift models can indeed predict the fate of spilled oil under the action of water current velocity and wind in terms of oil position, concentration and thickness distribution. The oil spill event that occurred on 31 May 2003 in the Baltic Sea offshore the Swedish and Danish coasts is considered a case study with the aim of producing three-dimensional models of sea circulation and oil contaminant transport. The High-Resolution Limited Area Model (HIRLAM) is used for atmospheric forcing. The results of the numerical modelling of current speed and water surface elevation data are validated by measurements carried out in Kalmarsund, Simrishamn and Kungsholmsfort stations over a period of 18 days and 17 h. The oil spill model uses the current field obtained from a circulation model. Near-infrared (NIR) satellite images were compared with numerical simulations. The simulation was able to predict both the oil spill trajectories of the observed slick and thickness distribution. Therefore, this work shows how oil drift modelling and remotely sensed data can provide the right synergy to reproduce the timing and transport of the oil and to get reliable estimates of thicknesses of spilled oil to prepare an emergency plan and to assess the magnitude of risk involved in case of oil spills due to disaster.

J	Olaofe, ZO				Olaofe, Z. O.			Modeling and sensitivity of the seasonal ocean winds to local effects at west and south coasts of South Africa	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS												Accurate wind speed and power forecasts of wind farm production are essential in planning of economic load dispatch and for a reliable transmission system operation. In this paper, the sensitivity of mesoscale simulated winds to the local effects in the near coasts of South Africa is examined. Three ocean wind field simulations performed in the advanced weather research and forecasting, WRF, model at a 3 km grid spatial resolution were assessed by accounting for how the mesoscale model description of topography impacts the surface wind speed and direction. Based on the Monin Obukhov similarity theory (MOST) with satellite wind retrieval from the remote sensing systems, the model performance in seasonal wind simulations at 50 m height asl for the period of 5 years (January 2007 to December 2011) is evaluated. The WRF modeled wind after postprocessing method compared well with the satellite observed wind speed across the surface fields with correlation coefficient and monthly mean error values ranging from 0.633 to 0.931; and -0.0029 to 0.5070 m/s, respectively, in all the seasons. Results also revealed that the west coast has higher wind speed and power potential in summer and spring months while the south coast in the winter months recorded the highest potential. The findings in these studied regions are essential for bias correction of the WRF modeling over non-homogenous ocean surface wind field. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Morphometric analysis of wadi Khumal basin, western coast of Saudi Arabia, using remote sensing and GIS techniques	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												Wadi Khumal, a triangular drainage system basin located at the Radwa Mountains of the south Red Sea, Saudi Arabia, has been chosen to assess certain morphometric parameters that influence water supply for basin hydrology. Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) information was used to produce Digital Elevation Model (DEM), aspect network, and descent graphs. Geographic Information System (GIS) is utilized for the assessment of linear, areal, and relief landmarks of morphometric aspects. Morphometric analysis of the drainage system network and the Khumal basin showed it has fifth-order wadi network with an elongated shape and possesses dendritic to sub-dendritic drainage pattern. These pattern points in the Khumal basin have similarity of lithology, moderate to steep slope, and an effective structural system. The various values of bifurcation ratios (Rb) versus low form factor results with circularity ratio (R-c) and elongation ratio (Re) highly suggested a geologically higher permeability and a structurally planned drainage system through intermediate to low drainage density (D-d), moderate stream frequency (Fs); moderately coarse drainage texture (Rt) with high relief indicates tectonic activity with high slope terrain made from loose materials with good permeability efficient for the, recharging of ground water. The low value of asymmetrical factor (AF) showed great distortion quotient of the lithology in all sub basins proving the great and broad tectonic influence in the Khumal basin. A high relief ratio (Rh) of 0.028, with low zigzag path and a highly steep ridge during the Khumal basin indicated a continuation of youth of the basin with continuously local uplifting. A very low value Rt of 0.646 versus a very low Fs of 0.177 and a Dd of 556.33 m/km(2) demonstrated that the basin was having extremely resistant rocks in a very high relief ground which indicates late tectonic activity.

REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Chlorophyll-a (Chl a) is a key parameter for the assessment of water quality in coastal and shelf environments. The availability of satellite ocean colour offers the potential of monitoring these regions at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales, as long as a high level of accuracy can be achieved. To use satellite derived Chl a to monitor these environments, it is imperative that rigorous accuracy assessments are undertaken to select the most accurate ocean colour algorithm(s). To this end, the accuracy of a range of ocean colour Chl a algorithms for use with Medium Imaging Resolution Spectrometer (MERIS) Level 2 (L2) Remote Sensing Reflectance (R-rs), using two different atmospheric correction (AC) processors (COASTCOLOUR and MERIS Ground Segment processor version 8.0 - MEGS8.0), were assessed in North West European waters. A total of 594 measurements of R-rs(lambda) and/or Chl a were made in the North Sea, Mediterranean Sea, along the Portuguese Coast English Channel and Celtic Sea between June 2001 and March 2012, where Chl a varied from 0.2 to 35 mg m(-3). The following algorithms were compared: MERIS Case 1 water Chl a algorithm OC4Me, the MERIS Case 2 algorithm Algal Pigment 2 (AP2), the MODIS-Aqua Case 1 Chl a algorithm OC3 adapted for MERIS (OC3Me), the MODIS-Aqua Garver-Siegel-Maritorena algorithm (GSM) adapted for MERIS and the Gohin et al. (2002) algorithm for MERIS (005Me). For both COASTCOLOUR and MEGS8.0 processors, OC5Me was the most accurate Chl a algorithm, which was within similar to 25% of in situ values in these coastal and shelf waters. The uncertainty in MEGS8.0 R(rs)4442) (similar to 17%) was slightly higher compared to COASTCOLOUR (similar to 12%) from 0.3 to 7 mg m(-3) Chl a, but for R-rs(560)the uncertainty was lower for MEGS8.0 (similar to 10%) compared to COASTCOLOUR (similar to 13%), which meant that MEGS8.0 Chl a was more accurate than COASTCOLOUR for all of the Chl a algorithms tested. Compared to 005Me, OC4Me tended to over-estimate Chl a, which was caused by non-algal SPM especially at values >14 g M-3. GSM also over-estimated Chl a, which was caused by variations in absorption coefficient of coloured dissolved organic matter at 442 nm (a(CDOM)(442)). AP2 consistently under-estimated Chl a, especially when non-algal SPM was >4 g m(-3). (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

With recorded wave frequency Omega and wavenumber k (and hence wave phase speed c = Omega/k), bed elevation z(b) can be derived using a model that relates Omega and k to water depth. However, the accuracy of z(b) as a function of the sensor and the method of Omega - k retrieval is not well known, especially not under low-period waves. Here, we assess the accuracy of z(b), based on two sensors with their own method of phase speed retrieval, in a dynamic, kilometer-scale environment (Sand Engine, The Netherlands). Bias in z(b) is systematic. A fast Fourier transform (FFT) method on X-band radar imagery produced z(b) too shallow by 1.0 m for -15 m <= z(b) <= -9 m, and too deep by 2.3 m for z(b) >= -6 m. A cross-spectral method on optical video imagery produced z(b) too shallow by 0.59 m for -10 m <= z(b) <= -5 m, and too deep by 0.92 m for z(b) >= -1 m. Intermediate depths had negligible bias, -0.02 m for the radar-FFT approach and -0.01 m for the video-CS approach. The collapse of the FFT method in shallow water may be explained by the inhomogeneity of the wave field in the 960 m x 960 m analysis windows. A shoreward limit of the FFT method is proposed that depends on z(b) in the analysis windows.

J	Pu, R; Bell, S				Pu, Ruiliang; Bell, Susan			Mapping seagrass coverage and spatial patterns with high spatial resolution IKONOS imagery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Seagrass habitats in subtidal coastal waters provide a variety of ecosystem functions and services and there is an increasing need to acquire information on spatial and temporal dynamics of this resource. Here, we explored the capability of IKONOS (IKO) data of high resolution (4m) for mapping seagrass cover [submerged aquatic vegetation (%SAV) cover] along the mid-western coast of Florida, USA. We also compared seagrass maps produced with IKO data with that obtained using the Landsat TM sensor with lower resolution (30m). Both IKO and TM data, collected in October 2009, were preprocessed to calculate water depth invariant bands to normalize the effect of varying depth on bottom spectra recorded by the two satellite sensors and further the textural information was extracted from IKO data. Our results demonstrate that the high resolution IKO sensor produced a higher accuracy than the TM sensor in a three-class % SAV cover classification. Of note is that the OA of %SAV cover mapping at our study area created with IKO data was 5-20% higher than that from other studies published. We also examined the spatial distribution of seagrass over a spatial range of 4-240 m using the Ripley's K function [L(d)] and IKO data that represented four different grain sizes [4 m (one IKO pixel), 8 m (2 x 2 IKO pixels), 12 m (3 x 3 IKO pixels), and 16 m (4 x 4 IKO pixels)] from moderate-dense seagrass cover along a set of six transects. The Ripley's K metric repeatedly indicated that seagrass cover representing 4m x 4m pixels displayed a dispersed (or slightly dispersed) pattern over distances of <4-8 m, and a random or slightly clustered pattern of cover over 9-240m. The spatial pattern of seagrass cover created with the three additional grain sizes (i.e., 2 x 24m IKO pixels, 3 x 34m IKO pixels, and 4 x 4m IKO pixels) show a dispersed (or slightly dispersed) pattern across 4-32 m and a random or slightly clustered pattern across 33-240m. Given the first report on using satellite observations to quantify seagrass spatial patterns at a spatial scale from 4m to 240m, our novel analyses of moderate-dense SAV cover utilizing Ripley's K function illustrate how data obtained from the IKO sensor revealed seagrass spatial information that would be undetected by the TM sensor with a 30 m pixel size. Use of the seagrass classification scheme here, along with data from the IKO sensor with enhanced resolution, offers an opportunity to synoptically record seagrass cover dynamics at both small and large spatial scales.(C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Organic matter from benthic foraminifera (Ammonia beccarii) shells by FT-IR spectroscopy: A study on Tupilipalem, South east coast of India	METHODSX												Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to study the variations in organic matters of benthic foraminifera (Ammonia beccarii) from four samples collected from beach environments from brackish environments along Tupilipalem coast (South east coast of India). Common absorption bands were observed as peaks in the range of 3600-3400 cm(-1), 3000-2850 cm(-1), 1750-1740 cm(-1), 1640-1600 cm(-1), 1450-1350 cm(-1), 885-870 cm(-1) and 725-675 cm(-1) in all the shells of Ammonia beccarii. The FTIR spectrum of station-1 represents the presence of alkanes (CH3) and alkyl halide (C-F stretching) with absorptions at the range 1385-1255 and 1350-1150 cm(-1) were observed and ether (C-O stretching) absorption band was observed at stations 1 and 3 with wavenumber of 1115 cm(-1) and 1117 cm(-1) respectively. Alkynes C-H bend was observed at station-1 with the wavenumber of 667.43 cm(-1). The shifting of peak positions in all the samples is could be due to presence of organic matter in the samples. Satellite remote sensing and field observation data revealed that the river mouth at Tupilipalem coast was closed by a sand bar. Consequentially, this waterbody may affect the species diversity. Positions of the sampling locations were identified using a hand-held Garmin Global Positioning System (GPS). Foraminifera from the sediment were obtained using a mixture of Bromoform and Acetone. The functional groups present in the benthic foraminifera shells were recorded in the spectral range of 4000400 cm(-1) using an FT-IR Spectrophotometer. (c) 2017 The Author(s).

The coast of water bodies are attractive spaces for human activities since the beginning of human history. Recently the uses of coastal areas are intensified due to the scenic value of water bodies. Viewshed analysis is the research of the relationships between a point data set and a single point. The visibility of water bodies which can be calculated spatially using viewshed analysis is becoming increasingly a common factor for land use/selection. As a result of this, viewshed analysis facilitates landscape planning in an appropriate way by considering scenic value of landscape features such as, water bodies. Viewshed analysis of Seyhan Dam Lake in Adana City with the support of remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) provided accurate results and saved time, labour and cost. The study area is called Menekse district in Adana located at the Eastern Mediterranean coast of Turkey and undergoing rapid population and urbanization due to agricultural capacity and industrialization which make this area ideal test-bed site for visibility analysis. This area is under pressure of urbanisation since introduction of city development plan in 2008. In this regard the visibility of Seyhan Dam Lake was modelled for Menekse district to find out the effect of scenic value on land use preference. The outputs of this study will maintain more effective city development plans.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	12A					145	153										WOS:000419539900019

Estimation of Air-Sea CO2 Exchange and Decadal Change of Surface Water fCO(2) in a Shallow Continental Shelf Using in Situ and Remote Sensing Data During Winter	ENVIRONMENT AND EARTH OBSERVATION: CASE STUDIES IN INDIA	Springer Remote Sensing Photogrammetry											The air-sea CO2 exchange (fCO(2)) was estimated in the outer estuary to offshore transition zone of the northern Bay of Bengal using in situ measurements and remote sensing data obtained from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR). The in situ measurements were done during winter months (December, January and February) of the year 2011-12. Sea surface CO2 fugacity (fCO(2)), sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a were measured in situ to develop an empirical relationship with fCO(2) but only the SST showed a significant correlation (r(2) = 0.55, n = 64, p < 0.05). This relationship was used to assess fCO(2) (water) and its temporal change in decadal scale from the year 2002-2003 to 2011-2012 of the winter months using remotely sensed SST data. The study area acted as a mild sink for atmospheric CO2 at the mean rate of -28 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) (MODIS derived) to -40 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) (AVHRR derived). An overall winter-to-winter increasing trend of fCO(2) was observed in the last decade which is accompanied by a similar decrease in the chlorophyll-a concentrations.																	2198-0721	2198-073X	978-3-319-46010-9; 978-3-319-46008-6				2017							123	135		10.1007/978-3-319-46010-9_9	10.1007/978-3-319-46010-9							WOS:000419229200011

The semi-analytical or empirical algorithms that work well in Case 1 waters encounter many problems in offshore areas where the water is often optically complex and presents difficulties for atmospheric correction. Zhejiang is one of the most developed provinces in eastern China, and its adjacent seas have been greatly affected by recent rapid economic development. Various islands and semi-closed bays along the Zhejiang coast promote the formation of muddy tidal flats. Moreover, large quantities of terrestrial substances coming down with the Yangtze River and other local rivers also have a great impact on the coastal waters of the province. MODIS, VIIRS and GOCI are three commonly used ocean color sensors covering the East China Sea. Several ocean color products such as remote-sensing reflectance (R) and the concentrations of chlorophyll a (Chl-a) and total suspended matter (TSM) of the above three sensors on the Zhejiang coast have been evaluated. Cloud-free satellite images with synchronous field measurements taken between 2012 and 2015 were used for comparison. It is shown that there is a good correlation between the MODIS and GOCI spectral data, while some outliers were found in the VIIRS images. The low signal-to-noise ratio at short wavelengths in highly turbid waters also reduced the correlation between different sensors. In addition, it was possible to obtain more valid data with GOCI in shallow waters because of the use of an appropriate atmospheric correction algorithm. The standard Chl-a and TSM products of the three satellites were also evaluated, and it was found that the Chl-a and TSM concentrations calculated by the OC3 G and Case 2 algorithms, respectively, were more suitable for use in the study area. Moreover, GOCI has been proved to be effective for monitoring the diurnal dynamics in coastal waters, and the concentration of TSM had a good negative correlation with water level. Overall, compared with MODIS and VIIRS, GOCI is more effective for monitoring the fine changes and diurnal dynamics in the seas adjacent to Zhejiang Province.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-1309-6; 978-1-5106-1308-9				2017	10422								UNSP 104221K	10.1117/12.2278041								WOS:000418795400037

While matchups are usually good in open ocean waters, significant discrepancies are observed in coastal areas which are primarily due to the more complex atmospheres near the coast and therefore less accurate atmospheric correction. Satellite-derived water leaving radiances are determined by applying atmospheric correction procedures which include assumptions about the characteristics of atmospheric aerosols. At sea level, SeaPRISM makes direct measurements of nLw from the ocean, as well as observations of sky from which aerosol parameters such as aerosol optical thickness, single scattering albedo, fraction of fine and coarse aerosols, and others are determined. Using NASA SeaDAS software for OC satellite data processing, characteristics of aerosols in atmospheric correction models for VIIRS sensor are explicitly retrieved and compared with the ones from AERONET-OC data, primarily in terms of aerosol optical depth (AOD), thus characterizing the validity of the aerosol models and evaluating possible errors and reasons for discrepancies. Comparisons are presented for the coastal site at CCNY's Long Island Sound Coastal Observatory (LISCO) and a less coastal WaveCIS Gulf of Mexico' AERONET-OC site with variable water and atmospheric conditions.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-1309-6; 978-1-5106-1308-9				2017	10422								UNSP 104220H	10.1117/12.2279150								WOS:000418795400011

Vessel and oil spill early detection using COSMO satellite imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF THE OCEAN, SEA ICE, COASTAL WATERS, AND LARGE WATER REGIONS 2017	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Remote Sensing of the Ocean, Sea Ice, Coastal Waters, and Large Water Regions	SEP 11-12, 2017	Warsaw, POLAND	SPIE				Oil spillage is one of the most common sources of environmental damage in places where coastal wild life is found in natural reservoirs. This is especially the case in the Patagonian coast, with a littoral more than 5000 km long and a surface above a million and half square km. In addition, furtive fishery activities in Argentine waters are depleting the food supplies of several species, altering the ecological equilibrium. For this reason, early oil spills and vessel detection is an imperative surveillance task for environmental and governmental authorities. However, given the huge geographical extension, human assisted monitoring is unfeasible, and therefore real time remote sensing technologies are the only operative and economically feasible solution. In this work we describe the theoretical foundations and implementation details of a system specifically designed to take advantage of the SAR imagery delivered by two satellite constellations (the SAOCOM mission, developed by the Argentine Space Agency, and the COSMO mission, developed by the Italian Space Agency), to provide real-time detection of vessels and oil spills. The core of the system is based on pattern recognition over a statistical characterization of the texture patterns arising in the positive and negative conditions (i.e., vessel, oil, or plain sea surfaces). Training patterns were collected from a large number of previously reported contacts tagged by experts in the National Commission on Space Activities (CONAE). The resulting system performs well above the sensitivity and specificity of other avalilable systems.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-1309-6; 978-1-5106-1308-9				2017	10422								UNSP 1042203	10.1117/12.2279545								WOS:000418795400002

Oil spill characterization thanks to optical airborne imagery during the NOFO campaign 2015	REMOTE SENSING OF THE OCEAN, SEA ICE, COASTAL WATERS, AND LARGE WATER REGIONS 2017	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Remote Sensing of the Ocean, Sea Ice, Coastal Waters, and Large Water Regions	SEP 11-12, 2017	Warsaw, POLAND	SPIE				One of the objectives of the NAOMI (New Advanced Observation Method Integration) research project, fruit of a partnership between Total and ONERA, is to work on the detection, the quantification and the characterization of offshore hydrocarbon at the sea surface using airborne remote sensing. In this framework, work has been done to characterize the spectral signature of hydrocarbons in lab in order to build a database of oil spectral signatures. The main objective of this database is to provide spectral libraries for data processing algorithms to be applied to airborne VNIRSWIR hyperspectral images. A campaign run by the NOFO institute (Norwegian Clean Seas Association for Operating Companies) took place in 2015 to test anti-pollution equipment. During this campaign, several hydrocarbon products, including an oil emulsion, were released into the sea, off the Norwegian coast. The NOFO team allowed the NAOMI project to acquire data over the resulting oil slicks using the SETHI system, which is an airborne remote sensing imaging system developed by ONERA. SETHI integrates a new generation of optoelectronic and radar payloads and can operate over a wide range of frequency bands. SETHI is a pod-based system operating onboard a Falcon 20 Dassault aircraft, which is owned by AvDEF. For these experiments, imaging sensors were constituted by 2 synthetic aperture radar (SAR), working at X and L bands in a full polarimetric mode (HH, HV, VH, VV) and 2 HySpex hyperspectral cameras working in the VNIR (0,4 to 1 mu m) and SWIR (1 to 2,5 mu m) spectral ranges. A sample of the oil emulsion that was used during the campaign was sent to our laboratory for analysis. Measurements of its transmission and of its reflectance in the VNIR and SWIR spectral domains have been performed at ONERA with a Perkin Elmer spectroradiometer and a spectrogoniometer. Several samples of the oil emulsion were prepared in order to measure spectral variations according to oil thickness, illumination angle and aging. These measurements have been used to build spectral libraries. Spectral matching techniques, relying on these libraries have been applied to the airborne hyperspectral acquisitions. These data processing approaches enable to characterize the oil emulsion by estimating the properties taken into account to build the spectral library, thus going further than unsupervised spectral indices that are able to detect the presence of oil. The paper will describe the airborne hyperspectral data, the measurements performed in the laboratory, and the processing of the optical images with spectral indices for oil detection and with spectral matching techniques for oil characterization. Furthermore, the issue of mixed oil-water pixels in the hyperspectral images due to limited spatial resolution will be addressed by estimating the areal fraction of each.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-1309-6; 978-1-5106-1308-9				2017	10422								UNSP 1042201	10.1117/12.2278336								WOS:000418795400012

The Oscar II coast area north-eastern Graham Land, Antarctic Peninsula (AP) was selected in this study to conduct a satellite-based remote sensing mapping technique. It is an inaccessible region due to the remoteness of many rock exposures and the necessity to travel over sever mountainous and glacier-cover terrains for geological field mapping and sample collection. Fractional abundance of alteration minerals such as muscovite, kaolinite, illite, montmorillonite, epidote, chlorite and biotite were identified in alteration zones using CEM, OSP and ACE algorithms in poorly mapped and unmapped zones at district scale for the Oscar II coast area. The results of this investigation demonstrated the applicability of ASTER shortwave infrared spectral data for lithological and alteration mineral mapping in poorly exposed lithologies and inaccessible regions, particularly using the image processing algorithms that are capable to detect sub-pixel targets in the remotely sensed images, where no prior information is available.																	1742-6588						2017	852								UNSP 012022	10.1088/1742-6596/852/1/012022								WOS:000417438600022

Anomaly pixels in the ICA image maps related to spectral features of Al-O-H, Fe, Mg-O-H and CO3 groups were detected using SWIR datasets of ASTER. ICA method provided image maps of alteration mineral assemblages and discriminate lithological units with little available geological data for poorly mapped regions and/ or without prior geological information for unmapped regions in northern and southern sectors of Oscar II coast area, Graham Land.

We calculated the changes in glacier area between 1975 and 2015 and the number of glacial lakes between 1985 and 2015 using Landsat images. Glacier shrinkage in our study region was most likely to have caused the expansion of numerous glacial lakes in recent decades. In contrast to observed glacier fluctuations in the western cordilleras of the tropical Andes, continuous glacier shrinkage was observed in the eastern cordilleras of Peru and Bolivia. The estimated glacier mean area loss between 1975 and 2015 in the Cordillera Apolobamba and the Cordillera Carabaya was about 51% and 79%, respectively. Glaciers situated below 5000 m a.s.l. nearly disappeared (93% and 95.5% in the cordilleras Apolobamba and Carabaya, respectively) during this period, but glaciers above 5500 m a.s.l. were relatively stable (13.5% and 31% in Apolobamba and Carabaya, respectively). Further on, glacier area loss by aspect revealed that glaciers oriented towards the Amazon Basin were retreating faster (74.5% and 86%, respectively) than those oriented towards the Pacific coast (40% and 68%, respectively). We observed the formation of 206 new glacial lakes between 1985 and 2015 in these two mountain ranges with an increase in the total area of 3.8 km(2), which is a significant growth in just 30 yr.

ADWICE identifies atmospheric regions containing supercooled liquid water where aircraft icing can occur. Running operationally at DWD since 2002, ADWICE is used at the German Advisory Centres for Aviation (Luftfahrtberatungszentrale) to support pilots in route planning by warning of hazardous in-flight icing conditions. The model domain covers Europe and the Mediterranean coast of North Africa with a horizontal grid spacing of about 7 km and 30 vertical hybrid levels. The warning system consists of two algorithms. Based on output data of the operational numerical weather prediction model COSMO-EU (Consortium of Small-Scale Modelling - Europe), the Prognostic Icing Algorithm (PIA) allows the forecast of areas with an icing hazard. The Diagnostic Icing Algorithm (DIA) realises a fusion of forecast, observational and remote sensing data such as satellite data to describe the current icing hazard. Both algorithms create a three-dimensional icing product containing information about the likely icing scenario and its associated icing intensity. This paper describes the current structure of ADWICE, its output, as well as its diagnosis and forecast skill. For verification, the output of the two algorithms was compared with pilot observations over Europe. The results show satisfactory values for the probability of detection and the volume efficiency.																	0941-2948	1610-1227					2017	26	4					441	455		10.1127/metz/2017/0756								WOS:000416405200008

A synthetic index of bimodality has been computed at pixel scale before and after 1994. No class in Cote d'Ivoire shows a change from a forest bimodal character to a savanna unimodal character. On the other hand, the only unimodal class in the entire series shows a minute inflexion toward a bimodal rhythm. In Benin, one notes greater stability between the two periods. The "regreening" that was observed in Sahel can be associated with a similar, yet not strongly marked, phenomenon in the Sudanian-Guinean transition.																	2279-7254						2017	50	1					588	600		10.1080/22797254.2017.1377051								WOS:000416070900001

The study of coastal system processes and coastal zone environmental management requires the information about coastlines and their changes. In this study, a methodology that extracts coastline efficiently by processing high-resolution orthophotos derived by UAV is presented. The photogrammetric UAV-based remote sensing approach reveals high-resolution digital surface models of coast. These models were derived from accurate and dense 3D point clouds, which are used for the 3D representation of the coast and can be used for calculating the erosion events of the study area. The methodology examines the capabilities of the integration of UAV data acquisition, GIS, remote sensing, and 3D visualization. Method applied in the Eressos beach, a very touristic sandy beach with large face, on Lesvos Island, Greece. Eressos beach is threatened by erosion which is clearly shown in the results. In addition, several features representing previous sea states were successfully determined in orthophoto map. The difference between the two acquisitions revealed specific areas with erosion and sand movement. Finally, the composition of 3D representation and the orthophoto map exposed vectors representing new beach characteristics e.g. erosion crests, berm zones and sand dunes. Vectors accuracy depends on the beach complexity. In conclusion, UAV's data reveal such information in spatial resolution which permits the study of coast changes with extreme confident. Applications include coast management, port installations and coastal energy projects.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	9					5564	5571										WOS:000409399700008						
J	Nayak, S				Nayak, Shailesh			Coastal zone management in India - present status and future needs	GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE												The coastal zone is a region where land, ocean and atmosphere interact and hence it is dynamic in nature. India has a long coastline which was not adequately monitored until the advent of the satellite remote sensing era in the 70s. India has a very robust remote sensing program that the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) series of satellites were effectively used to monitor coastal habitats, landforms, shoreline, water quality, etc., and changes were identified during the last 40 years. The classification system for coastal habitats and the classification and geometric accuracies of products were standardized. Detailed information for mangroves communities and characteristics of coral reefs were generated. The high and low tide lines were delineated seamlessly for the entire coastline using satellite data. All these data were organized in a GIS and the coastal database for the entire country was created. Impacts of various hazards on such as cyclones, tsunami and sea level changes on coastal habitats were documented. Based on topography, shoreline changes and tides, coastal multi-hazard vulnerability maps were characterized by employing the elevation data derived from satellite data and were prepared for the coastline of India. The information on ocean color and sea surface temperature was used to generate potential fishery advisories, which are provided daily to fishermen. The coastal database was utilized effectively to identify coastal regulation zones, marine protected areas, vulnerable zones, etc. Various services for tsunami, fishery and coral reef bleaching were generated for societal benefits. It is planned to develop models for the coastal zone, so that impeding dangers and likely changes in the coastal zone can be predicted and suitable actions can be undertaken. It is necessary to integrate socio-economic data with the knowledge database of coastal zone to understand the impact of anthropogenic activities and the changing climate on the coastal zone.																	1009-5020	1993-5153					2017	20	2			SI		174	183		10.1080/10095020.2017.1333715								WOS:000409348200011

The manipulation of these models resulted in three maps named 'Physical Model', 'Vegetation Density' and "Wetness Index" that were combined with an existing landslide susceptibility map known as 'SLIDO'. These maps served as input to a Bayesian Network capable of assessing the state of risk of a slope in "Prognosis" and determining required conditions to achieve a prescribed risk condition in "Diagnosis".

A fundamental challenge to remotely sensed mapping of coastal shallow waters is due to the significant disparity in the optical properties of the water column caused by the interaction between the coast and the sea. The objects to be classified have weak signals that interact with turbid waters that include sediments. In real scenarios, the absorption and backscattering coefficients are unknown with different sources of variability (river discharges and coastal interactions). Under normal circumstances, another unknown variable is the depth of shallow waters. This paper presents the development of algorithms for retrieving information and its application to the classification and mapping of objects under coastal shallow waters with different unknown concentrations of sediments. A mathematical model that simplifies the radiative transfer equation was used to quantify the interaction between the object of interest, the medium and the sensor. The retrieval of information requires the development of mathematical models and processing tools in the area of inversion, image reconstruction and classification of hyperspectral data. The algorithms developed were applied to one set of real hyperspectral imagery taken in a tank filled with water and TiO2 that emulates turbid coastal shallow waters. Tikhonov method of regularization was used in the inversion process to estimate the bottom albedo of the water tank using a priori information in the form of stored spectral signatures, previously measured, of objects of interest.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0897-9; 978-1-5106-0898-6				2017	10198								UNSP 1019818	10.1117/12.2262760								WOS:000404782800038

Remote sensing images obtained in 1990,2000,2005,2010 and 2015 were employed as data sources. The result shows that water landscape which include salt pools, fishing ponds and tidal channel decreased, while terrain landscape include building land and grassland increased.

S	Zhu, CM; Zhang, X		Zhang, X; Wang, L; Jiang, X; Zhu, C		Zhu, Changming; Zhang, Xin			Coastal Remote Sensing	MODELING WITH DIGITAL OCEAN AND DIGITAL COAST	Coastal Research Library											Coastal zones are a junction between the land and the ocean. The dynamic nature of the coast makes it difficult to clearly define the borders of coastal zones. Sometimes these zones are referred to as tidewater areas, extending from the coast to approximately 10 miles inland. Ketchum defined a coastal zone as the band of dry land and adjacent ocean space (water and submerged land) in which terrestrial processes and land uses directly affect oceanic processes and uses and vice versa (Ketchum BH, The water's edge: critical problems of the Coastal zone. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1972). Coastal zones are one of the most ecologically valuable and biodiverse regions in the world. They provide food, freshwater and other marine products for human beings, as well as play an important role in the local environment. However, human activities and global climate change have given rise to natural disasters that threaten coastal zones environmental security. In particular, the effect of industrial projects on coastal zones is worsening. Thus, it is important to study these areas to provide guidance for coastal resource management and environmental protection. Numerous researchers have attempted to monitor coastal zone dynamics based on remote sensing data. In this chapter, we summarize various topics concerning the application of remote sensing in coastal zones. We focus on describing several new methods, including coastline automatic extraction, intertidal zone identification, coastal wetland classification and coastal invasive plant detection, using remote sensing.																	2211-0577		978-3-319-42710-2; 978-3-319-42708-9				2017	18						169	203		10.1007/978-3-319-42710-2_8	10.1007/978-3-319-42710-2							WOS:000399043100009

An object-oriented classification method is used to the two images and five classes of ground features were identified as man-made objects, farmland, forest, waterbody and unutilized land. An auxiliary ASTER GDEM was used to improve the classification accuracy. And the change detection based on the classification results was performed. Accuracy assessment was carried out finally. Consequently, satisfactory results were obtained. The results show that great changes of the Pingtan city have been detected as the expansion of the city area and the intensity increase of man-made buildings, roads and other infrastructures with the establishment of Pingtan comprehensive experimental zone.

J	Jena, B				Jena, Babula			The effect of phytoplankton pigment composition and packaging on the retrieval of chlorophyll-a concentration from satellite observations in the Southern Ocean	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The Antarctic waters are known to be optically unique and the standard empirical ocean colour algorithms applied to these waters may not address the regional bio-optical characteristics. This article sheds light on the performance of current empirical algorithms and a regionally optimized algorithm (ROA) for the retrieval of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration from Aqua-Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (Aqua-MODIS) and Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) in the Indian Ocean Sector of Southern Ocean (IOSO). Analysis indicated that empirical algorithms used for the retrieval of chl-a concentration from Aqua-MODIS and SeaWiFS underestimate by a factor varying from 2 to 2.9, resulting in underestimation when in situ chl-a exceeds about 0.3 mg m(-3). To explain these uncertainties, a study was carried out to understand the effect of phytoplankton pigment composition and pigment packaging on remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs,R-lambda), from the analysis of phytoplankton-specific absorption coefficient (a(ph,)*(lambda)). The spatial variation of phytoplankton groups analysed using diagnostics pigments (DP) indicated shifting of the phytoplankton community structure from offshore to coastal Antarctic, with a significant increasing trend for diatoms and a decreasing trend for haptophytes population. The diatomdominated population exhibits lower a(ph,*lambda) in the 405-510 nm region (with relative flattening in 443-489 nm) compared with the a(ph,)*(lambda) spectra of the haptophytes-dominated population that peaks near 443 nm. The flattening of a(ph,)*(lambda) spectra for the diatom-dominated population was attributed to its larger cell size, which leads to pigment packaging (intracellular shading) and in turn results in higher R-rs,R-lambda The relationship between pigment composition (normalized by chl-a) and blue: green absorption band ratios (a(ph),*(443): a(ph),*(555) and a(ph),*(489): a(ph),* (555)) corresponding to the Aqua-MODIS and SeaWiFS bands showed in-phase associations with most of the pigments such as 19'-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin, 19'-butanoyloxyfucoxanthin, peridinin, and zeaxanthin. In contrast, the out-of-phase association observed between the blue: green absorption ratios and fucoxanthin indicated apparent deviations from the general pigment retrieval algorithms, which assumes that blue: green ratios vary in a systematic form with chl-a. The out-of-phase correspondence suggests that the increasing trend of fucoxanthin pigments towards the Antarctic coast was associated with the decreasing trend of blue: green absorption ratios and in turn results in higher R-rs,R-lambda Therefore, an increase in Rrs,. leads to underestimation of chl-a from Aqua-MODIS and SeaWiFS in the IOSO region.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2017	38	13					3763	3784		10.1080/01431161.2017.1308034								WOS:000399247300001

Both native and non-native subspecies thrive in the USA with the non-natives quickly displacing native wetland plants. Along the Gulf Coast, Phragmites grows in very dense stands, and at heights of greater than 4.6 m, is usually the tallest grass species in a wetland, estuary, and marsh ecosystems. Phragmites is known to alter the ecology of these wetland systems making them less suitable as habitat for many species of flora and fauna. Furthermore, Phragmites presents a navigation hazard to smaller boats by impairing visibility along shorelines and around bends of canals and rivers. Management efforts targeting non-native Phragmites rely heavily on accurately mapping invaded areas. Historically, mapping has been done through walking the perimeter of a stand with a Global Positioning System (GPS) unit, using satellite imagery, or through the use of aerial photography from manned aircraft. These methods are time consuming, are expensive, can have an inadequate resolution, and in some cases are prone to human error. In this work, an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) was used to capture visible imagery to create a basin-wide distribution map of a large wetland along the US Pearl River delta in southeastern Louisiana. The imagery was collected in the summer and individual images were mosaicked to create a larger map. We then evaluated the use of texture analysis on the mosaics to automatically map the invasive. Specifically, Gabor filters, grey level co-occurrence matrices, segmentation-based fractal texture analysis, and wavelet-based texture analysis were compared for mapping the Phragmites. Our experimental results, conducted using the imagery we collected over four study areas (approximately 2250 ha) along the US Pearl River delta, indicate the proposed texture-based approach yields an average accuracy of 85%, an average kappa accuracy of 70%. These maps have shown to be very useful for resource managers to hasten the eradication efforts of Phragmites.

They include two basic geomorphologic units, erosion depression and sand deposition, and three typical morphological types: saucer type, trough type, and compound type. In this study, the dynamic changes of typical blowouts within the past decade were analyzed via multiperiod high-resolution remote sensing images. RTK was used to repeatedly measure the blowouts to obtain their high-precision 3D terrain data in 2010, 2011, and 2012. Short-term dynamic changes in 3D blowout morphology were carefully analyzed to discover the following. (1) From 2002 to 2012, the depressions of typical blowouts exhibited downwind extension and lateral expansion trends, as they continuously grew in size. Regarding the sand deposition zones, those of the saucer blowout grew continuously, while those of the trough and compound blowouts fluctuated between growth and contraction. (2) The erosion depression of saucer blowouts eroded downward and spread horizontally; that of trough blowouts first accumulated then eroded but also spread horizontally. The erosion depression of compound blowouts exhibited horizontal spreading accompanied with bottom accumulation. The sand deposition zones of all three types of blowouts exhibited decreasing length with increasing width and height.																	1024-123X	1563-5147					2017									9206963	10.1155/2017/9206963								WOS:000398484100001

On 11 March 2011, an earthquake occurred at about 130 km of the east coast of Sendai City in Japan. This earthquake has been followed by a huge tsunami, which caused devastating damages over the wide areas in the eastern coastlines of Japan. In order to manage such crises quickly and efficiently, change maps of affected areas are really crucial for damage estimation and proposing the essential services. Therefore, an automatic extraction of inundated and damaged areas from satellite images, with less user interaction, is essential and helpful. So far, the existing change detection (CD) approaches have a low degree of automation and are not optimal and applicable to high resolution optical and radar remote-sensing data. In order to resolve these problems, an integrated object-level CD method based on an object-based classifier and support vector data description method is proposed. In addition, parameter determination of the proposed method is addressed automatically by using an inter-cluster distance based approach. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method and extract the damaged areas, various optical and radar remote sensing images from before and after of Sendai 2011's tsunami, acquired by IKONOS, Radarsat-2, and TerraSAR-X, were used. The accuracy analysis of results showed a great flexibility for CD of by finding nonlinear object-level solutions to the problem. Furthermore, the comparative analysis of experimental results from IKONOS, Radarsat-2, and TerraSAR-X (kappa coefficient (kappa): 0.85, 0.82, 0.76) and Support Vector Machine-based CD techniques (kappa= 0.83, 0.73, 0.84), showed that the accuracy of the change maps is relatively improved. Finally, we came to the conclusion that the proposed method is considerably automated and less influenced by the errors in the classification process.

J	Ferreira, CV; Pereira, PD				Ferreira Junior, Cicero Vicente; Pereira, Pedro de Souza			ASPECTS ON THE OF STATE ART IN SWASH ZONE STUDIES	REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE GEOMORFOLOGIA												Within of the beach environment, the swash zone can be considered as the most dynamic sub-environment in coastal region. In the larger part this is due the swash to represent the responses of external hydrodynamic processes in subaerial region of the beach profile. Thus, the wave climate and the amplitude of the tide are essential variables in the studies that have becoming searched to quantify of these phenomenon. The methods used in these studies follow the technological evolution of the present days from employing measurement in situ tools, acoustic signals, remote sensing, and others that to use more sophisticated and robust techniques for lasers and scanners. Therefore, it is possible to obtain a range of sufficient data for multidisciplinary approaches, are applied with a focus on physical processes in the interpretation of research results. Processes are considered as sediment transport in the swash cycle and their implications, infiltration/exfiltration on the beach face fl oor, as well as the saturation rate for the water, and the infl uence of profile gradient components and morphological features, in addition the beach balance are focused in these studies. Thus, it was established that, to depend on beach morphodynamic stage, determined movement in the swash cycle will infl uence more directly in the morphological evolution, as well as development features. All these research aim towards the understanding the relationship between the evolution of a given process and variations in the swash zone. The evaluation of these studies show the important of this area for morphological development of the subaerial beach region, because this area determines every variation that will occur in the profile. The study also addresses new directions for researches related to swash, requiring more accurate and details approaches this environment, considering new technological methods and studies involving numerical modeling. Also emphasized the need for monitoring the swash zone in diff erent types of coasts, for more extensive knowledge on the subject.																	1519-1540	2236-5664				JAN-MAR	2017	18	1					197	223		10.20502/rbg.v18i1.1120								WOS:000398524800013

Contrasting bio-optical characteristics of coastal water prior to and in the aftermath of a tropical super cyclone	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Apparent and inherent optical propertiesweremeasured in thecoastal region off Visakhapatnam(Bay of Bengal) during pre-monsoon season (January-May) of successive years, in-between of which the (October 2014) Hudhud super cyclone had landfall across. For 5 months after the cyclone in the region up to 50 m isobath, or 15 km from the coast and 6 months after the cyclone in the region up to 30 m isobath, or 5 km away, the particle back-scattering coefficient (b(bp)) and remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs) were anomalously higher throughout the spectral region (400-700 nm) than during other times. The bbp spectral slope coefficient gamma is abnormally higher than predicted from the b(bp)(680)-. model relationship, and R-rs(685) is also abnormally higher than the significant R-rs(685)-chlorophyll-a (chl-a) relationship would predict. These exceptional properties are attributed to the presence of little absorbing and highly reflecting sub-micrometre-sized particles in fine suspension that leached from the coastal deposits emplaced in the study region from the nearby harbour during the cyclone. The optical properties recovered subsequently. In the period when the reflectance and scattering spectra are not recovered, the R-rs(685) is no longer a proxy of chl-a. Remote-sensing algorithms for phytoplankton abundance of the coastal region during this period need correction.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2017	38	12					3519	3530		10.1080/01431161.2017.1297546								WOS:000397995500003

Satellite-derived CO2 flux in the surface seawater of the Austral Ocean south of Australia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												A step by step algorithm for air-sea CO2 flux (F(CO2)) calculation from satellite parameters is presented in this study. Parameters used for F(CO2) calculation are: (1) sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (chl-a) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Aqua (MODIS Aqua), (2) sea surface salinity (SSS) estimated from MODIS Aqua SST using multiple linear regression, (3) seawater CO2 fugacity (f(CO2sw)) estimated by MODIS Aqua SST and chl-a using feedforward neural networks, (4) atmospheric CO2 fugacity (f(CO2atm)) from the Cape Grim station, and (5) wind speed from the Quick and Advanced Scatterometer (QSCAT and ASCAT). In situ data provided by (1) the Surveillance de l'Ocean Austral - Monitoring the Southern Ocean (SURVOSTRAL) project, (2) the Integrated Marine Observed System (IMOS) project, and (3) Mesures a l'INterface Eau-aiR de la Variabilite des echanges de CO2 (MINERVE) project collected on the research vessel L'Astrolabe, are used to establish and validate the models. These models are then tested using remote sensing data. This work focus on the southern ocean from the south of Australia to the Antarctica coasts (between 43.5 degrees S and 67 degrees S), on the period of spring and Austral summer (from October to March, between 2002/2003 and 2014/2015). In each step, the result's precision of experiments was determined by the root mean square error (RMSE). Results show (1) an improvement of satellite SSS estimation with a precision of +/- 0.16 using SST and latitude, (2) an estimation of f(CO2sw) by satellite data with a good accuracy of +/- 9.45 mu atm (0.96 Pa), and (3) a calculation of F(CO2) using satellite data with a global RMSE of about +/- 3 mmol CO2 m(-2) day(-1). The interpolated F(CO2) shows that, in the period of austral spring and summer, this region absorbs the atmospheric CO2, and becomes a stronger sink of CO2 throughout the years (from an overall average absorption of about 2 mmol CO2 m(-2) day(-1) in 2002/2003 to about 7 mmol CO2 m(-2) day(-1) in 2014/2015).																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2017	38	6					1600	1625		10.1080/01431161.2017.1286054								WOS:000394651500007

Genetic Description and Remote Sensing Techniques as Management Tools for Zostera noltii Seagrass Populations along the Atlantic Moroccan Coast	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Seagrass meadows provide an essential ecological service in coastal ecosystems worldwide, although they are sensitive to many human factors, as a serious global regression has been documented. During sampling along the Atlantic Moroccan coast, five coastal lagoons were found characterized by the presence of intertidal monospecific seagrass Zostera noltii meadows (from south to north, Nayla, Oualidia, Sidi Moussa, Moulay Bousselham, and Larache). Two descriptive methods used to characterize Z. noltii populations could be used as management tools for future monitoring implementations: (1) the estimation of surface area covered by Z. noltii meadows using remote sensing techniques and in situ field surveys, and (2) the genetic characterisation of Z. noltii populations using simple sequence repeats (microsatellites) as molecular markers. Results revealed that the Nayla lagoon showed the largest area covered by Z. noltii (26,9,868 m(2)) and the highest coverage rate (5.19%), while presenting the lowest genetic/genotypic diversity values (T = 36, (A) over cap =3.58, G=50; R=0.544; H-e=0.43). On the other hand, northern populations displayed lower rates of seagrass coverage (similar to 1%) and higher values of genetic/genotypic diversity. Further genetic characterization also revealed that Z. noltii populations seem to be highly isolated in three geographically independent regions: northern Morocco (R1, Larache and Moulay Bousselham), central Morocco (R2, Oualidia and Sidi Moussa), and southern Morocco (R3, Nayla), which should be considered independent management units. Both seagrass coverage rate and the genetic description of seagrass populations along the Atlantic Moroccan coast seem to be useful management tools that could be used to evaluate changes in seagrass meadows over time to further establish appropriate conservation strategies.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JAN	2017	33	1					78	87		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-15-00111.1								WOS:000394926100006

Here we show that the surface gravity wave resuspension of sediments has a larger role in controlling backscatter than previously considered. Almost 18 years of SeaWiFS, MODIS, MERIS, and VIIRS satellite imagery of the Santa Barbara Channel, California and its surrounding waters spectrally merged with the Garver-Siegel-Maritorena bio-optical model were used to assess the controls on suspended particle distributions. Analysis revealed that chlorophyll blooms in the warmer portions of the domain occur in phase with SST minima, usually in early spring, while blooms in the cooler regions lag SST minima and occur simultaneously to the strongest equatorward winds every year, often in the summer. Tight coupling between the optical variables was seen in offshore areas, as expected for productive waters. However, values of backscatter near the coast were primarily modulated by surface waves. This relationship holds throughout all seasons and is stronger within the 100 m isobath, but often extends tens of kilometers offshore. This forcing of particle resuspension by surface waves is likely a feature ubiquitous in all coastal oceans characterized by fine sediments. The implication of surface wave processes determining suspended particle loads far beyond the surf zone has large consequences for the interpretation of satellite ocean color signals in coastal waters and potentially redefines the extent of the littoral zone.

Quantitative reconstruction of Holocene sea ice and sea surface temperature off West Greenland from the first regional diatom data set	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY												Holocene oceanographic conditions in Disko Bay, West Greenland, were reconstructed from high-resolution diatom records derived from two marine sediment cores. A modern data set composed of 35 dated surface sediment samples collected along the West Greenland coast accompanied by remote sensing data was used to develop a diatom transfer function to reconstruct April sea ice concentration (SIC) supported by July sea surface temperature (SST) in the area. Our quantitative reconstruction shows that oceanographic changes recorded throughout the last similar to 11,000 years reflect seasonal interplay between spring (April SIC) and summer (July SST) conditions. Our records show clear correlation with climate patterns identified from ice core data from GISP2 and Agassiz-Renland for the early to middle Holocene. The early Holocene deglaciation of western Greenland Ice Sheet was characterized in Disko Bay by initial strong centennial-scale fluctuations in April SIC with amplitude of over 40%, followed by high April SIC and July SST. These conditions correspond to a general warming of the climate in the Northern Hemisphere. A decrease in April SIC and July SST was recorded during the Holocene Thermal Optimum reflecting more stable spring-summer conditions in Disko Bay. During the late Holocene, high April SIC characterized the Medieval Climate Anomaly, while high July SST prevailed during the Little Ice Age, supporting previously identified antiphase relationship between surface waters in West Greenland and climate in NW Europe. This antiphase pattern might reflect seasonal variations in regional oceanographic conditions and large-scale fluctuations within the North Atlantic Oscillation and Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.

Spatio-Temporal Variation in High-Centre Polygons and Ice-Wedge Melt Ponds, Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands, Northwest Territories	PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES												High-centred polygonal terrain is a widespread feature of Arctic landscapes that is sensitive to increasing ground temperatures because of its high ground-ice content. Understanding spatial variation in the distribution and sensitivity of high-centred polygonal terrain is important for predicting landscape change. In the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands, Northwest Territories, Canada, mean annual ground temperatures in permafrost have increased between 1 and 2 degrees C over the last 40 years and high-centred polygonal terrain comprises about 10 per cent of the terrestrial landscape. To investigate factors affecting the distribution and potential degradation of ice wedges, we mapped high-centred polygonal terrain and ice-wedge melt ponds, and documented ice wedge related thermokarst at anthropogenic disturbances using 2004 aerial photographs. Historical melt pond distribution was assessed using 1972 aerial photographs. The density of polygonal terrain (up to 37%) was significantly higher in the northern than the southern part of the study area, where more abundant lacustrine sediments and lower ground temperatures have favoured ice-wedge development. Larger proportional melt pond area (0.68%), increases in pond area (up to 3.74%) and a higher frequency of major thermokarst activity following anthropogenic surface disturbance (54%) suggest that high-centred polygonal terrain in the northern part of the study area is more susceptible to degradation than in the southern part.

Analysis of Satellite SST Images of the Southeastern Baltic Sea	WATER RESOURCES												The results of comparative analysis of sea surface temperature variations along horizontal sections in the coastal zone are given. The data used had been taken by MODIS spectroradiometers (Aqua, Terra) in the Southeastern Baltic, in periods of coastal upwelling-in the periods of autumn differential cooling over coastal continental slopes (facilitating water subsidence along these slopes). Studying 135 SST images of coastal upwelling events in May-October 2000-2014 and four cooling events in October-November 2002, 2004, 2005, and 2009 revealed the specific features of the shape of horizontal temperature profiles on sea surface along sections over coastal continental slopes. In addition to the higher differences between water surface temperatures in the deep and coastal parts of the sea (up to 14 degrees C), upwelling features an appreciable distance from the cold-water core to the coast (up to 3-15 km) and a variable shape of horizontal profiles of water temperature on the sea surface along the sections. Conversely, during autumn differential cooling, water temperature difference on the surface is relatively small, the shape of the dependence of surface water temperature on the distance to the shore does not change over time, varies only slightly with the alongshore displacement of the section, and shows low sensitivity to bathymetry and even to wind effect. Thus, the analysis of the shape of the temperature on the sea surface along horizontal sections over coastal continental slopes enables the diagnostics of the regime of vertical water exchange in the coastal zone.

Ocean color remote sensing is an efficient tool to monitor SPM spatio-temporal variability in coastal waters. However, near-shore satellite images are complex to correct for atmospheric effects due to the proximity of land and to the high level of reflectance caused by high SPM concentrations in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions. The water reflectance signal ((w)) tends to saturate at short visible wavelengths when the SPM concentration increases. Using a comprehensive dataset of high-resolution satellite imagery and in situ SPM and water reflectance data, this study presents (i) an assessment of existing atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms developed for turbid coastal waters; and (ii) a switching method that automatically selects the most sensitive SPM vs. (w) relationship, to avoid saturation effects when computing the SPM concentration. The approach is applied to satellite data acquired by three medium-high spatial resolution sensors (Landsat-8/Operational Land Imager, National Polar-Orbiting Partnership/Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite and Aqua/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) to map the SPM concentration in some of the most turbid areas of the European coastal ocean, namely the Gironde and Loire estuaries as well as Bourgneuf Bay on the French Atlantic coast. For all three sensors, AC methods based on the use of short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands were tested, and the consistency of the retrieved water reflectance was examined along transects from low- to high-turbidity waters. For OLI data, we also compared a SWIR-based AC (ACOLITE) with a method based on multi-temporal analyses of atmospheric constituents (MACCS). For the selected scenes, the ACOLITE-MACCS difference was lower than 7%. Despite some inaccuracies in (w) retrieval, we demonstrate that the SPM concentration can be reliably estimated using OLI, MODIS and VIIRS, regardless of their differences in spatial and spectral resolutions. Match-ups between the OLI-derived SPM concentration and autonomous field measurements from the Loire and Gironde estuaries' monitoring networks provided satisfactory results. The multi-sensor approach together with the multi-conditional algorithm presented here can be applied to the latest generation of ocean color sensors (namely Sentinel2/MSI and Sentinel3/OLCI) to study SPM dynamics in the coastal ocean at higher spatial and temporal resolutions.

In this study, we have targeted the best hyperspectral indices for tracing chlorophyll content in cold temperate deciduous forests from a total of 86 published representative hyperspectral indices, including 71 reflectance(-)based indices, 10 derivative-based indices and five feature based indices. These indices have been thoroughly evaluated using the datasets from a dominant species (Fagus crenate) in one alpine site along the Japanese sea coast (Naeba site) and another alpine site along the Pacific Coast (Nakagawane site) composed of 29 species other than beech. Evaluation results based on beech leaves from the Naeba site revealed that the DDn had the best performance (R-2 = 0.57), and its robustness has also been confirmed from the dataset obtained from the Nakagawane site (R-2 = 0.47) when all leaf types were dumped. However, the indices that performed best were different when leaf types were taken into account, for which CI (R-2 = 0.73) and D2 (R-2 = 0.71) were identified for sunlit and shaded leaves, respectively. Astonishingly, they performed poorly with the other leaf type (R-2 = 023 for Cl with shaded leaves and 0.15 for D2 with sunlit leaves), suggesting the sensitivity of indices to different leaf categories. The measurements obtained from Nakagawane were also adopted to validate them based on the ratio of performance to deviation (RPD). For the sunlit leaf-oriented indices, the CI good again; however, those of the shaded-oriented indices were poor, and their robustness was not confirmed. As a result, there are no indices that are applicable for quantifying the chlorophyll concentrations of shaded leaves from different species; hence, it is required to develop a generally applicable index to express the differences in leaf type in future works (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Tiger re-establishment potential to former Caspian tiger (Panthera tigris virgata) range in Central Asia	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Caspian tigers (Panthera tigris virgata), a now extinct subspecies genetically similar to the Amur tiger (P. t. altaica), Occurred until the mid-1900s from modem day Turkey and Iran east through Central Asia into northwest China. A literature analysis we conducted revealed that Caspian tigers occupied ca. 800,000-900,000 km(2) historically, mostly within isolated patches of tugay- and reed-dominated riparian ecosystems at densities up to 2-3 tigers/100 km(2). Herein we explored options to restore tigers to Central Asia using Amur tiger as an "analog" form. Spatial analyses based on remote sensing data indicated that options for Amur tiger introduction are limited in Central Asia but at least two habitat patches remain potentially suitable for tiger re-establishment, both in Kazakhstan, with a total area of <20,000 km(2). The most promising site the Ili river delta and adjacent southern coast of Balkhash Lake hosts ca. 7000 km(2) of suitable habitat that our tiger-prey population models suggest could support a population of 64-98 tigers within 50 years if 40-55 tigers are translocated and current Ili river flow regimes are maintained. Re-establishment of tigers in Central Asia may yet be tenable if concerns of local communities in the Ili-Balkhash region are carefully addressed, prey population restoration precedes tiger introduction, Ili river water supplies remain stable, and the Amur tiger's phenotype proves adaptable to the arid conditions of the introduction site.

Traditional spatiotemporal techniques face great challenges in dealing with which, how, and where the marine environmental parameters in different zones help to drive, and respond to, ENSO events. Remote sensing products covering a 15-year period from 1998 to 2012 were used to quantitatively explore these patterns in the Pacific Ocean (PO) by a prevail quantitative association rule mining algorithm, that is, a priori, within a mining framework. The marine environmental parameters considered were monthly anomaly of sea surface chlorophyll-a (CHLA), monthly anomaly of sea surface temperature (SSTA), monthly anomaly of sea level anomaly (SLAA), monthly anomaly of sea surface precipitation (SSPA), and monthly anomaly of sea surface wind speed (WSA). Four significant discoveries are found, namely: (1) Association patterns among marine environmental parameters and ENSO events were found primarily in five sub-regions of the PO: the western PO, the central and eastern tropical PO, the middle of the northern subtropical PO, offshore of the California coast, and the southern PO; (2) In the western and the middle and east of the equatorial PO, the association patterns are more complicated than other regions; (3) The following factors were found to be predicators of and responses to La Nina events: abnormal decrease of SLAA and WSA in the east of the equatorial PO, abnormal decrease of SSPA and WSA in the middle of the equatorial PO, abnormal decrease of SSTA in the eastern and central tropical PO, and abnormal increase of SLAA in the western PO; (4) Only abnormal decrease of CHLA in the middle of the equatorial PO was found to be a predicator of and response to El Nino events. These findings will help to improve our abilities to identify the marine association patterns in factors relating to ENSO events.																	2220-9964					JAN	2017	6	1							32	10.3390/ijgi6010032								WOS:000392983900031

Numerical Modeling of a Tornado Event at Skala, Lakonia, Peloponnese in September 2015	PERSPECTIVES ON ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES	Springer Atmospheric Sciences				13th International Conference on Meteorology, Climatology and Atmospheric Physics (COMECAP)	SEP 19-21, 2016	Aristotle Univ Res Disseminat Ctr, Thessaloniki, GREECE	Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Phys, Lab Atmospher Phys, Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Geol, Dept Meteorol & Climatol, Hellen Meteorol Soc, Mariolopoulos Kanaginis Fdn Environm Sci	Aristotle Univ Res Disseminat Ctr			Towards the evaluation of the thermodynamic characteristics of a high impact tornadic event in Skala Lakonia, southern Peloponnese, in September 21, 2015, Weather Research and Forecasting (AR-WRF) mesoscale model was used. For the particular model setup used in this study, different configurations were pre-tested based on different spatial resolution and parameterization schemes. The current study downscales ECMWF reanalysis initial and boundary conditions to 300 m spatial resolution to assess the convective available potential energy (CAPE), the reflectivity perceived by radar (dBZ) and the energy helicity index (EHI). The validation was conducted using in situ and remote sensing observations of the surrounding area. The results illustrate deep convective activity with CAPE values indicating a strong instability in the region of interest. Furthermore, the model seems to capture well the southwesterly-northeasterly front propagation of the convective initiation of the storm, as well as the troughs that affected the south part of Peloponnese, assessing the pre-frontal nature of the particular tornadic event. Finally, the EHI values demonstrate the tornadic activity in the region of Skala Lakonia, as the model appears to simulate accurately the low pressure system along the east coast of the Lakonia Gulf.																	2194-5217		978-3-319-35095-0; 978-3-319-35094-3				2017							81	86		10.1007/978-3-319-35095-0_12								WOS:000392385800012

During this period, the sea surface temperature (SST) dropped 3 degrees C-4 degrees C and the chlorophyll A (Chl-a) content increased by 0.5-1 mg/m(3), as determined from satellite-derived products. The cold water also suppressed the sea surface capillary waves and made the ocean surface smooth, a distinct feature shown as dark patches observed in the synthetic aperture radar image acquired during this period of time. The surface wind direction varied between alongshore and offshore. We implemented an interactively coupled ocean (regional ocean modeling system) and atmosphere (Weather Research and Forecasting model) model to capture the dynamical processes of this seemingly wind-driven cooling event. When the wind changed direction such that the alongshore component blew with the land on its left side, stronger upwelling occurred; and when the wind blew offshore with no alongshore component, the upwelling still occurred in this area, but with less strength. Two simulations with idealized alongshore and offshore winds show that the upwelling can be set up within several hours. The alongshore wind is more effective than the offshore wind in transporting upper level water offshore and triggering upwelling and causing SST cooling areas that are relatively large in size, although the maximum SST cooling they cause is on the same order of magnitude.

Coastal erosion vs man-made protective structures: evaluating a two-decade history from southeastern India	NATURAL HAZARDS												Remote sensing images of AD 1991-2011 and field observations help evaluate shoreline changes (erosion and accretion) in Puducherry and Tamil Nadu states of southeastern India. A minor harbor was constructed during AD 1986-1989 in the coast of Puducherry, and it initiated the gradual process of shoreline modification. In the subsequent years, beaches located toward the north of the harbor suffered erosion (-0.12--4.19 m/year) and there was accretion (0.27-7.25 m/year) in the southern beaches. However, the man-made structures (seawall and groin) have reduced the shoreline changes after AD 2004. In the last two decades, the rate of erosion area-wise gradually decreased (0.24-0.013 km(2)/year) and accretion remained constant (0.019 km(2)/year). Our results suggest that accretion happened in the southern side of the breakwaters and erosion occurred in the northern part. Presence of groins structures in the region in the northern part has also provoked accretion in the south and erosion in the northern side close to the State of Tamil Nadu.

Remote Sensing of Atmospheric and Ionospheric Signals Prior to the Mw 8.3 Illapel Earthquake, Chile 2015	PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS												In the present study, a number of atmospheric and some ionospheric anomalies are analyzed, which were recorded prior to the Mw 8.3 Illapel earthquake of September 16, 2015. This very large earthquake occurred in Central Chile, close to the coast, as the result of thrust faulting on the interface between the Nazca Plate and South American continent. Using remotely sensed data extracted from NASA/Giovanni, NOAA/NCEP, and NOAA/NGDC, atmospheric and ionospheric anomalies were observed that co-registered 35-40 and 25-30 days prior to the main shock, respectively. With reference to long-term time series over the epicentral area, significant atmospheric anomalies were recorded for cloud cover, geopotential height, precipitation rates, surface air pressure, omega, stream function, and wind vectors-all in the time window of August 5-10, 2015, 35-40 days prior to the main shock. Anomalous TEC maps were recorded for the same time period. Satellite images indicate the formation of an unusual cyclone, presumably triggered by air turbulences and abnormal atmospheric conditions over the epicentral area, including strong vertical winds. Data from the Jicamarca radio observatory in Peru, more than 2000 km to the North, reveal anomalous ionospheric variations on August 15-20, 2015 with respect to international reference ionosphere thickness parameters and the altitude of the F layer. The observed anomalies are consistent with processes that occur at the ground-to-air interface due to the stress activation of peroxy defects in the hypocentral volume. The flow of positive hole charge carriers to the Earth surface expected to have led to massive air ionization, generating at first primarily positive airborne ions, then negative air ions plus ozone. Understanding the sequence of processes inside the Earth's crust and at the ground-to-air interface provides information not previously available about the causal and temporal linkages between the various pre-earthquake phenomena and the future seismic event.																	0033-4553	1420-9136				JAN	2017	174	1					11	45		10.1007/s00024-016-1366-0								WOS:000391362100002

The optical remote-sensing data with 250 m resolution acquired by a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) during 2002-2011 were used for statistical characterization of sea ice. A method based on bimodal histogram analysis of remote-sensing reflectance data was developed to discriminate ice from water. In general, ice extent information obtained from MODIS data agrees with the official ice chart data (synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and in situ measurements) and multi-sensor product containing data from microwave and infrared instruments (R-2>0.83). However, in case of severe winters and extremely mild winters there are differences in the dates when maximum ice extent is registered. MODIS data can be used for detailed analysis of ice extent in specific basins of Baltic Sea. Depending on the year, the ice season length in the Gulf of Riga ranged from 68 to 146 days, and the maximum ice extent varied greatly from 329 to 15,350 km(2). SIOP and number of ice days increased significantly in areas where the depth is less than 15 m. Based on negative-degree days and ice cover characteristics (SIOP and ice season length), three winter scenarios were defined: severe (2003, 2006, 2010, and 2011), medium (2004 and 2005), and mild (2007, 2008, and 2009).																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2017	38	3					617	638		10.1080/01431161.2016.1268734								WOS:000390870600001

Assessment of runup predictions by empirical models on non-truncated beaches on the south-east Australian coast	COASTAL ENGINEERING												This paper assesses the accuracy of 11 existing runup models against field data collected under moderate wave conditions from 11 non-truncated beaches in New South Wales and Queensland, Australia. Beach types spanned the full range of intermediate beach types from low tide terrace to longshore bar and trough. Model predictions for both the 2% runup exceedance (R-2%) and maximum runup (R-max) were highly variable between models, with predictions shown to vary by a factor of 1.5 for the same incident wave conditions. No single model provided the best predictions on all beaches in the dataset. Overall, model root mean square errors are of the order of 25% of the R-2% value. Models for R-2% derived from field data were shown to be more accurate for predicting runup in the field than those developed from laboratory data, which overestimate the field data significantly. The most accurate existing models for predicting R-2% were those developed by Holman [12] and Vousdoukas et al. [40], with mean RMSE errors of 0.30 m or 25%. A new model-of-models for R-2% was developed from a best fit to the predictions from six existing field and one large scale laboratory R-2% data derived models. It uses the Hunt [17] scaling parameter tan beta root H0L0 and incorporates a setup parameterisation. This model is shown to be as accurate as the Holman and Vousdoukas et al. models across all tidal stages. It also yielded the smallest maximum error across the dataset. The most accurate predictions for R-max were given by Hunt [17] but this tended to under predict the observed maximum runup obtained for 15-min records. Mase's [22] model has larger errors but yielded more conservative estimates. Greater observed values of R-max are expected with increased record length, leading to greater differences in predicted values. Given the large variation in predictions across all models, however, it is clear that predictions by uncalibrated runup models on a given beach may be prone to significant error and this should be considered when using such models for coastal management purposes. It should be noted that in extreme events, which are lacking in the dataset, runup may be truncated by beach scarps, cliffs, and dunes, or may overtop, and as a result, the probability density functions will have different tail shapes. The uncertainty already present in current models is likely to increase in such conditions.

Geological and Exploration Models of Beach Placer Deposits, Integrated from Case-Studies of Southern Australia	ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS												The processes leading to the formation of beach placer deposits generally begin inland and terminate at the coast, including source rocks being weathered, eroded and then transported by streams and rivers to the coast, where the sediments are deposited in a variety of coastal environments. The coastal sediments are reworked by the action of waves, tides, longshore currents and wind, which are effective processes for sorting the mineral grains based on differences in their size and density, resulting in laminated or lens-shaped packages of sediments up to tens of meters thick that are rich in heavy minerals. Detailed studies of sedimentary basins, as well as peripheral (paleo-)valleys that drained sediment source areas, are important tools in the exploration for heavy mineral resources. Knowledge of the ( paleo-)basin, associated valley architecture and the source of heavy minerals concentrated in the shorelines and valleys are useful guides to the potential for, and location of, economic deposits. Evidence from sedimentology can be combined with that from other geological and geophysical characteristics to arrive at a general reconstruction of basin and paleovalley architecture and depositional environments. Complex paleogeography of the shorelines can influence or determine the sites of heavy mineral concentration. Heavy mineral sands tend to concentrate in certain shoreline settings during storm activity. Repeated storm erosion and reworking over centuries (e.g., the southeastern coast of Australia) or millennia (e.g., the Eucla and Murray Basins of Australia) can progressively enrich heavy mineral sand deposits. Preservation of these deposits over a geological timeframe of millions of years can ensue through subsidence of coastal sediments, and during sea level change that results in either shorelines migrating inland (marine transgression) or seaward (marine regression), potentially burying or stranding earlier deposits or reworking them to form younger deposits. Refinements in remote sensing and geophysical techniques, data processing, sedimentology and computer-aided interpretations provide effective, economic and efficient methods for modeling coastal reconstructions and for exploring provinces and terrains prospective for heavy mineral sand deposits. Landscape topography analysis, combined with geophysical methods that can resolve physical property contrasts between the shoreline sediments and underlying sequences, are increasingly used in mineral exploration to locate and to reconstruct paleoshorelines and paleovalleys. Australia has modern and ancient beach-placer deposits, both of which show many similar geologic features. The formation of these heavy mineral deposits provides one of the best examples of applying knowledge of modern systems (e.g., the west and east coasts of Australia) as an analogue to interpret and understand the geology and form of ancient deposits (e.g., the Eucla and Murray Basins of southern Australia). This study provides descriptive and exploration models of Australia's heavy mineral sand deposits formed in coastal environments, which can be applied to similar settings worldwide.

The reference quantity for performance assessment is in situ total chlorophyll a (TChl a) concentration estimated through a phytoplankton absorption coefficient (i.e. equivalent to API2). Additional comparison of data products has also been addressed for TChl a concentration determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The MERIS matchup analysis revealed a systematic underestimation of TChl a, which was confirmed with an independent comparison of product map analysis.

Observations were obtained with the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS-Aqua). These four blooms were delineated by combining remote-sensing reflectance at 555 nm and normalized fluorescence line height. In 2004 and 2005, the WFS was affected by several hurricanes, including the category 5 storm Hurricane Katrina. These hurricanes led to increased river discharge and vertical mixing which favored bloom intensification and dispersion. No hurricanes passed over the WSF in 2006; however, storms in south Florida may have aided bloom intensification via increased river discharge. In 2011, a bloom appeared off Venice, Florida, where several small creeks discharge. The bloom moved south toward Charlotte Harbor where it intensified and lingered for several months as it received nutrients from riverine discharge and upwelling events. While it is difficult to identify initiation stages of a K. brevis bloom (< similar to 50; 000 cells L-1) using satellite imagery, the techniques used here provide information about bloom evolution (size, duration, and advection) and insight into factors affecting bloom dynamics.

The study adopted an integrated approach, using in situ and remote sensing data, as well as the output of current models. The data reveal variability in the area's hydrography induced by local freshwater sources, the Western Adriatic Current (WAC) flowing from the north along the Italian coast, and the current patterns under different wind regimes. Specifically, exchange with offshore waters in the gulf induces variability in salinity and biogeochemical content, even within the same season, i.e. winter, in our case. This strong dependence on physical and biogeochemical factors makes the Manfredonia-Gargano ecosystem vulnerable to climate change, which could compromise its important role as a nursery area for the Adriatic Sea.

Recently, a number of studies have been performed to estimate temporal topographic changes in tidal flats based on the waterline method using a number of remote sensing data that were acquired at different tidal heights. However, the effect of seasonal variation has not been taken into consideration, nor been understood so far. In this study, 18 scenes of Landsat TM and ETM+ data, covering the period 2003-2004, and corresponding tidal gauge observation data, were used to estimate seasonal topographic variations in two major tidal flats in Gomso and Hampyeong Bay in the southern part of the west sea of South Korea, using the waterline method. Our results showed that the summer deposition was dominant in Gomso Bay with overall average seasonal topographic increase of approximately 18.6 cm. In contrast, Hampyeong Bay showed more dominant summer erosion with overall average seasonal topographic subsidence of about 5.0 cm. In addition; the net overall sedimentation budget was estimated as 6,308,047 m(3) and -2,210,986 m(3) in Gomso and Hampyeong Bay, respectively. The results also indicates that although both bays of Gomso and Hampyeong are classified as semi enclosed tidal flat, the sedimentary fades caused by formation geometry and sediment type led to different topographic changes. The results demonstrate that the amount of seasonal topographic variations is not negligible and are expected to improve the accuracy of topographic change derived by the waterline method.

Assessing small-scale deformation and stability of landfast sea ice on seasonal timescales through L-band SAR interferometry and inverse modeling	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Rapid environmental change and increases in use of shorefast ice by industry and coastal communities highlight the need for an approach to accurately assess landfast sea-ice stability on seasonal timescales. While stability can sometimes be inferred from field measurements, current methods are lacking robustness and the ability to be automated and applied over large areas and long time scales to ensure safety and document change in the context of transportation, indigenous ice uses and industrial development. This paper introduces an inverse model capable of reconstructing three-dimensional deformation fields from one-dimensional interferometric L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) phase patterns. We apply this method at three landfast ice locations on the Alaska Beaufort Sea coast near Barrow and Prudhoe Bay. We find the small-scale displacements estimated from the model consistent with regional patterns of ice motion. Our study suggests that interferometry can provide planning and decision -support information for ice road development and structures operating within ice. Moreover, InSAR can potentially increase our understanding of sea ice on a fundamental level in terms of large-scale stability and long-term changes in ice dynamics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In this research, GPS reflected measurements from a software defined receiver (SDR) are used for aircraft passive bistatic altimetry and coasting with a Stable Frequency Reference (SFR) to continue navigation when, only two GPS satellites are available. The research in this paper focuses on flights over water, a scenario in which the water causes strong reflected signals while alternate terrestrial radio navigation signals are generally not available. Theoretical clock and position error covariances are derived as a function of measurement error, satellite geometry, SFR stability, and GPS bistatic altimetry performance. This is followed by computer simulations and evaluations using flight test data to characterize the positioning performance.

This study established a potential role of remote sensing and GIS for identification and mapping of salinity zone and spatial planning of agricultural land over the Basanti and Gosaba Islands(808.314sq. km) of South 24 PGS. District of West Bengal. The primary data i.e. soil pH, Electrical Conductivity (EC) and Sodium Absorption ratio (SAR) were obtained from soil samples of various GCP (Ground Control Points) locations collected at 50 mts. intervals by handheld GPS from 0-100 cm depths. The secondary information is acquired from the remotely sensed satellite data (LANDSAT ETM+) in different time scale and digital elevation model. The collected field samples were tested in the laboratory and were validated with Remote Sensing based digital indices analysisover the temporal satellite data to assess the potential changes due to over salinization. Soil physical properties such as texture, structure, depth and drainage condition is stored as attributes in a geographical soil database and linked with the soil map units. The thematic maps are integrated with climatic and terrain conditions of the area to produce land capability maps for paddy. Finally, The weighted overlay analysis was performed to assign the weights according to the importance of parameters taken into account for salineareaidentification and mapping to segregate higher, moderate, lower salinity zonesover the study area.																	2080-6736	2300-2581				DEC	2016	65	2					163	192		10.1515/geocart-2016-0012								WOS:000392720000004

Geomorphology and late Holocene accretion history of Adele Reef: a northwest Australian mid-shelf platform reef	GEO-MARINE LETTERS												The mid-shelf reefs of the Kimberley Bioregion are one of Australia's more remote tropical reef provinces and such have received little attention from reef researchers. This study describes the geomorphology and late Holocene accretion history of Adele Reef, a mid-shelf platform reef, through remote sensing of contemporary reef habitats, shallow seismic profiling, shallow percussion coring and radiocarbon dating. Seismic profiling indicates that the Holocene reef sequence is 25 to 35 m thick and overlies at least three earlier stages of reef build-up, interpreted as deposited during marine isotope stages 5, 7 and 9 respectively. The cored shallow subsurface facies of Adele Reef are predominantly detrital, comprising small coral colonies and fragments in a sandy matrix. Reef cores indicate a 'catch-up' growth pattern, with the reef flat being approximately 5-10 m deep when sea level stabilised at its present elevation 6,500 years BP. The reef flat is rimmed by a broad low-relief reef crest only 10-20 cm high, characterised by anastomosing ridges of rhodoliths and coralliths. The depth of the Holocene/last interglacial contact (25-30 m) suggests a subsidence rate of 0.2 mm/year for Adele Reef since the last interglacial. This value, incorporated with subsidence rates from Cockatoo Island (inshore) and Scott Reefs (offshore), provides the first quantitative estimate of hinge subsidence for the Kimberley coast and adjacent shelf, with progressively greater subsidence across the shelf.

Cross-polarized X-band radar is employed on the Canadian Coast Guard Ship (CCGS) Henry Larsen, which is capable of measuring the depolarization characteristics of sea ice. The CCGS Henry Larsen recorded several hours of raw radar data (including the radar data from several ice states) off the Northeast Coast of Newfoundland during several days in March 2012. On the basis of the collected data, the depolarization characteristics of ice states are analyzed for the grazing angles less than 3 z. The results show that the depolarized backscattered wave is stronger when the ice is covered with snow and snow ridges and when the ice floes are smaller.																	1053-5381					DEC	2016	26	4					321	326		10.17736/ijope.2016.aj06								WOS:000391844800001

Microphysical and optical characteristics of these clouds were studied as well as the impact of aerosols on these properties. Microphysical and optical cloud properties were derived using the algorithm SYRSOC (SYnergistic Remote Sensing Of Clouds). Ground-based in situ measurements of aerosol concentrations and the transport path of air masses at cloud level were investigated as well. The cloud properties were studied in dependence of the prevailing air mass at cloud level and season. We found higher cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNC) and smaller effective radii (r(eff)) with greater pollution. Median CDNC ranged from 60 cm(-3) in marine air masses to 160 cm(-3) in continental air. Median reff ranged from 8 mu m in polluted conditions to 10 mu m in marine air. Effective droplet size distributions were broader in marine than in continental cases. Cloud optical thickness (COT) and albedo were lower in cleaner air masses and higher in more polluted conditions, with medians ranging from 2.1 to 4.9 and 0.22 to 0.39, respectively. However, calculation of COT and albedo was strongly affected by liquid water path (LWP) and departure from adiabatic conditions. A comparison of SYRSOC results with MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) observations showed large differences for LWP and COT but good agreement for reff with a linear fit with slope near 1 and offset of -1 mu m.

In this paper, we cope with the early detection of the first signs of deforestation, which is the gateway for illegal activities, such as unauthorized urban sprawl and grazing use. In recent years, object-based approaches have emerged as a more suitable alternative than pixel-based methods for change detection in remote sensing images. Even though several classifiers have been tested, there was little effort in selecting appropriated features for the classification of detected changes. After a deep analysis of the existing segmentation, feature extraction, and classification approaches, we propose an object-based methodology that consists of: 1) segmenting multitemporal Xband high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images into superpixels employing the simple linear iterative clustering algorithm; 2) extracting features using the object correlation images framework and with the gray-level cooccurrence matrix; and 3) classifying areas into unchanged, deforestation, and other changes by means of a multilayer perceptron supervised learning technique. Experiments were performed using high-resolution SAR images obtained by the airborne sensor OrbiSAR-2 from BRADAR in challenging scenarios of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, including a wide variety of vegetation, rivers, sea coasts, urban, harvest and open areas, and humidity changes. We perform an extensive experimental analysis of the results, comparing the proposed method with a state-of-the-art approach. The results demonstrate that our method yields an improvement of over 10% in the accuracy while detecting changes and classifying deforested areas.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				DEC	2016	9	12	1		SI		5436	5448		10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2621818								WOS:000391468100015

Operational satellite sounder moisture profile retrievals from the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (SNPP) NOAA Unique Combined Atmospheric Processing System (NUCAPS) are empirically assessed using collocated dedicated radiosonde observations (raobs) obtained from ocean-based intensive field campaigns. The raobs from these campaigns provide uniquely independent correlative truth data not assimilated into numerical weather prediction (NWP) models for satellite sounder validation over oceans. Although ocean cases are often considered "easy" by the satellite remote sensing community, these hydro meteorological phenomena present challenges to passive sounders, including vertical gradient discontinuities (e.g., strong inversions), as well as persistent uniform clouds, aerosols, and precipitation. It is found that the operational satellite sounder 100-layer moisture profile NUCAPS product performs close to global uncertainty requirements in the SAL/Hadley cell environment, with biases relative to raob within 10% up to 350 hPa. In the more difficult AR environment, bias relative to raob is found to be within 20% up to 400 hPa. In both environments, the sounder moisture retrievals are comparable to NWP model outputs, and cross-sectional analyses show the capability of the satellite sounder for detecting and resolving these tropospheric moisture features, thereby demonstrating a near-real-time forecast utility over these otherwise raob-sparse regions.

Subash			Stimulus of developmental projects to landscape dynamics in Uttara Kannada, Central Western Ghats	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES												Unplanned large scale developmental projects in recent times have been causing alterations in land use land cover [LULC] at spatial and temporal scales with the substantial changes in the landscape. Uttara Kannada district has the distinction of having highest forest cover in India. Forest ecosystems in the district have witnessed major transformations due to industrialization during the post-independence. Impact of developmental activities during the post-independence era, is evident from barren hill tops due to deforestation. The analysis of temporal spatial data acquired through space borne sensors highlights the decline of evergreen-semi evergreen forest cover from 67.73% (1973) to 32.08% (2013). The ad-hoc approaches adopted in the implementation of developmental projects in the ecologically sensitive regions has impaired the ecosystem services affecting the people's livelihood. The changes in the landscape structure with LULC changes have altered the functional abilities of an ecosystem evident from lowered hydrological yield, disappearing perennial streams, higher instances of human-animal conflicts, declined ecosystem goods, etc. About 64355 Ha of forest land is diverted for various non-forestry activities during the last four decades by the government apart from encroachment of 7072 Ha of forest area for agriculture, horticulture activities, etc. Encroachment of forest land has resulted in the land degradation leading to reduced productivity. Alterations in bio-geo chemical and hydrological cycles have necessitated the restoration of native forests in the region to ensure water and food security, and livelihood of the local people. Monitoring and visualization of landscape dynamics helps in evolving appropriate management strategies. LULC dynamics analyses considering agents (developmental projects) through fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) integrated with Markov cellular automata (CA) indicate the developmental projects such as West Coast Paper Mill (WCPM) and Kaiga Nuclear Power House (KNPH) will lead to further fragmentation of forests with spurt in urbanization by 2022. This necessitates framing appropriate policy measures to sustain natural resources focusing on the landscape's ecological, hydrological, economic and social factors.

Year-round spatial movements and trophic ecology of Trindade Petrels (Pterodroma arminjoniana)	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												Trindade Petrels (Pterodroma arminjoniana) are vulnerable gadfly petrels that breed on the remote Trindade Island, located similar to 1100 km off the Brazilian coast. Little is known about their spatial ecology, and their trophic ecology has only been described for the breeding season. We tagged four Trindade Petrels with global location sensing loggers (GLS) from October 2013 to November 2014 and sampled the blood and feathers (innermost primary and the eighth secondary) of 14 individuals to evaluate their year-round spatial and isotopic ecology. We examined individual distributions, habitat use and suitability, activity, and isotopic values during the breeding, migration, and non-breeding periods. Trindade Petrels used areas in the southwest Atlantic Ocean (between 10 degrees N and 50 degrees S in latitude) during the breeding season. They migrated through pelagic waters of the tropical Atlantic to the northwest Atlantic, where they spent the non-breeding season. Trindade Petrels used mostly tropical to subtropical waters in areas of intermediate to high wind speeds and low marine productivity. Individuals spent more time foraging at night than during the day. During the breeding season, birds in northerly areas had higher carbon-13 values, and birds that used more pelagic areas foraged on prey at a higher trophic level (higher nitrogen-15 values) than those in more southern and coastal areas. Isotopic values during the breeding, migration, and non-breeding periods differed, possibly due to differences among individuals in their at-sea distribution throughout the year. We confirmed the non-breeding distribution of Trindade Petrels, which was previously known only from vessel sightings and stranded birds. Our results also suggest a strong temporal segregation in the at-sea distribution and trophic ecology between two groups of individuals, which might indicate the existence of two separate breeding populations.

Quantifying the human influence on fire ignition across the western USA	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Humans have a profound effect on fire regimes by increasing the frequency of ignitions. Although ignition is an integral component of understanding and predicting fire, to date fire models have not been able to isolate the ignition location, leading to inconsistent use of anthropogenic ignition proxies. Here, we identified fire ignitions from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) Burned Area Product (2000-2012) to create the first remotely sensed, consistently derived, and regionally comprehensive fire ignition data set for the western United States. We quantified the spatial relationships between several anthropogenic land-use/disturbance features and ignition for ecoregions within the study area and used hierarchical partitioning to test how the anthropogenic predictors of fire ignition vary among ecoregions. The degree to which anthropogenic features predicted ignition varied considerably by ecoregion, with the strongest relationships found in the Marine West Coast Forest and North American Desert ecoregions. Similarly, the contribution of individual anthropogenic predictors varied greatly among ecoregions. Railroad corridors and agricultural presence tended to be the most important predictors of anthropogenic ignition, while population density and roads were generally poor predictors. Although human population has often been used as a proxy for ignitions at global scales, it is less important at regional scales when more specific land uses (e.g., agriculture) can be identified. The variability of ignition predictors among ecoregions suggests that human activities have heterogeneous impacts in altering fire regimes within different vegetation types and geographies.

Because of its obvious land-use changes and ecosystem deterioration in recent decades, a sustainable development management and environmental protection project should be urgently proposed. Therefore, the remote-sensing images of Landsat are adopted to analyze the land use evolution and to evaluate its ecological security during the past 35 years in Silver Beach of this paper. The results show: in the period of 1979a-2013a, the areas of constructive land and artificial wetland are considerably increased and mainly transformed from cultivated land and forest land. The areas of cultivated land and forest land are substantially reduced accordingly, but the areas of grassland, water area and intertidal zone have no great extent of variation. Its land use intensities are consistently increased, but its land use diversities are abundant before 2000a and then significant decreased. Overall, the land use evolution presents slow in development speed, strengthen in development intensity, down in ecological richness and fragment in spatial patterns. In terms of ecological security, although there has short-term rising of ecological service value and security in 2006a, the whole structure, stability and ecological service function in Silver Beach are declined, and its vulnerabilities are accordingly increased. As a matter of fact, these results are achieved by shortly to improve the utilization rate of the artificial wetland and the intertidal zone resources with the cost of ecosystem structure and stability destruction. The impact factors of leading to above results are not only climatic factors as air temperature, typhoon, tide, but also even more important human activity factors as urbanization, sea reclamation, fishing, tourism and planning management in the studied time period. In consequence, the research findings from this study should be able to help understand the interacting mechanism among above multiple factors and to quantify respective contribution to land use evolution and its ecological security, which would provide an importantly scientific instruction for the future development management protection in Silver Beach.																	1386-7857	1573-7543				DEC	2016	19	4			SI		1907	1924		10.1007/s10586-016-0659-5								WOS:000388972000016

Assessment of shoreline changes over the Northern Tamil Nadu Coast, South India using WebGIS techniques	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												Coastal zone is often vulnerable to natural hazards such as cyclones, storm surges, tsunamis, erosion, accretion, and coastal flooding; and man-made hazards like ports, jetties, seawalls, breakwaters, and groins. These disasters are frequently affecting the shorelines, beaches, and headlands that lead to loss of human life, properties, and natural ecosystems. To prevent further loss in the coastal zone and to conserve the existing natural resources, it is important to map and monitor vulnerable shorelines at frequent time intervals. The current study, conducted over the Northern TN (Tamil Nadu) coast of India, is highly dynamic due to its nature of coast and shoreline changes. The temporal remote sensing data and Survey of India (SOI) topographic maps over the period of 40 years (i.e., 1976-2016) were used to capture shorelines and then the erosion and accretion from the shorelines were assessed by performing the overlay analysis. These geospatial datasets of shorelines were incorporated into WebGIS platform, which was developed and demonstrated using open source software. This latest WebGIS technology allows users to store a large volume of geospatial datasets in the server and access through internet with a web browser that lead to manipulation, visualization, interaction, and dissemination. The results revealed that there were 61 layers, which include district-wise shorelines, erosion, and accretion for Tiruvallur, Chennai, and Kanchipuram. These geospatial datasets in WebGIS showed that the dynamism on the morphological structure of the shorelines, over the Northern TN lost 1,925 ha and gained 1,578 ha due to erosion and accretion, respectively. It is reported that in this study spatial reduction in the coastline may be attributed to natural and anthropogenic activities. However, this research will be useful for various stakeholders, including coastal management authorities to formulate policies and to regulate the coastal development activities.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				DEC	2016	20	6					477	487		10.1007/s11852-016-0461-9								WOS:000389206900005						
J	Grilli, ST; Grosdidier, S; Guerin, CA				Grilli, Stephan T.; Grosdidier, Samuel; Guerin, Charles-Antoine			Tsunami Detection by High-Frequency Radar Beyond the Continental Shelf	PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS												Where coastal tsunami hazard is governed by near-field sources, such as submarine mass failures or meteo-tsunamis, tsunami propagation times may be too small for a detection based on deep or shallow water buoys. To offer sufficient warning time, it has been proposed to implement early warning systems relying on high-frequency (HF) radar remote sensing, that can provide a dense spatial coverage as far offshore as 200-300 km (e.g., for Diginext Ltd.'s Stradivarius radar). Shore-based HF radars have been used to measure nearshore currents (e.g., CODAR SeaSonde(A (R)) system;), by inverting the Doppler spectral shifts, these cause on ocean waves at the Bragg frequency. Both modeling work and an analysis of radar data following the Tohoku 2011 tsunami, have shown that, given proper detection algorithms, such radars could be used to detect tsunami-induced currents and issue a warning. However, long wave physics is such that tsunami currents will only rise above noise and background currents (i.e., be at least 10-15 cm/s), and become detectable, in fairly shallow water which would limit the direct detection of tsunami currents by HF radar to nearshore areas, unless there is a very wide shallow shelf. Here, we use numerical simulations of both HF radar remote sensing and tsunami propagation to develop and validate a new type of tsunami detection algorithm that does not have these limitations. To simulate the radar backscattered signal, we develop a numerical model including second-order effects in both wind waves and radar signal, with the wave angular frequency being modulated by a time-varying surface current, combining tsunami and background currents. In each "radar cell", the model represents wind waves with random phases and amplitudes extracted from a specified (wind speed dependent) energy density frequency spectrum, and includes effects of random environmental noise and background current; phases, noise, and background current are extracted from independent Gaussian distributions. The principle of the new algorithm is to compute correlations of HF radar signals measured/simulated in many pairs of distant "cells" located along the same tsunami wave ray, shifted in time by the tsunami propagation time between these cell locations; both rays and travel time are easily obtained as a function of long wave phase speed and local bathymetry. It is expected that, in the presence of a tsunami current, correlations computed as a function of range and an additional time lag will show a narrow elevated peak near the zero time lag, whereas no pattern in correlation will be observed in the absence of a tsunami current; this is because surface waves and background current are uncorrelated between pair of cells, particularly when time-shifted by the long-wave propagation time. This change in correlation pattern can be used as a threshold for tsunami detection. To validate the algorithm, we first identify key features of tsunami propagation in the Western Mediterranean Basin, where Stradivarius is deployed, by way of direct numerical simulations with a long wave model. Then, for the purpose of validating the algorithm we only model HF radar detection for idealized tsunami wave trains and bathymetry, but verify that such idealized case studies capture well the salient tsunami wave physics. Results show that, in the presence of strong background currents, the proposed method still allows detecting a tsunami with currents as low as 0.05 m/s, whereas a standard direct inversion based on radar signal Doppler spectra fails to reproduce tsunami currents weaker than 0.15-0.2 m/s. Hence, the new algorithm allows detecting tsunami arrival in deeper water, beyond the shelf and further away from the coast, and providing an early warning. Because the standard detection of tsunami currents works well at short range, we envision that, in a field situation, the new algorithm could complement the standard approach of direct near-field detection by providing a warning that a tsunami is approaching, at larger range and in greater depth. This warning would then be confirmed at shorter range by a direct inversion of tsunami currents, from which the magnitude of the tsunami would also estimated. Hence, both algorithms would be complementary. In future work, the algorithm will be applied to actual tsunami case studies performed using a state-of-the-art long wave model, such as briefly presented here in the Mediterranean Basin.																	0033-4553	1420-9136				DEC	2016	173	12					3895	3934		10.1007/s00024-015-1193-8								WOS:000388744000013

A remote sensing approach using airborne LiDAR on the Mediterranean coast	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												We examined the relationship between coastal habitats (sensu European Union Habitats Directive) and local dune morphology along a Mediterranean coastal dune system by integrating field collected vegetation data and remotely sensed imagery. Specifically, we described the morphological profile of each EC habitat based on the morphological variables that are most likely to affect their occurrence, including elevation, slope, curvature, northness, eastness and sea distance. In addition, we assessed the role and strength of each morphological variable in determining the occurrence of EC habitats. We used 394 random vegetation plots representative of six EC habitats (Habitat 1210: "Annual vegetation of drift lines"; Habitat 2110: "Embryonic shifting dunes"; Habitat 2120: "Shifting dunes along the shoreline with Ammophila arenaria"; Habitat 2210 and 2230: "Crucianellion maritimae fixed beach dunes" and "Malcolmietalia dune grasslands"; Habitat 2250: "Coastal dunes with Juniperus spp."; Habitat 2260: "Cisto-Lavanduletalia dune sclerophyllous scrubs") found along the Tyrrhenian coast of central Italy. We derived each morphological variable from a DTM (Digital Terrain Model) obtained from 2-m resolution LiDAR (Light Detection And Range) images. The mean value of each variable was calculated at different spatial scales using buffer areas of increasing radius (2 m, 4 m, 8 m) around each vegetation plot. Mean morphological values for each EC habitat were compared using Kruskal-Wallis rank test. The role and strength of the relationship between habitat type and the morphological variables were assessed using Generalized Linear Models. EC habitats occur differentially across dune morphology, and the role and strength of each morphological variable define habitat specificity. Dune elevation and sea distance were determined to be the key factors in shaping EC habitat occurrence along this section of the Mediterranean coast. Identification of the close relationship between habitat type and morphological variables deriving from airborne LiDAR imagery points to the high potential of such remote sensing tool for analyzing and monitoring the integrity of coastal dune ecosystems. As airborne LiDAR enables the rapid collection of extremely accurate topographic data over large areas, it also offers useful information for the management of these threatened and fragile ecosystems.

Three digisondes and one Doppler receiver located in East Asia were applied to investigate the far-field ionospheric response to the westward-propagating gravity waves generated by the earthquake. Based on time-period spectrum analysis, oscillations between 20 and 36 min on the f oF2 (critical frequency of F2 layer) curves and Doppler variations of each observation location were identified. The horizontal group speed, generation time, and source location estimated with the ray-tracing method all indicated that the periodic disturbances recorded by the four radio systems were gravity waves induced by the tsunami following the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. The plasma frequency variations at five fixed altitudes in the ionospheric F2 layer over I-Cheon were used to investigate the vertical propagation of the tsunami-associated gravity waves. The measured phase progression in the vertical direction was opposite that of the energy transport, which further confirmed that the recorded waves were atmospheric gravity waves. The use of multisite remote sensing for examining tsunami-induced waves in the ionosphere may open new perspectives in oceanic monitoring and future tsunami warning systems.																	0196-2892	1558-0644				DEC	2016	54	12					7177	7184		10.1109/TGRS.2016.2597165								WOS:000385713500030						
J	Wu, ST; Chen, YS				Wu, Shou-Tsung; Chen, Yeong-Shyang			Examining eco-environmental changes at major recreational sites in Kenting National Park in Taiwan by integrating SPOT satellite images and NDVI	TOURISM MANAGEMENT												The integration of remote sensing data and vegetation indices can enable the investigation of dynamic changes in ecological environments. This study utilized SPOT satellite images from different periods as raw materials and combined geographic information system (GIS), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and related statistical analyses to examine the condition of the ecological environment at the main terrestrial attractions of Kenting National Park in Taiwan. The results showed that changes in the ecological environment at the main attractions are presented to varying degrees on spatial-temporal scales. The changes are also relevant with respect to the numbers of artificial facilities and tourists. Moreover, change analysis via RGB WFM (write function memory insertion) can create spatial layouts for management. Well-conserved natural resources for sustainable development play a key role in attracting tourists. This study's investigation of the change in the main terrestrial attractions in the ecological environment of Kenting National Park may facilitate the preservation of natural resources.

J	O'Sadnick, M; Ingham, M; Eicken, H; Pettit, E				O'Sadnick, Megan; Ingham, Malcolm; Eicken, Hajo; Pettit, Erin			In situ field measurements of the temporal evolution of low-frequency sea-ice dielectric properties in relation to temperature, salinity, and microstructure	CRYOSPHERE												The seasonal evolution of sea-ice microstructure controls key ice properties, including those governing ocean-atmosphere heat and gas exchange, remote-sensing signatures, and the role of the ice cover as a habitat. Non-destructive in situ monitoring of sea-ice microstructure is of value for sea-ice research and operations but remains elusive to date. We examine the potential for the electric properties of sea ice, which is highly sensitive to the brine distribution within the ice, to serve as a proxy for microstructure and, hence, other ice transport properties. Throughout spring of 2013 and 2014, we measured complex dielectric permittivity in the range of 10 to 95 kHz in landfast ice off the coast of Barrow (Utqiagvik), Alaska. Temperature and salinity measurements and ice samples provide data to characterize ice microstructure in relation to these permittivity measurements. The results reveal a significant correlation between complex dielectric permittivity, brine volume fraction, and microstructural characteristics including pore volume and connectivity, derived from X-ray microtomography of core samples. The influence of temperature and salinity variations as well as the relationships between ice properties, microstructural characteristics, and dielectric behavior emerge from multivariate analysis of the combined data set. Our findings suggest some promise for low-frequency permittivity measurements to track seasonal evolution of a combination of mean pore volume, fractional connectivity, and pore surface area-to-volume ratio, which in turn may serve as proxies for key sea-ice transport properties.

J	Bernardello, R; Serrano, E; Coma, R; Ribes, M; Bahamon, N				Bernardello, Raffaele; Serrano, Eduard; Coma, Rafel; Ribes, Marta; Bahamon, Nixon			A comparison of remote-sensing SST and in situ seawater temperature in near-shore habitats in the western Mediterranean Sea	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Remote sensing of sea surface temperature (SST) is widely used in climate science because it provides a quasi-synoptic coverage of the ocean. However, the use of these data for near-shore habitats is hindered by the proximity of the coast, therefore further investigation is needed. We compared remote-sensing SST from the MODIS sensor (aboard the Aqua satellite) to near-shore seawater temperature (ST) recorded in situ with data loggers at 5 locations in the western Mediterranean Sea. In situ ST data were collected at 5 m depth over a similar to 6 yr period and at depths below 5 m at 3 of the locations. We evaluated the suitability of MODIS to represent the temperature at shallow subtidal depths relative to different modes of variability. MODIS reproduced seasonal variability with high correlations (r > 0.98) and biases (0.59 +/- 0.03 degrees C) only slightly higher than the accuracy of the loggers (0.50 degrees C). MODIS also captured interannual variability with no systematic biases. When evaluated for intra-seasonal temperature variability, MODIS showed limited biases (up to 0.79 degrees C) with a tendency to overestimate the variability (between 4 and 64%) in both cold and warm seasons. Finally, MODIS over-/underestimated only the most extreme unseasonably cold/warm events (by 1.51 and -0.79 degrees C, respectively). The observed limited differences between the 2 methods can be explained by the particular hydro dynamics of the area and by methodological constraints. Overall, MODIS SST data proved to be a reliable proxy for near-shore ST in the western Mediterranean Sea, and are thus considered suitable for studies requiring temperature reconstruction in shallow near-shore environments.

J	Baumstark, R; Duffey, R; Pu, RL				Baumstark, Rene; Duffey, Renee; Pu, Ruiliang			Mapping seagrass and colonized hard bottom in Springs Coast, Florida using WorldView-2 satellite imagery	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The offshore extent of seagrass habitat along the West Florida (USA) coast represents an important corridor for inshore-offshore migration of economically important fish and shellfish. Surviving at the fringe of light requirements, offshore seagrass beds are sensitive to changes in water clarity. Beyond and intermingled with the offshore seagrass areas are large swaths of colonized hard bottom. These offshore habitats of the West Florida coast have lacked mapping efforts needed for status and trends monitoring. The objective of this study was to propose an object-based classification method for mapping offshore habitats and to compare results to traditional photo-interpreted maps. Benthic maps were created from WorldView-2 satellite imagery using an Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) method and a visual photo interpretation method. A logistic regression analysis identified depth and distance from shore as significant parameters for discriminating spectrally similar seagrass and colonized hard bottom features. Seagrass, colonized hard bottom and unconsolidated sediment (sand) were mapped with 78% overall accuracy using the OBIA method compared to 71% overall accuracy using the photo-interpretation method. This study suggests an alternative for mapping deeper, offshore habitats capable of producing higher thematic and spatial resolution maps compared to those created with the traditional photo interpretation method.

Hence, understanding their distribution and abundance is important in order to assess the impact on native ecosystems. It is particularly important to be able to track the spread of invasive species across landscapes; a task best achieved using remotely sensed imagery. The availability of high resolution data, combined with efficient classification methods, can potentially improve early detection of invasive alien species thereby enhancing their management. This study aims to classifywoody species with a focus on Melia azedarach (Meliaceae) trees in a moderately invaded coastal belt valley on the east coast of South Africa using WorldView-2 (WV-2) satellite imagery, and to compare the commonly used pixel-based classification with object-oriented approaches. The results show that object-oriented approaches are more suitable for classifying woody species, as well as other land cover classes when using high-resolution WV-2 imagery. The overall accuracy was 90% by object oriented classification, while the pixel-based classification gave an overall accuracy of 78%. For Melia, a producer accuracy of 92% and user accuracy of 91% was obtained by object-oriented classification and a producer accuracy of 85% and user accuracy of 83% was obtained by pixel-based classification. Hence the combined use of new generation sensor imagery and the employment of object-oriented image classification techniques provided more accurate information on Melia invasion in the study area. This is an encouraging result given the high degree of intermingling of Melia with other plants at the study site. In particular, the vegetation maps produced from this study would aid in gathering accurate knowledge about the distribution and spreading status of Melia, a major invasive species over large areas of South Africa and elsewhere in the world.

Citizen-based contributions can fill observational gaps and increase environmental stewardship amongst the public. For this purpose, tools and methods for citizen science need to (1) complement existing datasets; and (2) be affordable, while appealing to different user and developer groups. In this article, tools and methods developed in the 7th Framework Programme of European Union (EU FP 7) funded project Citclops (citizens' observatories for coast and ocean optical monitoring) are reviewed. Tools range from a stand-alone smartphone app to devices with Arduino and 3-D printing, and hence are attractive to a diversity of users; from the general public to more specified maker-and open labware movements. Standardization to common water quality parameters and methods allows long-term storage in regular marine data repositories, such as SeaDataNet and EMODnet, thereby providing open data access. Due to the given intercomparability to existing remote sensing datasets, these tools are ready to complement the marine datapool. In the future, such combined satellite and citizen observations may set measurements by the engaged public in a larger context and hence increase their individual meaning. In a wider sense, a synoptic use can support research, management authorities, and societies at large.				van der Woerd, Hans/K-9812-2013; Simon, Carine/L-1219-2014	van der Woerd, Hans/0000-0002-8901-7567; Simon, Carine/0000-0001-9951-5132; Bardaji, Raul/0000-0002-0803-3427; Piera, Jaume/0000-0001-5818-9836; Wernand, Marcel R./0000-0002-1331-9569												2072-4292					NOV	2016	8	11							879	10.3390/rs8110879								WOS:000388798400001

RUNE aims at reducing the uncertainty of the near-shore wind resource estimates from model outputs by using lidar, ocean, and satellite observations. Here, we concentrate on describing the lidar measurements. The campaign was conducted from November 2015 to February 2016 on the west coast of Denmark and comprises measurements from eight lidars, an ocean buoy and three types of satellites. The wind speed was estimated based on measurements from a scanning lidar performing PPIs, two scanning lidars performing dual synchronized scans, and five vertical profiling lidars, of which one was operating offshore on a floating platform. The availability of measurements is highest for the profiling lidars, followed by the lidar performing PPIs, those performing the dual setup, and the lidar buoy. Analysis of the lidar measurements reveals good agreement between the estimated 10-min wind speeds, although the instruments used different scanning strategies and measured different volumes in the atmosphere. The campaign is characterized by strong westerlies with occasional storms.

However, only a handful of studies have documented the PSD variability in different regions. Here, we investigate the PSD properties and variability in two shallow and semi-enclosed seas (the Bohai Sea (BS) and Yellow Sea (YS)), using in situ laser diffraction measurements (LISST-100X Type C) and other measurements at 79 stations in November 2013. The results show large variability in particle concentrations (in both volume and number concentrations), with volume concentrations varying by 57-fold. The median particle diameter (D-v(50)) from each of the water samples also covers a large range (22.4-307.0 mu m) and has an irregular statistical distribution, indicating complexity in the PSD. The PSD slopes (2.7-4.5), estimated from a power-law model, cover nearly the entire range reported previously for natural waters. Small mineral particles (with large PSD slopes) are characteristic of near-shore waters prone to sediment resuspension by winds and tides, while large biological particles (with small PSD slopes) dominate the total suspended particulates for waters away from the coast. For the BS and YS, this study provides the first report on the properties and spatial variability of the PSD, which may influence the optical properties of the ocean surface and remote sensing algorithms that are based on estimations of particle concentrations and sizes.

J	Zhang, QW; Su, SL				Zhang, Qianwen; Su, Shiliang			Determinants of urban expansion and their relative importance: A comparative analysis of 30 major metropolitans in China	HABITAT INTERNATIONAL												Metropolitan has progressively emerged as a new form of urban governance. Understanding the urban expansion process and its determinants at metropolitan level should provide critical references for urban management and planning. Using time-series nighttime stable light data (1993-2012), this paper captures the full continuum of urban expansion process in 30 major metropolitans of China. Greater expansion intensity and faster expansion speed are observed in metropolitans along the eastern coast. Conversely, the metropolitans in northeastern China exhibit lower urban expansion intensity and speed. Potential determinants are selected based on extensive literature review from four categories: economic, social, demographic, and natural. Multivariable linear regression and variances partitioning are employed to identify and compare the determinants of urban expansion and their relative importance across the 30 metropolitans. Results show that urban expansion is not only subjected to different categories of determinants but also influenced by their combinations. More specifically, the identified determinants vary with metropolitans but present some similarities. Economic growth, industrial development, and economic structural transformation are the key economic determinants. Population and labor growth, population urbanization, and population structure act as essential demographic determinants. Primary social determinants include infrastructure construction, energy consumption, and real estate development, while dominant natural determinants are the amount and topology of available land. Cluster analysis is further applied and it generates three major driving forces profiles among the 30 metropolitans, with respect to the relative importance of different categories of determinants and their combinations. The driving force profiles should be useful for managers to set priorities in decision making procedure and develop optimal urban strategies. Our study is believed to advance the understanding of driving mechanism governing urban expansion at metropolitan level and further provide deeper spatial insights for international habitat research.

Its severity, demonstrated by extreme aerosol optical depth in the atmosphere in the 99th percentile compared to historical data, was attributed to the ongoing regional conflict. However, surface meteorological and remote sensing data, as well as regional climate model simulations, support an alternative hypothesis: the historically unprecedented aridity played a more prominent role, as evidenced by unusual climatic and meteorological conditions prior to and during the storm. Remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index demonstrates that vegetation cover was high in 2015 relative to the prior drought and conflict periods, suggesting that agricultural activity was not diminished during that year, thus negating the media narrative. Instead, meteorological simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model show that the storm was associated with a cyclone and 'Shamal' winds, typical for dust storm generation in this region, that were immediately followed by an unusual wind reversal at low levels that spread dust west to the Mediterranean Coast. These unusual meteorological conditions were aided by a significant reduction in the critical shear stress due to extreme dry and hot conditions, thereby enhancing dust availability for erosion during this storm. Concluding, unusual aridity, combined with unique synoptic weather patterns, enhanced dust emission and westward long-range transport across the region, thus generating the extreme storm.

Remote-Sensed Mapping of Sargassum spp. Distribution around Rottnest Island, Western Australia, Using High-Spatial Resolution WorldView-2 Satellite Data	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Satellite remote sensing is one of the most efficient techniques for marine habitat studies in shallow coastal waters, especially in clear waters where field observations can be easily carried out. However, such in situ observations have certain limitations: they are time consuming, have a limited ability to capture spatial variability, and require an interdisciplinary approach between marine biologists and remote-sensing specialists. The main objective of this study was to survey and map Sargassum beds around Rottnest Island, Western Australia, through a combination of high spatial resolution WorldView-2 imagery, using a validated depth invariant index model for water-column correction, and in-field observations. The combination of field survey data and four classification methods resulted in highly accurate classification outcomes that showed the distribution patterns of Sargassum spp. around Rottnest Island during the austral spring season (October 2013). Overall, the minimum distance and Mahalanobis classifiers yielded the highest overall accuracy rates of 98.32% (kappa coefficient, kappa = 0.96) and 98.30% (kappa = 0.96), respectively. The K-means classification method gave the lowest accuracy percentage of 42.50% (kappa = 0.22). Thus, the primary results of this study provide useful baseline information that is necessary for marine-conservation strategic planning and the sustainable utilization of brown macroalgae resources around the Western Australian coast.

This study focuses on the detection and analysis of historical changes in shoreline position of the Bay of Jijel (East -Algeria) occurred between 1960 and 2014. Shoreline changes along the Bay of Jijel were studied from multi-dated aerial photographs (1960, 1973 and 1988) and Quick-bird satellite image (2014). The correction of aerial photographs and satellite image was carried out using the remote sensing tools and Geographic Information System "GIS". To attain our objective, the study area was divided into three sectors for analysis: (1) the beaches of Jijel, Tassoust in the western sector, (2) the central area encompasses beaches of El Kanar, El Mzair and SidiAbdelaziz, (3) the eastern sector contains the beaches of El Djnah and Beni Belaid. Net rates changes of shoreline position in time were calculated from several statistical methods End Point Rates (EPR), Linear Regression Rates (LRR) and Weighted Linear Regression (WLR). These net rates of coastline changes have been calculated, also, on three intervals of times (1960-1973, 1973-1988 and 1988-2014) and on a period (mid-centennial) of 54 years (1960-2014). The result shows that the study area is almost stable between 1960 and 1973 with a rate of change equal to 0.072 miyear. This rate of change, has negatively increased during episodes time 1973-1988 and 1988-2014, with average values of 0.125 miyear and 0.85 miyear, respectively. Over a mid-secular period, the coast has experienced an average net rate global of changes equal to 0.459 m/year. This recession Of the coastline' is due to the combined action of the cumulative effects of stormy climate of the coast and various human actions on the Jijelian coastal strip. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Bai, P; Gu, YZ; Li, PL; Wu, KJ				Bai Peng; Gu Yanzhen; Li Peiliang; Wu Kejian			Modelling the upwelling offthe east Hainan Island coast in summer 2010	CHINESE JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY												A synoptic-scale upwelling event that developed offthe east coast of the Hainan Island (EHIU) in the summer of 2010 is defined well via processing the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sea surface temperature (SST) data. The Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) with high spatial resolution has been used to investigate this upwelling event. By comparing the ROMS results against tide station data, Argo float profiles and MODIS SST, it is confirmed that the ROMS reproduces the EHIU well. The cooler-water core (CWC) distinguished by waters < 27.5A degrees C in the EHIU, which occurred in the east Qiongzhou Strait mouth area and was bounded by a high temperature gradient, was the focus of this paper. Vertical structure of the CWC suggests that interaction between the westward flow and the bathymetry slope played a significant role in the formation of CWC. Numerical experiments indicated that the westward flow in the Qiongzhou Strait was the result of tidal rectification over variable topography (Shi et al., 2002), thus tides played a critical role on the development of the CWC. The negative wind stress curl that dominated the east Qiongzhou Strait mouth area suppressed the intensity of the CWC by 0.2-0.4A degrees C. Further, nonlinear interaction between tidal currents and wind stress enhanced vertical mixing greatly, which would benefit the development of the CWC.																	0254-4059	1993-5005				NOV	2016	34	6					1358	1373		10.1007/s00343-016-5147-5								WOS:000382885200020

Optimum Interpolation (OI) of daily SST data were extracted from the United States (US) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and data for wind speed and direction were from the US National Climatic Data Center. Time series were extracted at a daily frequency for a time horizon of 26 years. Upwelling indices were estimated using westerly (Q(x)) and southerly (Q(y)) Ekman transport components. In the first part of the study, time series were inspected for trend and seasonality over the whole period. The seasonally adjusted time series revealed an increasing slope for SST (0.15 degrees C per decade) and decreasing slopes for Q(x) (84.01 m(3) s(-1) km(-1) per decade) and Q(y) (-25.20 m(3) s(-1) km(-1) per decade), over the time horizon. Structural breaks analysis applied to the time series showed that a statistically significant incremental increase in SST was more pronounced during the last decade. Cross -correlation between upwelling indices and SST revealed a time delay of 5 and 2 days between Q(x) and SST, and between Qv and SST, respectively. A spectral analysis combined with the previous analysis enabled the identification of four oceanographic seasons. Those seasons were later recognised over a restricted time period of 4 years, between 2008 and 2012, when there was an extensive sampling programme for the validation of ocean colour remote sensing imagery. The seasons were defined as: summer, with intense and regular events of upwelling; autumn, indicating relaxation of upwelling conditions; and spring and winter, showing high inter annual variability in terms of number and intensity of upwelling events.

Annual down-glacier drainage of lakes and water-filled crevasses at Helheim Glacier, southeast Greenland	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Supraglacial lake drainage events are common on the Greenland ice sheet. Observations on the west coast typically show an up-glacier progression of drainage as the annual melt extent spreads inland. We use a suite of remote sensing and modeling techniques in order to study a series of lakes and water-filled crevasses within 20 km of the terminus of Helheim Glacier, southeast Greenland. Automatic classification of surface water areas shows a down-glacier progression of drainage, which occurs in the majority of years between 2007 and 2014. We demonstrate that a linear elastic fracture mechanics model can reliably predict the drainage of the uppermost supraglacial lake in the system but cannot explain the pattern of filling and draining observed in areas of surface water downstream. We propose that the water levels in crevasses downstream of the supraglacial lake can be explained by a transient high-pressure wave passing through the subglacial system following the lake drainage. We support this hypothesis with analysis of the subglacial hydrological conditions, which can explain both the position and interannual variation in filling order of these crevasses. Similar behavior has been observed in association with jokulhaups, surging glaciers, and Antarctic subglacial lakes but has not previously been observed on major outlets of the Greenland ice sheet. Our results suggest that the behavior of near-terminus surface water may differ considerably from that of inland supraglacial lakes, with the potential for basal water pressures to influence the presence of surface water in crevasses close to the terminus of tidewater glaciers.

Recent Advances (2008-2015) in the Study of Ground Ice and Cryostratigraphy	PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES												Cryostratigraphy involves the description, interpretation and correlation of ground-ice structures (cryostructures) and their relationship to the host deposits. Recent advances in the study of ground ice and cryostratigraphy concern permafrost aggradation and degradation, massive-ice formation and evaluation of ground-ice content. Field studies have increased our knowledge of cryostructures and massive ground ice in epigenetic and syngenetic permafrost. Epigenetic permafrost deposits are relatively ice-poor and composed primarily of pore-filled cryostructures, apart from an ice-enriched upper section and intermediate layer. Syngenetic permafrost deposits are commonly identified from cryostructures indicative of an aggrading permafrost table and are characterised by a high ice content, ice-rich cryofacies and nested wedge ice. Degradation of ice-rich permafrost can be marked by thaw unconformities, truncated buried ice wedges, ice-wedge pseudomorphs and organic-rich forest beds'. Studies of massive ground ice have focused on wedge ice, thermokarst-cave ice, intrusive ice and buried ice. Significant advances have been made in methods for differentiating between tabular massive-ice bodies of glacier and intrasedimental origin. Recent studies have utilised palynology, isotope geochemistry and hydrochemistry, in addition to sedimentary and cryostratigraphic analyses. The application of remote sensing techniques and laboratory methods such as computed tomography scanning has improved estimations of the ice content of frozen sediments.

In this study, a total of 50 Landsat 8 operational land imager (OLI) images were used to analyze the geological features and spectral characteristics of the Nansha reefs. The exposed islands/sandbanks, reef flats and sub-tidal reefs were identified with the near-infrared band, the red and green bands, and the blue band, respectively. Based on the relationships among various characteristics and bands illustrated in the OLI images, the maximum between-cluster variance threshold algorithm (OTSU method) and the mathematical morphology were employed to extract characteristic parameters of the spatial geometry of the reefs from top to bottom, which were subsequently operated by a series of post-processing methods such as vectorization, simplification and topological analysis. Among the 132 standalone reefs and 16 atolls that are identified in the study, four reefs have yet to be named in the Standard Names of Various Islands in the South China Sea and the website Nansha Islands Online (http://www.nansha.org/). Another 24 ones are exposed to the atmosphere even during high tides. Taiping Island with an area of 0.57 km(2) represents the largest exposed geological feature. This study demonstrated the applicability of medium-resolution satellite images to derive the coral reef information effectively and thus provided information for the related departments that are responsible to manage the coast. An improved resolution of multispectral bands with the panchromatic band in higher spatial resolution (15 m for OLI image) is expected to provide an optimum satellite based approach to map marine habitats.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				OCT	2016	35	10					11	19		10.1007/s13131-016-0898-6								WOS:000385152000002

Performance of operational satellite bio-optical algorithms in different water types in the southeastern Arabian Sea	OCEANOLOGIA												The in situ remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) and optically active substances (OAS) measured using hyperspectral radiometer, were used for optical classification of coastal waters in the southeastern Arabian Sea. The spectral R-rs showed three distinct water types, that were associated with the variability in OAS such as chlorophyll-a (chl-a), chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and volume scattering function at 650 nm (beta(650)). The water types were classified as Type-I, Type-II and Type-III respectively for the three R-rs spectra. The Type-I waters showed the peak R-rs in the blue band (470 nm), whereas in the case of Type-II and III waters the peak R-rs was at 560 and 570 nm respectively. The shifting of the peak R-rs at the longer wavelength was due to an increase in concentration of OAS. Further, we evaluated six bio-optical algorithms (OC3C, OC4O, OC4, OC4E, OC3M and OC4O2) used operationally to retrieve chl-a from Coastal Zone Colour Scanner (CZCS), Ocean Colour Temperature Scanner (OCTS), Sea-viewing Wide Field-of- view Sensor (SeaWiFS), MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM2). For chl-a concentration greater than 1.0 mg m(-3), algorithms based on the reference band ratios 488/510/520 nm to 547/550/555/560/565 nm have to be considered. The assessment of algorithms showed better performance of OC3M and OC4. All the algorithms exhibited better performance in Type-I waters. However, the performance was poor in Type-II and Type-III waters which could be attributed to the significant co-variance of chl-a with CDOM.

Its habitats are highly productive and harbour high standing stocks and densities of benthic species, well adapted to the demanding environmental conditions. Therefore, the Wadden Sea is one of the most important areas for migratory birds in the world and thus protected by national and international legislation, which amongst others requires extensive monitoring. Due to the inaccessibility of major areas of the Wadden Sea, a classification approach based on optical and radar remote sensing has been developed to support environmental monitoring programmes. In this study, the general classification framework as well as two specific monitoring cases, mussel beds and seagrass meadows, are presented. The classification of mussel beds profits highly from inclusion of radar data due to their rough surface and achieves agreements of up to 79 % with areal data from the regular monitoring programme. Classification of seagrass meadows reaches even higher agreements with monitoring data ( up to 100 %) and furthermore captures seagrass densities as low as 10 %. The main classification results are information on area and location of individual habitats. These are needed to fulfil environmental legislation requirements. One of the major advantages of this approach is the large areal coverage with individual satellite images, allowing simultaneous assessment of both accessible and inaccessible areas and thus providing a more complete overall picture.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				OCT	2016	188	10							595	10.1007/s10661-016-5591-x								WOS:000384330800053	27681444

To achieve this, the land cover of this protected area was determined by classifying satellite images obtained before, during and after the conflicts, and via ground surveys. Metrics of landscape ecology were calculated. A ground campaign for observing the CFHS's flora and damages incurred was carried out using a sampling of eighteen 500 m-long transects. The results show that forest fragmentation intensified during and after the period of conflicts. Forests covered over 93% of the CFHS's area before conflicts and under 28% in 2015. The main cause of this deforestation is cacao growing. Anthropic activities caused the loss of 40% of plant species, including some which are endemic in Ivory Coast. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Aimed to reveal the regional difference of coast land use in the Bohai Sea, series remote sensing images of HJ-1ACCD obtained in July of 2013 were employed to monitor land use in 5 km coastal zone of 13 regions around the Bohai Sea. Some evaluation index, such as dominant land use type, land use dominant index and land use intensity index were established to evaluate the regional difference of land use in the coast zone. The result shows: there exist obviously regional differences in coast land use around the Bohai Sea. Some regions such as Huludao and Yantai are typical farmland landscape. Some regions such as Dongying and Panjin are typical reed wetland landscape, While Cangzhou is typical fishpond landscape, Weifang and Binzhou are typical salt pond landscape. Land use in coast of Huludao, Yantai and Weifang are single dominated structure, the dominant land use type are farmland in Huludao and Yantai. It is salt pond in Weifang. Their dominant index is all above 0.34. Land use in coast of Tianjin, Qinhudao and other 8 regions are dual structure. The dominant index of dominant land use type ranged from 0.10 to 0.30. The land use intensity index is biggest in coast of Tianjin and Cangzhou with value 2.15 and 2.12, respectively.																	1380-7501	1573-7721				OCT	2016	75	19					12061	12075		10.1007/s11042-016-3334-1								WOS:000382678200027						
J	Good, E				Good, Elizabeth			Satellite observations of surface temperature during the March 2015 total solar eclipse	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES												The behaviour of remotely sensed land surface temperatures (LSTs) from the spinning-enhanced visible and infrared imager (SEVIRI) during the total solar eclipse of 20 March 2015 is analysed over Europe. LST is found to drop by up to several degrees Celcius during the eclipse, with the minimum LST occurring just after the eclipse mid-point (median=+1.5 min). The drop in LST is typically larger than the drop in near-surface air temperatures reported elsewhere, and correlates with solar obscuration (r=-0.47; larger obscuration = larger LST drop), eclipse duration (r=-0.62; longer duration = larger LST drop) and time (r=+0.37; earlier eclipse = larger LST drop). Locally, the LST drop is also correlated with vegetation (up to r=+0.6), with smaller LST drops occurring over more vegetated surfaces. The LSTs at locations near the coast and at higher elevation are also less affected by the eclipse. This study covers the largest area and uses the most observations of eclipse-induced surface temperature drops to date, and is the first full characterization of satellite LST during an eclipse (known to the author). The methods described could be applied to Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) LST data over North America during the August 2017 total solar eclipse.

Global detection of absorbing aerosols over the ocean in the red and near-infrared spectral region	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The spatial and temporal variability of the aerosol single scattering albedo (SSA at 865nm) has been estimated over clear-sky ocean for 2006 by using measurements acquired by POLDER (Polarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectances). Our estimates are correlated with Sun photometer retrievals (R = 0.63). Differences in SSA are generally around 0.05 and systematically fall below 0.055 for optical thicknesses 0.3 (at 865nm) and modeling errors 3.0%. Fine absorbing aerosols (radius 0.16m) are detected in many coastal regions. The lowest SSAs are retrieved over the southeast Atlantic during summer (0.80), whereas nonabsorbing fine particles (0.98) are observed over the North Pacific. During winter, fine absorbing aerosols are detected together with mineral dust near the coasts of western Africa (0.90), over the tropical Atlantic (0.88), and around India (0.88). Long-range transport of absorbing species is also detected, as for instance over the Arctic. This study could help to constrain aerosol absorption and radiative forcing in models.																	2169-897X	2169-8996				SEP 27	2016	121	18					10902	10918		10.1002/2016JD025163								WOS:000385836000004

Oil spills can be detected using some type of remote sensing data such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, but to determine of oil-spill origin is difficult. Oil spill hindcast models are commonly used to simulate the origin points. Surface winds, surface currents and random walk are three major parameters in the oil hindcast process. In coastal regions, the parameters are affected by offshore bathymetry, local weather, etc. In particular, random walk is more sensitive to the traits of coastal regions. However, most state-of-the-art hindcast models use an empirical and constant value for conducting random walk. In this paper, a random walk parameterization hindcast method (RWPHM) for the Bohai Sea is proposed, in which random walk is initially parameterized and combined with remote sensing data and oil-spill models. The backward-in-time method is validated using data for the Penglai 19-3 spill accident observed between June 11 and 19, 2011. The results confirm that the accuracy of random walk is significant for improving the accuracy of oil-spill hindcasting. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Rondeau-Genesse, G; Trudel, M; Leconte, R				Rondeau-Genesse, Gabriel; Trudel, Melanie; Leconte, Robert			Monitoring snow wetness in an Alpine Basin using combined C-band SAR and MODIS data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												MODIS is a reliable means of monitoring the snow cover extent over an entire river basin. However, it displays a few significant limitations for hydrologic forecasting, such as the inability to distinguish dry snow from wet snow, which could be addressed by the use of a technology such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR). This study is based on the Nechako River basin, located in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia (Canada), where the snowpack can reach several meters in depth. Fifteen RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR Wide images were obtained in VV + VH polarization between the months of March and July 2012 and sixteen SENTINEL-1A IW images were obtained in W polarization between the months of February and June 2015. They were processed with an algorithm based on Nagler and Rott's methodology, but which employs a soft threshold to separate wet snow from dry snow instead of the -3 dB hard threshold used in their method. The wet snow probability maps from this technique correspond better to the uncertainties caused by the coniferous forest found throughout the river basin. They were combined with the MODIS snow-covered area (SCA) product to exploit its ability to accurately detect the snow cover extent. The wet snow probability was also cross-referenced with the MODIS SCA product to remove discrepancies caused by forested areas or waterlogged soil. When compared to the snow metamorphism model SURFEX-Crocus at the location of the snow pillows of the basin, the combined product improves the detection of snow from 81.7 to 915% compared to MODIS alone. It also reliably distinguishes wet snow, dry snow, and snow free conditions with an accuracy of 77.6%. Moreover, an agreement of 72.4% was established between this product and the MODIS Land Surface Temperature. As an example of the future application of this work for watershed management, the current dataset was used to successfully detect snowmelt and predict the peak inflow occurrence in the Nechako reservoir for the 2012 and 2015 winters.

J	Wang, XJ; Key, J; Kwok, R; Zhang, JL				Wang, Xuanji; Key, Jeffrey; Kwok, Ron; Zhang, Jinlun			Comparison of Arctic Sea Ice Thickness from Satellites, Aircraft, and PIOMAS Data	REMOTE SENSING												In this study, six Arctic sea ice thickness products are compared: the AVHRR Polar Pathfinder-extended (APP-x), ICESat, CryoSat-2, SMOS, NASA IceBridge aircraft flights, and the Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS). The satellite products are based on three different retrieval methods: an energy budget approach, measurements of ice freeboard, and the relationship between passive microwave brightness temperatures and thin ice thickness. Inter-comparisons are done for the periods of overlap from 2003 to 2013. Results show that ICESat sea ice is thicker than APP-x and PIOMAS overall, particularly along the north coast of Greenland and Canadian Archipelago. The relative differences of APP-x and PIOMAS with ICESat are -0.48 m and -0.31 m, respectively. APP-x underestimates thickness relative to CryoSat-2, with a mean difference of -0.19 m. The biases for APP-x, PIOMAS, and CryoSat-2 relative to IceBridge thicknesses are 0.18 m, 0.18 m, and 0.29 m. The mean difference between SMOS and CryoSat-2 for 0 similar to 1 m thick ice is 0.13 m in March and -0.24 m in October. All satellite-retrieved ice thickness products and PIOMAS overestimate the thickness of thin ice (1 m or less) compared to IceBridge for which SMOS has the smallest bias (0.26 m). The spatial correlation between the datasets indicates that APP-x and PIOMAS are the most similar, followed by APP-x and CryoSat-2.

Detecting Fluvial Wood in Forested Watersheds using LiDAR Data: A Methodological Assessment	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												It has long been known that large wood in rivers increases channel complexity and is a primary driver of geomorphic change in forested mountain streams in the Pacific Northwest. Studies analyzing the presence and distribution of fluvial wood are often limited in their spatial extents to the site or reach scales because of the intensive fieldwork required for comprehensive wood surveys. Remote sensing techniques are beginning to allow researchers to assess fluvial wood dynamics and distributions on a basin or regional scale. We used 2009 high-resolution light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point cloud data to detect and quantify wood within five forested watersheds in the Oregon Coast Range. We filtered the LiDAR data to remove the forest canopy over the stream channel and visually inventoried fluvial wood based on its distinct shape within the channels. We derived several wood and stream morphometric variables to test theories relating to wood abundance and positioning in the lower reaches of streams. We were able to detect fluvial wood with confidence; however, validation of results with ground-truth data was difficult in the study due to the dynamic and mobile nature of wood through time. We mapped a total of 163 single logs and 55 logjams within the five study watersheds. We did not find statistically significant differences between individual pieces and jam positioning in relation to slope; however, the surveyed wood was often found in areas of lower stream power. This research shows that it is possible to use height-filtered LiDAR to detect in-stream wood in densely forested watersheds and has the potential to be employed in future wood studies across broad spatial scales.

Although the timing and magnitude of high turbidity water export affect the coastal marine environment, for example, through impacts on biological productivity, little is known about the characteristics of this high turbidity water. In this paper, we therefore report on the spatial and temporal variations in high turbidity water off the Thule region in northwestern Greenland, based on remote sensing, reflectance data at a wavelength of 555 nm (Rrs555). The high turbidity area, identified on the basis of high reflectivity (Rrs555 >= 0.0070 sr(-1)), was generally distributed near the coast, where many outlet glaciers terminate in the ocean and on land. The extent of the high turbidity area exhibited substantial seasonal and interannual variability, and its annual maximum extent was significantly correlated with summer air temperature. Assuming a linear relationship between the high turbidity area and summer temperature, annual maximum extent increases under the influence of increasing glacial meltwater discharge, as can be inferred from present and predicted future warming trends.

Erosion of the Arctic coasts composed by fine-grained permafrost turns coastlines into badlands dozens of meters wide and is harmful to the coastal infrastructure. Regional-level variations in the coastal retreat rate in the Arctic tend to follow the climate change dynamics and its consequences, mainly the shrinkage of the perennial sea ice area. This study considers the lower level local-scale variability linked to permafrost features, lithology, and morphology of the coasts in the remote region on the western shore of the Bering Sea within Lorino settlement (Chukotka, Russia). The coastal dynamics was tracked by means of geodesy and remote sensing in 2012-14, and the archival engineering survey data available since 1967. We have derived the erodibility of sediments from the conventional soil properties measured by engineers, and linked the coastal retreat rates to erodibility of the sediments, so that it could be extrapolated to other coastal areas of Eastern Chukotka with similar sediment structure.

The results show that land use along the eastern coast of Laizhou bay has been significantly changed in the recent 50 years. The main evolution trend is the transition from aeolian sandy land, woodland and farmland to aquaculture ponds and residential land since the early 1990s. A belt zone of aquaculture facility parallel to the coastline has been formed and dykes are constructed along the outside of the coastal aquiculture zone. The significant land cover change in the supratidal zone has profoundly modified the boundary conditions of storm surges. The hydrodynamic modeling results show that the ocean dynamics near the coastline are enhanced and caused severe erosion of the coastline, beach and underwater coastal sea slope along the eastern coast of Laizhou Bay over the recent 30 years.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SEP	2016					74		83	94		10.2112/SI74-008.1								WOS:000383795300009

Coastline changes over the last 70 years were then analyzed in terms of coastline structure, coastline fractals, coastline change rates, land-sea patterns, and bay areas. The results showed that mainland coastline structure changed dramatically, and due to the significant coastline artificialization mainly driven by sea reclamation and coastal engineering, the remaining natural coastline merely accounts for less than one third at present. Coastline fractal dimension represented an overall spatial pattern of "north < entirety < south"; however, the discrepancy between the north and south coast was apparently narrowed due to dramatic coastline artificialization of northern China which in turn altered the whole pattern. Patterns and processes of land-sea interchange along the mainland coast were complex and varied spatially and temporally, with over 68% advancing toward sea and 22% retreating toward land. The net growth of land area was nearly 14.2 x10(3) km(2) with an average growth rate of 202.82 km(2) a(-1); and coast retreat was characterized by area decrease of 93 bays with a magnitude of 10.1 x10(3) km(2) and an average shrinking rate up to 18.19% or an average shrinking speed up to 144.20 km(2) a(-1), among which the total area of Bohai shrunk by 7.06%, with an average annual loss amounting to 82 km(2). The dramatic coastline changes along mainland China have brought about kinds of challenges to the coastal environment, therefore the integrated management, effective environment protection and sustainable utilization of coastlines is urgent.																	1674-7313	1869-1897				SEP	2016	59	9					1791	1802		10.1007/s11430-016-5317-5								WOS:000382669900008						
J	Kordi, MN; O'Leary, M				Kordi, Moataz N.; O'Leary, Michael			Geomorphic classification of coral reefs in the north western Australian shelf	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												Coral reefs occur extensively along the northwest Australian continental shelf in the Kimberley Bioregion (KIM), forming major geomorphic features along and just off the coast. These reefs have not been studied in as much detail as the offshore reefs and are poorly known due to the coastal conditions, including extremely high tide regimes, high turbidity and complex coastline morphology. This study aims to establish a regional-scale distribution map of exposed and intertidal reefs of the KIM and to classify the Kimberley reefs into types, adopting widely recognised reef classification and typology schemes. Remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) were used in this study to process and produce digital maps as well as to provide some of the first detailed spatial analysis of reef distribution. Outcomes of this study showed that the Kimberley reefs possess strong morphological complexity and clear regional patterns. The study revealed that the number of Kimberley reefs and their area are considerably (60%) greater than previously thought; the total combined reefal area is approximately 1,950 km(2). Fringing reefs have been identified as the dominant reef type and are widely distributed throughout the KIM. It was also found that tidal range affected the distribution of reef geomorphologies. The outcomes of this study will contribute to a better understanding of the Kimberley reefs, and provide marine park managers with essential and quality scientific information so that better management decisions can be made in this area.

Surface suspended matter (SSM) and sea surface temperature (SST) in the East China Seas from December 2009 to November 2010 has been extracted from the satellite NOAA-19 AVHRR/3. We have monitored the change of the SSM diffusion during summer half-year and winter half-year. High SSM areas occur in the inshore of the Liaodong Bay, Bohai Bay, Yellow River Delta, Shandong Peninsula, Jiangsu Coast and Yangtze Estuary, especially blooming in winter half-year. Going by our findings, the sediment provenance influences the SSM distribution, and the current system and monsoon are important factors that drive the SSM diffusion all year round. In winter half-year, the ocean colour images show that the current system is well developed. The SSMs are transported southeastward, and a part reaching the outer continental shelf is captured by the Kuroshio Current before it finally reaches the open Pacific Ocean through the Tokara Strait. Some SSMs are transported by the Yellow Sea and Tsushima Warm Current into the Yellow Sea and Japan Sea. In summer half-year, most of the SSM could not reach the continental shelf break and only little SSM could be captured by the Kuroshio Current into the open ocean.

J	Yi, KP; Bao, YL				Yi, Kunpeng; Bao, Yulong			Estimates of Wildfire Emissions in Boreal Forests of China	FORESTS												Wildfire emissions in the boreal forests yield an important contribution to the chemical budget of the troposphere. To assess the contribution of wildfire to the emissions of atmospheric trace species in the Great Xing'an Mountains (GXM), which is also the most severe fire-prone boreal forest region in China, we estimated various wildfire activities by combining explicit spatio-temporal remote sensing data with fire-induced emission models. We observed 9998 fire scars with 46,096 km(2) in the GXM between the years 1986 and 2010. The years 1987 and 2003 contributed 33.2% and 22.9%, respectively, in burned area during the 25 years. Fire activity is the strongest in May. Most large fires occurred in the north region of the GXM between 50 degrees N and 54 degrees N latitude due to much drier weather and higher fire danger in the northern region than in the southern region of the study domain. Evergreen and deciduous needleleaf forest and deciduous broadleaf forest are the main sources of emissions, accounting for 84%, 81%, 84%, 87%, 89%, 86%, 85% and 74% of the total annual CO2, CH4, CO, PM10, PM2.5, SO2, BC and NOx emissions, respectively. Wildfire emissions from shrub, grassland and cropland only account for a small fraction of the total emissions level (approximately 4%-11%). Comparisons of our results with other published estimates of wildfire emissions show reasonable agreement.																	1999-4907					AUG	2016	7	8							158	10.3390/f7080158								WOS:000382470000007

Habitat and distribution predictions for marine fishery species under climate change scenarios are important for understanding the overall impacts of such global changes on the human society and on the ecosystem. In this study, we examine the impacts of climate change on anchovy fisheries off Chile using predicted changes in global models according to the National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate System Model 3.0 (CCSM3) and IPCC high future CO2 emission scenario A2, habitat suitability index (HSI) models and satellite-based sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) estimates from high-resolution regional models for the simulation period 2015-2065. Predictions of SST from global climate models were regionalised using the Delta statistical down scaling technique. Predictions of chlorophyll-a were developed using historical Chl-a and SST (20032013) satellite data and applying a harmonic model. The results show an increase. in SST of up to 2.5 degrees C by 2055 in the north and central-south area for an A2 scenario. The habitat suitability index model was developed using historical (2001-2011) monthly fisheries and environmental data. The catch per unit effort (CPUE) was used as an abundance index in developing the HSI models and was calculated as the total catch (ton) by hold capacity (m(3)) in a 10' x 10' fishing grid square of anchovy, integrated over one month of fishing activity. The environmental data included the distance to coast (DC), thermal (SST) and food availability (Chl-a) conditions. The HSI modelling consists of estimating SI curves based on available evidence regarding the optimum range of environmental conditions for anchovy and estimating an integrated HSI using the Arithmetic Mean Model (AMM) method. The results of this work show that the model has produced robust estimates of habitat suitability and geographic distribution off Chile and has been especially effective in capturing the spatial and temporal variability of CPUE. Using IDRISI geographical information system (GIS), these HSI models simulated monthly changes in the habitat suitability (i.e., relative abundance) and distribution of anchovy off Chile forced by changes in the regionalised SST and Chl-a as projected by the NCAR model under the A2 emission scenario. The simulations predicted a moderate negative change of 17% and 13% for the north and central-south areas, respectively, in the habitat suitability (i.e., potential relative abundance) of anchovy by 2055.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of mangrove conservation efforts in two adjacent protected areas in China that were under the management policies of the Ramsar Convention (Mai Po Marshes Nature Reserve (MPMNR), Hong Kong) and China's National Nature Reserve System (Futian Mangrove National Nature Reserve (FMNNR), Shenzhen). To achieve this goal, eleven Landsat images were chosen and classified, areal extent and landscape metrics were then calculated. The results showed that: from 1973-2015, the areal extent of mangroves in both reserves increased, but the net change for the MPMNR (281.43 hm(2)) was much higher than those of the FMNNR (101.97 hm(2)). In general, the area-weighted centroid of the mangroves in FMNNR moved seaward by approximately 120 m, whereas in the MPMNR, the centroid moved seaward even farther (410 m). Although both reserves saw increased integrality and connectivity of the mangrove patches, the patches in the MPMNR always had higher integrality than those in the FMNNR. We concluded that the mangroves in the MPMNR were more effectively protected than those in the FMNNR. This study may provide assistance to the formulation of generally accepted criteria for remote sensing-based evaluation of conservation effectiveness, and may facilitate the development of appropriate mangrove forest conservation and management strategies in other counties.					, Mingming/0000-0002-4548-899X												2072-4292					AUG	2016	8	8							627	10.3390/rs8080627								WOS:000382458700014

Changes in Sahelian annual vegetation growth and phenology since 1960: A modeling approach	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												In semi-arid areas like the Sahel, vegetation is particularly sensitive to climate variability and can play an important role in surface-atmosphere coupling. After a wet period extending from 1950 to 1970, the Sahel experienced a severe drought in the 1970s and 1980s, followed by a partial recovery of rainfall and a "re-greening" of vegetation beginning in the 1990s. This study explores how the multidecadal variability of Sahelian rainfall and particularly the drought period have affected vegetation phenology and growth since 1960. The STEP model, which is specifically designed to simulate the Sahelian annual vegetation, including the dry season processes, is run over an area extending from 13 degrees N to 18 degrees N and from 20 degrees W to 20 degrees E. Mean values, interannual variability and phenological characteristics of the Sahelian annual grasslands simulated by STEP are in good agreement with MODIS derived production and phenology over the 2001-2014 period, which demonstrates the skill of the model and allows the analysis of vegetation changes and variability over the last 50 years. It was found that droughts in the 1970s and 1980s shortened the mean vegetation cycle and reduced its amplitude and that, despite the rainfall recovery since the 1990s, the current conditions for green and dry vegetation are still below pre-drought conditions. While the decrease in vegetation production has been largely homogeneous during droughts, vegetation recovery has been heterogeneous over the Sahel since 1990, with specific changes near the western coast and at the eastern edge of the West African monsoon area. Since 1970, the Sahel also experienced an increased interannual variability in vegetation mass and phenology. In terms of phenology, region-averaged End and Length of Season are the most variable, while maximum date and Start of Season are the least variable, although the latter displays a high variability locally.

GRADHIST - A method for detection and analysis of oceanic fronts from remote sensing data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Oceanic shelf sea fronts have significant effects on local dynamics, ecology and climate. An assessment of the impact of climate change on frontal positions and frontal gradients requires reliable reference data and the possibility to monitor oceanic fronts. Therefore, the development of algorithms which automatically detect frontal positions from Earth Observation (EO) data is an important tool to analyse long EO time series, i.e. to process big data volumes. The development of GRADHIST was driven by the need to generate a climatology for North Sea fronts. GRADHIST is a new algorithm for the detection and mapping of oceanic fronts, which is based on a combination and refinement of the gradient algorithm of Canny (1986) and the histogram algorithm of Cayula and Cornillon (1992). GRADHIST preserves the main principles of both algorithms and can be applied to various ocean parameters as well as to different sensors with very little effort. GRADHIST was validated and tested using both synthetic and real data and applied to sea surface temperature and ocean colour parameters retrieved from satellite data; i.e. data from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), MERIS (MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer), AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) and AATSR (Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer). Selected results and statistical analysis of a new North Sea climatology for oceanic fronts are presented and discussed.

Leveraging limited information to understand ecological relationships of endangered Florida salt marsh vole	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY												We were able to substantially increase our knowledge of what is likely the least understood endangered terrestrial mammal in the United States, the Florida salt marsh vole (FSMV; Microtus pennsylvanicus dukecampbelli). We developed a predictive landscape model that estimated 264 ha of potential habitat for FSMVs. Evaluating our model, we found voles at 8 of the 36 sites sampled, yielding a model accuracy of 22% for a subspecies that previously was known from only 3 locations. Within areas of potential habitat, FSMVs selected patches of marsh vegetation > 0.49 ha with at least some (>= 16.75% and <= 43.61%) smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) cover. Suggestive of a meta-population dynamic, FSMV activity decreased outside of patches of smooth cordgrass and saltgrass (Distichlis spicata) identified by the predictive landscape model. Our hierarchical approach to studying FSMVs allowed us to leverage a limited amount of data to ultimately produce important ecological information about an endangered species. This approach easily may be adapted to other mammals with similar information needs.																	0022-2372	1545-1542				JUL 25	2016	97	4					1249	1255		10.1093/jmammal/gyw084								WOS:000383262100022						
J	Robinson, CJ				Robinson, Carlos J.			Evolution of the 2014-2015 sea surface temperature warming in the central west coast of Baja California, Mexico, recorded by remote sensing	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Extraordinarily warm sea surface temperatures were present in the California Current System during 2014-2015. In several locations surface waters temperature registered new record high in the recent time series. This study focuses in the evolution of the warming in the southern part of the California Current System (CCS), off the west coast of Baja California, Mexico. Analysis of monthly sea surface temperature (SST), sea level pressure, and wind speed as measured by satellite from January 1988 to December 2015 show that recent warming occurred during two distinct periods. From May 2014 to April 2015, SST warming was related to weak coastal winds not associated to El Nino. During this period occurred the longest sustained record of 15months of negative wind anomalies in the series. A reduction of wind stress suggests a weakened coastal upwelling, and consequently, cold water not transported into the surface. The second process of warming occurred from September to December 2015, during a strong El Nino condition.																	0094-8276	1944-8007				JUL 16	2016	43	13					7066	7071		10.1002/2016GL069356								WOS:000380901600047						
J	Dunkin, L; Reif, M; Altman, S; Swannack, T				Dunkin, Lauren; Reif, Molly; Altman, Safra; Swannack, Todd			A Spatially Explicit, Multi-Criteria Decision Support Model for Loggerhead Sea Turtle Nesting Habitat Suitability: A Remote Sensing-Based Approach	REMOTE SENSING												Nesting habitat for the federally endangered loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) were designated as critical in 2014 for beaches along the Atlantic Coast and Gulf of Mexico. Nesting suitability is routinely determined based on site specific information. Given the expansive geographic location of the designated critical C. caretta nesting habitat and the highly dynamic coastal environment, understanding nesting suitability on a regional scale is essential for monitoring the changing status of the coast as a result of hydrodynamic forces and maintenance efforts. The increasing spatial resolution and temporal frequency of remote sensing data offers the opportunity to study this dynamic environment on a regional scale. Remote sensing data were used as input into the spatially-explicit, multi-criteria decision support model to determine nesting habitat suitability. Results from the study indicate that the morphological parameters used as input into the model are well suited to provide a regional level approach with the results from the optimized model having sensitivity and detection prevalence values greater than 80% and the detection rate being greater than 70%. The approach can be implemented in various geographic locations to better communicate priorities and evaluate management strategies as a result of changes to the dynamic coastal environment.

J	Gomez, I; Caselles, V; Estrela, MJ; Niclos, R				Gomez, Igor; Caselles, Vicente; Jose Estrela, Maria; Niclos, Raquel			Impact of Initial Soil Temperature Derived from Remote Sensing and Numerical Weather Prediction Datasets on the Simulation of Extreme Heat Events	REMOTE SENSING												Extreme heat weather events have received increasing attention and has become of special importance as they can remarkably affect sectors as diverse as public health, energy consumption, water resources, natural biodiversity and agricultural production. In this regard, summer temperatures have become a parameter of essential interest under a framework of a hypothetical increase in the number of intense-heat conditions. Thus, their forecast is a crucial aspect bearing in mind a mitigation of the effects and impacts that these intense-heat situations could produce. The current work tries to reach a better understanding of these sorts of situations that are really common over theWestern Mediterranean coast. An extreme heat episode that took place in the Valencia Region in July 2009 is analysed, based on the simulations performed with the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS). This event recorded maximum temperatures exceeding 40 degrees C amply extended over the region besides reaching minimum temperatures up to 25.92 degrees C. We examine the role of improved skin and soil temperature (ST) initial conditions in the forecast results by means of different modelling and satellite-derived products. The influence of incorporating the Land Surface Temperature (LST) into RAMS is not found to produce a meaningful impact on the simulation results, independently of the resolution of the dataset used in the initial conditions of the model. In contrast, the introduction of the ST in lower levels, not only the skin temperature, has a more marked decisive effect in the simulation. Additionally, we have evaluated the influence of increasing the number of soil levels to spread deeper underground. This sensitivity experiment has revealed that more soil levels do not produce any meaningful impact on the simulation compared to the original one. In any case, RAMS is able to properly capture the observed patterns in those cases where a Western advection is widely extended over the area of study. This region's variability in orography and in distances to the sea promotes the development of sea-breeze circulations, thus producing a convergence of two opposite wind flows, a Western synoptic advection and a sea-breeze circulation. As a result, the RAMS skill in those cases where a sea breeze is well developed depends on the proper location of the boundary and convergence lines of these two flows.

J	Kirincich, A				Kirincich, Anthony			Remote Sensing of the Surface Wind Field over the Coastal Ocean via Direct Calibration of HF Radar Backscatter Power	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY												The calibration and validation of a novel approach to remotely sense surface winds using land-based high-frequency (HF) radar systems are described. Potentially available on time scales of tens of minutes and spatial scales of 2-3 km for wide swaths of the coastal ocean, HF radar-based surface wind observations would greatly aid coastal ocean planners, researchers, and operational stakeholders by providing detailed real-time estimates and climatologies of coastal winds, as well as enabling higher-quality short-term forecasts of the spatially dependent wind field. Such observations are particularly critical for the developing offshore wind energy community. An autonomous surface vehicle was deployed within the Massachusetts Wind Energy Area, located south of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, for one month, collecting wind observations that were used to test models of wind-wave spreading and HF radar energy loss, thereby empirically relating radar-measured power to surface winds. HF radar-based extractions of the remote wind speed had accuracies of 1.4 m s(-1) for winds less than 7 m s(-1), within the optimal range of the radar frequency used. Accuracies degraded at higher winds due to low signal-to-noise ratios in the returned power and poor resolution of the model. Pairing radar systems with a range of transmit frequencies with adjustments of the extraction model for additional power and environmental factors would resolve many of the errors observed.																	0739-0572	1520-0426				JUL	2016	33	7					1377	1392		10.1175/JTECH-D-15-0242.1								WOS:000379571200004						
J	Sims, AP; Raman, S				Sims, Aaron P.; Raman, Sethu			Interaction Between Two Distinct Mesoscale Circulations During Summer in the Coastal Region of Eastern USA	BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY												The interaction of two phenomena, a sea-breeze front and a thermally-driven local circulation, is investigated during the summer season. The sea-breeze circulation in the coastal Carolinas (USA) can be quite strong and the sea-breeze front often propagates well inland. The Sandhills, an area of sandy soils, is oriented roughly parallel to the coast and is located approximately 180 km inland. Differential heating is a strong driving force for convective development in this coastal region and the Sandhills front develops from the thermally-driven circulation caused by the differential heating of differing soil types. The sea-breeze and the Sandhills circulations have been previously studied independently, however, the interaction of these two phenomena is not well known. A combination of remote sensing, in situ observations, and numerical simulations is used to examine the interaction of these two fronts with remote sensing and in situ observations revealing the differential heating that occurs along the Sandhills region. Radar reflectivity is used to identify the two frontal features that converge and result in enhanced convection. A modelling simulation reveals the vertical structure of the frontal features, their propagation, and interaction, highlighting the interaction of the two fronts that results in enhanced convection between the Sandhills and the coast. Over the Sandhills region, differential heating triggers convective storms. Radar reflectivity and numerical simulation indicate the outflows from these convective storms to produce a shallow Sandhills front that in turn propagates toward the coast. As the two opposing fronts, the Sandhills front and the sea-breeze front, converge and interact, intense convection occurs resulting in additional storms.																	0006-8314	1573-1472				JUL	2016	160	1					113	132		10.1007/s10546-015-0125-6								WOS:000379026800006

Delineation of spatio-temporal changes of shoreline and geomorphological features of Odisha coast of India using remote sensing and GIS techniques	NATURAL HAZARDS												Odisha coast is a dynamic region wherein both natural and anthropogenic processes affecting the shape and position of the shoreline vis-A -vis the coastal processes are prevalent in this region. Geomorphology such as lagoons, tidal flats, mangrove swamps and shoreline is a rapidly changing phenomenon along this coast mainly due to tides, waves, oceanic currents and storm surges. Keeping in view of the above, the present study mainly focused on decadal changes of shoreline and land cover changes, and delineation of geomorphological units along the Odisha coast using geospatial technologies for the period 1990-2009. Spatio-temporal analysis of remote sensing data indicated notable shoreline changes at cyclone land fall locations along the Odisha coast, wherein erosion (loss) and accretion (gain) rates were observed to be high at Paradeep and Kendrapada. During the study period, the rate of accretion was observed to be higher during 1999-2009 compared to 1990-1999. Coastal geomorphology landforms distributions indicate that the swale complex, older and younger coastal plains, tidal flats and mangrove swamp are the dominant features. Long-term land cover analysis indicated that the vegetation cover loss happened in the high vegetated areas during the period 1990-1999 and regeneration during the period 1999-2009.																	0921-030X	1573-0840				JUL	2016	82	3					1437	1455		10.1007/s11069-016-2252-x								WOS:000377792100001						
J	Quan, Q; Xue, HJ; Qin, HL; Zeng, XZ; Peng, SQ				Quan, Qi; Xue, Huijie; Qin, Huiling; Zeng, Xuezhi; Peng, Shiqiu			Features and variability of the South China Sea western boundary current from 1992 to 2011	OCEAN DYNAMICS												Different from the traditional definition of the South China Sea western boundary current (SCSWBC), in this paper, only the southwestward and southward currents along the northern and western slopes in the SCS, which are closely associated with the basin-wide wind stress curl, are defined as the SCSWBC, while the flows on the southwestern shelf driven directly by the local wind stress are regarded as part of the shelf circulation. Using a new reanalysis dataset of the SCS in conjunction with the in situ and remote sensing data, the main features and variability of the SCSWBC from 1992 to 2011 were studied. Dictated by the prevailing monsoonal winds and in- and outflows, the SCSWBC in winter extended the full length of the western slope and reached its maximum intensity off the southeast coast of Vietnam, while in summer the main body of the SCSWBC was limited to the northern half of the western slope and merged with the northward coastal current to form the Vietnam Offshore Current (VOC) at about 12A degrees N. Moreover, the respective seasonal patterns of the SCSWBC showed pronounced interannual variations in its structure, including the axis, the width, and the maximum depth. The strength of the SCSWBC, with the transport of -11.8 A +/- 3.5 Sv in winter and -3.0 A +/- 1.6 Sv in summer off the central coast of Vietnam, also varied significantly from year to year. It was demonstrated that the monsoonal forcing over the SCS, the interannual variability of which was closely associated with El Nio events, played an important role in modulating the interannual variability of the SCSWBC, whereas the influence from the upper-layer Luzon Strait transport was secondary.																	1616-7341	1616-7228				JUL	2016	66	6-7					795	810		10.1007/s10236-016-0951-1								WOS:000378002600003

Spatio-temporal changes of a mangrove-saltmarsh ecotone in the northeastern coast of Florida, USA	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												General circulation models predict warming trends and changes in temperature and precipitation patterns that have the potential to alter the structure and function of coastal habitats. The purpose of this study was to quantify the expansion and contraction of mangroves and saltmarsh habitats and assess the impact of climate on these landscape changes. The study was conducted in a mangrove/saltmarsh ecotone in Flagler County, FL, near the northern range limit of mangroves along the Atlantic coast of North America. We used time series of historical aerial photography and high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery from 1942 to 2013 to quantify changes in the extent of mangrove and saltmarsh vegetation and compared these changes to climate variables of temperature and precipitation, temperature-seasonality, as well as historical sea-level data. Results showed increases in mangrove extent of 89% between 1942 and 1952, and a continuous increase from 1995 to 2013. Largest decrease in saltmarsh extent occurred between 1942 and 1952 (-136%) and between 2008 and 2013 (-81%). We found significant effects of precipitation, temperature, seasonality, and time on mangrove and saltmarsh areal extent. The statistical effect of sea-level was rather small, but we speculate that it might have ecological impacts on these two coastal ecosystems. Results also showed a cyclical dynamism as well as a reversal in habitat dominance, which may be the result of complex interactions between plant habitats and several environmental drivers of change such as species interactions, and hydrological changes induced by sea-level rise, in addition to temperature and precipitation effects. Our results on mangrove/saltmarsh expansion and contraction may contribute to the improvement of management and conservation strategies for coastal ecosystems being impacted by climate change.

Ashraful; Mitra, Debashis; Dewan, Ashraf; Akhter, Syed Humayun			Coastal multi-hazard vulnerability assessment along the Ganges deltaic coast of Bangladesh-A geospatial approach	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												It is ironic that countries that are least responsible for or insignificant contributors to global climate change, are in fact, the most susceptible to its harmful impact. The Ganges deltaic coast, one of the largest sediment depocentres with the 286 km long coastline of Bangladesh, faces potentially multi-hazard threat due to climatic change. This study attempted to develop a coastal vulnerability index (CVI) by using seven physical parameters namely: (a) geomorphology; (b) coastal slope; (c) shoreline change rate; (d) rate of sea level change; (e) mean tide range; (f) bathymetry; and (g) storm surge height. These variables are considered as relative risk parameters and integrated through geospatial techniques (i.e., remote sensing and GIS), and then ranked to estimate the degree of coastline vulnerability to sea level rise. The entire coastline is ranked in accordance with multi-hazard vulnerability and the results reveal that 20.1% of the shoreline (57.9 km of total coastline in the Ganges delta) is very highly vulnerable, whilst 17.5% of shoreline (50.0 km) is estimated to be highly vulnerable. In contrast, 21.5% of the entire shoreline (61.3 km) is moderately vulnerable, whereas approximately 56.6 km (19.7%) and 60.4 km (21.2%) of the total shorelines are in low and very low vulnerability categories, respectively. The results of the CVI are expected to provide a clear picture for predicting future recession of shorelines; hence the outcome of this study can be used as an important tool by coastal managers for developing sustainable resources management practices. Furthermore, this study also offers a framework for prioritizing actions to enhance a community's resilience or to assist in developing appropriate adaptive measures as part of disaster risk reduction initiative.

J	Kordi, MN; O'Leary, M				Kordi, Moataz N.; O'Leary, Michael			A spatial approach to improve coastal bioregion management of the north western Australia	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Coral reefs are a major coastal feature of the Kimberley bioregion in north-western Australia; however, very little is known about the habitats and substrates of the reefs in this coast. Previous studies have been conducted on a broad scale, but no geomorphological, surface substrate and habitat maps of the reefs have been produced. Such maps would provide researchers and coastal zone managers with significant information and estimations of reef growth and productivity. The primary aim of this study was to obtain detailed information on reefs in the Kimberley bioregion. This study used remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), as well as multiple other data sources, to map reef geomorphic zones and the associated key habitats and substrate types of shallow nearshore reefs. Despite the macrotidal regimes and the turbid waters of the study area, remote sensing was effectively used to identify the dominant habitats and substrate types of eight reef platforms. This study provides long-term quantitative assessments of the main habitats and substrates of these reefs and offers a better understanding of reefs in the Kimberly bioregion. It is also a source of valuable information for the marine park and coastal managers investigating the coral reefs that have been targeted for conservation, but have not yet been the subject of regional analysis.

J	Suominen, T; Tolvanen, H				Suominen, Tapio; Tolvanen, Harri			Temporal analysis of remotely sensed turbidity in a coastal archipelago	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												A topographically fragmental archipelago with dynamic waters set the preconditions for assessing coherent remotely sensed information. We generated a turbidity dataset for an archipelago coast in the Baltic Sea from MERIS data (FSG L1b), using CoastColour L1P, L2R and L2W processors. We excluded land and mixed pixels by masking the imagery with accurate (1:10 000) shoreline data. Using temporal linear averaging (TLA), we produced satellite-imagery datasets applicable to temporal composites for the summer seasons of three years. The turbidity assessments and temporally averaged data were compared to in situ observations obtained with coastal monitoring programs. The ability of TLA to estimate missing pixel values was further assessed by cross-validation with the leave-one-out method. The correspondence between L2W turbidity and in situ observations was good (r=0.89), and even after applying TLA the correspondence remained acceptable (r=0.78). The datasets revealed spatially divergent temporal water characteristics, which may be relevant to the management, design of monitoring and habitat models. Monitoring observations may be spatially biased if the temporal succession of water properties is not taken into account in coastal areas with anisotropic dispersion of waters and asynchronous annual cycles. Accordingly, areas of varying turbidity may offer a different habitat for aquatic biota than areas of static turbidity, even though they may appear similar if water properties are measured for short annual periods.

As part of the DUST Aging and Transport from Africa to the Caribbean (Dust-ATTACk) intensive field campaign, the size distribution and optical properties of mineral dust were measured in June-July 2012 on the east coast of Puerto Rico, more than 5000 km from the west coast of Africa. During the recorded dust events, the PM10 (particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter) concentrations increased from 20 to 70 mu gm(-3). Remote sensing observations and modeling analysis were used to identify the main source regions, which were found in the Western Sahara, Mauritania, Algeria, Niger, and Mali. The microphysical and optical properties of the dust plumes were almost independent of origin. The size distribution of mineral dust after long-range transport may have modal diameters similar to those on the eastern side of the Atlantic short time after emission, possibly depending on height of transport. Additional submicron particles of anthropogenic absorbing aerosols (likely from regional marine traffic activities) can be mixed within the dust plumes, without affecting in a significant way the PM10 absorption properties of dust observed in Puerto Rico. The Dust-ATTACk experimental data set may be useful for modeling the direct radiative effect of dust. For accurate representation of dust optical properties over the Atlantic remote marine region, we recommend mass extinction efficiency (MEE) and single- scattering albedo values in the range 1.1-.5m(2)g(-1) and 0.97-0.98, respectively, for visible wavelengths.				andrews, elisabeth/A-7104-2018	andrews, elisabeth/0000-0002-9394-024X; Cassola, Federico/0000-0003-4670-740X												2169-897X	2169-8996				JUN 27	2016	121	12					7117	7138		10.1002/2016JD024783								WOS:000381631800026

Environmental correlates of nearshore habitat distribution by the Critically Endangered M(a)over-barui dolphin	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Effective management of space-use conflicts with anthropogenic activities is contingent upon reliable knowledge of a species' ecology. The M (a) over bar ui dolphin Cephalorhynchus hectori maui is endemic to New Zealand and is listed as Critically Endangered, mainly as a result of fisheries bycatch. Despite conservation efforts, the population was estimated at 55 animals in 2011. Here we investigate environmental correlates of M (a) over bar ui dolphin nearshore distribution, using 119 encounters with M (a) over bar ui dolphin groups during boat-based, coastal surveys across 4 summers (2010, 2011, 2013, 2015). We describe the nearshore distribution using a kernel density analysis with differential smoothing on the x- and y-axes to account for the nearshore preference of the dolphins and the survey design. In all years, dolphins were encountered consistently in a restricted area (4 year area of overlap: 87.3 km(2)). We modelled habitat preference with boosted regression trees, using presence/absence of dolphins relative to static and dynamic environmental predictors. An index of coastal turbidity was created based on a near-linear relationship between Secchi disk measurements and log-transformed remotely sensed chl a concentration. Sea surface temperature (SST; 22.6% contribution), turbidity (22.2%), distance to major watersheds (17%), depth (14.5%), distance to minor watersheds (13.3%) and distance to the coast (10.4%) partly explained M (a) over bar ui dolphin distribution. We detected a match between predicted areas of high nearshore habitat suitability around North Island and historical sightings (76.2% overlap), thus highlighting potential areas of M (a) over bar ui dolphin recovery. Our study presents methods broadly applicable to distribution analyses, and demonstrates an evidence-based application toward managing M (a) over bar ui dolphin habitat.

Collaborative Observations of Boundary Currents, Water Mass Variability, and Monsoon Response in the Southern Bay of Bengal	OCEANOGRAPHY												The region surrounding Sri Lanka modulates monsoon-driven exchange between the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. Here, local circulation impacts the pathways followed by the boundary currents that drive exchange, thereby modulating mixing and water mass transformation. From 2013 to 2016, an international partnership conducted sustained measurements around the periphery of Sri Lanka, with the goal of understanding how circulation and mixing in this critical region modulate exchange between the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. Observations from satellite remote sensing, surface drifters, gliders, current meter moorings, and Pressure Inverted Echo Sounders capture seasonally reversing monsoon currents off the southern tip of Sri Lanka, trace the wintertime freshwater export pathway of the East India Coastal Current, and document the deflection of currents running along the east coast of Sri Lanka by cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies. Measurements also reveal energetic interleaving, indicative of mixing and stirring associated with these flows. Circulation inferred from satellite remote sensing and drifter tracks sometimes differs from that indicated by in situ sections, pointing to the need for observing systems that employ complementary approaches toward understanding this region.																	1042-8275					JUN	2016	29	2			SI		102	111		10.5670/oceanog.2016.43								WOS:000380572500014

The DST group ionospheric sounder replacement for JORN	RADIO SCIENCE												The Jindalee Over-the-horizon Radar Network (JORN) is an integral part of Australia's national defense capability. JORN uses a real-time ionospheric model as part of its operations. The primary source of data for this model is a set of 13 vertical-incidence sounders (VIS) scattered around the Australian coast and inland locations. These sounders are a mix of Lowell digisonde portable sounder (DPS)-1 and DPS-4. Both of these sounders, the DPS-1 in particular, are near the end of their maintainable life. A replacement for these aging sounders was required as part of the ongoing sustainment program for JORN. Over the last few years the High-Frequency Radar Branch (HFRB) of the Defence Science and Technology (DST) Group, Australian Department of Defence, has been developing its own sounders based on its successful radar hardware technology. The DST Group VIS solution known as PRIME (Portable Remote Ionospheric Monitoring Equipment) is a 100% duty cycle, continuous wave system that receives the returned ionospheric signal while it is still transmitting and operates the receiver in the near field of the transmitter. Of considerable importance to a successful VIS is the autoscaling software, which takes the ionogram data and produces an ionogram trace (group delay as a function of frequency), and from that produces a set of ionospheric parameters that represent the (bottomside) overhead electron density profile. HFRB has developed its own robust autoscaling software. The performance of DST Group's PRIME under a multitude of challenging ionospheric conditions has been studied. In December 2014, PRIME was trialed at a JORN VIS site collocated with the existing Lowell Digisonde DPS-1. This side-by-side testing determined that PRIME was fit for purpose. A summary of the results of this comparison and example PRIME output will be discussed. Note that this paper compares PRIME with the 25year old Lowell Digisonde DPS-1, which is planned to be replaced. Our future plans include PRIME comparisons with the much newer Digisonde DPS-4D located at Learmonth in Western Australia.																	0048-6604	1944-799X				JUN	2016	51	6					563	572		10.1002/2015RS005881								WOS:000379948700002

The phytoplankton biomass was estimated with the MERIS product Algal Pigment Index 1 (API 1). Seasonal-Trend decomposition of time series based on Loess (STL) identified the temporal variability of the dynamical features in the MERIS products for water leaving reflectance ((w)()) and API 1. The advantages of STL is that it can identify seasonal components changing over time, it is responsive to nonlinear trends, and it is robust in the presence of outliers. One of the novelties in this study is the development and the implementation of an automatic procedure, stl.fit(), that searches the best data modeling by varying the values of the smoothing parameters, and by selecting the model with the lowest error measure. This procedure was applied to 10 years of monthly time series from Sagres in the Southwestern Iberian Peninsula at three Stations, 2, 10 and 18 km from the shore. Decomposing the MERIS products into seasonal, trend and irregular components with stl.fit(), the (w)() indicated dominance of the seasonal and irregular components while API 1 was mainly dominated by the seasonal component, with an increasing effect from inshore to offshore. A comparison of the seasonal components between the (w)() and the API 1 product, showed that the variations decrease along this time period due to the changes in phytoplankton functional types. Furthermore, inter-annual seasonal variation for API 1 showed the influence of upwelling events and in which month of the year these occur at each of the three Sagres stations. The stl.fit() is a good tool for any remote sensing study of time series, particularly those addressing inter-annual variations. This procedure will be made available in R software.

Examination of Abiotic Drivers and Their Influence on Spartina alterniflora Biomass over a Twenty-Eight Year Period Using Landsat 5 TM Satellite Imagery of the Central Georgia Coast	REMOTE SENSING												We examined the influence of abiotic drivers on inter-annual and phenological patterns of aboveground biomass for Marsh Cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, on the Central Georgia Coast. The linkages between drivers and plant response via soil edaphic factors are captured in our graphical conceptual model. We used geospatial techniques to scale up in situ measurements of aboveground S. alterniflora biomass to landscape level estimates using 294 Landsat 5 TM scenes acquired between 1984 and 2011. For each scene we extracted data from the same 63 sampling polygons, containing 1222 pixels covering about 1.1 million m(2). Using univariate and multiple regression tests, we compared Landsat derived biomass estimates for three S. alterniflora size classes against a suite of abiotic drivers. River discharge, total precipitation, minimum temperature, and mean sea level had positive relationships with and best explained biomass for all dates. Additional results, using seasonally binned data, indicated biomass was responsive to changing combinations of variables across the seasons. Our 28-year analysis revealed aboveground biomass declines of 33%, 35%, and 39% for S. alterniflora tall, medium, and short size classes, respectively. This decline correlated with drought frequency and severity trends and coincided with marsh die-backs events and increased snail herbivory in the second half of the study period.

The existing global and regional maps of Mauritania's mangroves have little detail, and available estimates of the mangrove area differ among studies. We assessed the use of automated Remote Sensing classification techniques to calculate the extent and map the distribution of the mangrove patches located at Cap Timiris, PNBA, using QuickBird and GeoEye imagery. It was possible to detect the northernmost contiguous mangrove patches of West Africa with an accuracy of 87% +/- 2% using the Maximum Likelihood algorithm. The main source of error was the low spectral difference between mangroves and other types of terrestrial vegetation, which resulted in an erroneous classification between these two types of land cover. The most reliable estimate for the mangrove area obtained in this study was 19.48 +/- 5.54 ha in 2011. Moreover, we present a special validation procedure that enables a detailed and reliable validation of the land cover maps.																	2072-4292					JUN	2016	8	6							512	10.3390/rs8060512								WOS:000379985300071

Due to a wide latitudinal distribution, Brazilian mangroves can be found within a large range of environmental conditions. However, little attention has been given to the description of environmental variables driving the distribution of mangrove species in Brazil. In this study, we present a novel and unprecedented description of environmental conditions for all mangroves along the Brazilian coast focusing on species limits. We apply a descriptive statistics and data-driven approach using Self-Organizing Maps and we combine data from terrestrial and marine environmental geodatabases in a Geographical Information System. We evaluate 25 environmental variables (21 bioclimatic variables, three sea surface temperature derivates, and salinity). The results reveal three groups of correlated variables: (i) air temperature derivates and sea surface temperature derivates; (ii) air temperature, potential evapotranspiration and precipitation derivates; and (iii) precipitation derivates, aridity and salinity. Our results unveil new locations of extreme values of temperature and precipitation. We conclude that Rhizophora harrisonii and Rhizophora racemosa are more limited by precipitation and aridity and that they do not necessarily follow a latitudinal gradient. Our data also reveal that the lowest air temperatures of the coldest month are not necessarily found at the southernmost limits of mangroves in Brazil; instead they are localized at the Mesoregion of Vale do Itajai. However, the minimum sea surface temperature drops gradually with higher latitudes in the Brazilian southern hemisphere and is probably a better indicator for the decrease of species at the latitudinal limits of mangroves than the air temperature and precipitation.

Icarus			Unstructured grid modelling of offshore wind farm impacts on seasonally stratified shelf seas	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Shelf seas comprise approximately 7% of the world's oceans and host enormous economic activity. Development of energy installations (e.g. Offshore Wind Farms (OWFs), tidal turbines) in response to increased demand for renewable energy requires a careful analysis of potential impacts. Recent remote sensing observations have identified kilometre-scale impacts from OWFs. Existing modelling evaluating monopile impacts has fallen into two camps: small-scale models with individually resolved turbines looking at local effects; and large-scale analyses but with sub-grid scale turbine parameterisations. This work straddles both scales through a 3D unstructured grid model (FVCOM): wind turbine monopiles in the eastern Irish Sea are explicitly described in the grid whilst the overall grid domain covers the south-western UK shelf. Localised regions of decreased velocity extend up to 250 times the monopile diameter away from the monopile. Shelf-wide, the amplitude of the M-2 tidal constituent increases by up to 7%. The turbines enhance localised vertical mixing which decreases seasonal stratification. The spatial extent of this extends well beyond the turbines into the surrounding seas. With significant expansion of OWFs on continental shelves, this work highlights the importance of how OWFs may impact coastal (e.g. increased flooding risk) and offshore (e.g. stratification and nutrient cycling) areas.

J	Zhang, KQ; Thapa, B; Ross, M; Gann, D				Zhang, Keqi; Thapa, Bina; Ross, Michael; Gann, Daniel			Remote sensing of seasonal changes and disturbances in mangrove forest: a case study from South Florida	ECOSPHERE												Knowledge of the spatial and temporal changes caused by episodic disturbances and seasonal variability is essential for understanding the dynamics of mangrove forests at the landscape scale, and for building a baseline that allows detection of the effects of future environmental change. In combination with LiDAR data, we calculated four vegetation indices from 150 Landsat TM images from 1985 to 2011 in order to detect seasonal changes and distinguish them from disturbances due to hurricanes and chilling events in a mangrove-dominated coastal landscape. We found that normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) performed best in identifying both seasonal and event-driven episodic changes. Mangrove responses to chilling and hurricane events exhibited distinct spatial patterns. Severe damage from intense chilling events was concentrated in the interior dwarf and transition mangrove forests with tree heights less than 4 m, while severe damage from intense hurricanes was limited to the mangrove forest near the coast, where tree heights were more than 4 m. It took 4-7 months for damage from intense chilling events and hurricanes to reach their full extent, and took 2-6 yr for the mangrove forest to recover from these -disturbances. There was no significant trend in the vegetation changes represented by NDMI over the -27-yr period, but seasonal signals from both dwarf and fringe mangrove forests were discernible. Only severe damage from hurricanes and intense chilling events could be detected in Landsat images, while damage from weak chilling events could not be separated from the background seasonal change.																	2150-8925					JUN	2016	7	6							e01366	10.1002/ecs2.1366								WOS:000378523100028

Standard API1 data are those delivered by the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) orbiting sensor. Equivalent quantities are computed by applying a regional inversion scheme using as input both MERIS and in situ remote sensing reflectances (R-rs). Reference data for the development of the regional algorithm and for the analysis of tested products include field measurements of total concentration of chlorophyll a (TChla) and coincident R-rs values collected at different distances from the coast. Validation results, based on matchup analysis, identifies a systematic overestimation of standard API1 versus the reference TChla values. The additional comparison of product maps in selected regions of interest confirms this tendency and demonstrates the feasibility and relevance of using regional algorithms for investigating spaceborne products. Analogous applications are hence devised for the early-stage evaluation of the forthcoming Sentinel-3/OLCI data products.

The radar is uniquely capable of sampling relevant temporal and spatial scales of nearshore processes that impact event response activities and basic coastal ocean research. HFR is a shore-based remote sensing system and is therefore subject to data gaps, which are predominately due to environmental effects, like increased external noise or low signal due to ocean surface conditions. Many applications of these surface current data require that these gaps be filled, such as Lagrangian numerical models, to estimate material transport and dispersion. This study introduces a new penalized least squares regression method based on a three-dimensional discrete cosine transform method to reconstruct hourly HFR surface current data with a horizontal resolution of 6 km. The method explicitly uses both time and space variability to predict the missing value. Furthermore, the method is fast, robust, and requires relatively low computer memory storage. This paper evaluates the method against two scenarios of common data gaps found in HFR networks currently deployed around the world. The validation is based on observed surface current maps along the mid-Atlantic coast of the United States with specific vectors removed to replicate these common gap scenarios. The evaluation shows that the new method is robust and particularly well suited to fill a more common scenario with complete data coverage surrounding an isolated data gap. It is shown that the real-time application of the method is suitable for filling data gaps in large oceanography datasets with high accuracy.																	0739-0572	1520-0426				JUN	2016	33	6					1097	1111		10.1175/JTECH-D-15-0056.1								WOS:000377942700001

The aim of the study was to better understand the spatial and temporal variations in surface snow properties. Samples were collected twice daily during a traverse in 2007-08 to capture regional variability. Local variability was assessed by sampling in 10 x 10m grids (5m spacing) at selected locations. The particle size and shape distributions for each site were analysed through digital image analysis. Snow particle size variability is complex at different scales, and shows an internal variability of 0.18-3.31 mm depending on the sample type (surface, grid or pit). Relationships were verified between particle size and both elevation and distance to the coast (moisture source). Regional seasonal changes were also identified, particularly on the lower elevations of the polar plateau. This dataset may be used to quantitatively analyse the optical properties of surface snow for remote sensing. The details of the spatial and temporal variations observed in our data provide a basis for further studies of the complex and coupled processes affecting snow particle size and the interpretation of remote sensing of snow covered areas.

A Pilot Project	MISCELLANEA GEOGRAPHICA												As new information is received, predictions of sea-level rise resulting from global warming continue to be revised upwards. Measurements indicate that the rise in sea-level is continuing at, or close to, the worst case forecasts (Kellet et al. 2014). Coastal areas are coming under increasing risk of inundation and flooding as storms are predicted to increase in frequency and severity, adding to the risk of inundation due to higher sea levels. Stakeholders, government agencies, developers and land owners require accurate, up to date information to be able to protect coastal areas. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) along with accurate remote sensing technologies such as LiDAR provides the best means for delivering this information. Using these technologies, this paper predicts the risk posed to a large multi-use development in the emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, UAE. This development, Al Hamra Village, is situated on the coast of the Arabian Gulf. Al Hamra's physical relationship to the Gulf is in common with other developments in Ras Al Khaimah in its and for this reason has been used as a pilot project. The resulting GIS model shows that Al Hamra is indeed at risk from predicted flood events. How this information can be used as a planning tool for numerous strategies is discussed in this paper.																	0867-6046	2084-6118				JUN	2016	20	2					25	31		10.1515/mgrsd-2016-0012								WOS:000407361100004

We estimated the SMB in the SHI, using a regional atmospheric climate model (RACMO2.1). The SMB of the mainstream A flow region was 12.1 +/- 1.5 Gt a(-1) for an area of 1.985 +/- 10(5) km(2). Obvious overestimation of the model round the coast, similar to 0.5 Gt a(-1), was corrected for. For calculating the IMD, we employed a 15-m resolution Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) with a digital elevation model (DEM) to determine the heights at the grounding line (GL), after comparison with the interpolated Bamber DEM grid heights; the results of this are referred to as the measured heights. Ice thickness data at the GL were inferred by using a free-board relationship between the measured height and the ice thickness, and considering the measured firn depth correction (4.2 m with the reference ice density of 910 kg m(-3)) for the nearby blue-ice area. The total IMD was estimated to be 14.0 +/- 1.8 Gt a(-1). Semi-empirical firn densification model gives the estimate within 0.1-0.2 Gt a(-1) difference. The estimated net mass balance, -1.9 Gt a(-1), has a two-s uncertainty of +/- 3.3 Gt a(-1), and probable melt water discharge strongly suggests negative NMB, although the associated uncertainty is large.

Linkages between the circulation and distribution of dissolved organic matter in the White Sea, Arctic Ocean	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The White Sea is a semi-enclosed Arctic marginal sea receiving a significant loading of freshwater (225-231 km(3) yr(-1) equaling an annual runoff yield of 2.5 m) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) from river run-off. We report discharge weighed values of stable oxygen isotope ratios (delta O-18) of -14.0 parts per thousand in Northern Dvina river for the period 10 May-12 October 2012. We found a significant linear relationship between salinity (S) and delta O-18 (delta O-18 = -17.66 +/- 0.58+0.52 +/- 0.02 x S; R-2=0.96, N=162), which indicates a dominant contribution of river water to the freshwater budget and little influence of sea ice formation or melt. No apparent brine additions from sea-ice formation is evident in the White Sea deep waters as seen from a joint analysis of temperature (T), S, delta O-18 and a(CDOM)(350) data, confirming previous suggestions about strong tidal induced vertical mixing in winter being the likely source of the deep waters. We investigated properties and distribution of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the White Sea basin and coastal areas in summer. We found contrasting DOM properties in the inflowing Barents Sea waters and White Sea waters influenced by terrestrial runoff. Values of absorption by CDOM at 350 nm (a(CDOM)(350)) and DOC (exceeding 10 m(-1) and 550 mu mol l(-1), respectively) in surface waters of the White Sea basin are higher compared to other river-influenced coastal Arctic domains. Linear relationship between S and CDOM absorption, and S and DOC (DOC=959.21 +/- 52.99-25.80 +/- 1.79 x S; R-2=0.85; N=154) concentrations suggests conservative mixing of DOM in the White Sea. The strongest linear correlation between CDOM absorption and DOC was found in the ultraviolet (DOC=56.31 +/- 2.76+9.13 +/- 0.15 x a(CDOM)(254); R-2=0.99; N=155), which provides an easy and robust tool to trace DOC using CDOM absorption measurements as well as remote sensing algorithms. Deviations from this linear relationship in surface waters likely indicate contribution from different rivers along the coast of the White Sea. Characteristics of CDOM further indicate that there is limited removal or change in the DOM pool before it exits to the Barents Sea. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A half-century of coastline change in Diego Garcia - The largest atoll island in the Chagos	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Being low and flat atoll islands are often used as case studies against which to gauge the likely impacts of future sea-level rise on coastline stability. Furnished with lengthy temporal datasets, Pacific atolls form the majority of studies with scant information published for sites in the Indian Ocean. To address this imbalance, this study considers Diego Garcia, an atoll island situated in the remote equatorial Indian Ocean, which has undergone pronounced natural and anthropogenic change in the last fifty years. To explore the former, time separated remote sensing images spanning the years 1963-2013 are assembled to provide insight into the natural dynamics of the shoreline of this island and ocean climate data are compiled to investigate possible controls. Disregarding the precinct of the atoll on which a military complex has been constructed, overall land area of Diego Garcia decreased by a net value of only 0.92% between 1963 and 2013. While net island area is relatively unchanged, 12% of the shoreline that is not in the military precinct displayed discernible accretion and 15% has receded, with the lagoon-facing coastline having undergone the most pronounced changes and at rates higher than recorded for the island's exterior. Broad trends in the morphological adjustment of the island exist The north-eastern limb of the atoll has generally receded while the south-eastern limb has extended. The south of the island has also extended, the south-western region has eroded and the north-western part has generally also eroded with the exception of notable shoreline extension at Simpson Point. The most common mechanism by which the lagoon-ward coastline has aggraded is through the in-filling of cuspate embayments with sediment which is later stabilized by the expansion of terrestrial vegetation. This evolution is most active in the complex network of embayments in the south of the atoll lagoon. The ocean-facing coastline, by contrast, typically aggrades and erodes through the linear shift of the vegetated coast along the strike of the beach line. While the areal extent of Diego Garcia has been almost static for the last half century, the annualized rate of flux of the coastline is considerable at 0.30 m yr(-1); a rate comparable to other atoll islands. The literature consistently reports two factors as relevant to increasing the rate of shoreline migration - human modification of it and sea-level rise. Both are foreseeably set to increase for Diego Garcia, the former due to its strategic importance, not least its use as a military base, and the latter due to global environmental change. The findings of this work serve to remind that the coastline of Diego Garcia, as for all atoll islands, is naturally dynamic and will likely become more so in the future. 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Previous approaches for the detection of KB HABs in the WFS primarily used observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Aqua (MODIS-A) satellite. They depended on the remote sensing reflectance signal at the 678 nm chlorophyll fluorescence band (Rrs678) needed for both the normalized fluorescence height (nFLH) and Red Band Difference algorithms (RBD) currently used. VIIRS which has replaced MODIS-A, unfortunately does not have a 678 nm fluorescence channel so we customized the NN approach to retrieve phytoplankton absorption at 443 nm (aph443) using only Rrs measurements from existing VIIRS channels at 486, 551 and 671 nm. The aph443 values in these retrieved VIIRS images, can in turn be correlated to chlorophyll-a concentrations [Chla] and KB cell counts. To retrieve KB values, the VIIRS NN retrieved aph443 images are filtered by applying limiting constraints, defined by (i) low backscatter at Rrs 551 nm and (ii) a minimum aph443 value known to be associated with KB HABs in the WFS. The resulting filtered residual images, are then used to delineate and quantify the existing KB HABs. Comparisons with KB HABs satellite retrievals obtained using other techniques, including nFLH, as well as with in situ measurements reported over a four year period, confirm the viability of the NN technique, when combined with the filtering constraints devised, for effective detection of KB HABs.																	2072-4292					MAY	2016	8	5							377	10.3390/rs8050377								WOS:000378406400021

However, Louisiana coastal wetlands have been disappearing at an alarming rate due to natural and anthropogenic processes, including sea level rise, land subsidence and infrastructure development. Wetland loss occurs mainly along the tidal zone, which varies in width and morphology along the Louisiana shoreline. In this study, we use Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) observations to detect the extent of the tidal inundation zone and evaluate the interaction between tidal currents and coastal wetlands. Our data consist of ALOS and Radarsat-1 observations acquired between 2006-2011 and 2003-2008, respectively. Interferometric processing of the data provides detailed maps of water level changes in the tidal zone, which are validated using sea level data from a tide gauge station. Our results indicate vertical tidal changes up to 30 cm and horizontal tidal flow limited to 5-15 km from open waters. The results also show that the tidal inundation is disrupted by various man-made structures, such as canals and roads, which change the natural tidal flow interaction with the coast.																	2072-4292					MAY	2016	8	5							393	10.3390/rs8050393								WOS:000378406400037

Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Cloud Cover and Fog Inundation in Coastal California: Ecological Implications	EARTH INTERACTIONS												The presence of low-lying stratocumulus clouds and fog has been known to modify biophysical and ecological properties in coastal California where forests are frequently shaded by low-lying clouds or immersed in fog during otherwise warm and dry summer months. Summer fog and stratus can ameliorate summer drought stress and enhance soil water budgets and often have different spatial and temporal patterns. Here, this study uses remote sensing datasets to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of cloud cover over California's northern Channel Islands. The authors found marine stratus to be persistent from May to September across the years 2001-12. Stratus clouds were both most frequent and had the greatest spatial extent in July. Clouds typically formed in the evening and dissipated by the following early afternoon. This study presents a novel method to downscale satellite imagery using atmospheric observations and discriminate patterns of fog from those of stratus and help explain patterns of fog deposition previously studied on the islands. The outcomes of this study contribute significantly to the ability to quantify the occurrence of coastal fog at biologically meaningful spatial and temporal scales that can improve the understanding of cloud-ecosystem interactions, species distributions, and coastal ecohydrology.

J	Elmahdy, SI; Mohamed, MM				Elmahdy, Samy Ismail; Mohamed, Mohamed Mostafa			Factors controlling the changes and spatial variability of Junipers phoenicea in Jabal Al Akhdar, Libya, using remote sensing and GIS	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The Junipers phoenicea, which covers 70 % of the Jabal Al Akhdar (Green Mountain) in Cyrene on the northeast coast of Libya, has deteriorated over large scales. To deal with this problem, the images of the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) in conjunction with the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) were used to map factors controlling the J. phoenicea mortality using a set of automated algorithms and tools. These factors include altitude, slope, aspect, curvature, drainage pattern, seawater intrusion, and land cover. As a first step, changes of J. phoenicea and land cover during the period from the year 2000 to 2015 were mapped. The results showed a sharp decline in J. phoenicea covering an area of 396 km(2) (22 %) of the total area. The result also showed that areas at a lower elevation with steep slope and faced to the south and southeast directions have a higher probability of J. phoenicea distribution. The spatial analysis showed a positive correlation between wetness and the intensity of J. phoenicea mortality. The results also show that altitude and slope have the most influencing power on the J. phoenicea morality. This study is of great help for decision makers and agriculture engineers and permits a better understanding of ecological and biomass changes in the Jabal Al Akhdar, Libya, over a regional scale.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				MAY	2016	9	6							478	10.1007/s12517-016-2500-0								WOS:000376611000052

They provide shelter and nursery to wide variety of species such as fish and birds. Around 73 species of mangroves were recognized around the world. In Qatar, there is only one mangrove species Avicennia marina that is predominant along the northeastern coast. Assessing the health of these valuable ecosystems is vital for protection, management, and conservation of those resources. In this study, an integrated approach of chemical and remote sensing analysis was implemented to investigate the current status of the mangrove trees in Al-Khor, Qatar. Fifteen different A. marina trees from different locations in the mangrove forest were examined for their chlorophyll and nitrogen content levels. Soil analysis was also conducted to understand the effect of moisture on nitrogen availability. Results shows that currently, mangroves are in a good status in terms of nitrogen availability and chlorophyll levels which are related and both are key factors for photosynthesis. Remote sensing techniques were used for chlorophyll prediction. The results showed that these methods have the potential to be used for chlorophyll prediction and estimation.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY	2016	188	5							268	10.1007/s10661-016-5269-4								WOS:000376017400009	27048493					
J	Panek, T; Klimes, J				Panek, Tomas; Klimes, Jan			Temporal behavior of deep-seated gravitational slope deformations: A review	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (DSGSDs) are slow moving, hillslope-scale mass movements featuring characteristic landforms such as double-crested ridges and upslope-facing scarps that occur in diverse landscapes throughout the world. Although these deformations have been studied since the 1960s, significant insights to the rates of DSGSDs have only been gained within the last two decades owing to progress in geochronology, remote sensing and instrumental monitoring. Absolute age and monitoring data indicate that DSGSD movements are observable over long-term (>= 10(2) years) and short-term (<10(2) years) intervals. Apart from creep, an episodic deformation also plays a crucial role, especially in regions with earthquakes and heavy rainfall. Our review also supports the notion of DSGSDs as precursors of catastrophic rock slope failures, given that many of the world's largest rock avalanches have occurred in areas with diagnostic DSGSD features, indicating that sudden collapse was preceded by a prolonged stage of slope sagging. Detailed studies on DSGSDs have therefore the potential for better prediction of catastrophic rock slides and rock avalanches. Future research directions include constraining the lifespan of DSGSDs with absolute age dating and precise high resolution monitoring of spatio-temporal displacement across DSGSD bodies. It is of great importance to include absolute time scales in the numerical models of DSGSDs. Furthermore, combining remote sensing techniques such as Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry with high-resolution LiDAR scanning and near-surface geophysics offers a promising toolkit for collecting very detailed and accurate data on the short-term deformation rates of DSGSDs.

Mostafa; Jose, Felix; da Silva, Graziela Miot			Sensitivity of a third generation wave model to wind and boundary condition sources and model physics: A case study from the South Atlantic Ocean off Brazil coast	COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES												Three different packages describing the white capping dissipation process, and the corresponding energy input from wind to wave were used to study the surface wave dynamics in South Atlantic Ocean, close to the Brazilian coast. A host of statistical parameters were computed to evaluate the performance of wave model in terms of simulated bulk wave parameters. Wave measurements from a buoy deployed off Santa Catarina Island, Southern Brazil and data along the tracks of Synthetic Aperture Radars were compared with simulated bulk wave parameters; especially significant wave height, for skill assessment of different packages. It has been shown that using a single parameter representing the performance of source and sink terms in the wave model, or relying on data from only one period of simulations for model validation and skill assessment would be misleading. The model sensitivity to input parameters such as time step and grid size were addressed using multiple datasets. The wind data used for the simulation were obtained from two different sources, and provided the opportunity to evaluate the importance of input data quality. The wind speed extracted from remote sensing satellites was compared to wind datasets used for wave modeling. The simulation results showed that the wind quality and its spatial resolution is highly correlated to the quality of model output. Two different sources of wave information along the open boundaries of the model domain were used for skill assessment of a high resolution wave model for the study area. It has been shown, based on the sensitivity analysis, that the effect of using different boundary conditions would decrease as the distance from the open boundary increases; however, the difference were still noticeable at the buoy location which was located 200-300 km away from the model boundaries; but restricted to the narrow band of the low frequency wave spectrum.

In Saadiyat and Ras Ghanada reefs similar to 40% of the corals showed signs of bleaching. In contrast, only 15% of the corals were affected on Delma reef. Bleaching threshold temperatures for these sites were established using remotely sensed sea surface temperature (SST) data recorded by MODIS-Aqua. The calculated threshold temperatures varied between locations (34.48 degrees C, 34.55 degrees C, 35.05 degrees C), resulting in site-specific deviations in the numbers of days during which these thresholds were exceeded. Hence, the less severe bleaching of Delma reef might be explained by the lower relative heat stress experienced by this coral community. However, the dominance of Porites spp. that is associated with the long-term exposure of Delma reef to elevated temperatures, as well as the more pristine setting may have additionally contributed to the higher coral bleaching threshold for this site.

Considered as an invasive species and a trophic competitor of the cultivated conspecific oyster, it is now seen as a resource by oyster farmers following recurrent mass summer mortalities of oyster spat since 2008. Spatial distribution maps of wild oyster reefs are required by local authorities to help define management strategies. In this work, visible near infrared (VNIR) hyperspectral and multispectral remote sensing was investigated to map two contrasted intertidal reef structures: clusters of vertical oysters building three-dimensional dense reefs in muddy areas and oysters growing horizontally creating large fiat reefs in rocky areas. A spectral library, collected in situ for various conditions with an ASD spectroradiometer, was used to run Spectral Angle Mapper classifications on airborne data obtained with an HySpex sensor (160 spectral bands) and SPOT satellite HRG multispectral data (3 spectral bands). With HySpex spectral/spatial resolution, horizontal oysters in the rocky area were correctly classified but the detection was less efficient for vertical oysters in muddy areas. Poor results were obtained with the multispectral image and from spatially or spectrally degraded HySpex data, it was clear that the spectral resolution was more important than the spatial resolution. In fact, there was a systematic mud deposition on shells of vertical oyster reefs explaining the misclassification of 30% of pixels recognized as mud or microphytobenthos. Spatial distribution maps of oyster reefs were coupled with in situ biomass measurements to illustrate the interest of a remote sensing product to provide stock estimations of wild oyster reefs to be exploited by oyster producers. This work highlights the interest of developing remote sensing techniques for aquaculture applications in coastal areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Kipp; Barth, John A.; Tufillaro, Nicholas			Optics of the offshore Columbia River plume from glider observations and satellite imagery	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The Columbia River (CR) is the largest source of freshwater along the U.S. Pacific coast. The resultant plume is often transported southward and offshore forming a large buoyant feature off Oregon and northern California in spring-summer-the offshore CR plume. Observations from autonomous underwater gliders and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery are used to characterize the optics of the offshore CR plume off Newport, Oregon. Vertical sections, under contrasting river flow conditions, reveal a low-salinity and warm surface layer of similar to 20-25 m (fresher in spring and warmer in summer), high Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) concentration, and backscatter, and associated with the base of the plume high chlorophyll fluorescence. Plume characteristics vary in the offshore direction as the warm and fresh surface layer thickens progressively to an average 30-40 m of depth 270-310 km offshore; CDOM, backscatter, and chlorophyll fluorescence decrease in the upper 20 m and increase at subsurface levels (30-50 m depth). MODIS normalized water-leaving radiance (nLw(lambda)) spectra for CR plume cases show enhanced water-leaving radiance at green bands (as compared to no-CR plume cases) up to similar to 154 km from shore. Farther offshore, the spectral shapes for both cases are very similar, and consequently, a contrasting color signature of low-salinity plume water is practically imperceptible from ocean color remote sensing. Empirical algorithms based on multivariate regression analyses of nLw(lambda) plus SST data produce more accurate results detecting offshore plume waters than previous studies using single visible bands (e.g., a(dg)(412) or nLw(555)).

Not many coastal sites with unbounded ocean with high tidal current speed have been reported. The coastal sea near the Cape Fuguei in northwestern Taiwan is such a site with a high tidal power potential. The purpose of this study is to investigate the tidal current speed at this location for assessing the tidal current power potential. In-situ and remote sensing instruments were deployed simultaneously to measure the temporal and spatial distributions of tidal currents. An Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) was deployed at a 26 m depth site and an X-band marine radar was installed at a coastal building. Two measurements lasting over one month were done. Both instruments showed the maximum current speed at the surface was more than 3.5 m/s in the measurement period. ADCP measurements showed that the time mean speed in the upper layer (-1.7 to -6 m) was 1.5 m/s. The current speed decreased with depth slightly. It was also found from both ADCP and radar measurements that in the surface layer, the probability of duration for current speed exceeding 1 m/s was more than 70%. In addition, radar measurement showed that the average surface current speed at the area from 2 km offshore out to 4 km (radar offshore limit) was more than 1 m/s. The size of this area is more than 15 km(2).																	2214-1669					APR	2016	13						193	205		10.1016/j.ijome.2015.02.002								WOS:000381687600012

Imperial shag, Phalacrocorax atriceps, breeding at Punta Leon colony, Argentina, were equipped with global positioning system (GPS) loggers to record foraging trips and blood samples were taken after removal of the devices in order to analyse their nitrogen and carbon stable isotope composition in whole blood and plasma. Whole blood was correlated to plasma isotopic composition for each individual (n = 35), linking diet in the short and medium term. Sexes did not differ in isotopic signatures. The maximum distance reached and the total number of dives that individuals made on two consecutive foraging trips were correlated to their plasma nitrogen isotopic signature. Individuals that went further from the colony and dived fewer times presented more positive signatures, indicative of benthic prey consumption (e.g. Raneya brasiliensis). Diet was predominantly benthic with some individuals incorporating pelagic prey (Engraulis anchoita) and even cephalopods (Octopus tehuelchus). Within breeding pairs (n = 9), different combinations of foraging and prey preferences were observed. Estimated trophic levels of these individuals were similar to those of the same species in other colonies further south along the Patagonian coast.

Optical Models for Remote Sensing of Colored Dissolved Organic Matter Absorption and Salinity in New England, Middle Atlantic and Gulf Coast Estuaries USA	REMOTE SENSING												Ocean color algorithms have been successfully developed to estimate chlorophyll a and total suspended solids concentrations in coastal and estuarine waters but few have been created to estimate light absorption due to colored dissolved inorganic matter (CDOM) and salinity from the spectral signatures of these waters. In this study, we used remotely sensed reflectances in the red and blue-green portions of the visible spectrum retrieved from Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and the International Space Station (ISS) Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) images to create a model to estimate CDOM absorption. CDOM absorption results were then used to develop an algorithm to predict the surface salinities of coastal bays and estuaries in New England, Middle Atlantic, and Gulf of Mexico regions. Algorithm-derived CDOM absorptions and salinities were successfully validated using laboratory measured absorption values over magnitudes of similar to 0.1 to 7.0 m(-1) and field collected CTD data from oligohaline to polyhaline (S less than 5 to 18-30) environments in Narragansett Bay (Rhode Island); the Neuse River Estuary (North Carolina); Pensacola Bay (Florida); Choctawhatchee Bay (Florida); St. Andrews Bay (Florida); St. Joseph Bay (Florida); and inner continental shelf waters of the Gulf of Mexico.																	2072-4292					APR	2016	8	4							283	10.3390/rs8040283								WOS:000375156500016

In the Lobo basin, the problem is more acute because reservoirs of water built to supply the population have not been properly supplied in recent years and are prone to severe eutrophication. A multidisciplinary approach (comprised of remote sensing, multi-criteria analysis and a spatial reference information system) was adopted. The map of potential water sites shows that almost the whole of the Lobo basin (93% of the total area) has good and excellent groundwater availability. This good availability water is due to a weak slope and a good density of fracturing, which result in good infiltration of water in the aquifer. The identification of potential sites shows that nearly 72% of the basin area is favourable for the establishment of works for large flows. Overall, these aquifers have good accessibility, but with a poor exploitability.																	0262-6667	2150-3435				APR	2016	61	5					856	867		10.1080/02626667.2014.932360								WOS:000374659000006

Remote sensing imageries can offer the outstanding capability to monitor nature and extent of land and associated changes over time. Nowadays accurate analysis using remote sensing imageries with high spatio-temporal resolution is required for environmental monitoring. This study develops a methodology of mapping and change detection in LULC by using classified Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite-2 (KOMPSAT-2) multispectral imageries at Jeonbuk and Jeonnam provinces including protected tidal flats located in the west coasts of Korean peninsula from 2008 to 2015. The LULC maps generated from unsupervised classification were analyzed and evaluated by post-classification change detection methods. The LULC assessment in Jeonbuk and Jeonnam areas had not showed significant changes over time although developed area was gradually increased only by 1.97% and 4.34% at both areas respectively. Overall, the results of this study quantify the land cover change patterns through pixel based analysis which demonstrate the potential of multispectral KOMPSAT-2 images to provide effective and economical LULC maps in the coastal zone over time. This LULC information would be of great interest to the environmental and policy mangers for the better coastal management and political decisions.																	1225-6161	2287-9307				APR	2016	32	2					141	153		10.7780/kjrs.2016.32.2.7								WOS:000408867800007

Response of the North Atlantic wave climate to atmospheric modes of variability	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												This study investigates the relationship between the wind wave climate and the main climate modes of atmospheric variability in the North Atlantic Ocean. The modes considered are the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the East Atlantic (EA) pattern, the East Atlantic Western Russian (EA/WR) pattern and the Scandinavian (SCAN) pattern. The wave dataset consists of buoys records, remote sensing altimetry observations and a numerical hindcast providing significant wave height (SWH), mean wave period (MWP) and mean wave direction (MWD) for the period 1989-2009. After evaluating the reliability of the hindcast, we focus on the impact of each mode on seasonal wave parameters and on the relative importance of wind-sea and swell components. Results demonstrate that the NAO and EA patterns are the most relevant, whereas EA/WR and SCAN patterns have a weaker impact on the North Atlantic wave climate variability. During their positive phases, both NAO and EA patterns are related to winter SWH at a rate that reaches 1m per unit index along the Scottish coast (NAO) and Iberian coast (EA) patterns. In terms of winter MWD, the two modes induce a counterclockwise shift of up to 65 degrees per negative NAO (positive EA) unit over west European coasts. They also increase the winter MWP in the North Sea and in the Bay of Biscay (up to 1s per unit NAO) and along the western coasts of Europe and North Africa (1s per unit EA). The impact of winter EA pattern on all wave parameters is mostly caused through the swell wave component.

Most of these failures happen due to heavy rainfalls from time to time. These landslides include rock topples, rockslides, debris flow, and some combination of these which affected many roads, highways, and buildings. The Al-Raith Road is one of these roads connecting Red Sea coast cities with Asir and Al-Hasher areas. The length of this road reaches about 45km and it has been exposed to landslides during each heavy rain storm. One of these events happened in 24 August 2013, which caused huge debris flows that cut and damaged the road. The current research aims to evaluate the debris flow assessment along this highway using remote sensing data and field studies. According to the detailed analysis of geological and geomorphological maps, as well as field investigation, it is evident that the debris flow materials are mainly related to the different types of landslides. These landslides included rock topples which are frequently observed along the side walls of the channels (flexture which occur in foliated rocks and block which occurs in massive rocks), rock sliding (planner failures) where many rock joints and shear zones dip towards the channel, and rockfalls. Debris range in their size from up to 2m in diameter to fine materials less than 2mm. These materials can be easily moved with water causing a risk to vehicles, roads, and housing in the area. Field study indicated that these debris channels especially at the lower part have been reactivated several times in the past. Finally, suitable solutions have been suggested to these critical sites to minimize and/or avoid the debris flow hazards in the future.

Use of a Florida Gulf Coast Barrier Island by Spring Trans-Gulf Migrants and the Projected Effects of Sea Level Rise on Habitat Availability	PLOS ONE												Barrier islands on the north coast of the Gulf of Mexico are an internationally important coastal resource. Each spring hundreds of thousands of Nearctic-Neotropical songbirds crossing the Gulf of Mexico during spring migration use these islands because they provide the first landfall for individuals following a trans-Gulf migratory route. The effects of climate change, particularly sea level rise, may negatively impact habitat availability for migrants on barrier islands. Our objectives were (1) to confirm the use of St. George Island, Florida by trans-Gulf migrants and (2) to determine whether forested stopover habitat will be available for migrants on St. George Island following sea level rise. We used avian transect data, geographic information systems, remote sensing, and simulation modelling to investigate the potential effects of three different sea level rise scenarios (0.28 m, 0.82 m, and 2 m) on habitat availability for trans-Gulf migrants. We found considerable use of the island by spring trans-Gulf migrants. Migrants were most abundant in areas with low elevation, high canopy height, and high coverage of forests and scrub/shrub. A substantial percentage of forest (44%) will be lost by 2100 assuming moderate sea level rise (0.82 m). Thus, as sea level rise progresses, less forests will be available for migrants during stopover. Many migratory bird species' populations are declining, and degradation of barrier island stopover habitat may further increase the cost of migration for many individuals. To preserve this coastal resource, conservation and wise management of migratory stopover areas, especially near ecological barriers like the Gulf of Mexico, will be essential as sea levels rise.																	1932-6203					MAR 2	2016	11	3							e0148975	10.1371/journal.pone.0148975								WOS:000371724200014	26934343

Distribution and dynamics of two species of Dinophyceae producing high biomass blooms over the French Atlantic Shelf	HARMFUL ALGAE												The frequency and distribution of high biomass blooms produced by two dinoflagellate species were analysed along the French continental shelf from 1998 to 2012. Two species were specifically studied: Karenia mikimotoi and Lepidodinium chlorophorum. Based on remote-sensing reflectances at six channels (410, 430, 480, 530, 550 and 670 nm), satellite indices were created to discriminate the species forming the blooms. A comparison with observations showed that the identification was good for both species in spite of a lower specificity for L. chlorophorum. The overall analysis of the satellite indices, in association with some monitoring data and cruise observations, highlights the regularity of these events and their extent on the continental shelf. L. chlorophorum blooms may occur all along the South Coast of Brittany. All the coastal areas under the influence of river plumes and the stratified northern shelf area of the Western English Channel appear to be areas of bloom events for both species. These two species are likely to be in competitive exclusion as they share the same spatial distribution and the timing of their bloom is very close. Finally, due to the scarcity of off-shore observations, these satellite indices provide useful information regarding HABs management and the development of a warning system along the French coast.

Olive ridley sea turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) nesting in French Guiana cross this turbulent environment during their post-nesting migration. We studied how oceanographic and biological conditions drove the foraging behavior of 18 adult females, using satellite telemetry, remote sensing data (sea surface temperature, sea surface height, current velocity and euphotic depth), simulations of micronekton biomass (pelagic organisms) and in situ records (water temperature and salinity). The occurrence of foraging events throughout migration was located using Residence Time analysis, while an innovative proxy of the hunting time within a dive was used to identify and quantify foraging events during dives. Olive ridleys migrated northwestwards using the Guiana current and remained on the continental shelf at the edge of eddies formed by the North Brazil retroflection, an area characterized by low turbulence and high micronekton biomass. They performed mainly pelagic dives, hunting for an average 77% of their time. Hunting time within a dive increased with shallower euphotic depth and with lower water temperatures, and mean hunting depth increased with deeper thermocline. This is the first study to quantify foraging activity within dives in olive ridleys, and reveals the crucial role played by the thermocline on the foraging behavior of this carnivorous species. This study also provides novel and detailed data describing how turtles actively use oceanographic structures during post-nesting migration. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A total of 232 ground sample plots were used to estimate the biomass distribution in the Nakdong River estuary. Field data were overlain and correlated with digital values from an atmospherically corrected multispectral image (Landsat 8). The AGB distribution was derived using empirical models trained with field-measured AGB data. The final regression model for AGB estimation was composed using the OLI3, OLI4, and OLI7 spectral bands. The Pearson correlation between the observed and predicted biomass was significant (R = 0.84, p < 0.0001). OLI3 made the largest contribution to the final model (relative coefficient value: 53.4%) and revealed a negative relationship with the AGB biomass. The total distribution area of B. planiculmis was 1,922,979 m(2). Based on the model estimation, the total AGB had a dry weight (DW) of approximately 298.2 tons. The distribution of high biomass stands (> 200 kg DW/900 m(2)) constituted approximately 23.91% of the total vegetated area. Our findings suggest the expandability of remotely sensed products to understand the distribution pattern of estuarine plant productivity at the landscape level.

The antenna-array, which consists of eight elements housed in a certified external structure for a BASLER aircraft, was used for measurements during the 2013-2014 Antarctic field season. We performed measurements with this system in conjunction with two ultra-wideband radars operating over a frequency range of 2-8 GHz and 12-18 GHz on Siple Coast ice streams in West Antarctica during December 2013 and January 2014. We sounded ice thicker than 2 km with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of more than 20 dB in an area with two-way ice loss of about 27 dB/km. The same system also simultaneously mapped near-surface internal layers with submeter resolution from the ice-surface to a depth of about 1100 for 1200 m thick ice. In this paper, we provide a detailed overview of the radar instrumentation and signal processing algorithms and present a few sample results. The radar will be operated over a frequency range of 150-550 MHz with a 24-element antenna-array for wide-ranging measurements over the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, starting around August 2015.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				MAR	2016	9	3			SI		980	993		10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2403611								WOS:000373054100003

GIS-based modelling of vulnerability of coastal wetland ecosystems to environmental changes: Comerong Island, southeastern Australia	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					14th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)	MAR 06-11, 2016	Sydney, AUSTRALIA	Univ Sydney, Geocoastal Res Grp, Coastal Educ & Res Fdn, JCR				Sustainable management of coastal zones has become a complicated issue. The majority of the human population lives along the coast, where their activities, together with a range of environmental changes, have altered the natural ecosystem processes and caused changes in coastal wetlands. To ensure sustainable use of coastal resources, a comprehensive set of modelling tools can help managers to make decisions. This study uses Comerong Island (southeastern NSW, Australia) as a case study to demonstrate the importance of modelling modifications to environmental change. Several data-based modelling approaches are employed to explore how human activities have altered this estuarine island setting over the last sixty years (1949 2014). Multi-temporal changes in land cover, shorelines and sediment delivery are estimated from remote sensing data, GIS analysis, and laboratory tests on water and sediment samples (grain size, X-ray diffraction and loss on ignition and water analysis). Results show there are significant changes to the areal extents and elevation of mangroves, saltmarshes and shorelines in the wetlands on Comerong Island over the time period of analysis, including northern accretion (0.4 km(2)), eastern, middle and southern erosion (0.7 km(2)) of the island. The implementation of modelling using GIS tools, water and sediment samples to monitor ecosystem processes, such as sediment transport and erosion/deposition, will allow resource managers to make more informed decisions by evaluating the potential consequences of the existing situation.

For the demonstration, we selected the coast of French Guiana where mangrove physiognomy and extent continuously vary due to successive and recurrent erosion or accretion phases resulting from the alongshore migration of mud banks originating from the Amazon River. We modelled the French Guiana coastal system as a set of ecological and physical processes involving entities (e.g. ocean, mangrove shoreline, mud bank) that are in relation with each other. Interaction functions are written to specify how the entities change when they interact, according to the level of understanding and knowledge available. The scenario then describes what interaction functions are activated at each time step. We applied the approach to explain mangrove shoreline variations from 1986 to 2009 over 45 kilometres, and examined the contribution of alongshore and cross-shore wave energy and current velocities. The model was run with daily ERA-Interim/ECMWF waves and Mercator-Ocean currents as input data, whereas a time series of remote sensing images was used during the initialization and validation phases. We then discuss the flexibility of our approach to integrate existing models of mangrove forest dynamics.

During the growing season, MSAV develops to form dense canopy seaweed beds that play a vital role in coastal marine ecosystems and offer great potential to chemical, pharmaceutical, and bio-energy industries. At present, the total biomass and the distribution of the MSAV beds along the coast of Western Australia (WA) are not fully identified and quantified. Therefore, the application of satellite remote sensing data with high spatial resolution for examining the MSAV beds is required. The main objective of the present study was to assess and map the distribution of MSAV at two sites; Rottnest Island and Point Peron, Rockingham, WA, using WorldView-2 (WV2) satellite data. These study sites are important marine protected areas in WA waters with extraordinary documented biodiversity. By means of quantitative quadrat techniques, the MSAV canopy covers and fresh biomass data from the ground truth observations were assessed from September 2012 to December 2014. At Point Peron, the fresh biomass of Sargassum in the inter-tidal zone reached 5651.7 +/- 754.5, 5218.9 +/- 192.6, 1136.6 +/- 526.4, and 3472.2 +/- 434.2 g m(-2) for spring, summer, fall, and winter, respectively. The overall accuracy of the minimum distance method was employed and yielded the highest accuracy rates of 90.93% (Kappa coefficient, kappa = 0.96) and 97.13% (kappa = 0.96) for Rottnest Island and Point Peron, respectively. The Mahalanobis classification with overall accuracy yielded 90.66% (kappa = 0.88) and 94.16% (kappa = 0.85) for Rottnest Island and Point Peron, respectively. The study results revealed that WV2 satellite data provided evidence of the high accuracy of MSAV classification.

The drainage network of the Wadi Zerka Ma'in catchment area, located in the middle of the Dead Sea rift, parallels these structural orientations. A regional transtensive fault, with embedded normal faults, bounds the lower and middle part of the catchment area. The topographic profile of the Zerka Ma'in River exhibits two major knickpoints where it crosses two major embedded normal faults. The second major knickpoint developed as a result of the dramatic lowering of the Lisan Lake water level, a lake that predates the Dead Sea. The decreased water level triggered river incision into the clastic sandstone units of Wadi Zerka Ma'in. We performed a morphotectonic analysis study to investigate how the rock structures control the drainage network and the catchment area geomorphology. According to the transverse topographic symmetry factor (T), the catchment area is highly asymmetric. The major basin asymmetry trend is SE-oriented, parallel to the oldest set of fault systems. The catchment area displays a convex hypsometric curve indicating a very recent stage in the geomorphologic cycle. Our study indicates that the Lisan Lake catchment area shrinkage and structures growth controlled and shaped the Wadi Zerka Ma'in catchment area geomorphology. The combined use of a geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing was shown to be very efficient in unraveling the evolution of the drainage network and catchment area geomorphology.

Shoreline change rate and erosion risk assessment along the Trou Aux Biches-Mont Choisy beach on the northwest coast of Mauritius using GIS-DSAS technique	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The present study investigates the rate of shoreline change and erosion risk along the Trou aux Biches-Mont Choisy beach in the northwest coast of Mauritius using digital shoreline analysis system (DSAS). In this analysis, the long-term shoreline change rate and coastal erosion and accretion pattern are estimated along the coastal stretch using multi-temporal aerial photographs and high resolution satellite images for the past 45 years (1967-2012). The shoreline change rate and erosion/accretion pattern at each transects are estimated by five statistical parameters functionalized in DSAS 4.5 software such as end point rate (EPR), shoreline change envelop (SCE), net shoreline movement (NSM), linear regression rate (LRR), and least median of squares (LMS). The measurement of shoreline change rate and coastal erosion and accretion pattern has been described for three segments namely (1) North-North-West (NNW) to South-South-East (SSE); (2) North-East (NE) to South-West (SW); (3) North-North-East (NNE) to South-South-West (SSW) based on the coastal configuration. The analysis reveals that the severe erosion risk (-1.75 to -0.03 m/year) was noticed between transects 41 and 61 in NE-SW segments and moderate erosion risk (-1.09 to -0.18 m/year) between transects 62 and 95 of the NNE-SSW segments. The NNW-SSE segment shows low erosion risk with an EPR value of -0.55 to -0.05 m/year. The values of shoreline change rate of these transects indicate the occurrence of severe erosion along the coastal area over the periods of 1967-2012. However, the coastal segment in NNW-SSE configuration faces least erosion rate and the protective coral reefs reduce the wave energy action which leads to the formation of sustainable coast in the area. Moreover, poor set back and management activities with reference to high energetic waves, storm surge and cyclonic conditions produce direct impacts on the coastal morphology and degradation of coral reef ecosystem. The shoreline change studies through integrated remote sensing and GIS technology is considered of paramount importance for accurately focusing on planning, management and coastal intervention in long-term purpose.

A 4D-variational ocean data assimilation application for Santos Basin, Brazil	OCEAN DYNAMICS												Aiming to achieve systematic ocean forecasting for the southeastern Brazilian coast, an incremental 4D-Var data assimilation system is applied to a regional ocean model focused mainly in the Santos Basin region. This implementation is performed within the scope of The Santos Basin Ocean Observing System (or Project Azul), a pilot project designed to collect oceanographic data with enough frequency and spatial coverage so to improve regional forecasts through data assimilation. The ocean modeling and data assimilation system of Project Azul is performed with the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). The observations used in the assimilation cycles include the following: 1-day gridded, 0.1A degrees resolution SST from POES AVHRR; 1-day gridded, 0.3A degrees composite of the MDT SSH from AVISO; and surface and subsurface hydrographic measurements of temperature and salinity collected with gliders and ARGO floats from Project Azul and from UK Met-Office EN3 project dataset. The assimilative model results are compared to forward model results and independent observations, both from remote sensing and in situ sources. The results clearly show that 4D-Var data assimilation leads to an improvement in the skill of ocean hindcast in the studied region.																	1616-7341	1616-7228				MAR	2016	66	3					419	434		10.1007/s10236-016-0931-5								WOS:000371635900008

Role of flocculation and settling processes in development of the mangrove-colonized, Amazon-influenced mud-bank coast of South America	MARINE GEOLOGY												The Guianas coast downdrift (northwestward) of the Amazon River mouth is characterized by the periodic migration of mud banks that originate from the Amazon. The characteristic sizes of these banks as well as their rates of alongshore migration have been estimated from remote sensing. However, the physical mechanisms leading to their displacement are not yet fully understood. The present work is aimed at investigating a number of micro-scale processes involved in the coastal and estuarine dynamics of fine sediments, and expected to occur during the migration of mud banks. The relative magnitudes of flocculation, hindered settling and consolidation have been determined. Sampling of coastal mud was carried out during a field survey in 2001 that focussed on the fluid mud layer in the leading edge of a mud bank in French Guiana. Settling column experiments were conducted under quiescent conditions for various mean sediment concentrations in the range of 2.5-110 g.l(-1), which is typical of mud bank concentrations. The time dependent vertical profiles of suspended sediment concentration were monitored using an optical settling tank equipped with 32 pre-calibrated optical sensors. The corresponding settling velocities were deduced from the equation of the conservation of mass. The results show that the timescales of hindered settling and consolidation processes are much larger than the timescales of mixing mechanisms such as tides or propagating waves. The individual floc settling velocities are too small to counterbalance the turbulent mixing induced by breaking waves. Hindered settling, favoured by wave action and by the high background suspended sediment concentrations, is thus an overarching process in wave-driven mud bank migration. This pervasive hindered settling regime is characteristic of the wave-exposed outer and leading edges of mud banks where active mobilization of mud assures mud bank migration. As a result, consolidation is theoretically precluded. The experiments pointed out, however, that additional flocculation and differential settling should enhance sedimentation during slack water and under low wave conditions. We deduce from this that enhanced settling in the inner,subtidal-intertidal, parts of leading edges of banks during such conditions is important in the temporary sedimentation that generates gel-like fluid mud patches and mud bars. These low-energy inner, leading parts of banks form an accreted substrate colonized by mangroves, which further contribute to enhanced settling and rapid sedimentation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using mechanistic modelling, we investigated how global change relates to the invasion of European coasts by a non-native marine invertebrate, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. LocationBourgneuf Bay on the French Atlantic coast was considered as the northern boundary of C.gigas expansion at the time of its introduction to Europe in the 1970s. From this latitudinal reference, variations in the spatial distribution of the C.gigas reproductive niche were analysed along the north-western European coast from Gibraltar to Norway. MethodsThe effects of environmental variations on C.gigas physiology and phenology were studied using a bioenergetics model based on Dynamic Energy Budget theory. The model was forced with environmental time series including insitu phytoplankton data, and satellite data of sea surface temperature and suspended particulate matter concentration. ResultsSimulation outputs were successfully validated against insitu oyster growth data. In Bourgneuf Bay, the rise in seawater temperature and phytoplankton concentration has increased C.gigas reproductive effort and led to precocious spawning periods since the 1960s. At the European scale, seawater temperature increase caused a drastic northward shift (1400km within 30years) in the C.gigas reproductive niche and optimal thermal conditions for early life stage development. Main conclusionsWe demonstrated that the poleward expansion of the invasive species C.gigas is related to global warming and increase in phytoplankton abundance. The combination of mechanistic bioenergetics modelling with insitu and satellite environmental data is a valuable framework for ecosystem studies. It offers a generic approach to analyse historical geographical shifts and to predict the biogeographical changes expected to occur in a climate-changing world.

J	Li, ZQ				Li, Zhiqiang			Rip current hazards in South China headland beaches	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Beaches and coastal regions are commonly primary tourist destinations. Dollars spent by beach visitors annually provide significant input to local and regional economies. Hazards associated with rip currents can influence the suitably of any given stretch of coast as a recreational resource, and thus impact tourist dollars spent in addition to the safety and well-being of beach visitors. Therefore it is crucial to evaluate the degree of rip current risk along recreational beaches in order to protect human lives, maintain tourist attraction, and aid beach managers. Accordingly, a new rip current hazard assessment method is proposed based on the beach state model. Using the measured morphodynamic parameters (wave parameters, tidal ranges and sediment grain size) of 51 South China beaches, a preliminary assessment of rip current hazards was carried out. Results show that 71% of South China beaches may develop rip currents. The beaches in southern Fujian, Shanwei (in eastern Guangdong) and western Guangdong, and eastern and southern Hainan coasts have the highest risk of rip current development. The evaluation results are consistent with remote sensing observations, and beach incident (drowning and near drowning) media reports. This paper indicates that the beach morphodynamic model of Q-RTR (dimensionless fall velocity-relative tidal range) is a reasonable method to assess the rip current risk along sandy beaches. This information can aid coastal managers as well as reduce the frequency of rip current related incidents. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study attempts to identify the environmental sensitivity to the oil spill of Karnataka coast by using GIS and remote sensing techniques. Nearly 300 km long coastline of Karnataka is endowed with a vast variety of natural resources and aesthetics. Several of the rivers that originate in the Western Ghats form wide extensive estuaries, backwaters and mangrove forests before debouching into the Arabian Sea. Besides, several non-vegetal wetlands like beaches, spits, shoals, mudflats, rocky cliffs and a few islands are found scattered all along the coast. A major port (New Mangalore Port), ten minor ports and a naval base (near Karwar) are also situated in the study area. As a result, various ESI types namely: 1A, 1B, 3A, 4, 6B, 8B, 9B, 10A, 10B and 10D were noticed in the study area. Bio-resources such as birds, marine mammals, reptiles (sea turtle), shellfish; and habitats like corals etc.; and human-use resources such as factories, ferry, boat ramp, access to vehicles, beach etc. are mapped in this study.

A combined GLAS and MODIS estimation of the global distribution of mean forest canopy height	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Mapping the global distribution of forest canopy height is important for estimating forest biomass and terrestrial carbon flux. In this study, we present a global map of mean forest canopy height at 500 m spatial resolution obtained by combining Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) data acquired from 2005 to 2006 and 13 ancillary variables, including seven climatic variables and six remote sensing variables (nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance at red and NIR bands, tree cover, anisotropic factor, accumulated Enhanced Vegetation Index, and elevation). The original contributions of this study include the following: (1) The wavelet method was applied to complement the GLA14 product to identify the ground peak and the top-canopy peak. We found that it was useful for dealing with waveforms with low reconstruction accuracy. (2) GLAS data from the leafless season were not used for non evergreen forest because the height retrieval results exhibited underestimation and strong variations. (3) The an isotropic factor (ANIF), an indicator related to surface structure, was included as an ancillary variable for the first time and was determined to be important for height modeling in the Asian and North American regions. (4) The balanced random forest (BRF) algorithm was applied to register GLAS mean forest canopy height to a 500 m grid considering the small proportion of extreme height classes (tall and short trees), and it achieved good performance in terms of modeling accuracy (RMSE = 2.75 to 4.45 m) and preserving data variation. An inter-comparison among three global forest height maps [the present study, Lefsky (2010), and Simard et al. (2011)] was implemented in a pixel-by-pixel manner. High agreement (R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 4.49 m) was determined between the present study and Simard et al., whereas the result from Lefsky was notably different from the other two results (R-2 = 0.14, RMSE = 8.92 m, compared with the present study; R-2 = 0.11, RMSE 11.19 m, compared with Simard et al.). Large disparities were generally associated with evergreen broadleaf forests in South America, deciduous needleleaf forests in Europe and Russian North Asia, and evergreen needleleaf forests on the West Coast of North America. Differences in the height metric were a main factor affecting the disparities among the three results. Validation against field survey data acquired from the Distributed Active Archive Center indicated the accuracy of our mean forest canopy height map (R-2 = 0.63, RMSE = 4.68 m, n = 59).

J	Gherboudj, I; Ghedira, H				Gherboudj, Imen; Ghedira, Hosni			Assessment of solar energy potential over the United Arab Emirates using remote sensing and weather forecast data	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS												This research proposes innovative maps to describe the land relative suitability indices for the implementation of solar energy systems (PV and CSP) over the United Arab Emirates. These maps have been developed by combining the solar irradiances maps (global horizontal irradiance and direct normal irradiance) with the effects of the land constraints (land slope, land use and land accessibility to the transportation infrastructure) and weather conditions (airborne dust properties, wind speed, relative humidity, air temperature). Remote sensing, weather forecast models and geospatial information system (GIS) offer excellent tools for estimating and monitoring the aforementioned data at high temporal and spatial resolutions. Indeed, these data have acceptable accuracy to provide a good understanding of the degree of exposure to these data over each location. Our results highlight the potential for using the considered tools to estimate the UAE land capability map, dust/relative-humidity/air-temperature risk map and finally the land relative suitability index for both PV and CSP power plants setting. The obtained results confirm that PV power plants are more appropriate for the UAE context than CSP power plants. In fact, the most suitable areas for PV power plants are located in the eastern side of the country, an area which represents 9.7% of the UAE's total land area. As for the CSP power plants, their most suitable areas are located on the coast nearby Abu-Dhabi and the extreme south of the UAE, with an area that represents 1%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, discriminating various types of salt marsh is rather difficult because of their strong spectral similarities. Previous salt marsh mapping studies have focused mainly on high spatial and spectral (i.e., hyperspectral) resolution images combined with auxiliary information; however, the results are often limited to small regions. With a high temporal and moderate spatial resolution, the Chinese HuanJing-1 (HJ-1) satellite optical imagery can be used not only to monitor phenological changes of salt marsh vegetation over short-time intervals, but also to obtain coverage of large areas. Here, we apply HJ-1 satellite imagery to the middle coast of Jiangsu in east China to monitor changes in saltmarsh vegetation cover. First, we constructed a monthly NDVI time-series to classify various types of salt marsh and then we tested the possibility of using compressed time-series continuously, to broaden the applicability of this particular approach. Our principal findings are as follows: (1) the overall accuracy of salt marsh mapping based on the monthly NDVI time-series was 90.3%, which was similar to 16.0% higher than the single-phase classification strategy; (2) a compressed time-series, including NDVI from six key months (April, June-September, and November), demonstrated very little reduction (2.3%) in overall accuracy but led to obvious improvements in unstable regions; and (3) a simple-rule for Spartina alterniflora identification was established using a scene solely from November, which may provide an effective way for regularly monitoring its distribution.

Modeling the weekly cycle of NOx and CO emissions and their impacts on O-3 in the Los Angeles-South Coast Air Basin during the CalNex 2010 field campaign	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												We developed a new nitrogen oxide (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) emission inventory for the Los Angeles-South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) expanding the Fuel-based Inventory for motor-Vehicle Emissions and applied it in regional chemical transport modeling focused on the California Nexus of Air Quality and Climate Change (CalNex) 2010 field campaign. The weekday NOx emission over the SoCAB in 2010 is 620td(-1), while the weekend emission is 410td(-1). The NOx emission decrease on weekends is caused by reduced diesel truck activities. Weekday and weekend CO emissions over this region are similar: 2340 and 2180td(-1), respectively. Previous studies reported large discrepancies between the airborne observations of NOx and CO mixing ratios and the model simulations for CalNex based on the available bottom-up emission inventories. Utilizing the newly developed emission inventory in this study, the simulated NOx and CO mixing ratios agree with the observations from the airborne and the ground-based in situ and remote sensing instruments during the field study. The simulations also reproduce the weekly cycles of these chemical species. Both the observations and the model simulations indicate that decreased NOx on weekends leads to enhanced photochemistry and increase of O-3 and O-x (=O-3+NO2) in the basin. The emission inventory developed in this study can be extended to different years and other urban regions in the U.S. to study the long-term trends in O-3 and its precursors with regional chemical transport models.

The study aims to assess the shoreline changes and prediction in Sagar Island, a delta of the Ganges, situated in West Bengal, India. Shorelines have been delineated by using Tasseled Cap Transformation techniques from the Landsat MSS (1975), Landsat TM (1989, 1991) and Landsat ETM+ (1999, 2002, 2005, 2008, and 2011) images. The uncertainty was calculated for every year for assessing the positional error related to shoreline extraction. Total shoreline change rate/year has also been calculated and the uncertainty of total shoreline change rate was found +/- 3.20 m/year. In the present study, End Point Rate (EPR) and Linear Regression (LR) methods have been used for shoreline change rate calculation and prediction of shoreline. Long term (1975-2002) and short term (2002-2011) erosion and accretion rates were calculated for the study area. Sagar is the biggest island of the Sundarban region; so, it was divided into three segments in order to analyze the change on a segment basis. It was observed that the most of erosion occurred in the Segment B (south Sagar). The rate of erosion was -7.91 and -7.01 m/year for the periods 1975-2002 and 2002-2011 respectively. The mean shoreline change rate was high in Segment B (South Sagar) with values of -6.46 m/year (1975-2002) but the rate was decreased into -5.25 m/year during the later period (2002-2011). The study reveals that most of the southern part of Sagar Island is vulnerable to high rate of shoreline erosion.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				FEB	2016	20	1					61	80		10.1007/s11852-015-0418-4								WOS:000373149500006

Topographically mediated ice stream subglacial drainage networks	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Satellite laser altimetry reveals short timescale changes in Antarctic ice sheet surface elevation that are suggested to be driven by subglacial water transport and storage. Here details of the interaction between the dynamics of ice stream flow, subglacial water system, and bed elevation relief are examined in the context of idealized, heterogeneous bed geometries. Using a two-way coupled model of ice and subglacial water flow, we show that basal topography controls the temporal and spatial variability of the sub-ice stream hydraulic system. The orientation and characteristic dimensions of the topographic undulations determine the morphology (connected subglacial ponds or channel-like subglacial water features) and timescales of the sub-ice stream drainage system. The short-term (several years to decades) variability of the simulated coupled ice stream/subglacial water system suggests that the short-term surface variations detected in remote sensing observations may be indicative of a rapidly evolving subglacial water system. Our simulations also show that interaction between ice flow and the highly dynamic subglacial water system has a strong effect on effective stress in the ice. Large effective stress magnitudes arise over areas where the basal traction is characterized by strong spatial gradients, that is, transitions from high to low basal traction or vise versa. These transitions migrate on multiyear timescales and thus cause large effective stress variability on the same temporal scales.																	2169-9003	2169-9011				FEB	2016	121	2					497	510		10.1002/2015JF003660								WOS:000372928400016						
J	Parinussa, RM; Lakshmi, V; Johnson, F; Sharma, A				Parinussa, Robert M.; Lakshmi, Venkat; Johnson, Fiona; Sharma, Ashish			Comparing and Combining Remotely Sensed Land Surface Temperature Products for Improved Hydrological Applications	REMOTE SENSING												Land surface temperature (LST) is an important variable that provides a valuable connection between the energy and water budget and is strongly linked to land surface hydrology. Space-borne remote sensing provides a consistent means for regularly observing LST using thermal infrared (TIR) and passive microwave observations each with unique strengths and weaknesses. The spatial resolution of TIR based LST observations is around 1 km, a major advantage when compared to passive microwave observations (around 10 km). However, a major advantage of passive microwaves is their cloud penetrating capability making them all-weather sensors whereas TIR observations are routinely masked under the presence of clouds and aerosols. In this study, a relatively simple combination approach that benefits from the cloud penetrating capacity of passive microwave sensors was proposed. In the first step, TIR and passive microwave LST products were compared over Australia for both anomalies and raw timeseries. A very high agreement was shown over the vast majority of the country with R-2 typically ranging from 0.50 to 0.75 for the anomalies and from 0.80 to 1.00 for the raw timeseries. Then, the scalability of the passive microwave based LST product was examined and a pixel based merging approach through linear scaling was proposed. The individual and merged LST products were further compared against independent LST from the re-analysis model outputs. This comparison revealed that the TIR based LST product agrees best with the re-analysis data (R-2 0.26 for anomalies and R-2 0.76 for raw data), followed by the passive microwave LST product (R-2 0.16 for anomalies and R-2 0.66 for raw data) and the combined LST product (R-2 0.18 for anomalies and R-2 0.62 for raw data). It should be noted that the drop in performance comes with an increased revisit frequency of approximately 20% compared to the revised frequency of the TIR alone. Additionally, this comparison against re-analysis data was subdivided over Australia's major climate zones and revealed that the relative agreement between the individual and combined LST products against the re-analysis data is consistent over these climate zones. These results are also consistent for both the anomalies and the raw time series. Finally, two examples were provided that demonstrate the proposed merging approach including an example for the Hunter Valley floods along Australia's central coast that experienced significant flooding in April 2015.

Geomorphological evolution of marine heads on the eastern coast of Red Sea at Saudi Arabian region, using remote sensing techniques	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The eastern coast of the Red Sea is characterized by the presence of numerous marine heads that differ in terms of shape, size, geological setting, structures, and composition. This difference directly affects geomorphological evolution. In the present study, Ras Al-Shabaan was chosen as a most important area in this coast. Field investigations supported with photo-interpretation techniques were performed for studying of geomorphological features of Ras Al-Shabaan. On the other hand, the remotely sensed imagery data has been used extensively in the identification of geological and geomorphological details of Ras Al-Shabaan. The geomorphological studies showed that depositional processes of wadis and channels are predominant at the Ras Al-Shabaan coast. The changes in geomorphological and geological data of Ras Al-Shabaan were identified by remote sensing image software. Two Landsat ETM+ images from 1990 and 2010 have been processed. The analysis of remote sensing data combined with field investigations and reference data were used to monitor, delineate, and describe the geomorphological changes of Ras Al-Shabaan coast during proceedings of supervised classification of ground units. Hence, the change detection statistics have been used in ground units. Geological and geomorphological maps were digitized by using ArcGIS software. Remote sensing techniques and geographic information system (GIS) were employed in order to monitor the results of changes occurred in the line of the coast. The satellite image processing and water index data were transferred to the ArcGIS program to draw the coast lines and to stand on the changes occurred. Thereby, it was possible to identify the most prominent landforms and geomorphic units of this area. Results showed that platforms, barriers, rocky heads, islands, coral reefs, submerged reefs, tidal channels, dissolution grooves, sabkhas, inlet system, waves work, and shoreline processes were included in coastal prominent landforms. The circumstances that formed this coast are not permanent, as it is changing rapidly and continuously due to erosion and uplift processes.

Long-term monitoring of biophysical characteristics of tidal wetlands in the northern Gulf of Mexico - A methodological approach using MODIS	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT					2014 ForestSAT Conference	NOV 04-07, 2014	Riva del Garda, ITALY					Accurate and efficient monitoring is critically important for the effective restoration and conservation of threatened tidal wetlands in the Gulf Coast. The high carbon sequestration potential, habitat for important wildlife and fish, and numerous ecosystem services make these tidal wetlands highly valuable both ecologically and economically to Gulf Coast communities. Our study developed a new methodological approach for mapping biophysical health of coastal tidal wetland habitats in terms of green leaf area index (GLAI), canopy level chlorophyll content (CHL), vegetation fraction (VF), and above ground green biomass (GBM). We measured these biophysical characteristics in tidal wetlands of the northern Gulf of Mexico using a combination of ground data collected from field surveys during the growing seasons of 2010 and 2011 and NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 m and 500 m images. Additionally, we compared and evaluated the performances of both in situ proximal and satellite remote sensing measurements in terms of their potential for mapping the wetland biophysical characteristics. MODIS-based models proved superior at the landscape level compared to models developed from in situ proximal sensing, as species level signals seemed to be diluted at coarser spatial scales. We selected Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI) for MODIS 250 m and Visible Atmospheric Resistant Index (VARI) for MODIS 500 m to map biophysical characteristics of tidal wetlands. Time-series composites and phenological information derived using the MODIS based models captured the impact of the selected disturbances in the last decade on the ecological and physiological status of the tidal wetland habitats in the Gulf Coast. This is the first study to employ MODIS data to analyze the biophysical characteristics of tidal wetlands in the Gulf Coast, which, in turn, has the potential to improve our ability to predict their productivity and carbon sequestration potential. These techniques could also be used to assess the success of previous and ongoing tidal wetland restoration projects, and evaluate the productivity of marshes under threat from developmental activity, sea level rise, and industrial pollution.

In this study, we applied long-term (9 yr) air quality, meteorological, and ground-based remote sensing data for investigating the transported haze events over Northern Taiwan in winter. Thirty-six haze events were identified using a statistical method and information pertaining to wind direction and episode duration. In contrast to haze events over China, the transported haze exhibits low relative humidity (approximately 70%) and high wind speed (approximately 5 m s(-1)) and is associated with a migrating high-pressure system. The mass concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) for the haze events was 57.1 +/- 13.6 mu g m(-3), nearly four times higher than that of the background (13.7 +/- 7.4 mu g m(-3)). Such high PM levels persisted for 120 h in winter. Back trajectory analysis suggests that the haze particles were transported from the east coast of China, particularly from the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) area with a traveling time of nearly 28 h. Lidar observations clarify that the Chinese haze was transported to Northern Taiwan and accompanied by low clouds and a temperature inversion layer, which confined the particles to a height of less than 1 km. Moreover, a relatively high PM2.5 concentration (65.0 mu g m(-3)) was observed when air mass stagnated over YRD before advancing to Taiwan. This scenario, most frequently seen in the winter of 2013, resulted in the highest historical PM2.5 concentration (approximately 77.2 mu g m(-3)). We propose that the heavy haze year is primarily attributable to synoptic weather variability and less to climate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	He, SY; Huang, DJ; Zeng, DY				He, Shuangyan; Huang, Daji; Zeng, Dingyong			Double SST fronts observed from MODIS data in the East China Sea off the Zhejiang-Fujian coast, China	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												We report a double coastal front system off the Zhejiang (Zhe) and Fujian (Min) Provinces in the East China Sea in winter. In addition to the well-known Zhe-Min offshore coastal front along 50 m isobath, a secondary near-shore coastal thermal front along 20 m isobath is also apparent in December and January. The fronts were observed by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) at monthly mean nighttime sea surface temperature (SST) during 2000-2013 in terms of SST gradients. Our results showed temporal and spatial variations of the two fronts as follows: (1) both offshore front and near-shore front often co-exist between 26.5 degrees N and 29.5 degrees N in December and between 28.0 degrees N and 29.5 degrees N in January. However, only the offshore front is apparent in November and February. (2) The near-shore front is narrow (4-16 km), while the offshore front is three to four times wider (16-48 km). (3) In contrast to the well-known offshore front which exists throughout the winter with a strong intensity, the near-shore front has a shorter lifetime with a weak intensity, and has been overlooked by previous studies. Finally, we proposed that the bottom bathymetric gradients may play an important role in the frontogenesis of the double fronts. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Modelling the spatial distribution of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica along the North African coast: Implications for the assessment of Good Environmental Status	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile, 1813 is a seagrass species endemic to the Mediterranean Sea, which is considered as an indicator of environment quality in coastal areas. This species forms large meadows, which are sensitive to several anthropogenic pressures and the decrease in their extension is considered a priority issue for the Mediterranean Sea. The aim of this study was to develop a Species Distribution Model for P. oceanica, to be applied to the Mediterranean North African coast, in order to obtain an estimation of the potential distribution of this species in the region. The Species Distribution Model was calibrated using high resolution data from 4 Mediterranean sites, located in Italy and Spain, as the study area is a data-poor zone with regard to seagrass distribution (i.e. only for some areas detailed distribution maps are available). The model was then validated using available data concerning the North African coast. The probability of presence of the species in a given area was modelled using a binomial generalized linear model as a function of the bathymetry and water transparency, dissolved organic matter, sea surface temperature and salinity, mainly obtained from satellite data. Model selection procedure suggests that water transparency plays a major role, but also other variables, such as salinity and sea surface temperature, are important at larger spatial scales in explaining meadows distribution. The availability of high resolution time-series of input data allowed us to apply the validated model to the whole North African coast. Suitable areas are strongly related to the coastal realm, and cover a large portion of North African coasts, with Tunisian and Lybian ones being the most relevant zones for this species. In particular, the shelf of the Gulf of Gabes includes large areas with environmental conditions suitable for the species.

Based on spectral analysis, differences in spectral characteristics were found over different underlying surfaces, which include land, sea, middle/high level clouds, stratus clouds and sea fog. Statistical analysis showed that the R-rc (412 nm) (Rayleigh Corrected Reflectance) of sea fog pixels is approximately 0.1-0.6. Similarly, various band combinations could be used to separate different surfaces. Therefore, three indices (SLDI, MCDI and BSI) were set to discern land/sea, middle/high level clouds and fog/stratus clouds, respectively, from which it was generally easy to extract fog pixels. The remote sensing algorithm was verified using coastal sounding data, which demonstrated that the algorithm had the ability to detect sea fog. The algorithm was then used to monitor an 8-hour sea fog event and the results were consistent with observational data from buoys data deployed near the Sheyang coast (121 degrees E, 34 degrees N). The goal of this study was to establish a daytime sea fog detection algorithm based on GOCI data, which shows promise for detecting fog separately from stratus.

This degradation can result in significant surface subsidence and retreat of coastal bluffs and riverbanks with large consequences to landscape evolution, infrastructure damage, and water quality. We used remote sensing and field observations to assess patterns and rates of riverbank erosion at a 35-m-high active yedoma bluff along the Itkillik River in northern Alaska. The total volumetric ground-ice content including wedge, segregated, and pore ice-was estimated to be similar to 86%. The process of riverbank erosion and stabilization include three main stages typical of the areas with ice-rich permafrost: (1) thermal erosion combined with thermal denudation, (2) thermal denudation, and (3) slope stabilization. Active riverbank erosion at the main study site started in July 1995, when the Itkillik River changed its channel. The total retreat of the riverbank during 1995-2010 within different segments of the bluff varied from 180 to 280 m; the average retreat rate for the most actively eroded part of the riverbank was almost 19 m/y. From August 2007 to August 2011, the total retreat varied from 10 to almost 100 m. The average retreat rate for the whole 680-m-long bluff was 11 m/y. For the most actively eroded central part of the bluff (150 m long) it was 20 m/y, ranging from 16 to 24 m/y. More than 180,000 m(3) of ground ice and organic-rich frozen soil, or almost 70,000 metric tons (t) of soil solids including 880 t of organic carbon, were transported to the river from the retreating bank annually. This study reports the highest long-term rates of riverbank erosion ever observed in permafrost regions of Eurasia and North America. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The tsunami generated by this earthquake reached up to 7 m run-up height and extended over 1.3 km inundation. This paper aims to revisit the impact of the 2001 Peruvian tsunami on the coastal area and its morphology along Camana city. The tsunami source is reconstructed through inversion of tsunami waveform records observed at several tide gauge stations and the impact is analyzed using the numerical result and moderate-resolution satellite images to calculate the inundation features in the coast. Finally we propose the tsunami source model suitable for further analysis of this event through tsunami numerical simulations. In addition, environmental changes, in particular the impact to vegetation areas, were evaluated using satellite imagery. An important reduction of agricultural areas due to tsunami impact and soil salinization was confirmed.

Shoreline and Coastal Morphological Changes Induced by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami in the Katchal Island, Andaman and Nicobar A Study Using Archived Satellite Images	TSUNAMIS AND EARTHQUAKES IN COASTAL ENVIRONMENTS: SIGNIFICANCE AND RESTORATION	Coastal Research Library											The December 24, 2004 Sumatra earthquake and Tsunami had caused large damage to the coastal environment in the Indian Ocean countries. Continuous monitoring of shorelines are needed to understand the causes and consequences of recent changes and to assess the long term impact of tsunami waves. Assessment of the shoreline and coastal morphological changes due to tsunami in Katchal Island have been lacking due to obstacles in the fi eld data acquisition owing to their remote location. As access to the ground information is limited, the only possibility is the monitoring of shorelines from multi-temporal satellite images. In this study, we demonstrate the methods used in extracting shorelines and analyzing their changes using the data from Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites, the EO1-ALI and Landsat images in a GIS environment. Eight satellite images acquired between 2004 and 2014 where used for the shoreline change and coastal morphology analysis in the Katchal Island. The results showed that the island experienced extensive erosion and signifi cant loss in land area of about 20 km(2). Erosion has been more prevalent than accretion at an average linear regression rate of similar to-13 m/year between 2004 and 2010. Net shoreline movement of more than 4 km landward has been observed at the western coast of the island. Regions of high net shoreline movements were associated with bay-mouth areas, and regions linked with coastal inlets. This study demonstrates the strong potential of archived satellite images for detecting shoreline movements in far-off islands. The results will likewise help in understanding the response and recovery of shorelines in Indian Ocean regions after the 2004 tsunami.																	2211-0577		978-3-319-28528-3; 978-3-319-28526-9				2016	14						65	77		10.1007/978-3-319-28528-3_5	10.1007/978-3-319-28528-3							WOS:000398067600006

Satellite images and topographic maps spanning the period 1972-2013 were processed to map fishponds and the natural habitats over which they have encroached. Historical archives were consulted and interviews were conducted to understand the historical exploitation of local natural resources and the reasons behind the recorded land changes. Results showed that aquaculture developed in the late nineteenth century and expanded subsequently across the landscape under a succession of forcing factors. The global market, for example, played an early role but a number of land-use changes were also a direct response to changing environmental constraints and natural hazards. These cumulative events have promoted continuous gain in favor of aquaculture, to the detriment of other land-use options.

Advanced optical and radar satellite imagery is the most applicable tool for mapping and identification of inaccessible regions in Antarctic. Consequently, an improved scientific research using remote sensing technology would be essential to provide new and more complete lithological and structural data to fill the numerous knowledge gaps on Antarctica's geology. In this investigation, Oscar coast area in Graham Land, Antarctic Peninsula (AP) was selected to conduct a remote sensing study using Landsat-7 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat-8 and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data. Contrast-enhanced Red-Green-Blue (RGB) composites, band ratios and Relative Band Depth (RBD) image processing techniques were applied to Landsat-8 and ASTER dataset for establishing the spectral separation of the main lithologic groups exposed in the study area. The outcomes of this investigation demonstrated the applications of SWIR and TIR bands of the multispectral remote sensing datasets to identify lithological units and producing geological maps with suitable accuracy of ice-free rock regions in the Antarctic Peninsula. The results could be extended to map coverage of non-investigated regions further east and validated previously inferred geological observations concerning other rocks and mineral deposits throughout the Antarctica.																	2194-9034						2016	42-4	W1					77	81		10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-4-W1-77-2016								WOS:000402559600011

Rising in sea level, shoreline erosion, stresses on fisheries, population pressure, interference of land-use and lack of institutional capabilities for integrated management make major challenges. Recent investigations and satellite observations indicate HABs originated from specific coast that have favourable geographic, geomorphic and coastal geology conditions to bring the green macro algae from the coast offshore. Therefore, the identification of high HABs frequented bays using remote sensing and geology investigations in Malaysian waters is required to reduce future challenges in this unique case. This research implemented comprehensive geomorphic and coastal geology investigations combined with remote sensing digital image processing approach to identify Malaysian bays frequented with HABs occurrence in Malaysian waters territory. The landscape and geomorphological features of the Malaysian bays were constructed from the Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) remote sensing satellite data combined with field observations and surveying. The samples for laboratory analysis were collected from the sediment stations with different distance across shorelines features and watersheds of the Johor Bahru estuary. This research identified that semi-enclosed bays such as Kuala Lumpur and Johor Bahru bays with connection to estuaries have high potential to be frequented with HABs occurrence.

This research utilizes field surveys and analyses of multi-resolution remote sensing images to clarify the impact on landscapes caused by this disaster and also to monitor the subsequent survival and recovery process in the Sendai Bay region. MODIS data (250 m resolution) were employed to map the overall extent of inundation and damage on the regional landscape scale. The major damage caused by the tsunami, destruction of coastal pine forests and inundation of rice paddies on the plain, was identified at this level. Progressively finer-scale analyses were then implemented using SPOT/HRG-2 (10 m resolution) data, GeoEye-1 fine-resolution data (0.5 m), very fine-resolution aerial photographs (10 cm) and LiDAR. These results demonstrated the minute details of the damage and recovery process down to the level of individual groves and trees. The results of the research show that on the wide-scale regional level, plant communities on rocky cliffs along the rias-style Sanriku Coast survived relatively intact, but coastal forests and other vegetations on sandy beaches and other low-lying coasts were severely damaged. Finer-scale analyses of a coastal pine forest in the Sendai Bay area showed that local topography influenced the patterns of damage and survival for individual trees. At the finest level, damaged pine forests and sandy beach vegetation could be seen recovering only a little more than a year after the disaster. Continuous monitoring using fieldwork and remote sensing is required for balanced regional strategies that provide for economic and social recovery as well as restoration of vegetation, biodiversity and vital ecotones.																	2191-0707		978-4-431-56448-5; 978-4-431-56446-1				2016							253	269		10.1007/978-4-431-56448-5_16	10.1007/978-4-431-56448-5							WOS:000402094400017

A High-Frequency Radar Oceanic Current Monitoring System for the Texas Coast	OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE MONTEREY					MTS/IEEE Oceans Conference	SEP 19-23, 2016	Monterey, CA	MTS, IEEE				The Texas coast represents an area of interest for a wide variety of stakeholders, including the oil industry (for both, exploration and operation purposes), fisheries and living resource management, ecosystem, coastal hazard mitigation and planning, and ocean and coastal education. For more than twenty years, the Texas coast has relied on the Texas Automated Buoy System (TABS) for real-time surface current measurements. In early 2016, the installation of a network of high-frequency coastal ocean radars was implemented to supplement the in situ observations of the TABS system with terrestrial-based remote sensing observations of surface currents. The first set of paired systems, located at Rollover Pass and Surfside Beach, Texas, are providing data hourly in near-real time. A comparison between the time series for the radar and buoys was made in order to determine the correlation coefficient between these signals; correlation coefficients above 0.5 were found for the three buoy locations included in this research, for both, the meridional and zonal component. This project represents the integration of the Texas coast into the high-frequency radar national network, and constitutes the first stage of a three methods comparison, which will include the data of the high frequency radar, an Autonomous Surface Vehicle and TABS.																			978-1-5090-1537-5				2016																		WOS:000399929001004

The two major objectives in SAR based remote sensing of sea ice is on the one hand to have a large coverage of the imaged ground area, and on the other hand to obtain a radar response that carries as much information as possible. Whereas single-polarimetric acquisitions of existing sensors offer a wide coverage on the ground, dual polarimetric, or even better fully polarimetric data offer a higher information content which allows for a more reliable automated sea ice analysis. In order to reconcile the advantages of fully polarimetric acquisitions with the higher ground coverage of acquisitions with fewer polarimetric channels, hybrid polarimetric acquisitions offer a trade-off between the mentioned objectives. With the advent of the RISAT-1 satellite platform, we are able to explore the potential of hybrid dual pol acquisitions for sea ice analysis and classification. Our algorithmic approach for an automated sea ice classification consists of two steps. In the first step, we perform a feature extraction procedure. The resulting feature vectors are then ingested into a trained neural network classifier to arrive at a pixelwise supervised classification.

Continuous and complete dock data could hardly be extracted by existing coast dock extraction method, because the spatial relationships and other characteristics of dock are often ignored which only considers grayscale characteristics of remote sensing image. A dock extraction method based on waterline and perceptual organization is proposed in this paper. To make full use of characteristics spatial relationships, perceptual organization is introduced into dock extraction. Firstly, waterline of coast zone remote sensing image is extracted. Then, perceptual organization and evidence theory are introduced, after which doing perceptual organization based on grayscale characteristics and structural features following the rules of perceptual organization. Finally, evidence is verified to accurately extract dock contours. Experimental results show that the method is able to accurately extract continuous and complete dock contours, providing a new approach for coast dock accurate extraction.																	2153-6996		978-1-5090-3332-4				2016							6201	6204		10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730620								WOS:000388114606019

Measurement of changes in area and mass of the Antarctic ice sheet is critically important and has been made by using different remote sensing technologies and ground exploration data. Sequential mapping of Antarctic boundaries provides a simple and direct method for measuring the area and volume if ice sheet or ice shelves advances or retreats in the Antarctic coasts. Our results show that the total ice shelf area is retreated between 1963 and 2009. However, the trend for each ice shelf is quite different.																	2194-9034						2016	41	B8					545	547		10.5194/isprsarchives-XLI-B8-545-2016								WOS:000393156000092

MAPPING OF THE SEAGRASS COVER ALONG THE MEDITERRANEAN COAST OF TURKEY USING LANDSAT 8 OLI IMAGES	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VIII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				Benthic habitat is defined as ecological environment where marine animals, plants and other organisms live in. Benthic habitat mapping is defined as plotting the distribution and extent of habitats to create a map with complete coverage of the seabed showing distinct boundaries separating adjacent habitats or the use of spatially continuous environmental data sets to represent and predict biological patterns on the seafloor. Seagrass is an essential endemic marine species that prevents coast erosion and regulates carbon dioxide absorption in both undersea and atmosphere. Fishing, mining, pollution and other human activities cause serious damage to seabed ecosystems and reduce benthic biodiversity. According to the latest studies, only 5-10% of the seafloor is mapped, therefore it is not possible to manage resources effectively, protect ecologically important areas. In this study, it is aimed to map seagrass cover using Landsat 8 OLI images in the northern part of Mediterranean coast of Turkey. After pre-processing (e.g. radiometric, atmospheric, water depth correction) of Landsat images, coverage maps are produced with supervised classification using in-situ data which are underwater photos and videos. Result maps and accuracy assessment are presented and discussed.

Gregoric			SPATIAL CHANGES AND POPULATION MOVEMENTS ON THE ALBANIAN COASTLINE	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VIII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				The last decade has seen a large increase in construction along the southern Albanian coastline, mainly in the rise of large tourist complexes comprising hotels, apartment houses, touristic villages, and so on. These constructions rarely follow urban planning and not only change its landscape but also often threaten the ecological value of the coastal zone. The uncontrolled and devastating construction along the coast has been accompanied by coastal erosion caused by the sea with the intensity up to 50 cm/year. This paper investigates the environmental change monitoring on the Albanian Riviera by analysing optical remote sensing data (Landsat 5 and 8) in the period between 1984 and 2015. The image analysis results grounded on the change vector analysis indicate coastal morphology changes and land cover changes in the coastal environment, which appear mostly due to erosion in river delta and urban growth. Apart from identifying both phenomena through time, the objective of this study is to show that these landscape changes in fact correlate with the population migration as well as to explain why and the extent to which Albania is one of the most migratory countries in Europe. Based on the multidisciplinary research, which combines anthropological method with spatial analysis, this presentation anticipates future changes in this area. It argues that movements of both people and in landscape formations strongly influence each other, constituting a closely corresponding relationship.																	2194-9034						2016	41	B8					1141	1146		10.5194/isprsarchives-XLI-B8-1141-2016								WOS:000393156000192

DETECTION OF COASTLINE DEFORMATION USING REMOTE SENSING AND GEODETIC SURVEYS	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VIII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				The coastal areas are being destroyed due to the usage that effect the natural balance. Unconsciously sand mining from the sea for nearshore nourishment and construction uses are the main ones. Physical interferences for mining of sand cause an ecologic threat to the coastal environment. However, use of marine sand is inevitable because of economic reasons or unobtainable land-based sand resources. The most convenient solution in such a protection-usage dilemma is to reduce negative impacts of sand production from marine. This depends on the accurate determination of criteriaon production place, style, and amount of sand. With this motivation, nearshore geodedic surveying studies performed on Kilyos Campus of Bogazici University located on the Black Sea coast, north of Istanbul, Turkey between 2001-2002. The study area extends 1 km in the longshore. Geodetic survey was carried out in the summer of 2001 to detect the initial condition for the shoreline. Long-term seasonal changes in shoreline positions were determined biannually. The coast was measured with post-processed kinematic GPS. Besides, shoreline change has studied using Landsat imagery between the years 1986-2015. The data set of Landsat 5 imageries were dated 05.08.1986 and 31.08.2007 and Landsat 7 imageries were dated 21.07.2001 and 28.07.2015. Landcover types in the study area were analyzed on the basis of pixel based classification method. Firstly, unsupervised classification based on ISODATA (Iterative Self Organizing Data Analysis Technique) has been applied and spectral clusters have been determined that gives prior knowledge about the study area. In the second step, supervised classification was carried out by using the three different approaches which are minimum-distance, parallelepiped and maximum-likelihood. All pixel based classification processes were performed with ENVI 4.8 image processing software. Results of geodetic studies and classification outputs will be presented in this paper.																	2194-9034						2016	41	B8					1169	1174		10.5194/isprsarchives-XLI-B8-1169-2016								WOS:000393156000198

Remote Sensing and GIS analysis for demarcation of coastal hazard line along the highly eroding Krishna-Godavari delta front	EARTH RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMOTE SENSING/GIS APPLICATIONS VII	Proceedings of SPIE				SPIE Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications VII	SEP 27-29, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE				Coastal regions, especially river deltas are highly resourceful and hence densely populated; but these extremely low-lying lands are vulnerable to rising sea levels due to global warming threatening the life and property in these regions. Recent IPCC (2013) predictions of 26-82cm global sea level rise are now considered conservative as subsequent investigations such as by Met Office, UK indicated a vertical rise of about 190cm, which would displace 10% of the world's population living within 10 meters above the sea level. Therefore, predictive models showing the hazard line are necessary for efficient coastal zone management. Remote sensing and GIS technologies form the mainstay of such predictive models on coastal retreat and inundation to future sea-level rise. This study is an attempt to estimate the varying trends along the Krishna Godavari (K-G) delta region. Detailed maps showing various coastal landforms in the K-G delta region were prepared using the IRS-P6 LISS 3 images. The rate of shoreline shift during a 31-year period along different sectors of the 330km long K-G delta coast was estimated using Landsat-2 and IRS-P6 LISS 3 images between 1977 and 2008. With reference to a selected baseline from along an inland position, End Point Rate (EPR), Shoreline Change Envelope (SCE) and Net Shoreline Movement (NSM) were calculated, using a GIS based Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). The results showed that the shoreline migrated landward up to a maximum distance of 3.13km resulting in a net loss of about 42.10km(2) area during this 31-year period. Further, considering the nature of landforms and EPR, the future hazard line is predicted for the area, which also indicated a net erosion of about 57.68km(2) along the K-G delta coast by 2050 AD.

However, this can become a cumbersome and expensive task to undertake for large populations of buildings, scattered in large urban areas. To optimize the use of available resources, appropriate tools are required for the assessment of corrosion risk of reinforced concrete construction. This paper proposes a framework for the production of digital corrosion risk maps for urban areas; Cyprus was used as a case study. This framework explored multi-temporal satellite remote sensing data from the Landsat sensors as well as corrosion risk factors derived from the results of a recently completed research project, entitled "STEELCOR". This framework was used to develop two corrosion risk scenarios within Geographical Information Systems, and to produce corrosion risk maps for three coastal cities of Cyprus. The thematic maps indicated that, for slight corrosion damage, the distance of reinforced concrete buildings from the coast was more influential than the building age. While, for significant corrosion damage, the maps indicated that the age of RC buildings was more influential than the distance from the coast.

Especially in such an emerging and dynamic branch of science as archaeology. Warsaw Institute of Archaeology, conducts many archaeological expeditions, among the others Polish-Georgian archaeological expedition in Gonio, where ancient Roman Bath has been discovered and excavated. Gonio is located in Adjara, Georgia, placed on the Black Sea coast. Fortress of Gonio is an ancient Roman fortification, the oldest reference to the fortress is dated for a 1st century AD. After decomposition of Roman Empire, the fortress came under a Byzantine influence. In XVI century Fort was occupied by Ottoman Empire until XIX century, where has been taken by Russian Empire. After decomposition of Soviet Union, and restoring Georgian independence, Gonio is located in the well developing area and experiencing a tourist boom. Whereas very intense archaeological works are held in this area. Archaeological workflow demands significant labour effort and might be augmented and accelerated by the proper use of geodesy techniques. Reduction of work effort saves not only labour costs but also another important factor, time. This paper focused on a review of geodesy techniques which may have an application in archaeology, with especially insight on the use of remote sensing methods.

The island is prone to tidal effects and cyclonic activities. The complex geomorphological and hydrological study along with remote sensing techniques are applied for understanding the recent morphological changes arising out of rapid growth of small islands just downstream of southern tip of Nayachara Island generally known as Nayachara tail. The present study has analyzed the change in area in and around the Nayachara tail through erosional, depositional and tidal activities during the last four decades using multitemporal satellite images. Some basic hydro-geomorphological parameters like velocity and direction of flow, suspended sediment concentration, salinity and average grain size distribution of the bed material have truly enriched the study. Besides, a comparative bed profile study with super-imposition of contour lines of cross sections also have a significant role to predict the shifting trend of the tail. Since 1973 the extent of Nayachara tail has gradually been increased. A total of 12.118 sq km land area of Nayachara tail has been obtained as newly developed or appeared on the sea surface during the entire time period of 43 years.																	2005-4289						2016	7						13	26		10.14257/ijdrbc.2016.7.02								WOS:000393555400002

SPATIAL-TEMPORAL DETECTION OF CHANGES ON THE SOUTHERN COAST OF THE BALTIC SEA BASED ON MULTITEMPORAL AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS	XXIII ISPRS Congress, Commission II	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				Digital photogrammetry and remote sensing solutions applied under the project and combined with the geographical information system made it possible to utilize data originating from various sources and dating back to different periods. Research works made use of archival and up-to-date aerial images, satellite images, orthophotomaps. Multitemporal data served for mapping and monitoring intermediate conditions of the Baltic Sea shore zone without a need for a direct interference in the environment. The main objective of research was to determine the dynamics and volume of sea shore changes along the selected part of coast in the period of 1951-2004, and to assess the tendencies of shore development in that area. For each of the six annual data sets, the following were determined: front dune base line, water line and the beach width. The location of the dune base line, which reflects the course of the shoreline in a given year was reconstructed based on stereoscopic study of images from each annual set. Unidirectional changes in the period of 1951-2004 occurred only within 10% of the examined shore section length. The examined shore is marked by a high and considerable dynamics of changes. Almost half of the shore, in particular the middle coast shows big changes, in excess of 2 m/year. The limits of shoreline changes ranged from 120 to -90 m, and their velocity from 0 to 11 m/year, save that the middle and west parts of the examined coast section were subjected to definitely more intense shore transformations. Research based on the analysis of multitemporal aerial images made it possible to reconstruct the intermediate conditions of the Baltic Sea shoreline and determine the volume and rate of changes in the location of dune base line in the examined period of 53 years, and to find out tendencies of shore development and dynamics.

Fisheries sector employs 38 million people, especially marine fisheries who are sensitive to the natural hazards like cyclone or rough sea conditions. 370 million Indians residing over 8118 kms of coastline are exposed to 10% of the world's tropical cyclones. During 1891 to 2000, 308 cyclones hit the Indian West coast, leading to loss of lives and livelihood and damaging the public infrastructure; resetting the development pace, repeatedly. Technological advancements like Remote Sensing, Data Analytics and weather models have improved the accuracy of prediction of the natural hazards. Communication technologies such as mobile phones are spreading too and have become affordable. Hence, such revolution in Information generation and Communication technology has increased the hope of identifying the hazards in advance, their impact region (exposure) and the people / property vulnerability towards it. mKRISHI (R) Fisheries used the Wind and Wave information generated by INCOIS and using the service design concept, simplified the delivery of information to local language on mobile phones. Such communication helped fishers, their family and other stakeholders to identify the risk zones, their occurrence date and time and accordingly responded to it or re-planned their journey. This data driven planning is helping the fishers reduce the risk exposure and hence saving the lives of many fishers. We also experimented with the extension of mobile signal in the deep sea, to create a digital information highway upto 30km from the coast. This paper captures the experience, methodology followed, learning and set of recommendations, which can help develop a strategy for Early Warning System (EWS) to improve safety at sea and coastal regions.																	2158-3404		978-1-5090-2498-8				2016							106	111										WOS:000391412400018

However, concomitant with the accelerated development of nuclear power stations, the environmental effects of thermal discharge will become a problem that cannot be avoided. Real-time monitoring of water temperature needs to be installed following station construction in order to measure its variation with time and to ensure that the operation of the nuclear plant does not result in adverse environmental damage. Landsat is the world's oldest, continuously acquired collection of space-based, moderate-resolution, land remote sensing data. On May 30, 2013, data from the Landsat 8 satellite became available, and the data quality and radiometric quantization of the thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) are significantly greater than those of previous Landsat instruments. The analysis of sea surface temperature (SST) obtained from Landsat 8's TIRS data was used to enhance information about the plume shape, dimensions, and direction of dispersion of the thermal discharge from the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant in Hangzhou Bay on the East China Sea coast. Both single-channel and split-window algorithms were used and focused. The detection of temperature increases through split-window algorithms is considered a preferable method for warm-discharge monitoring. Recent results showed that the thermal discharge from the nuclear plant was controlled over a small area, and that it never breached national water quality standards.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0402-5; 978-1-5106-0403-2				2016	9999								UNSP 99991E	10.1117/12.2242253								WOS:000391353700037

Safer Ship Navigation demands high resolution satellite monitoring of the ice conditions which varies from 30 km to 200 km from the Antarctic coast of Research stations. During the last couple of years Indian Satellites play a major role in safer ship navigation in sea ice regions of the Arctic and the Antarctic. Specifically Indian Scientific Expedition to the Antarctica (ISEA) through National Centre for Antarctic and Oceanic Research (NCAOR) is one of the beneficiaries for safer ship navigation using information derived from Indian Satellite data. Space Applications Centre, Indian Space Research Organisation (SAC-ISRO) is providing Sea Ice Advisories for the safer optimum entry and exit for the expedition ship at two of the Research stations Bharati and Maitri. Two of the Indian Satellites namely Radar Imaging Satellite-1 (RISAT-1) and ResourceSAT-2 (RS-2) are the two major workhorses of ISRO for monitoring and mapping of the Antarctic terrain. The present study demonstrate the utilisation potential of these satellite images for various Polar Science Applications. Mosaic of the Antarctic Terrain was generated from RISAT-1 CRS data. The preliminary results of the mosaic from CRS-circular polarisation data is presented.

The ocean colour remote sensing has played a significant role in monitoring the turbidity level in marine and inland water bodies. However, algorithms to accurately estimate the turbidity in such optically complex waters are scarce or limited by high level of uncertainty due to various issues. The present study proposes a simple, two band algorithm to estimate turbidity in both turbid and clear waters. It was found that the band ratio of remote sensing reflectance (R-rs(670)/R-rs(670)+R-rs(555)) represents the proxy of TSS (Total suspended sediment) and therefore, positively correlates to turbidity. The new algorithm is based on the assumption that light reflected in these two vital bands contains the essential information regarding the total suspended matter in the water column. The statistical results showed that the percent mean relative error between the predicted turbidity and the measured turbidity was within +/- 20%. To further demonstrate the robustness of the present algorithm, the spatial grid contours for the measured and the predicted turbidity was generated for the month of January 2014, August 2013 and May 2012 for the coastal waters in Bay of Bengal (Point Calimere, located in the southeast coast of India). The close consistency between the predicted and measured turbidity spatial patterns revealed that the present algorithm can be applied with high confidence to predict turbidity in both coastal and inland waters.

After recalibrating and validating the form with the highest correlation coefficient between reflectance and TSS concentration and other TSS retrieval models that have been successful applied in many places, we found that the quadratic model of the ratio of logarithmic transformation of red band and near infrared band and logarithmic transformation of TSS concentration (QRLTSS) shows the highest performance. QRLTSS model based on Landsat OLI, ETM+ and TM can explained about 71% of the TSS concentration variation (4.3 similar to 577.2 mg/L) in the five regions and has a high and acceptable validation accuracy with root mean square error (RMSE) of 21.5-25mg/L and mean relative error (MRE) of 27.2-32.2%. We concluded that QRLTSS model can be used to quantify the TSS concentration of multiple estuaries and coasts of south China which would be helpful to understand the temporal and spatial variation of TSS in a large region. QRLTSS model should be applied to Landsat imagery for further validation in the future. The approach proposed in the paper also could promote the research work of establishing regional and uniform TSS retrieval model forward.																	2380-8039		978-1-5090-1479-8				2016																		WOS:000389576700032

Review and combination of recent remote sensing based products for forest cover change assessments in Cameroon	INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW												Two recent remote sensing derived products providing assessment of forest cover change in the Congo Basin for the last two decades were compared and combined to obtain estimates of forest cover change in Cameroon for the period 1990-2012. The intensity of deforestation in the whole region decreased from the 1990s to the 2000s. Forest loss is observed everywhere in Cameroon but present higher intensity nearby the Atlantic coast. The analysis of the spatial distribution of the forest loss in Cameroon reveals that an important part of the loss is happening outside the permanent and the non-permanent forest domain. The Landsat spatial resolution used in the two products allows us to capture change caused by agro-industrial exploitation as well as shifting cultivation, infrastructure and selective logging when the area affected is large enough. But it fails to monitor forest degradation and small scale deforestation events.																	1465-5489	2053-7778					2016	18			1	SI		14	25		10.1505/146554816819683807								WOS:000388553900003

In an attempt to compensate BRDF effects in multi-angular hyperspectral images, the Semi-Supervised Manifold Alignment (SSMA) algorithm pulls data from similar classes together and pushes data from different classes apart. SSMA uses Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE) to preserve the original geometric structure of each local data set independently. In this paper, we replace LE with Spatial-Spectral Schoedinger Eigenmaps (SSSE) which was designed to be a semisupervised enhancement to the to extend the SSMA methodology and improve classification of multi-angular hyperspectral images captured over Hog Island in the Virginia Coast Reserve.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0081-2				2016	9840								98401K	10.1117/12.2224068								WOS:000383611600042

The Search and Rescue Optimal Planning System (SAROPS) became operational with the USCG in 2007 and is the main tool for developing search and rescue mission plans. This tool utilizes environmental data (wind, ocean currents, etc.) to estimate the drift of an object in the ocean and also calculate a probability of detection for the object based upon the various search sensors. The environmental data used by the Coast Guard is a combination of model output, in situ and remote sensing measurements. Recent work by the Coast Guard Office of Search and Rescue has shown that the various environmental data sources available in SAROPS have shown skill but none on a consistent basis. In the Mid Atlantic Bight we compared the predicted drift of several surface drifters that were advected with High Frequency radar measurements and regional and global ocean model surface currents. The results shown here indicate that an ensemble of surface current estimates is useful when trying to predict the path of an object drifting on the surface of the ocean.																	0197-7385		978-1-4673-9724-7				2016																		WOS:000386521800200

In this study, supervised classification and post-classification change detection techniques were applied to Landsat images acquired in 1987 and 2015 to map LULC changes along the north part of the Nile delta coastal zone specifically, at Damietta promontory. Landsat images were radio-metrically and geometrically corrected, and then, multi-temporal post-classification analysis was performed to detect LULC changes rates of the Nile delta coast around Damietta promontory where the Damietta branch (of the Nile River) meets the Mediterranean Sea. Four categories including seawater, developed (agriculture and urban), and undeveloped areas were selected to evaluate their temporal changes by comparing the processed images. The objective of this study is to map and assess the rate of changes LULC changes at the study area which can help the decision makers to replan the use of natural resources efficiently. By applying remote sensing/GIS technique, areas of rapid change are identified and targeted for more detailed monitoring in the field. Changes among different LULC classes were assessed. The results show that the sew water and urban area were increased. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

These needs are met through imports from aboard. The raw materials for alginate, namely brown seaweed (Phaeophyceae) are very abundant in Indonesian coastal zones, but its stock level is not yet known. This study aims: to explore the biomass of brown seaweeds along the coastal areas of Bitung-Bentena, North Sulawesi Province by mapping their habitat, distribution and density using the effective and efficient tool of satellite remote sensing; and to compile preliminary results on the quality of alginate extracted from brown seaweeds. Result show that based on the isocluster analysis of Landsat-7 ETM+ and field sampling, we successfully classified 6 different habitats in the reef flats of Bitung-Bentena with map which had accuracy of 73.6%. The total area of brown seaweeds was approximately 127.1 ha. Meanwhile, from 53 field transects, there were 6 species of brown seaweed with an average density for all species of 690.4 grams/m2. Thus, the biomass of brown seaweed was 2,133.5 tons wet weight, equal to 29.9 tons of alginate. This study proves that satellite remote sensing is an effective and efficient tool for such kind of works, and must be continued along the entire of Indonesian coastal zones. In this study, the preliminary results on extracting alginate from brown seaweed are also presented. (C) 2016 The Authors.

MODIS-Aqua Data based Detection and Classification of Algal Blooms along the Coast of India using RLS Classifier	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS	Procedia Computer Science				6th International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communications (ICACC)	SEP 06-08, 2016	Rajagiri Sch Engn & Technol, Kochi, INDIA		Rajagiri Sch Engn & Technol			In the field of marine biology, researches reveal that there exists a constant increase in Algal bloom (AB) count, along the coast of India. This work aims at detecting and classifying six most frequently appearing algal blooms in this region (viz.: Trichodesmium erythraeum, Noctiluca scintillans/miliaris, Cocholodinium ploykrikoides, Chattonella marina and Karenia mikimotoi blooms). The uniqueness of ocean's optical properties such as remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) and normalized water leaving radiance (nL(w)) during bloom period serve as the underlying features on whose grounds classification is performed. These parameters are acquired from Aqua/MODIS sensor measurements and Regularized least squares classifier is used in GURLS library for classification. An overall classification accuracy of 94.37% is obtained using both R-rs and nL(w) features, which is superior to the previously conducted studies for monitoring ABs using optical properties of water. Given a MODIS image, a map is developed wherein the pixels with ABs are highlighted and the causative species is recognized. A MODIS image is available every two days and hence frequent generation of AB moitoring maps is possible, which is of great significance in the fisheries industry. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Over land, the AATSR dual-view (ADV) algorithm utilizes the measured top of the atmosphere (TOA) reflectance in both the nadir and forward views to decouple the contributions of the atmosphere and the surface to retrieve aerosol properties. Over ocean, the AATSR single-view (ASV) algorithm minimizes the discrepancy between the measured and modelled TOA reflectances in one of the views to retrieve the aerosol information using an ocean reflectance model. Necessary steps to process global, multi-year aerosol information are presented. These include cloud screening, the averaging of measured reflectance, and post-processing. Limitations of the algorithms are also discussed. The main product of the aerosol retrieval is the aerosol optical depth (AOD) at visible/near-infrared wavelengths. The retrieved AOD is validated using data from the surface-based AERONET and maritime aerosol network (MAN) sun photometer networks as references. The validation shows good agreement with the reference (r = 0.85, RMSE = 0.09 over land; r = 0.83, RMSE = 0.09 at coasts and r = 0.96, RMSE = 0.06 over open ocean). The results of the aerosol retrievals are presented for the full AATSR mission years 2002-2012 with seasonally averaged time series for selected regions.

The study includes a detailed analysis of all cities with over 100,000 inhabitants, from 1945 to the present. Coastal cities have been differentiated from the inland cities. To do this, two sources of information were used: analysis of databases United Nations and Google Earth remote sensing. When these two sources are related, allowing a fairly accurate study of the coastal urban world stage. The vision of this research is dynamic because it pays close attention to the changing nature of urbanization phenomenon in the world's coastlines. The result is of great importance for the Integrated Coastal Zone Management. The increasing number of cities and population in the coastal zone exerts enormous pressure on coastal and marine ecosystems. It is possible that the new scenario that is observed on the coasts of the world also requires new management approaches.																	0212-8594	2340-2776					2016	33	1					64	83		10.12795/rea.2016.i33.04								WOS:000382985300004

Strong and extreme desert dust (DD) episodes are identified at 1 degrees x 1 degrees spatial resolution, over the period March 2000-February 2013, through the implementation of an updated objective and dynamic algorithm. According to the algorithm, strong DD episodes occurring at a specific place correspond to cases in which the daily aerosol optical depth at 550 nm (AOD(550 nm)) exceeds or equals the long-term mean AOD(550 nm) (Mean) plus two standard deviations (SD), which is also smaller than Mean+4xSD. Extreme DD episodes correspond to cases in which the daily AOD(550 nm) value equals or exceeds Mean+4xSD. For the identification of DD episodes, additional optical properties (Angstrom exponent, fine fraction, effective radius and aerosol index) derived by the MODIS-Terra & Aqua (also AOD retrievals), OMI-Aura and EPTOMS databases are used as inputs. According to the algorithm using MODIS-Terra data, over the period March 2000-February 2013, strong DD episodes occur more frequently (up to 9.9 episodes year(-1)) over the western Mediterranean, while the corresponding frequencies for the extreme ones are smaller (up to 3.3 episodes year(-1), central Mediterranean Sea). In contrast to their frequency, dust episodes are more intense (AODs up to 4.1), over the central and eastern Mediterranean Sea, off the northern African coasts. Slightly lower frequencies and higher intensities are found when the satellite algorithm operates based on MODIS-Aqua retrievals, for the period 2003-2012. The consistency of the algorithm is successfully tested through the application of an alternative methodology for the determination of DD episodes, which produced similar features of the episodes' frequency and intensity, with just slightly higher frequencies and lower intensities. The performance of the satellite algorithm is assessed against surface-based daily data from 109 sun-photometric (AERONET) and 22 PM10 stations. The agreement between AERONET and MODIS AOD is satisfactory (R = 0.505 0.750) and improves considerably when MODIS level 3 retrievals with higher sub-grid spatial representativeness and homogeneity are considered. Through the comparison against PM10 concentrations, it is found that the presence of dust is justified in all ground stations with success scores ranging from 68 to 97 %. However, poor agreement is evident between satellite and ground PM10 observations in the western parts of the Mediterranean, which is attributed to the desert dust outbreaks' vertical extension and the high altitude of dust presence. The CALIOP vertical profiles of pure and polluted dust observations and the associated total backscatter coefficient at 532 nm (beta(532 nm)), indicate that dust particles are mainly detected between 0.5 and 6 km, though they can reach 8 km between the parallels 32 and 38 degrees N in warm seasons. An increased number of CALIOP dust records at higher altitudes is observed with increased latitude, northwards to 40 degrees N, revealing an ascending mode of the dust transport. However, the overall intensity of DD episodes is maximum (up to 0.006 km(-1) sr(-1)) below 2 km and at the southern parts of the study region (30-34 degrees N). Additionally, the average thickness of dust layers gradually decreases from 4 to 2 km, moving from south to north. In spring, dust layers of moderate-to-high beta(532) nm values (similar to 0.004 km(-1) sr(-1) /are detected over the Mediterranean (35-42 degrees N), extending from 2 to 4 km. Over the western Mediterranean, dust layers are observed between 2 and 6 km, while their base height is decreased down to 0.5 km for increasing longitudes underlying the role of topography and thermal convection. The vertical profiles of CALIOP beta(532) nm confirm the multilayered structure of the Mediterranean desert dust outbreaks on both annual and seasonal bases, with several dust layers of variable geometrical characteristics and intensities. A detailed analysis of the vertical structure of specific DD episodes using CALIOP profiles reveals that the consideration of the dust vertical structure is necessary when attempting comparisons between columnar MODIS AOD retrievals and ground PM10 concentrations.

J	Tudor, M; Janekovic, I				Tudor, Martina; Janekovic, Ivica			Modelling origin and transport fate of waste materials on the southeastern Adriatic coast (Croatia)	GEOFIZIKA												In this study we analysed meteorological and oceanographic conditions that lead to the waste deposition along the southeast Croatian coast during the second half of November 2010. We used available in situ measurements, atmospheric products (reanalysis, remote sensing) as well as atmosphere and ocean numerical models. The measured meteorological data reveal that an intensive rainfall event occurred from 7 till 10 November 2010, over the parts of Montenegro and Albania. It was followed by a substantial increase of the river water levels indicating a possibility of flash floods, capable of splashing the waste material into a river and after to the Adriatic Sea (or to the sea directly). The currents that could bring this waste to Croatian coast are likely intensified by the strong wind from southeast direction. In order to test these two hypotheses we set a number of numerical drifter experiments with trajectories initiated over southeast Adriatic during the intensive rainfall events following their path in space and time. The numerical drifter trajectory experiments that resulted with drifters reaching the right position (southeastern Adriatic coast) at exact time the waste was observed were initiated on 00: 00 and 12: 00 UTC of 10 November 2010 during the mentioned high precipitation event.																	0352-3659	1846-6346					2016	33	1					53	77		10.15233/gfz.2016.33.3								WOS:000381162400004

Parametric and non-parametric statistical analyses were applied on spectral data in four spectral modes: (i) reflectance (ii) continuum removed, (iii) additive inverse and (iv) continuum removed additive inverse. We introduced continuum removal of inverse spectra to utilize the advantage of continuum removal in reflectance region. Non-parametric test gave better separability than parametric test. Principal component analysis and stepwise discriminant analysis were applied for feature reduction and to identify optimal wavelengths for species discrimination. To quantify the separability, Jeffries-Matusita distance measure was derived. Green (550 nm), red edge (680-720 nm) and water absorption region (1470 and 1850 nm) were found to be optimal wavelengths for species discrimination. The continuum removal of additive inverse spectra gave better separability than the continuum removed spectra.																	1010-6049	1752-0762					2016	31	8					891	912		10.1080/10106049.2015.1094521								WOS:000381011900007

The impact of Hurricane Katrina on urban growth in Louisiana: an analysis using data mining and simulation approaches	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE												Understanding human dynamics after a major disaster is important to the region's sustainable development. This study utilized land cover data to examine how Hurricane Katrina has affected the urban growth pattern in the Mississippi Delta in Louisiana. The study analyzed land cover changes from non-urban to urban in three metropolitan areas, Baton Rouge, New Orleans-Metairie, and Hammond, for two time periods, pre-Katrina (2001-2006) and post-Katrina (2006-2010). The study first applied a focal filter to extract continuous urban areas from the scattered urban pixels in the original remote sensing images. Statistical analyses were applied to develop initial functions between urban growth probability and several driving factors. A genetic algorithm was then used to calibrate the transition function, and cellular automata simulation based on the transition function was conducted to evaluate future urban growth patterns with and without the impact of Hurricane Katrina. The results show that elevation has become a much more important factor after Hurricane Katrina, and urban growth has shifted to higher elevation regions. The elevation most probable for new urban growth increased from 10.84 to 11.90 meters. Moreover, simulated future urban growth in this region indicates a decentralized trend, with more growth occurring in more distant regions with higher elevation. In the New Orleans metropolitan area, urban growth will continue to spill across Lake Pontchartrain to the satellite towns that are more than 50 minutes away by driving from the city center.																	1365-8816	1362-3087					2016	30	9			SI		1832	1852		10.1080/13658816.2016.1144886								WOS:000378064300008

Algorithm Model for the Determination of Cimandiri Estuarine Boundary using Remote Sensing	INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON CURRENT PROGRESS IN MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCES 2015 (ISCPMS 2015)	AIP Conference Proceedings				1st International Symposium on Current Progress in Mathematics and Sciences (ISCPMS)	NOV 03-04, 2015	Univ Indonesia, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Depok, INDONESIA	Univ Indonesia, Directorate Res & Community Engagement	Univ Indonesia, Fac Math & Nat Sci			Estuarine zone is a typical ecosystem, because this areacontinuously receives organic materials from the river and sufficient light illuminating the water. It has also salinity level from mesohaline to eurihaline. The zone must be protected from waste discharge (liquid or solid) coming from domestic and industrial activities along the riverside. The determination of estuarine boundary still cannot be confirmed until now due to the transformation of existing water dynamics changes over time according to the season changes. One of technologies in the determination of estuarine boundary is using remote sensing technology. The advantage of this technology is on its temporal and spatial resolution. Some research have been done in tropical water of Northern Java Coast and Makassar Strait, however none has been done in tropical high seas such as in Cimandiri Estuary. The algorithm model resulted from this research is different with existing algorithm. Estuarine boundary will be made based on salinity level. This model can also be used for different area and used by stakeholder and local government in order to protect estuary in sustainable way.																	0094-243X		978-0-7354-1376-4				2016	1729								020079	10.1063/1.4946982								WOS:000377625400079

This Iron Age and Roman harbour city was completely abandoned in the early Middle Ages, when people moved to nearby lagoon islands, and so the site is particularly fit for the application of non-invasive techniques. Primary aims of the research were to test the interpretation of archaeological structures in the city centre, estimate their degree of preservation in the subsoil, and update previous knowledge on the urban landscape. Target areas were identified first through remote sensing with later magnetic gradiometer mapping of the consular road (via Annia) and its adjoining streets, foundations of large buildings, theatres, temple and forum, a main canal with possible boatyard/storing place and workshops. Multi-electrode automatic resistivity profile produced a very detailed survey of the little theatre (odeon) and basilica. The ground-penetrating radar traced the city walls, while frequency-domain electromagnetics mapped the street pattern. Buried archaeological structures were located with an estimated error <0.5 m. Floors and foundations of Roman buildings and infrastructures appear to be preserved between 0.5 and 2 m depth. They probably relate to a reorganization of the city, which occurred between the second half of the second century and the end of the first century BC, having via Annia and the forum as the main city axis, and incorporating few elements of the Iron Age settlement, such as the canal and city boundary. Eight city districts could be recognized, each one showing prevalent public, residential and other productive functions. In the ancient past the monumental buildings of the city were potentially visible from ships in the Adriatic Sea, and could act as nautical signals of the entrance to the lagoon along this low and otherwise monotonous coast.

Vulnerability of Kuwait coast to sea level rise	GEOGRAFISK TIDSSKRIFT-DANISH JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY												Assessing coastal vulnerability to sea level rise (SLR) at local and regional scales is a fundamental step for designing successful long-term coastal management plans. This study was thus designed to assess Kuwait coastal vulnerability to SLR at four scenarios (.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 m). Potential inundated areas and the number of people at risk were estimated based on these SLR scenarios. A coastal vulnerability index (CVI) map of Kuwait was then computed based on the lowest scenario using eight parameters: elevation, coastal slope, geomorphology, distance to 20-m isobath, population, land use, cultural heritage and transportation. The geographic distribution of inundated areas at an SLR of .5 m revealed that the northern islands of Kuwait and coastal areas along Kuwait Bay would be highly impacted, whereas the coastal area near Shuaibah Port was the most influenced among the southern coasts. Most of the coastal area exhibited a moderate vulnerability to SLR, especially the northern islands. This study presented an initial vulnerability assessment for Kuwait coasts to SLR, which can be extended with more variables. The integrated remote sensing and geographic information system methodology demonstrated in this study can be applied in similar studies elsewhere.																	0016-7223	1903-2471					2016	116	1					56	70		10.1080/00167223.2015.1121403								WOS:000375579600007

Srinivasa			Validation of MERIS sensor's CoastColour algorithm for waters off the west coast of India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) retrieved using the MERIS CoastColour (CC) algorithm was evaluated for the coastal waters of the west coast of India, against in situ observations made as part of the Satellite Coastal and Oceanographic Research (SATCORE) programme. These observations include profiles of surface solar irradiance (Es) along with those of upwelling radiance and downwelling irradiance, measured using hyperspectral radiometry. Chl-a was also estimated from water samples. Furthermore, remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs) and chl-a were retrieved from MODIS-Aqua using the OC3M algorithm, and from MERIS using the OC4E algorithm. In addition, to understand the long-term seasonal variability, chl-a retrieved from the MERIS-CC algorithm was overlaid on monthly mean chl-a time series data from MODIS. Comparison of chl-a using MERIS-CC to that measured in situ showed wide scatter around the linear trend line. We observed that chl-a from MERIS-CC was underestimated for two-thirds of the observations, whereas with MODIS and MERIS it was 51% and 44%, respectively. Statistical analysis showed an improved performance in chl-a retrieval using the operational OC4E algorithm as compared to that of MERIS-CC. The time series analysis showed a good match between in situ chl-a and that derived from MODIS using the OC3M algorithm, whereas the MERIS-CC algorithm showed inconsistency in match-up with regard to both magnitude and trend. This inconsistency was more prominent during the low-chl-a scenario during the northern winter. We infer that algorithms such as OC4E and OC3M that use bands from the blue and green regions of the spectrum offer better chlorophyll retrieval in high-TSM or -CDOM concentration waters in comparison with CoastColour, which uses all bands across the spectrum.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2016	37	9			SI		2066	2076		10.1080/01431161.2015.1129564								WOS:000375461300007

Forcing and variability of nonstationary rip currents	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Surface wave transformation and the resulting nearshore circulation along a section of coast with strong alongshore bathymetric gradients outside the surf zone are modeled for a consecutive 4 week time period. The modeled hydrodynamics are compared to in situ measurements of waves and currents collected during the Nearshore Canyon Experiment and indicate that for the entire range of observed conditions, the model performance is similar to other studies along this stretch of coast. Strong alongshore wave height gradients generate rip currents that are observed by remote sensing data and predicted qualitatively well by the numerical model. Previous studies at this site have used idealized scenarios to link the rip current locations to undulations in the offshore bathymetry but do not explain the dichotomy between permanent offshore bathymetric features and intermittent rip current development. Model results from the month-long simulation are used to track the formation and location of rip currents using hourly statistics, and results show that the direction of the incoming wave energy strongly controls whether rip currents form. In particular, most of the offshore wave spectra were bimodal and we find that the ratio of energy contained in each mode dictates rip current development, and the alongshore rip current position is controlled by the incident wave period. Additionally, model simulations performed with and without updating the nearshore morphology yield no significant change in the accuracy of the predicted surf zone hydrodyanmics indicating that the large-scale offshore features (e.g., submarine canyon) predominately control the nearshore wave-circulation system.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				JAN	2016	121	1					520	539		10.1002/2015JC010990								WOS:000371432200030

Vulnerability assessment of the Saudi Arabian Red Sea coast to climate change	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Climate changes in terms of sea level rise and global warming impose different ramifications upon the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia, which extends to 1840 km and witnesses accelerated urban development. The shoreline is mostly resistant to erosion and inundation by seawater due to the inherent hard nature and the relatively higher relief. Digital elevation models reveal that only about 890 km(2) of the coast occurs below 1 m. Global warming has a more conceivable impact upon the coast as numerous coral reef ecosystems exist, and the harm is inevitable. The coastal vulnerability index indicates that about 16 % of the coast is under high vulnerability, whereas 44 % of the coast is intimately low vulnerable to climate change. Higher vulnerable coastal segments include: relatively flat and lowlands; inhabited; and/or coral-mangrove-rich shorelines. Coastal zone management and rescue plans are essential to protect coastal resources for a long-term sustainable development.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2016	75	1							30	10.1007/s12665-015-4835-3								WOS:000370239800030

Different surfaces, as flat sandy areas of contrasted water contents, coastal vegetation (salt marshes), sea surfaces, urban zones, have been investigated to define a general model. Different reflection models have been investigated, like Lommel-Seeliger, Ward, Oren-Nayar, and Hapke laws but either they do not allow to fit specular reflection, or they had too many parameters. The Torrance-Sparrow formulation is the only model that describes the intensity behavior of each representative surface, especially the specular signature of the water surface. This law integrates both diffuse and specular components, the latter being described by a microfacet distribution. Finally, to separate and identify the surfaces, we have established a decomposition method, based on a single microfacet distribution, to characterize, unambiguously, different surfaces.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				JAN	2016	9	1					313	325		10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2510337								WOS:000370541400033

Estimation of TSM plays a vital role in monitoring, evaluating, and protecting water quality. Many empirical and semianalytical models have been established for clear open ocean waters or extremely turbid coasts/lakes. However, few are generally applicable to inland, optically complex, deep waters. Using data sets of observed in situ data for the slightly turbid water of the Xin'anjiang Reservoir, we developed a semianalytical algorithm to estimate the TSM concentration for slightly turbid waters (TSM < 25 mg L-1; TSM/Chla < 2.2 x 10(3)) [chlorophyll a (Chla)] using [R-rs(542)(-1) -R-rs(600)(-1)] x R-rs (668), (R-rs: remote sensing reflectance), with a coefficient of determination (R-2) > 0.9 and a normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) < 12%. The semianalytical model was then applied to 14 Landsat 8 OLI images from December 2013 to April 2015, with R-2 = 0.85 and NRMSE = 23%, indicating the feasibility of the semianalytical model for estimating TSM. The TSM concentration estimated from Landsat 8 OLI data in the Xin'anjiang Reservoir exhibited a significant spatial and seasonal difference. The spatial heterogeneity, significantly higher in incoming rivers than the main body of the reservoir, was due to watershed inputs and anthropogenic dredging activity. The temporal heterogeneity of TSM, significantly higher in summer and autumn than in winter and spring, was mainly caused by the seasonal rainfall and seasonal growth of phytoplankton. Our study showed that the semianalytical model for Landsat 8 OLI images could be used to quantitatively monitor TSM in slightly turbid, inland waters.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				JAN	2016	9	1					398	413		10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2509469								WOS:000370541400040

On the feasibility of the use of wind SAR to downscale waves on shallow water	OCEAN SCIENCE												In recent years, wave reanalyses have become popular as a powerful source of information for wave climate research and engineering applications. These wave reanalyses provide continuous time series of offshore wave parameters; nevertheless, in coastal areas or shallow water, waves are poorly described because spatial resolution is not detailed. By means of wave downscaling, it is possible to increase spatial resolution in high temporal coverage simulations, using forcing from wind and offshore wave databases. Meanwhile, the reanalysis wave databases are enough to describe the wave climate at the limit of simulations; wind reanalyses at an adequate spatial resolution to describe the wind structure near the coast are not frequently available. Remote sensing synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has the ability to detect sea surface signatures and estimate wind fields at high resolution (up to 300 m) and high frequency. In this work a wave downscaling is done on the northern Adriatic Sea, using a hybrid methodology and global wave and wind reanalysis as forcing. The wave fields produced were compared to wave fields produced with SAR winds that represent the two dominant wind regimes in the area: the bora (ENE direction) and sirocco (SE direction). Results show a good correlation between the waves forced with reanalysis wind and SAR wind. In addition, a validation of reanalysis is shown. This research demonstrates how Earth observation products, such as SAR wind fields, can be successfully up-taken into oceanographic modeling, producing similar down-scaled wave fields when compared to waves forced with reanalysis wind.

This study focuses on Umm Nigga, Northeast of Kuwait, which was damaged by various human activities. The northern portion of Umm Nigga falls within the boundaries of the demilitarized zone (DMZ) adjacent to Iraq, and was fenced off to restrict public access since 1994. The central objective of this project was to use remote sensing, field assessment, and Geographical Information System (GIS) spatial data to develop a site history for restoration planning of Umm Nigga. Field observation and GIS analysis indicated that the landscape could be divided into three units along a gradient ranging from the coast to inland locations, based on geology, soil properties, and dominant vegetation. Reference sites in the DMZ were also matched for each unit. Remote sensing was used to compare vegetation cover between damaged and reference sites at selected units. Results showed that vegetation cover increased in the unfenced damaged site after the 1991 Gulf War from 2% in 1988 to 37% in 1998, but then it decreased to 23% in 2013. In the DMZ reference site, the vegetation cover also increased from 0% in 1988 to 40% in 1998, but it continued increasing through 2013 to 64%. We conclude that overgrazing and destructive camping are the major source of disturbance in the damaged areas.

This problem is necessary to be overcome. According to the statistical evaluations method and the different characteristics of polarization between the objects radiance and atmospheric path radiation, a new atmospheric correction method for airborne remote sensing images was proposed. Using this new method on the airborne remote sensing images which acquired on the north coast areas of China during the haze weather, we achieved a high quality corrected atmosphere-free image. The results demonstrate the power of the method on the harbor area. The results show that the algorithm, improving image contrast and image information entropy, can effectively identify the targets after atmospheric correction.

A decade (2003-12) of landfalling ARs impacting the North American west coast (between 32.5 degrees and 52.5 degrees N) is collected to assess the skill of five commonly used satellite-based precipitation products [T3B42, T3B42 real-time (T3B42RT), CPC morphing technique (CMORPH), PERSIANN, and PERSIANN-Cloud Classification System (CCS)] in capturing ARs' precipitation rate and pattern. AR detection was carried out using a database containing twice-daily satellite-based integrated water vapor composite observations. It was found that satellite products are more consistent over ocean than land and often significantly underestimate precipitation rate over land compared to ground observations. Incorrect detection of precipitation from IR-based methods is prevalent over snow and ice surfaces where microwave estimates often show underestimation or missing data. Bias adjustment using ground observation is found very effective to improve satellite products, but it also raises concern regarding near-real-time applicability of satellite products for ARs. The analysis using individual case studies (6-8 January and 13-14 October 2009) and an ensemble of AR events suggests that further advancement in capturing orographic precipitation and precipitation over cold and frozen surfaces is needed to more reliably quantify AR precipitation from space.

Allen			Atmospheric Rivers and Rainfall during NASA's Iowa Flood Studies (IFloodS) Campaign	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												Atmospheric rivers (ARs) play a major role in causing extreme precipitation and flooding over the central United States (e.g., Midwest floods of 1993 and 2008). The goal of this study is to characterize rainfall associated with ARs over this region during the Iowa Flood Studies (IFloodS) campaign that took place in April-June 2013. Total precipitation during IFloodS was among the five largest accumulations recorded since the mid-twentieth century over most of this region, with three of the heavy rainfall events associated with ARs. As a preliminary step, the authors evaluate how well different remote sensing-based precipitation products captured the rainfall associated with the ARs and find that stage IV is the product that shows the closest agreement to the reference data. Two of the three ARs during IFloodS occurred within extratropical cyclones, with the moist ascent associated with the presence of cold fronts. In the third AR, mesoscale convective systems resulted in intense rainfall at many locations. In all the three cases, the continued supply of warm water vapor from the tropics and subtropics helped sustain the convective systems. Most of the rainfall during these ARs was concentrated within similar to 100 km of the AR major axis, and this is the region where the rainfall amounts were highly positively correlated with the vapor transport intensity. Rainfall associated with ARs tends to be larger as these events mature over time. Although no major diurnal variation is detected in the AR occurrences, rainfall amounts during nocturnal ARs were higher than for ARs that occurred during the daytime.

Quantifying the impacts of ENSO and IOD on rain gauge and remotely sensed precipitation products over Australia	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Large-scale ocean-atmospheric phenomena like the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) have significant influence on Australia's precipitation variability. In this study, multi-linear regression (MLR) and complex empirical orthogonal function (CEOF) analyses were applied to isolate (i) the continental precipitation variations likely associated with ENSO and IOD, here referred to as 'ENSO/IOD mode', and (ii) the variability not associated with ENSO/IOD (the 'non-ENSO/IOD mode'). The first is of interest due to its dominant influence on inter-annual variability, while the second may reveal lower frequency variability or trends. Precipitation products used for this study included gridded rainfall estimates derived by interpolation of rain gauge data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), two satellite remote sensing products (CHIRP and TRMM TMPA version 7), and two weather forecast model re-analysis products (ERA-Interim and MERRA). The products covered the period 1981-2014 except TMPA (1998-2014). Statistical and frequency-based inter-comparisons were performed to evaluate the seasonal and long-term skills of various rainfall products against the BoM product. The results indicate that linear trends in rainfall during 1981-2014 were largely attributable to ENSO and IOD. Both intra-annual and seasonal rainfall changes associated with ENSO and IOD increased from 1991 to 2014. Among the continent's 13 major river basins, the greatest precipitation variations associated with ENSO/IOD were found over the Northern and North East Coast, while the smallest contributions were for Tasmania and the South West Coast basins. We also found that although the assessed products show comparable spatial variability of rainfall over Australia, systematic seasonal differences exist that were more pronounced during the ENSO and IOD events.

Although it is known that a large portion of the released oil from this second largest accidental marine oil spill in history reached the surface, to date there has been no attempt to document the surface footprint and trajectory of the released oil. Our study attempts to fill this knowledge gap using remote sensing data collected by Landsat/MSS and CZCS. Both showed the same general patterns of oil trajectory to the northwest and north, nearly parallel to the coastline of the western Gulf of Mexico (GoM) with possible oil landing on Mexican and Texas beaches. Field observations at selected beaches and islands along the coast of the western and southern GoM during and after the spill confirmed these satellite-based findings, which were also used to help in planning a recent field campaign to collect sediment samples in the southern GoM.

Infestation and outbreak of the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae; HWA) along the eastern coast of the USA, has led to widespread loss of hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr.), and a shift in tree species composition toward hardwood stands. Developing an understanding of the geographic distribution of individual species can inform conservation practices that seek to maintain functional capabilities of ecosystems. Modeling is necessary for understanding changes in forest composition, and subsequent changes in biodiversity, and one that can be implemented at the species level. By integrating the use of remote sensing, modeling, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) coupled with expert knowledge in forest ecology and disturbance, we can advance the methodologies currently available in the literature on predictive modeling. This paper describes an approach to modeling the spatial distribution of the less common but foundational tree species eastern hemlock throughout the state of Maine (similar to 84,000 km(2)) at a high resolution. There are currently no published accuracy assessments on predictive models for high resolution continuous distribution of eastern hemlock relative basal area that span the geographic extent covered by our model, which is at the northern limit of the species' range. A two stage mapping approach was used where presence/absence was predicted with an overall accuracy of 85% and the continuous distribution (percent basal area) was predicted with an accuracy of 84%. Overall, these findings are quite good despite high variability in the training dataset and the general minor component that eastern hemlock represents in the primary forest types in Maine. Eastern hemlock occurs along the southern half of the state stretching the east-west span with little to no occurrence in the northern regions. Several environmental and site characteristics, particularly average yearly maximum and minimum temperatures, were found to be positively correlated with hemlock occurrence. Eastern hemlock dominated stands appeared predominantly in the southwest corner of the state where HWA monitoring efforts can be focused. Given the importance of climate variables in predicting eastern hemlock, forecasts of future range shifts should be possible using data generated from climate scenarios. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Habitat and Vegetation Variables Are Not Enough When Predicting Tick Populations in the Southeastern United States	PLOS ONE												Two tick-borne diseases with expanding case and vector distributions are ehrlichiosis (transmitted by Amblyomma americanum) and rickettiosis (transmitted by A. maculatum and Dermacentor variabilis). There is a critical need to identify the specific habitats where each of these species is likely to be encountered to classify and pinpoint risk areas. Consequently, an in-depth tick prevalence study was conducted on the dominant ticks in the southeast. Vegetation, soil, and remote sensing data were used to test the hypothesis that habitat and vegetation variables can predict tick abundances. No variables were significant predictors of A. americanum adult and nymph tick abundance, and no clustering was evident because this species was found throughout the study area. For A. maculatum adult tick abundance was predicted by NDVI and by the interaction between habitat type and plant diversity; two significant population clusters were identified in a heterogeneous area suitable for quail habitat. For D. variabilis no environmental variables were significant predictors of adult abundance; however, D. variabilis collections clustered in three significant areas best described as agriculture areas with defined edges. This study identified few landscape and vegetation variables associated with tick presence. While some variables were significantly associated with tick populations, the amount of explained variation was not useful for predicting reliably where ticks occur; consequently, additional research that includes multiple sampling seasons and locations throughout the southeast are warranted. This low amount of explained variation may also be due to the use of hosts for dispersal, and potentially to other abiotic and biotic variables. Host species play a large role in the establishment, maintenance, and dispersal of a tick species, as well as the maintenance of disease cycles, dispersal to new areas, and identification of risk areas.

J	Guneroglu, A				Guneroglu, Abdulaziz			Coastal changes and land use alteration on Northeastern part of Turkey	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT					3rd International Symposium on Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM)	OCT 14-18, 2014	Marmara Res Ctr, Antalya, TURKEY		Marmara Res Ctr			Coasts, not only today but throughout history, have been valuable, important and attractive areas for mankind. Unfortunately, the link between coasts and user has not been stayed in balance due to growing pressure from increasingly diverse human activities. Anthropogenic pressure on coastal areas is rising because of the fact that people are tend to settle by the coast for some reasons such as better transportation, nutrition and commerce. Many conflicts were observed during the establishment of mega cities on coastal zones. Unfortunately, sustainability is generally neglected through the solution process of the coastal problems. Even though, it is a relatively late step, the recent initiatives have a potential to decrease the anthropogenic pressure on coastal zones in Turkey. To achieve the best management strategy, there should be a well established connection between science and policy. Therefore novel technologies should be used for better monitoring and mapping the coastal zones. Coastline mapping is one of the fundamental steps of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) planning. In this study, coastal zone of the Trabzon city which comprises approximately 110 km length including central district and 9 coastal counties was investigated in terms of decadal coastline changes and associated land use/cover (LULC) types. Automatic extraction of the coastline was achieved by applying proposed methodology on multispectral Landsat TM/ETM images. To obtain the LULC classes, Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was implemented and four classes, water, vegetation, impervious surface and bare soil were identified. Finally all graphical data was transferred and analyzed within GIS environment. The coastline changes were evaluated by using a GIS tool of Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). DSAS results revealed that, the net coastline change was reached up to 88.2 m in central region of Trabzon. It was found that during the time span (1984-2011) coastal agricultural lands were intentionally converted to impervious surfaces. The ratio analyses of the study area showed that impervious surface area was doubled for the last 27 years. The coastal zone of the region can be characterized with "accretion" type zone. The geomorphologic character, linear-littoral development of the city and recently completed North Anatolian highway might be dominant effects in shaping the coastal zone character. In conclusion, decadal change analyses prove that the coastal zone of the city is under severe anthropogenic effects as it can be observed in some other coasts of Turkey. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Pang, YB; Fuentes, M; Rieger, P				Pang, Yanbo; Fuentes, Mark; Rieger, Paul			Trends in selected ambient volatile organic compound (VOC) concentrations and a comparison to mobile source emission trends in California's South Coast Air Basin	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Trends in ambient concentrations of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) in the South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) are compared to trends in VOC emissions from Light-Duty Gasoline Vehicles (LDGV) tested on chassis dynamometers and to trends observed in tunnel studies during the same period to understand the impacts of gasoline vehicle emissions on ambient VOC concentrations from 1999 to 2009. Annual median concentrations for most ambient VOCs decreased 40% from 1999 to 2009 in the SoCAB, based on data from the Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS). Annual concentration decreases of most compounds, except 2,2,4-trimethylpentane, are highly correlated with the decrease of acetylene, a marker for tailpipe emissions from LDGV. This indicates that ambient VOC concentration decreases were likely due to tailpipe emission reductions from gasoline vehicles. Air Toxics Monitoring Network data also support this conclusion. Benzene concentration-normalized ratios for most compounds except ethane, propane, isoprene, and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane were stable even as these compound concentrations decreased significantly from 1999 to 2009. Such stability suggests that the main sources of ambient VOC were still the same from 1999 to 2009. The comparison of trends in dynamometer testing and tunnel studies also shows that tailpipe emissions remained the dominant source of tunnel LDGV emissions. The pronounced changes in 2,2,4-trimethylpentane ratios due to the introduction of Phase 3 gasoline also confirm the substantial impact of LDGV emissions on ambient VOCs. Diurnal ambient VOC data also suggest that LDGV tailpipe emissions remained the dominant source of ambient VOCs in the SoCAB in 2009. Our conclusion, which is that current inventory models underestimate VOC emissions from mobile sources, is consistent with that of several recent studies of ambient trends in the SoCAB. Our study showed that tailpipe emissions remained a bigger contributor to ambient VOCs than evaporative emissions from LDGV's. This finding is also different from EMFAC estimates.

J	Layden, A; Merchant, C; MacCallum, S				Layden, Aisling; Merchant, Christopher; MacCallum, Stuart			Global climatology of surface water temperatures of large lakes by remote sensing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Lake surface water temperatures (LSWTs) of 246 globally distributed large lakes were derived from Along-Track Scanning Radiometers (ATSR) for the period 1991-2011. The climatological cycles of mean LSWT derived from these data quantify on a global scale the responses of large lakes' surface temperatures to the annual cycle of forcing by solar radiation and the ambient meteorological conditions. LSWT cycles reflect the twice annual peak in net solar radiation for lakes between 1 degrees S to 12 degrees N. For lakes without a lake-mean seasonal ice cover, LSWT extremes exceed air temperatures by 0.5-1.7 degrees C for maximum and 0.7-1.9 degrees C for minimum temperature. The summer maximum LSWTs of lakes from 25 degrees S to 35 degrees N show a linear decrease with increasing altitude; -3.76+/-0.17 degrees Ckm(-1) (R-adj(2) = 0.95), marginally lower than the corresponding air temperature decrease with altitude -4.15+/-0.24 degrees Ckm(-1) (R-adj(2) = 0.95). Lake altitude of tropical lakes account for 0.78-0.83 (R-adj(2)) of the variation in the March to June LSWT-air temperature differences, with differences decreasing by 1.9 degrees C as the altitude increases from 500 to 1800m above sea level (a.s.l.) We define an 'open water phase' as the length of time the lake-mean LSWT remains above 4 degrees C. There is a strong global correlation between the start and end of the lake-mean open water phase and the spring and fall 0 degrees C air temperature transition days, (R-adj(2) = 0.74 and 0.80, respectively), allowing for a good estimation of timing and length of the open water phase of lakes without LSWT observations. Lake depth, lake altitude and distance from coast further explain some of the inter-lake variation in the start and end of the open water phase.

J	Yang, YP; Zhang, MJ; Li, YT; Zhang, W				Yang Yun-ping; Zhang Ming-jin; Li Yi-tian; Zhang Wei			The variations of suspended sediment concentration in Yangtze River Estuary	JOURNAL OF HYDRODYNAMICS												With the Yangtze River Estuary as an example, this paper analyzes the influence of human activity on the sea water content, the sediment content and the regional transport situation. In both flood seasons and dry seasons, as well as in the whole year, the sediment discharge rate and the suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in the estuary area of the Yangtze River show decreasing trends. In the estuary area, the amount of sediment transported into the South and North Branches and the offshore area is also in a decreasing trend over the years. The SSCs at the sections at the entrances of the South Branch, the South Channel, the North Channel and the South Passage in the Yangtze River Estuary show decreasing trends during 1959-2011. The remote-sensing data reveal that for the same runoff and tidal current combination, the SSC in the surface water is decreased, caused by the dramatic decrease in the sediment discharge and the sediment content from the watershed. Although the SSC in the offshore area does not exhibit an apparent decreasing trend, the SSC in the nearshore area drops by 21.42% during the period of 2003-2011 as compared with that during the period of 1985-2002 before the impounding of the Three Gorges Reservoir. The sediment re-suspension in the estuary slows down the reduction of the SSC. The period of 2003-2011 is dry years for the Yangtze River, when the flow is relatively low. The peak value of the SSC in the coast area shifts inwards for about 1/6 degrees of longitude. Due to the deepwater channel improvement project in the North Passage at the Yangtze River Estuary in 1998, the SSC in the waterway area is decreased. With the decrease of the divided flow ratio and the sediment splitting ratio in the entrance and the exit of the North Passage, the SSC in the upper and lower reaches of the North Passage during the period of 2008-2011 is decreased by about 14.25% as compared with that during the period of 2000-2007. Primarily due to the jetty at the south side, the SSC in the middle reach shows an increasing trend.																	1001-6058	1878-0342				DEC	2015	27	6					845	856		10.1016/S1001-6058(15)60547-9								WOS:000367637500004

We present a microwave satellite-based approach for mapping fractional surface water (FW) globally at 25-km resolution. The approach employs a land cover-supported, atmospherically-corrected dynamic mixture model applied to 20+ years (1992-2013) of combined, daily, passive/active microwave remote sensing data. The resulting product, known as Surface WAter Microwave Product Series (SWAMPS), shows strong microwave sensitivity to sub-grid scale open water and inundated wetlands comprising open plant canopies. SWAMPS' FW compares favorably (R-2 = 91%-94%) with higher-resolution, global-scale maps of open water from MODIS and SRTM-MOD44W. Correspondence of SWAMPS with open water and wetland products from satellite SAR in Alaska and the Amazon deteriorates when exposed wetlands or inundated forests captured by the SAR products were added to the open water fraction reflecting SWAMPS' inability to detect water underneath the soil surface or beneath closed forest canopies. Except for a brief period of drying during the first 4 years of observation, the inundation extent for the global domain excluding the coast was largely stable. Regionally, inundation in North America is advancing while inundation is on the retreat in Tropical Africa and North Eurasia. SWAMPS provides a consistent and long-term global record of daily FW dynamics, with documented accuracies suitable for hydrologic assessment and global change-related investigations.																	2072-4292					DEC	2015	7	12					16688	16732		10.3390/rs71215843								WOS:000367534000046

If yes, it would promote stirring and mixing of coastal waters and surf-shelf exchanges. Another question is whether tridimensional transient processes are important for instability generation. An innovative modeling system with tridimensional wave-current interactions was designed to investigate transient nearshore currents and interactions between nearshore and innershelf circulations. We present here some validation of rip current modeling for the Aquitanian coast of France, using in-situ and remote video sensing. We then proceed to show the benefits of 3D versus 2D (depth-mean flow) modeling of rip currents and their low-frequency variability. It appears that a large part of VLF motions is due to intrinsic variability of the tridimensional flow. 3D models may thus provide a valuable, only marginally more expensive alternative to conventional 2D approaches that miss the vertical flow structure and its nonlinear interaction with the depth-averaged flow.

Land evaluation suitability for settlement based on soil permeability, topography and geology ten years after tsunami in Banda Aceh, Indonesia	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES												Years after the tragedy of the tsunami in Banda Aceh researchers are still saddled with the problem of water permeability, slope and geology suitability for settlements. Social and ecological vulnerability to disasters and outcomes of Oceanic earthquakes causing tsunamis remain an indelible phobia to potential residents at the western coast of Sumatra upto the northern part of Indonesia. Ten years after the disaster, this study evaluates the topography of the area to determine the level of suitability of the area for human habitat. This article examines the concept of land suitability evaluation and its potential as a tool of determining appropriateness of a settlement. The focus of the study centered on the application of geographic information systems GIS in handling spatial data permeability, slope and geology of the land in accordance with the FAO land suitability standard. To ensure that the application works, it requires geospatial analysis compiled based on the permeability, slope and geology that can be observed and measured for the residential requirements. Results showed that almost all the cities within Banda Aceh are suitable for residency (Ordos). (C) 2015 Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, Sandy generated record low-pressure, a large wind field with corresponding storm surge and copious amounts of precipitation in some areas, including record snowfall in mountainous regions. Sandy presented several forecast challenges to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Weather Service (NWS). Satellites played an integral role in the analysis and forecast of Sandy's track and intensity. The NOAA National Hurricane Center, Ocean Prediction Center, and Weather Prediction Center all relied on information from satellites to make critical warning decisions using various satellite products that assist with diagnosing tropical cyclone intensity, surface winds over the ocean, and heavy precipitation. All of the skillful global forecast models used satellite data for initiation to better forecast the track and intensity of Sandy. As part of the Geostationaty Operational Environmental Satellite R-series (GOES-R) and Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) Proving Ground activities, new satellite products were available to forecasters at these national centers in experimental form to assist with observing this unique, high impact event. This paper will demonstrate how the current satellite products assisted NOAA forecasters during Sandy and introduce some new satellite products that could be used to analyze and predict future high impact weather systems.

Series satellite remote sensing images obtained from 1990 to 2010 were employed to monitor sea areas reclamation and coastline change in coastal zone of Liaoning. Some spatial index was established to describe sea areas reclamation and coastline change by geographical information system, respectively. The results are as follow: Spatial index based on geographical information system are suitable to assess spatial pattern of sea areas reclamation and coastline change. The sea areas reclamation in coastal zone of Liaoning is 35,720.98 hm(2) from 1990 to 2010. The sea areas reclamation intension is high in Panjin and Jinzhou with reclamation intension index above 90.0 hm(2)/km, but low in Huludao, Yingkou and Dalian with reclamation intension index below 20.0 hm(2)/km. Length of coastline in Liaoning increased and its tortuosity ascend over last 20 years. The increment is 30% in some regions as Jinzhou and Panjin. Exploitation of coastline cause the growth of the length of artificial coastline (dams, bulwark, e.g.), while natural coast line (rock coastline, sandy coastline and muddy coastline) is compressed.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				WIN	2015					73		725	729		10.2112/SI73-124.1								WOS:000351538400125

While remote sensing and open water sampling already described the physical nature of this upwelling, the spatial and temporal effects on key parameters and processes in the water column have not been investigated yet, although being highly relevant for coral reef functioning. The present study investigated a range of water parameters on two coral reefs with different exposure to upwelling (Matapalo and Bajo Rojo) in a weekly to monthly resolution over one year (May 2013 to April 2014). Based on air temperature, wind speed and water temperature, three time clusters were defined: a) May to November 2013 without upwelling, b) December 2013 to April 2014 with moderate upwelling, punctuated by c) extreme upwelling events in February, March and April 2014. During upwelling peaks, water temperatures decreased by 7 degrees C (Matapalo) and 9 degrees C (Bajo Rojo) to minima of 20.1 and 15.3 degrees C respectively, while phosphate, ammonia and nitrate concentrations increased 3 to 15-fold to maxima of 1.3 mu mol PO43- L-1, 3.0 mu mol NH4+ L-1 and 9.7 mu mol NO3- L-1. This increased availability of nutrients triggered several successive phytoplankton blooms as indicated by 3-(Matapalo) and 6-fold (Bajo Rojo) increases in chlorophyll a concentrations. Particulate organic carbon and nitrogen (POC and PON) increased by 40 and 70% respectively from February to April 2014. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) increased by 70% in December and stayed elevated for at least 4 months, indicating high organic matter release by primary producers. Such strong cascading effects of upwelling on organic matter dynamics on coral reefs have not been reported previously, although likely impacting many reefs in comparable upwelling systems.																	1932-6203					NOV 11	2015	10	11							e0142681	10.1371/journal.pone.0142681								WOS:000364433100112	26560464

In the southeast, BA consists of a 500 km(2) tidal flat, the most important wintering site for shorebirds using the East Atlantic Flyway. The Mauritanian upwelling-driven phytoplankton production supports the most productive fisheries worldwide, but little is known about its trophic role in the functioning of the inshore BA food web. Using stable isotopes as trophic tracers to distinguish between upwelling-driven phytoplankton, open ocean phytoplankton, and benthic primary producers, we assessed the spatial extent to which the inshore BA food web is fuelled by upwelling-driven phytoplankton production. The delta C-13 and delta N-15 signals were characterized in dominant primary producers, benthic invertebrate taxa, and various fish species along an offshore inshore (northwest southeast) gradient. We also monitored the spatial and temporal extent of upwelling entering BA during 2008 with remote sensing of sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a data. The results suggest that benthic invertebrates and fishes living in the northwestern part of BA depend on the nearby upwelling phytoplankton production, but this food source does not support the intertidal benthic community in southeast BA. Furthermore, the isotopic signatures of fishes suggest weak trophic connectivity between the northern subtidal and southeastern intertidal BA. Our results support the hypothesis that the southeastern tidal flat region functions as a distinct ecosystem with a food web supported mainly by local benthic primary production, which is crucial knowledge for effective management of the pristine BA national park.

Oceanic and climatic drivers of mangrove changes in the Gulf of Uraba, Colombian Caribbean	LATIN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC RESEARCH												The Gulf of Uraba is the largest estuary on the Caribbean coast of Colombia. The aim of this research was to analyse the oceanic, climatic and environmental variables that influence mangrove structure and composition in the gulf. Based on the availability of remote sensing, the study area was divided into western and eastern zones. The spatial pattern of environmental variables (water salinity, pH and percentage of organic matter, sand, silt and clay in the soils) and oceanic and climatic variables (winds, wave height and wave period) was analysed. The relationship of these variables with variables of vegetation structure (basal area, diameter at breast height, tree height, and abundance of seedlings of mangrove species in 1 m(2) subplots) was analysed in 27 plots of 500 m(2) containing fringe mangroves and 5 plots containing basin mangroves. Mangroves of the western zone showed a higher structural development and were dominated by Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove). This zone is supplied by fresh water and sediments, and the soils have a high content of organic matter and clay and a low degree of anthropogenic disturbance. The eastern zone was characterized by higher pore water salinity due to lower freshwater input from rivers. In this area there is a smaller impact of waves and winds, higher sedimentation rates, high anthropogenic disturbance and mangroves are dominated by Avicennia germinans (black mangrove). Although Laguncularia racemosa (white mangrove) did not show a particular spatial pattern, due to its tolerance to open canopy conditions it was commonly found in anthropogenically disturbed areas.

The LST along the Dhanushkodi coast is studied based on data collected simultaneously in Gulf of Mannar (GoM) and Palk Bay (PB) using directional waverider buoys. The numerical model REF/DIF1 was used to calculate the nearshore waves and the LST rate was estimated using three different formulae. The model validation was done based on the measured nearshore waves using InterOcean S4DW. Numerical model LITPACK was also used for simulating non-cohesive sediment transport and the LITLINE module was used to study the shoreline evolution over 5 years. Low net annual LST along PB (similar to 0.01x10(6) m(3)) compared to the GoM region (0.3 x 10(6) m(3)) were due to the weak waves. Accretion in the region led to growth of the Dhanushkodi sandspit by 65 m during the period 2010-2015.					pr, shanas/0000-0002-7586-0641												2092-6782	2092-6790				NOV	2015	7	6					939	950		10.1515/ijnaoe-2015-0065								WOS:000365555100001

Classification of rocky headlands in California with relevance to littoral cell boundary delineation	MARINE GEOLOGY												Despite extensive studies of hydrodynamics and sediment flux along beaches, there is little information on the processes, pathways and timing of water and sediment transport around rocky headlands. In this study, headlands along the California coast are classified to advance understanding of headland dynamics and littoral cell boundaries in support of improved coastal management decisions. Geomorphological parameters for 78 headlands were quantified from geological maps, remote-sensing imagery, navigational charts, and shoreline geospatial databases. K-means cluster analysis grouped the headlands into eight distinct classes based on headland perimeter, bathymetric slope ratio, and the headland apex angle. Wave data were used to investigate the potential for sediment transport around the headland types and determine the efficacy of the headland as a littoral cell boundary. Four classes of headland appear to function well as littoral cell boundaries, with headland size (e.g., perimeter or area) and a marked change in nearshore bathymetry across the headland being relevant attributes. About half of the traditional California littoral cell boundaries align with headland classes that are expected to perform poorly in blocking alongshore sediment transport, calling into question these boundaries. Better definition of these littoral cell boundaries is important for regional sediment management decisions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Case study: El Daba'a area, Northwestern Coast of Egypt	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												In the light of the current situation of water resources in Egypt, where it has a deficit in those resources, the rainwater harvesting and assessment of its potentialities became necessary. In the present study, an attempt is made to define a decision based on scientific approach for identifying the most appropriate sites for rainwater harvesting. This approach is based on GIS data layers which include DEM, landforms, geologic setting, watershed area, rainfall amounts, drainage lines, morphometric parameters, flow accumulation, flow direction, slope, and surface runoff. It also includes a verification of the site suitability through field investigations. El Daba'a area has been chosen because it has a lack of water for agriculture and drinking purposes. In addition, this area has special interest because of a planned nuclear power plant there. The obtained results reveal that the study area contains eight basins which have slightly intensive drainage network. The morphometric analyses of the studied basins reveal their opportunities for surface runoff. Three of them are showing high hazard degrees. These basins have actual runoff (Q) ranges between 16.5 and 25 mm annually resulted from average rainfall of 164 mm. Therefore, management of rainwater harvesting and protections from flash floods were recommended. Many rainwater harvesting structures, for example concert dams, alternative earth dikes, surface water reservoirs, and cisterns, should be established.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				NOV	2015	8	11					9169	9191		10.1007/s12517-015-1837-0								WOS:000363719600016

Assessment of South Sinai Coastal Vulnerability to Climate Change	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Coastal vulnerability assessment is important to help achieve the sustainable use of coastal resources and to incorporate coastal hazards into coastal planning and decision making for integrated management. This study applied the coastal vulnerability index (CVI) to delineate susceptibility of the South Sinai coastline to climate change. The following variables pertaining to inherent shoreline characteristics were used in the assessment of the CVI: coastal slope, coastal geomorphology, fauna/flora, and socioeconomic factors. GIS and remote sensing analysis were employed to extract intrinsic attributes of the coast in this study area. Results showed that about one half of the 635-km-long coastline is exposed to high and very high coastal vulnerability to climate change, and global warming could exacerbate biologic suffering in the region. The Gulf of Suez is likely to be more vulnerable than the Gulf of Aqaba. Most areas susceptible to climate change include gentle, unconsolidated, coral assemblages and inhabited coastal segments. Coastal zone managers should implement remediation plans for any anticipated ecosystem disruption episodes.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				NOV	2015	31	6					1469	1477		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-14-00018.1								WOS:000364260600016

Liquid water cloud properties during the Polarimeter Definition Experiment (PODEX)	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												We present retrievals of water cloud properties from the measurements made by the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) during the Polarimeter Definition Experiment (PODEX) held between January 14 and February 6, 2013. The RSP was onboard the high-altitude NASA ER-2 aircraft based at NASA Dryden Aircraft Operation Facility in Palmdale, California. The retrieved cloud characteristics include cloud optical thickness, effective radius and variance of cloud droplet size distribution derived using a parameter-fitting technique, as well as the complete droplet size distribution function obtained by means of Rainbow Fourier Transform. Multi-modal size distributions are decomposed into several modes and the respective effective radii and variances are computed. The methodology used to produce the retrieval dataset is illustrated on the examples of a marine stratocumulus deck off California coast and stratus/fog over California's Central Valley. In the latter case the observed bimodal droplet size distributions were attributed to two-layer cloud structure. All retrieval data are available online from NASA GISS website. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Decadal shoreline assessment using remote sensing along the central Odisha coast, India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												One of the major requirements of planning coastal protection works is to understand the processes of erosion, deposition, sediment transport, flooding and sea level changes which continuously alter the shoreline. Significant erosion can affect the stability and productivity of aquatic environment which may have severe implications for coastal inhabitants. The middle coastal plains of Odisha State on the east coast of India were investigated for morphological assessment of shoreline. Accurate demarcations of shorelines were carried out at parts of Odisha coast specifically along Gahirmatha, Paradip and coast above Devi River to quantify erosion and accretion at annual to decadal scale for the years 1990, 2000 and 2012. Satellite-derived remote sensing data (Landsat and IRS P6) were used in the study. Digital shoreline analysis system discovered the eroded and accreted parts of the study area. Gahirmatha and coast above Devi River experienced heavy erosion during 2000-2012 compared with 1990-2000, whereas Paradip coast has comparatively undergone accretion during 2000-2012. Some accreted spots are identified nearby river mouths, which are attributed to heavy accretion of eroded materials by the action of sediment transport. The detailed analysis reveals a maximum erosion of 124, 33 and 154 m in a decade at Gahirmatha, Paradip and coast above Devi River, respectively. Southern parts of Gahirmatha coast showed highly dynamic behavior near Hukitola Bay and Barrier Island and are acting as a natural breakwater to conserve the shoreline. This region had undergone severe geomorphologic changes due to natural as well as human interventions and poses a threat. This coast exhibits unique reasons for erosion with various degrees of combinations of sediment depletion, human activities, high frequency of cyclones and floods, sea level rise, etc. This study concludes that the shoreline of Odisha coast is under heavy erosion and needs scientific and management attention.

LocationThe pristine 300-km-long coast of French Guiana, South America. MethodsWe produced time series of mangrove maps using archival remote sensing images. We retrieved significant wave heights (H-S), mean wave periods (T-M) and mean wave directions ((M)) from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis products. We used complex empirical orthogonal function (CEOF) decomposition to extract the main mode of mangrove surface area (M-S) variability and singular value decomposition (SVD) to test the relationships between M-S and H-S,T-M and (M). ResultsThe leading mode of variability extracted from the CEOF decomposition of M-S captured approximately 78% of the total auto-covariance and revealed multi-decadal fluctuations in M-S that were on the order of 10,000ha. The SVD results indicated that the multi-decadal fluctuation in M-S cross-covaried with H-S,T-M and (M) over the North Atlantic sector, particularly in the region immediately off the French Guiana coast that is remotely forced by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) during the winter season. Main conclusionsWe provide evidence based on linear statistics that variations in the extent of mangroves are driven by large-scale, low-frequency changes in North Atlantic waves that are related to the NAO. Such a relationship is hypothesized to operate through wave pounding, which alters the mud substrates on which mangroves thrive and which varies with the phase of the NAO. In addition to long-term trends due to anthropogenic climate change, our results stress the importance of studying low-frequency modes of climate variability to understand changes in the extent of mangroves.

In the present study, multisource remote sensing data for 1979-2012 were analyzed to quantify seasonal, interannual, and spatial changes in sea ice conditions along the NEP. Data for October-November showed that spatially averaged ice thickness in the NEP decreased from 1.2-1.3 m in 2003-2006 to 0.2-0.6 m in 2011-2012. From 1979 to 2012, the fastest decreasing trend in monthly ice concentration occurred in October (-1.76% per year, P < 0.001), when the ice cover starts to increase. As a result of decreasing multiyear sea ice, thinning ice and delayed freeze-up, the spatially averaged length of open period (ice concentration < 50%) increased from 84 days in the 1980s to 114 days in the 2000s and reached 146 days in 2012. The Kara, Laptev, and East Siberian sectors were relatively inaccessible, especially the sector of 90-110 degrees E around the Vilkitsky Strait. However, because of the thinning sea ice prior to the melt season and the enhanced positive polarity of the summer Arctic Dipole Anomaly, these sectors have become more accessible in recent years. The summer sea ice along the high-latitude sea route (HSR) north of the eastern Arctic islands, with a route distance comparable to the NEP, has also decreased during the last decade with the ice-free period reaching 42 days in 2012. The HSR avoids shallow waters along the coast, improving access to the Arctic sea route for deeper-draft vessels. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Amongst nearshore ecosystems, seagrass beds play a major role enhancing biodiversity and water quality. Consequently, the development of new approaches to create extensive and high-resolution habitat maps is required not only to implement conservation, restoration and management plans, but also to establish adaptation plans to face climate change impacts. This study particularly assesses the capability of hyperspectral airborne imagery acquired with Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) to discriminate and map estuarine habitats, with special focus on Zostera noltii seagrass meadows. To this end, 13 habitats were defined along the supralittoral, intertidal and subtidal zones of an estuary, including Z noltii seagrass meadows. The CASI sensor was configured to acquire 25 bands in the visible and near infrared wavelengths with a ground sampling distance of 2 m. Spectral bands were selected for species discrimination based on the spectral signature of the different habitat classes. Six different band combinations were tested applying maximum likelihood classification algorithm. The most accurate classification was obtained with 10 band combination (a mean producer accuracy 92% and a mean user accuracy 94%). The classification of Z noltii beds has been found to be restricted to moderate and high dense meadows, however a vegetation index has been defined which could be applied for mapping Z noltii meadow cover. These results highlight the value of CASI data to discriminate and map estuarine habitats, providing key information to be used in supporting the implementation of environmental legislation, protection and conservation of coastal habitats.

Landslide scar/soil erodibility mapping using Landsat TM/ETM+ bands 7 and 3 Normalised Difference Index: A case study of central region of Kenya	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Landsat series multispectral remote sensing imagery has gained increasing attention in providing solutions to environmental problems such as land degradation which exacerbate soil erosion and landslide disasters in the case of rainfall events. Multispectral data has facilitated the mapping of soils, land-cover and structural geology, all of which are factors affecting landslide occurrence. The main aim of this research was to develop a methodology to visualize and map past landslides as well as identify land degradation effects through soil erosion and land-use using remote sensing techniques in the central region of Kenya. The study area has rugged terrain and rainfall has been the main source of landslide trigger. The methodology comprised visualizing landslide scars using a False Colour Composite (FCC) and mapping soil erodibility using FCC components applying expert based classification. The components of the FCC were: the first independent component (IC1), Principal Component (PC) with most geological information, and a Normalised Difference Index (NDI) involving Landsat TM/ETM+ band 7 and 3. The FCC components formed the inputs for knowledge-based classification with the following 13 classes: runoff, extreme erosions, other erosions, landslide areas, highly erodible, stable, exposed volcanic rocks, agriculture, green forest, new forest regrowth areas, clear, turbid and salty water. Validation of the mapped landslide areas with field GPS locations of landslide affected areas showed that 66% of the points coincided well with landslide areas mapped in the year 2000. The classification maps showed landslide areas on the steep ridge faces, other erosions in agricultural areas, highly erodible zones being already weathered rocks, while runoff were mainly fluvial deposits. Thus, landuse and rainfall processes play a major role in inducing landslides in the study area. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In Europe, there is a policy to expand the maritime economic sector without damaging the environment by ensuring that these activities comply with legally binding Directives, such as the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). However, monitoring an extensive maritime area is a logistical and economic challenge. Remote sensing is considered one of the most cost effective, methods for providing the spatial and temporal environmental data that will be necessary for the effective implementation of the MSFD. However, there is still a concern about the uncertainties associated with remote sensed products. This study has tested how a specific satellite product can contribute to the monitoring of a MSFD Descriptor for "good environmental status" (GES). The results show that the quality of the remote sensing product Algal Pigment Index 1 (API 1) from the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) sensor of the European Space Agency for ocean colour products can be effectively validated with in situ data from three stations off the SW Iberian Peninsula. The validation results show good agreement between the MERIS API 1 and the in situ data for the two more offshore stations, with a higher coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.79, and with lower uncertainties for the average relative percentage difference (RPD) of 24.6% and 27.9% and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.40 and 0.38 for Stations B and C, respectively. Near to the coast, Station A has the lowest R-2 of 0.63 and the highest uncertainties with an RPD of 112.9% and a RMSE of 1.00. It is also the station most affected by adjacency effects from the land: when the Improved Contrast between Ocean and Land processor (ICOL) is applied the R-2 increases to 0.77 and there is a 30% reduction in the uncertainties estimated by RPD. The MERIS API 1 product decreases from inshore to offshore, with higher values occurring mainly between early spring and the end of the summer, and with lower values during winter. By using the satellite images for API 1, it is possible to detect and track the development of algal blooms in coastal and marine waters, demonstrating the usefulness of remote sensing for supporting the implementation of the MSFD with respect to Descriptor 5: Eutrophication. It is probable that remote sensing will also prove to be useful for monitoring other Descriptors of the MSFD. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Nonlinear forecasting of intertidal shoreface evolution	CHAOS												Natural systems dominated by sediment transport are notoriously difficult to forecast. This is particularly true along the ocean coastline, a region that draws considerable human attention as economic investment and infrastructure are threatened by both persistent, long-term and acute, event driven processes (i.e., sea level rise and storm damage, respectively). Forecasting the coastline's evolution over intermediate time (daily) and space (tens of meters) scales is hindered by the complexity of sediment transport and hydrodynamics, and limited access to the detailed local forcing that drives fast scale processes. Modern remote sensing systems provide an efficient, economical means to collect data within these regions. A solar-powered digital camera installation is used to capture the coast's evolution, and machine learning algorithms are implemented to extract the shoreline and estimate the daily mean intertidal coastal profile. Methods in nonlinear time series forecasting and genetic programming applied to these data corroborate that coastal morphology at these scales is predominately driven by nonlinear internal dynamics, which partially mask external forcing signatures. Results indicate that these forecasting techniques achieve nontrivial predictive skill for spatiotemporal forecast of the upper coastline profile (as much as 43% of variance in data explained for one day predictions). This analysis provides evidence that societally relevant coastline forecasts can be achieved without knowing the forcing environment or the underlying dynamical equations that govern coastline evolution.

Rizaludin; Matsuyama, Hiroshi; Hosaka, Tetsuro; Numata, Shinya; Hashim, Mazlan			Temporal Downscaling of TRMM Rain-Rate Images Using Principal Component Analysis during Heavy Tropical Thunderstorm Seasons	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												This paper examines the utility of principal component analysis (PCA) in obtaining accurate daily rainfall estimates from 3-hourly Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite data during heavy precipitation in a humid tropical environment. A large bias during heavy thunderstorms in humid tropical catchments is indicated by the TRMM satellite and is of profound concern because it is a conspicuous constraint for practical hydrology applications and requires proper treatment, particularly in areas with sparse rain gauges. The common procedure of calculating daily rainfall estimates by direct accumulation (DA) of a series of 3-hourly rainfall estimates caused a large bias because of temporal uncertainties, upscaling effects, and different mechanisms. In this study, PCA was used to transform correlated 3-hourly rain-rate images into a minimum effective principal component and to compute the corresponding rain-rate proportion based on correlation strength. This study was conducted on 91 rainy days of various intensity, acquired from three different years, during the wettest season on the eastern coast of peninsular Malaysia. Results showed that PCA reduced the bias and daily root-mean-square error by an average of 62% and 22%, respectively, compared with the DA approach. The PCA transformation was able to produce more precise daily rainfall estimates compared to the DA approach without the use of any rain gauge references. However, the performance was varied by the threshold selection and rainfall intensity. The results of this study indicate that PCA can be a useful tool in effective temporal downscaling of TRMM satellite data during heavy thunderstorm seasons in areas where rain gauges are sparse and satellite data are pivotal as a secondary source of rainfall data.

Spatial analysis suggests that post-depositional processes have a great impact on surface morphology; thus, the representativeness of a single measurement should be discussed in conjunction with local climate features. The comparison among snow accumulation, ice sheet thickness, surface elevation, and ice velocity indicates that the bedrock topography has an indirect connection with the SMB patterns through controlling the surface topography and local climate. The observation reveals that the Lambert Glacier Basin has been experiencing increasing mass input (4.5%), whereas the inland area has experienced a 6% loss, since 2005. An overall estimation of the SMB along the route is 71.3 +/- 44.3 kg m(-2) a(-1), but the annual and regional variation is considerable. Tendency analysis shows that there are four sections with different SMB patterns as a result of three moisture sources and surface climatic discrepancy in the Antarctic inland. This study is the first to identify four SMB patterns from the coast to the Dome area and should provide a valuable contribution to modeling and remote sensing on a continental scale.																	1674-7313	1869-1897				OCT	2015	58	10					1787	1797		10.1007/s11430-015-5083-9								WOS:000362336700011

It covers the area from the Bernam River basin in south Perak to the Linggi River basin in Negri Sembilan. The analysis of the land use change patterns and the prediction of future changes can highlight the problems of continuing current pattern of growth. Kuala Langat as the case study is located in the strategic area, because this area is identified as a Klang Valley II. The district has been experiencing rapid development, influence by some fast growing new centers like Kuala Lumpur International Airport, Klang Valley, Cyberjaya, Putrajaya and Kuala Lumpur mega-urban region. These have caused degradations of the natural habitats located in this area such as forests, peat swamp, mangroves and wetlands and land use changes from forest and agriculture to development areas. Also some sensitive area such as reclaimed lands, geo-disaster area, flash flood prone areas, dumping grounds and high erosion area need urgent sustainable plan for future development. Also, coastal lands are being developed very fast through establishments of residential, industrial and commercial centers. The analysis of land use changes have led to a better understanding in exploring suitable growth pattern for future development. The land use map obtained from Department of Agriculture for the year 1974 and 1981 and data of Landsat TM for the years of 1988, 1991, 1996 and 2010 obtained from the Malaysian Center for Remote Sensing were analyzed using GIS. From the investigation of land use changes detection over 35 years, the current unsustainable pattern of growth was highlighted. This emphasizes the urgent need for a sustainable development plan.																	1387-585X	1573-2975				OCT	2015	17	5					1003	1016		10.1007/s10668-014-9585-y								WOS:000361483600003

Efficient wind energy projects rely on accurate wind resource estimates, which are complex to obtain offshore due to the temporal and spatial sparseness of observations, and the potential for temporal data gaps introduced by the formation of ice during winter months, especially in freshwater lakes. For this study, in situ observations from 70 coastal stations and 20 buoys provide diurnal, seasonal, and interannual wind variability information, with time series that range from 3 to 11 years in duration. Remotely-sensed equivalent neutral winds provide spatial information on the wind climate. NASA QuikSCAT winds are temporally consistent at a 25 km resolution. ESA Synthetic Aperture Radar winds are temporally sparse but at a resolution of 500 m. As an initial step, each data set is processed independently to create a map of 90 m wind speeds. Buoy data are corrected for ice season gaps using ratios of the mean and mean cubed of the Weibull distribution, and reference temporally-complete time series from the North American Regional Reanalysis. Generalized wind climates are obtained for each buoy and coastal site with the wind model WAsP, and combined into a single wind speed estimate for the Great Lakes region. The method of classes is used to account for the temporal sparseness in the SAR data set and combine all scenes into one wind speed map. QuikSCAT winds undergo a seasonal correction due to lack of data during the cold season that is based on its ratio relative to buoy time series. All processing steps reduce the biases of the individual maps relative to the buoy observed wind climates. The remote sensing maps are combined by using QuikSCAT to scale the magnitude of the SAR map. Finally, the in situ predicted wind speeds are incorporated. The mean spatial bias of the final map when compared to buoy time series is 0.1 ms(-1) and the RMSE 03 ms(-1), which represents an uncertainty reduction of 50% relative to using only SAR, and of 40% to using only SAR and QuikSCAT without in situ observations.

Validation of standard and alternative satellite ocean-color chlorophyll products off Western Iberia	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Chlorophyll a concentration (Chl) product validation off the Western Iberian coast is here undertaken by directly comparing remote sensing data with in situ surface reference values. Both standard and recently developed alternative algorithms are considered for match-up data analysis. The investigated standard products are those produced by the MERIS (algal 1 and algal 2) and MODIS (OC3M) algorithms. The alternative data products include those generated within the CoastColour Project and Ocean Color Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) funded by ESA, as well as a neural net model trained with field measurements collected in the Atlantic off Portugal (MLPATLP). Statistical analyses showed that satellite Chl estimates tend to be larger than in situ reference values. The study also revealed that a non-uniform Chl distribution in the water column can be a concurring factor to the documented overestimation tendency when considering larger optical depth match-up stations. Among standard remote sensing products, MODIS OC3M and MERIS algal 2 yield the best agreement with in situ data. The performance of MLPATLP highlights the capability of regional solutions to further improve Chl retrieval by accounting for environmental specificities. Results also demonstrate the relevance of oceanographic regions such as the Nazare area to evaluate how complex hydrodynamic conditions can influence the quality of Chl products.

The study area is the Whale Coast Region, located in the extreme south of Bahia, between parallels 17 degrees 28'52.23 "S and 18 degrees 20'4.26"S and 39 degrees 11'41.93 meridians" and 40 degrees 29'27.03"W Greenwich, covering the municipalities of Alcobaca, Caravelas, Nova Vicosa and Mucuri. For this identification was based on Images of the RapidEye constellation satellite available free by the Brazil Environment Ministry in GeoEye portal, processed and subsequently integrated into the Geographic Information System, the ArcGIS software. The results show the presence of the Coastal Tablelands and the existence of extensive floodplain, Coastal Plain and Beach Ridges. The technique used is intended to contribute to the geomorphological studies of the area and support better planning proposals for the use and occupation of the land.																	2178-0463					OCT	2015	6				1		17	23										WOS:000387309900003						
J	Mendes, VR; Giannini, PCF				Mendes, Vinicius Ribau; Fonseca Giannini, Paulo Cesar			Coastal dunefields of south Brazil as a record of climatic changes in the South American Monsoon System	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Southern Brazil coastal dunefields are undergoing a stabilization process that appears to be influenced by climate change. Although this process is relatively well known in the literature, the precise climatic mechanisms involved were not fully understood until now. Here, we propose anew method for integrating meteorological data with dunefield morphology analyses by remote sensing to better understand the impacts of recent climate change on dunefield dynamics. Based on this approach, three successive morphological phases were identified for the Santa Catarina central coast dunefields since 1938: (i) increased sand saturation; (ii) reduced sand saturation with consequent accelerated dune migration; and (iii) decelerated dune migration with trends of stabilization by the vegetation cover. For the coastal dunefields of southern Brazil, the stabilization process can be explained mechanistically by an increase in precipitation and decrease of wind power, both of which were correlated with the intensification of the South American Monsoon System.

Ecology of the Ocean Sunfish, Mola mola, in the southern California Current System	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												The common ocean sunfish, Mola mola, occupies a unique position in the eastern Pacific Ocean and the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME) as the world's heaviest, most fecund bony fish, and one of the most abundant gelativores. M. mola frequently occur as bycatch in fisheries worldwide and comprise the greatest portion of the bycatch in California's large-mesh drift gillnet fishery. In this first long-term tagging study of any ocean sunfish species in the eastern Pacific, 15 M. mola (99 cm to 200 cm total length) were tagged in the southern California Bight (SCB) between 2003 and 2010 using 14 satellite pop-off archival tags (PATs) and one Fastloc Mk10 GPS tag. Ten tags provided positional data for a cumulative dataset of 349 tracking days during the months of july through March. Thirteen tags provided temperature and depth data. All M. mola remained within similar to 300 km of the coast, and nearly all exhibited seasonal movement between the SCB and adjacent waters off northern and central Baja California, Mexico. No tagged individuals were tracked north of the SCB. Tag depth data showed diel vertical migration and occasional deep (>500 m) dives. Data from the Fastloc GPS tag allowed close examination of the relationship between the movements of the largest tagged ocean sunfish (2 m TL) and fine-scale oceanographic features. Near-instantaneous satellite sea surface temperature images showed this individual associated with upwelling fronts along its migration path, which exceeded 800 km and ranged from 6 to 128 km from the coast. Tag depth data showed active use of the water column within the frontal zones. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images demonstrated that surface slicks, which often indicate convergent circulation, coincided with this type of front. Zooplankton tows in the southern region of tracking off central Baja California, Mexico revealed dense populations of salps toward the warm side of these fronts. Satellite tag and ecosystem data suggest that bio-physical interactions in coastal upwelling fronts create favorable foraging habitat. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Sequera, P; Gonzalez, JE; McDonald, K; Bornstein, R; Comarazamy, D				Sequera, Pedro; Gonzalez, Jorge E.; McDonald, Kyle; Bornstein, Robert; Comarazamy, Daniel			Combined impacts of land cover changes and large-scale forcing on Southern California summer daily maximum temperatures	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												California near-surface air temperatures are influenced by large-scale, regional and local factors. In that sense, a numerical model experiment was carried out to analyze the contribution of large-scale (changes in atmospheric and oceanic conditions) and regional (increased urbanization) factors on the observed California South Coast Air Basin regional summer daily maximum temperature warming pattern from 1950 to 2013. The simulations were performed with past (1950-1954) and present (2009-2013) land cover and climate conditions. The past land cover was derived from historical digital maps, and the present land cover was updated with high-resolution airborne remote sensing data. Results show that both factors contribute to the total change in daily maximum temperatures. Changes due to large-scale climate conditions dominate in coastal (due to warming sea surface temperatures) and nonurban regions, while changes due to urbanization have an impact mainly in urban areas, especially inland where large-scale warming weakens. Increased urbanization has also reduced sea-breeze intensity due to changes in surface roughness. The model was able to reproduce the regional observed warming pattern, as it incorporates urban heat island effects, otherwise underestimated by large-scale climate change only.

Free-floating patches of green algae dominated by Ulva prolifera occurred in early May in coastal waters of the southern Yellow Sea with an average biomass of 0.05 g m(-2). The average biomass of free-floating green algae developed rapidly and reached 3.20 gm(-2) in mid-May, and the affected area reached 8.7 x 10(3) km(2) with a total biomass of 1.37 x 10(5) tons. In late May, the average biomass reached 5.81 gm(-2,) and the affected area reached 3.2 x 10(4) km(2) with a total biomass of 2.5 x 10(5) tons. In early June, the average biomass reached 8.47 gm(-2), the affected area covered 3.6 x 10(4) km(2), and the total biomass of floating green algae was 3.64 x 10(5) tons. The affected areas of green tide in our observed data were higher than those estimated from remote sensing images in the early two cruises, and basically matched the remote sensing data in the last two cruises. With the increased biomass and the expansion of the affected area, the free-floating algal patches moved progressively northward. They first appeared in coastal water of middle Jiangsu province, gradually reached 35 degrees N in early May, and finally drifted to the southern coast of the Shandong Peninsula (36 degrees N) after one month. This work can offer help for the early prediction and warning of a green algal bloom and provide decision-making bases for governmental departments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

These ecotones between aquatic and terrestrial environments also provide protection from storm damage, run-off filtering, and recharge of aquifers. Many wetlands along coasts have been exposed to stress-inducing alterations globally, including dredge and fill operations, hydrologic modifications, pollutants, impoundments, fragmentation by roads/ditches, and sea level rise. For wetland protection and sensible coastal development, there is a need to monitor these ecosystems at global and regional scales. Recent advances in satellite sensor design and data analysis are providing practical methods for monitoring natural and man-made changes in wetlands. However, available satellite remote sensors have been limited to mapping primarily wetland location and extent. This paper describes how the HyspIRI hyperspectral and thermal infrared sensors can be used to study and map key ecological properties, such as species composition, biomass, hydrology, and evapotranspiration of tidal salt and brackish marshes and mangroves, and perhaps other major wetland types, including freshwater marshes and wooded/shrub wetlands.

With the newly built 3E model, the three indexes of ESI (ecological support index), EDI (equitable distribution index) and EEI (economic efficiency index) were calculated and their spatial pattern characteristics and regional differences over time were analyzed. The research results indicated that as the forest coverage rate increased, the carbon sink of the ecosystem in China also increased. ESI in the central and western China was tending to decrease, while ESI in the eastern coast was growing. Although the EEI gap between eastern China and western China was large, their EDI value gap was becoming shrinking as the economic growth shifted towards the central China and western China. The 3E values which were calculated with the consideration of ecology, equity and efficiency for China's carbon emissions indicated that the carbon emissions in half provinces of China were in good conditions, with benign ecosystem circulation, fairness and high economic efficiency in the recent 11 years. These results could act as references for China's low carbon economic development and also could provide guidance for the spatial pattern planning of China's carbon emissions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Climate variability drives plankton community composition changes: the 2010-2011 El Nino to La Nina transition around Australia	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The strong La Nina of 2010-2011 provided an opportunity to investigate the ecological impacts of El Nino-Southern Oscillation on coastal plankton communities using the nine national reference stations around Australia. Based on remote sensing and across the entire Australian region 2011 (La Nina) was only modestly different from 2010 (El Nino) with the average temperature declining 0.2%, surface chlorophyll a up 3% and modelled primary production down 14%. Other changes included a poleward shift in Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. Along the east coast, there was a reduction in salinity, increase in nutrients, Chlorophytes and Prasinophytes (taxa with chlorophyll b, neoxanthin and prasinoxanthin). The southwest region had a rise in the proportion of 19-hexoyloxyfucoxanthin; possibly cocco-lithophorids in eddies of the Leeuwin Current and along the sub-tropical front. Pennate diatoms increased, Ceratium spp. decreased and Scrippsiella spp. increased in 2011. Zooplankton biomass declined significantly in 2011. There was a reduction in the abundance of Calocalanus pavo and Temora turbinata and increases in Clausocalanus farrani, Oncaea scottodicarloi and Macrosetella gracilis in 2011. The changes in the plankton community during the strong La Nina of 2011 suggest that this climatic oscillation exacerbates the tropicalization of Australia.

Five major SST fronts are detected. The Jiangsu Fronts exist all year round along the 20-m isobath near the Jiangsu coast. In summer, the Jiangsu Fronts exhibit several frontal bands, closely corresponding to the shape of radial sand ridges off the Jiangsu coast. The Yangtze Bank Front forms a ring-shaped structure off the Yangtze River estuary in winter, and creates a boundary between the cold shelf water over the Yangtze Shoal and the warm Kuroshio water. The China Coastal Front evolves in winter along the 50-m isobath from the northern ECS southwestward into the Taiwan Strait. The Kuroshio Front is enhanced to the northeast of Taiwan between the 100-m and 200-m isobaths. The Cheju Island Front emerges along the southern coast of the Korean Peninsula and extends between Cheju Strait and Tsushima Strait, and is sustained in the summer months.

Mapping the Impacts of Iceland's Katla Subglacial Volcano on the Myrdalsjokull Glacier	CARTOGRAPHICA												Jokulhlaup is the Icelandic term for a sudden and substantial release of subglacial and/or proglacial water. The subglacial volcano Katla and its associated glacier Myrdalsjokull, near Iceland's southern coast, have the potential to cause catastrophic jokulhlaups through geothermally induced melting and volcanic eruptions. The resulting jokulhlaups can cause destruction of property and detriment to human life. Water-filled ice depressions (termed ice cauldrons) are produced by enhanced geothermal heating/melting and are large enough to be identified through remote sensing; therefore, ice cauldrons can be used to infer geothermal hot-spot locations and melt rates. To assess the risk of surrounding communities and infrastructure, a map of geothermal hot spots, loss of glacial mass, and meltwater flow paths of the Myrdalsjokull glacier were created and analysed. Using geospatial analysis, it was determined that three hazard zones - two towns, Alftaver (to the east) and Vik (to the south), as well as Iceland's main highway, Route 1 - are directly in the path of potential jokulhlaups originating from the Myrdalsjokull-Katla complex. Future research should further constrain meltwater flow paths to determine potential flow discharge rates and areas that are at the greatest risk of flooding. RESUMEJokulhlaup est le terme islandais pour un rejet subit et appreciable d'eau sous-glaciaire et proglaciaire. Le volcan sous-glaciaire Katla et son glacier associe, Myrdalsjokull, pres de la cote sud de l'Islande, peuvent provoquer des jokulhlaups catastrophiques par la fonte d'origine geothermique et les eruptions volcaniques. Les jokulhlaups resultants peuvent provoquer la destruction de biens et nuire a la vie humaine. Les depressions de glace remplies d'eau (appelees cuvettes de glace) sont generees par une augmentation du chauffage/de la fonte geothermiques et sont suffisamment importantes pour etre decelees par teledetection; par consequent, les cuvettes de glace peuvent servir a determiner par inference l'emplacement des points chauds geothermiques et les taux de fonte. De facon a evaluer le risque pour les collectivites environnantes et l'infrastructure, les auteurs ont cree et analyse une carte des points chauds geothermiques, de la perte de masse glaciaire, des cheminements d'ecoulement de l'eau de fonte du glacier Myrdalsjokull. l'aide de l'analyse geospatiale, il a ete etabli que trois zones a risque - deux villes, Alftaver (a l'est) et Vik (au sud), ainsi que la principale route d'Islande, la route1, sont directement sur le trace de jokulhlaups eventuels provenant du complexe Myrdalsjokull-Katla. Les recherches futures devraient determiner davantage les voies d'ecoulement des eaux de fonte afin de preciser les debits de deversement potentiels et les zones les plus a risque d'inondation.																	0317-7173	1911-9925				FAL	2015	50	3					195	203		10.3138/cart.50.3.3197F								WOS:000361157500008

Thus, it is especially important if the region has very high tidal ranges over very gentle tidal flats, which is a very vulnerable region. Although the various remote sensing platforms can be used to map shoreline changes, the spatial and temporal resolutions are not enough to obtain it for a short time. Accordingly, in this study we introduce the newly developed low altitude Helikite remote sensing platform to achieve much better resolutions of shorelines and a bathymetry. The Helikite stands for Helium balloon and Kite, which is a kind of aerial platform that uses the advantages of both a Helium balloon and a kite. Field experiments were conducted in the Jaebu Island, off the coast of the west Korean Peninsula in January 29, 2011. In order to extract shorelines from the consecutive images taken by the low altitude Helikite remote sensing platform, active contours without edges (ACWE) is used. Edges or boundaries exist primarily on places between one type of objective and the other. Since the hydrodynamic pressure has an effect everywhere, the locations of the waterlines can be the isobath lines. We could map several waterlines, which would enable us to complete a local bathymetry map ranges from 35 to 60 cm depth. The error resulting from applying ACWE algorithm to the imagery to determine the waterline is approximately less than 1 m. Therefore, it is very unique way to obtain such high resolutions of bathymetry with high accuracy for the regions of extremely high tidal ranges for a short time.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				SEP	2015	34	9					110	116		10.1007/s13131-015-0730-8								WOS:000360819600013						
J	Jorgensen, U; Skjetne, R				Jorgensen, Ulrik; Skjetne, Roger			Online Reconstruction of Drifting Underwater Ice Topography: The 2D case	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CONTROL												An online estimation design for a drifting two dimensional ice topography is presented. Under the assumption that the topography can be accurately represented by a truncated Fourier series, and given a moving window of measurements along the topography, an observer design is proposed to estimate the parameters of the model. The chosen method ensures an online cutoff of higher wave numbers in the spectrum representing the topography such that sufficient data compression is achieved for transmitting the model parameters through a limited hydroacoustic communication channel. This allows online reconstruction of the underwater drifting ice topography at a remote operation center. The observer is shown to be uniformly globally exponentially stable under a persistency of excitation condition. For comparison, a design based on B-spline basis functions is also presented. The effectiveness of the estimation algorithm is verified on a set of real ice draft measurements taken from the underside of an ice sheet off the coast of Greenland.																	1561-8625	1934-6093				SEP	2015	17	5					1509	1521		10.1002/asjc.1088								WOS:000361186700004

Physiochemical and optical parameters were measured following standard protocols. Average concentration of inorganic nutrients, such as NO2-N (17.26 +/- 2.92 mu M), NO3-N (643.80 +/- 215.99 mu M), PO4-P (74.10 +/- 26.52 mu M) and SiO3-Si (137.66 +/- 25.83 mu M) were recorded as very high at Veraval port as compared to other coastal stations i.e., 1.48 +/- 0.66, 49.16 +/- 13.73, 10.03 +/- 5.31 and 96.23 +/- 22.74 mu M, respectively. The pH and salinity (%(0)) were observed to be low (7.80 +/- 0.15 and 28.00 +/- 4.54%) as compared to coastal seawaters (8.34 +/- 0.06 and 33.24 +/- 2.32%). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and spectral signature (absorbance and reflectance) study revealed that the bloom-forming organism was D. tubifer. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) study detected that chlorophyllide-a represent nearly 47.53 % of total pigment composition followed by chlorophyll c(2) (27.40 %) and chlorophyll c(3) (14.25 %). Four prominent absorption peaks were observed within 350 to 700 nm. The first peak was very wide and ranged from 350 to 530 nm and the rest of the three peaks ranged from 550 to 590, 590 to 650 and 650 to 690 nm, respectively. In case of reflection, three peaks appeared between 550 and 590, 590 and 630 and 630 and 670 nm. Nearly 100 % reflection was observed after 720 nm. The eutrophic condition of the port water along with low salinity and low pH might be the reason for D. tubifer bloom formation. This species-specific spectral signature of the D. tubifer bloom may be helpful for developing algorithm of remote sensing data analysis.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				SEP	2015	187	9								10.1007/s10661-015-4798-6								WOS:000360313000051	26314344

Analyzing the Influence of Urban Forms on Surface Urban Heat Islands in Europe	JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT												Problem: Remotely sensed land surface temperatures help exploring the surface urban heat island. Measures to mitigate the urban heat island include increasing green urban areas and altering the form of cities. Research is needed to explore the impacts of urban form on the surface urban heat island. Research strategy: Data on land surface temperatures for summer 2001 and land cover are combined with meteorological, demographic, and topographic data for European urban regions, delineated as larger urban zones. To ensure a comprehensive view, three ways of quantifying surface urban heat island are calculated and stratified for morning and evening, and climate zones. Linear models reveal the relative influence of the four factors: (1) composition (e.g., share of different land covers in the urban region), (2) configuration (e.g., spatial arrangement), (3) location (e.g., distance to coast or elevation), and (4) population. Findings: The explanatory power (i.e., adj. R-sq) of the models varies strongly among the different ways to quantify the surface urban heat island and time of day. Rather specific combinations of explanatory variables were found to be relevant in explaining the variation in the different ways of quantifying surface urban heat islands. Compact urban form increases the surface urban heat island measured in one way, but was not a significant predictor for other ways of quantification. Increasing the share of built-up area and forest both increase the surface urban heat island. More built-up areas increased the mean temperature in the region, whereas more forest unsurprisingly decreased the overall temperature. The three ways of quantifying the surface urban heat island were correlated at r<0.5, and their variation was explained by different variables implying that they carry different information about the surface urban heat island effect. Takeaway for practice: Considerable attention needs to be paid to the aims of spatial planning, because mitigating the surface urban heat island might lead to measures that are actually increasing mean temperatures.

Shakhawat; Murshed, Sanzida			Assessment of Coastal Vulnerability Due to Sea Level Change at Bhola Island, Bangladesh: Using Geospatial Techniques	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												With continued climate change, coastal areas are subjected to undesirable situations in the form of sea-level rise and its adverse outcomes like storm surge, flooding and erosion. Being a unique geographic location, low topography, relatively higher population density as well as overwhelming dependence on natural resources, Bangladesh is one of the vulnerable countries exposed to the impacts of global warming and climate change. Bhola in southern Bangladesh represents the world's most dynamic estuary is potentially vulnerable to accelerated sea level rise and associated calamities. The present study aims to develop a coastal vulnerability index (CVI) using eight parameters namely (a) geomorphology, (b) slope, (c) relative sea level change rate, (d) mean tide range (e) shoreline erosion and accretion, (f) population (g) bathymetry and (h) coastal flooding which were addressed as the relative risk variable for the study area using geospatial techniques i.e., Remote Sensing and GIS. The aforementioned parameters were ranked on the basis of their potential contribution to physical changes on the coast, as sea-level rises, and the final calculation was done over 263.87 km shoreline by the square root of the mean values of the ranked variables. According to the vulnerability index, about 22 % corresponding to 57.23 km of the entire coast is under very high-risk and another 29 % representing 75.26 km is under high-risk. Again, 25 % encompassing 67.69 km shoreline is at moderate risk and 24 %, that is 63.69 km shoreline is found to be at low risk. The most vulnerable coastal regions are found mainly along the western coast of Char Fasson and northern and southwestern coast of Bhola Sadar of Bhola Island.																	0255-660X	0974-3006				SEP	2015	43	3					625	637		10.1007/s12524-014-0426-0								WOS:000359730500018

The main goals are focused on quantifying the urbanization process in coastal areas. Also, the relationship between urban growth and different coastal conditions was studied. In this research two sources of information were used: city population databases of United Nations and Google Earth remote sensing. The method is focused on a detailed study of all cities with over 100,000 inhabitants, from 1945 to 2012. The results show that half of population living in cities with over 100,000 inhabitants are within 100 km from the coast. This urban settlement has a particular pattern on the south, where is observed a "southern ridge" with a greater growth. The relationship between this development and coastal issues about geographical distribution, ecosystems, social and economic points; allows obtaining areas of interest for integrated coastal management.

J	Huang, Z; Feng, M				Huang, Zhi; Feng, Ming			Remotely sensed spatial and temporal variability of the Leeuwin Current using MODIS data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The Leeuwin Current is an anomalous poleward-flowing eastern boundary current that transports warm tropical waters southward and imposes significant ecological influences on the coastal marine ecosystems off Western Australia. In this study, we attempt to map the spatial structure of the sea surface temperature (SST) signature of the Leeuwin Current using MODIS satellite data, which is used to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of the Leeuwin Current for the period July 2002 to December 2012. A topographic Position Index (TPI) method is used to map the Leeuwin Current's SST signature from the MODIS SST images. The semi-automatic classification process involves automatically identifying areas occupied by warm SST waters of the Leeuwin Current and manually discarding detached Leeuwin Current features. The TPI mapping results enabled us to quantitatively examine the spatial and temporal variability of the Leeuwin Current's SST signature, including its spatial structure, extent, and cross-shelf migration, as well as its associated surface chlorophyll a characteristics. This study showed that the TPI mapping is able to capture the complex spatial structures of the Leeuwin Current, including its meanders, offshoots and eddies along its path, as reflected in the SST data. Using an eddy-resolving, data-assimilating numerical ocean model, we were able to relate the Leeuwin Current's SST signature with its surface current speed signature, though generally the speed signature is on the offshore side of the SST signature by about 25 to 30 km. Temporal wavelet analyses indicated that the variability of the Leeuwin Current's SST structure is dominated by seasonal cycle. During austral winter, the warm SST signature of the current is close to the shelf break, having greater spatial extent and higher chlorophyll a concentrations. In contrast, during austral summer, the SST signature of the current moves offshore, with reduced spatial extent and chlorophyll a concentrations. The Leeuwin Current also has notable inter-annual variation, to a large extent in response to ENSO variability in the Pacific. In El Nino years the current's SST signature tends to have reduced spatial extent, move further inshore, and increase its chlorophyll a concentrations. The opposite occurs during the La Nina years, especially after the unprecedented 2010-11 La Nina/Ningaloo Nino event when there was a significant reduction of the surface chlorophyll a concentration within the Leeuwin Current's SST signature. The mapping method developed in this study will be also useful in detecting climate driven variability of other ocean boundary current systems. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Extent of sewage pollution in coastal environment of Mumbai, India: an object-based image analysis	WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL												The coastal water quality of Mumbai is deteriorating by receiving partially treated effluent from wastewater treatment facilities, sewage discharges from ocean outfalls and discharges from point and non-point sources in the creek and coast. A novel approach of object-based image analysis has been used in this research study to assess the extent of sewage pollution in the coastal environment of Mumbai. For this, Indian Remote Sensing P6 Linear Imaging Self Scanning IV image was used for multiresolution segmentation and rule-based image classification as per normalised difference water index and normalised difference turbidity index. Water quality regions as per classification were strongly correlated with observed water quality parameters. Based on classified regions and water quality parameters, extent of sewage pollution in the coast was ranked from high to least polluted. The approach developed in this methodology should be tested in similarly polluted waters to ascertain its adaptability for assessing the spatial extent of sewage pollution.																	1747-6585	1747-6593				SEP	2015	29	3					365	374		10.1111/wej.12115								WOS:000359305600008

For Brazilian coastal dunefields, the second hypothesis seems to be more consistent with the luminescence ages found so far; however, most of these data were obtained without using the SAR protocol. Another point of concern is the role of climate change in the aeolian system, which is still not very clear. The aim of this paper is to try to clarify these two questions. To this end, five coastal dunefields were selected in central Santa Catarina coast. The remote sensing and dating results allowed the discrimination and mapping of at least four aeolian generations. Their age distribution in relation to the global curve of relative sea level variation during the Late Pleistocene allows us to suggest that the formation of Aeolian dunefields in the coastal context is supported by stable relative sea level. However, relative sea level is not the only determinant for the formation and preservation of the aeolian coastal dunes. Evidences of climatic control indicate that the initiation of dunefields would be favored by periods of less humidity while their stabilization would occur preferably during the periods of rain intensification, connected to monsoon activity.

Here, we (1) review the current status of the diversity and distribution of coastal ecosystems in BCS, (2) assess the composition and coverage of these ecosystems in PNAs, and (3) identify coastal ecosystems of special interest for conservation. The combination of spatial analysis techniques was carried out using LandSat TM images and GIS processing, considering ecoregions and ecosystems in the coastal zone, as well as through the application of an ecosystem diversity index. In the BCS coastal zone, 11 ecosystems were identified: scrub, coastal water body, riparian, bare soil, halophyte, beach, salt flat, mangrove, salt marsh, coral reef, and seagrass. The ecosystem diversity in BCS results from the coastal features that differentiate the Pacific and the Gulf coasts. PNAs include 17 % of coastal ecosystems. Bahia Magdalena (Pacific) and Bahia Concepcin (Gulf of California), which are key for conservation (including mangroves and seagrasses), should be considered either for classification as PNAs or for inclusion in coastal management programs. The combination of remote sensing and GIS with biogeographic and ecosystemic approaches in our study enabled to determine ecosystem diversity and set coastal conservation priorities in Baja California Sur, Mexico. Specifically, coastal ecosystems that are not currently included within PNAs and which should be considered as conservation priorities were identified.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				AUG	2015	19	4					609	619		10.1007/s11852-015-0411-y								WOS:000362017900015

FORMATION, MOVEMENT, AND RESTORATION OF DEAD INTERTIDAL OYSTER REEFS IN CANAVERAL NATIONAL SEASHORE AND MOSQUITO LAGOON, FLORIDA	JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH												Globally, 85% of shellfish reefs have been lost during the past century. The severe loss of the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica has encouraged different types of restoration efforts in the United States. In Mosquito Lagoon (ML), a shallow-water estuary on the east coast of central Florida, restoration focuses on providing additional substrate for larval recruitment via deployment of stabilized oyster shell. To assess the current number and area of natural, dead, and restored oyster reefs within ML, aerial photographs from 2009 were digitized using ArcGIS software. All reefs were screen digitized using a reef "signature" to estimate the surface area of each reef type. The maps from 2009 were then used as a guide to digitizing the historical aerial photographs (1943, 1951, 1967, 1971, 1984, 1995, and 2006). Oyster habitat within ML has decreased by almost 15 hectares between 1943 and 2009, which constitutes 24% of the 1943 lagoon-wide coverage. The impacts were greater in Canaveral National Seashore, which covers the southern ML; 40% of the oyster coverage within the park has been lost since 1943. Dead reefs were found adjacent to important boating channels. Tracked dead reefs exhibited a continuous migration into the mangrove islands located landward of the original live reefs, with some dead reefs completely washing up into the marsh. Restoration of dead reefs with stabilized oyster shells has added nearly 1 hectare of live oyster habitat to ML as of January 2009. This research demonstrates that dead reefs are increasing in number and coverage within ML, but this trend can be reversed with restoration.																	0730-8000	1943-6319				AUG	2015	34	2					251	258		10.2983/035.034.0206								WOS:000360410500006

Assessment of Egypt's Red Sea coastal sensitivity to climate change	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												A coastal sensitivity index (CSI) was developed to assess the response of the Red Sea coast in Egypt to climate change in terms of sea level rise and global warming. Six different variables pertaining to the intrinsic characteristics of the coast that extends to 1200 km were utilized, notably: coastal geomorphology, coastal slope, width of the coastal plain, shoreline exposure, fauna/flora and land use. Data have been extracted, manipulated and presented using remote sensing and GIS analysis. The resulting coastal sensitivity map depicts the susceptibility levels of the Red Sea coastal plain to climate change. The most severely sensitive segments (very high CSI) account for 31 % (365 km) of the coast. They occur across unconsolidated, flat, wide, exposed, ecologically effective and/or inhabited coasts. On the other hand, the least sensitive (low CSI) coastal segments total 245 km (20 %) and are mainly rocky, steep, narrow, barren and/or inaccessible shores. Eustatic sea level rise by 1 m should inundate a coastal area of 106 km(2), whereas a sudden tsunami of 5 m height should overwhelm 724 km(2), particularly at the southern section near Shalateen. Global warming of seawater should impact the coastal zone between Hurghada and Marsa Alam (270 km long) due to the occurrence of fringing coral reef systems. The coastal sensitivity index provides a synoptic overview that could help prioritize emergency plans and protection strategies to reduce the ramifications of climate change.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				AUG	2015	74	4					2831	2843		10.1007/s12665-015-4304-z								WOS:000358320700004

Extracting geometric information for tidal creek networks (TCN) geometry from remote sensing is essential to understanding their characteristics, formation, and evolution. Currently, the major obstacles to automated recognition using digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data are low relief, varying widths, high density, strong anisotropy, and complicated patterns. Conventional methods, such as the optimal-elevation threshold method, the optimal-curvature threshold method, and the D8 method, cannot achieve satisfactory performance under these conditions. We propose an automated method for extracting tidal creeks (AMETC) using topographic features detected from LiDAR. Specifically, a multi-window median neighborhood analysis was designed to enhance depressions both in mudflat and marsh environments; a multi-scale and multi-directional Gaussian-matched filtering method was incorporated to enhance width-variant TCs; and a two-stage adaptive thresholding algorithm was implemented to segment low-contrast TCs. The AMETC was tested on two large LiDAR datasets of the Jiangsu coast with different resolutions. The quantitative assessments show that AMETC successfully extracted both small and large TCs from our study areas. The true positive extraction rate reached 95%, outperforming conventional methods. The AMETC is robust and weakly dependent on scale, and rarely requires manual intervention. Further applications suggests that the AMETC has potential for extraction of other types of channel features (e.g., badland networks and ravines). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The study took into account factors including the proximity of municipal landfill sites to transportation routes, hotels, tourist resorts, airports, the coast, groundwater, high flood risk zones, faults and fractures, and residential communities. These factors or criteria were categorized into three regularity groups. Experts from governmental agencies, non-governmental organizations, and academic institutions scored the criteria grids and determined the relative importance ratio of each pair of criteria inside regularity groups and the relative importance of each pair of the regularity groups. Then, an AHP ArcGIS extension was applied using pairwise comparison matrices to determine the weight of individual criterion in each regularity group and the weight of the regularity groups. The weighted scored grid of municipal landfill siting criteria was used to locate regions that were highly conformal with all the criteria. Three suitable municipal sites were delineated out of these regions by a field survey.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				AUG	2015	74	3					2283	2296		10.1007/s12665-015-4220-2								WOS:000358073800036

Automated detection of features such as building roof for template matching and pattern recognition is great significance in the image processing field. In this chapter, a method which is developed optimizing the shape and size of hit-or-miss morphological filtering parameters with morphological operators is presented for building roof target detection. Morphological operations of opening and closing with constructions are applied to segmented images. Hit-or-Miss Transform (HMT) has been successfully applied for template matching in binary images. The proposed approach involves several advanced morphological operators among which an adaptive HMT with varying size and shape of the structuring elements. VHR space borne images consisting of a pre and post 2011 Pacific coast of Tohoku earthquake and the tsunami site of the Ishinomaki, Miyagi area in Japan were used. Experimental results show that the identified probability of building can reach more than 81 % by this method.																	1868-8071	1868-808X				AUG	2015	6	4					641	650		10.1007/s13042-014-0326-1								WOS:000358074500011

The exceptional surface turbidity of the North-West European shelf seas during the stormy 2013-2014 winter: Consequences for the initiation of the phytoplankton blooms?	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												A succession of storms during the winter 2013-2014 enhanced the resuspension of sediments in the surface waters of the North-West European shelf seas. The effects of waves on satellite-derived non-algal SPM (Suspended Particulate Matters) are discussed for the January 2008-March 2014 period. A simple statistical model relating locally SPM to tidal intensity and waves helps us analyse the main characteristics of the winter 2013-2014. The exceptional run of storms observed in this stormy and rainy winter has resulted in the highest SPM concentration in the Celtic Sea and the Bay of Biscay ever observed by remote-sensing during the 1998-2014 period. Despite the lower clarity of the surface waters over a large part of the continental shelf during the first days of March 2014, blooms occurred early off the coast of Southern Brittany (Bay of Biscay) and later in April, as usual, in the Celtic Sea. Off the coast of southern Brittany, a region of freshwater influence, the lower clarity of the waters was counterbalanced by stronger haline stratification, due to high river discharges, enabling the initiation of blooms in late winter when the solar irradiance is sufficient; which was the case in March 2014 with 7 sunny days in a row just after the last storm. As a consequence, we can postulate that a possible increase in the intensity of waves occurring from December to early March, along with a possible scenario of global change, would not restrict the productive period in the Bay of Biscay. However an extension of the period of storms later in March would delay the timing of the blooms as observed in March 2008 in most of the investigated area. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Measurement-based estimates of direct radiative effects of absorbing aerosols above clouds	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The elevated layers of absorbing smoke aerosols from western African (e.g., Gabon and Congo) biomass burning activities have been frequently observed above low-level stratocumulus clouds off the African coast, which presents an excellent natural laboratory for studying the effects of aerosols above clouds (AAC) on regional energy balance in tropical and subtropical environments. Using spatially and temporally collocated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), and Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System data sets, the top-of-atmosphere shortwave aerosol direct shortwave radiative effects (ARE) of absorbing aerosols above low-level water clouds in the southeast Atlantic Ocean was examined in this study. The regional averaged instantaneous ARE has been estimated to be 36.720.5Wm(-2) (regional meanstandard deviation) along with a mean positive OMI Aerosol Index at 1.3 in August 2006 based on multisensors measurements. The highest magnitude of instantaneous ARE can even reach 138.2Wm(-2). We assess that the 660nm cloud optical depth (COD) values of 8-12 is the critical value above (below) which aerosol absorption (scattering) effect dominates and further produces positive (negative) ARE values. The results further show that ARE values are more sensitive to aerosols above lower COD values than cases for higher COD values. This is among the first studies to provide quantitative estimates of shortwave ARE due to AAC events from an observational perspective.

The evidences suggest that the ports of Odisha had contacts with the Arabs, Mediterranean countries and South Asia, as well as Southeast Asian countries. Khalkattapatna, a medieval port located on the banks of River Kushabhadra was discovered by archaeological excavations which suggest that between the 13th and 15th centuries it flourished and had contacts with Arabia and China, in addition to other countries. During recent explorations, a number of terracotta ring wells, stamped pottery, Chinese and celadon ware sherds, bricks and brickbats, and terracotta beads were found on the riverbank and in the waters of River Kushabhadra because of erosion of the north bank of the river. Remote sensing images of this region from 1977 to 2014 were analysed to delineate the river mouth and its course. Google Earth images of 2003 and 2011 were also referred to for an understanding of the migration of the northern bank of River Kushabhadra. This note describes the present state of the Khalkattapatna port, causes of erosion, change of north bank of the river course and its consequences.

J	Wang, CS; Sun, GY; Dang, LJ				Wang, Chuansheng; Sun, Guiyan; Dang, Lijuan			Identifying Ecological Red Lines: A Case Study of the Coast in Liaoning Province	SUSTAINABILITY												The global decline in estuarine and coastal ecosystems is affecting critical ecosystem services. The spatial agglomeration of population, industries and resources has led to the emergence of regionally-specific ecological problems. Therefore, identifying ecological red lines, based on specific natural and environmental features, could help to differentiate the economic development and ecological protection directions or potentials of different regions in future. The aim of this case study is to define the ecological red line in the coastal zone of Liaoning Province, China, by evaluating the ecological importance and environmental stress in its marine and terrestrial ecosystems. For this purpose, the ecological importance of this area was first classified into four conservation indices (species, wetland, water and coast and islands) and assigned values of 5, 3 and 1 for indications of high, moderate and minor importance. In the meantime, environmental stress was also classified into four indices (water environment, salinization, soil erosion and erosion of coasts and islands) and assigned values of 5, 3 and 1 for indications of high, moderate and low stress, respectively. Then, based on an overlay analysis and evaluation of the above results, we defined two grades of ecological red line zones. Grade I ecological red line zones contain the areas with critical and diverse ecosystem services, areas of high importance for species conservation and nature reserves, as well as ecologically-vulnerable and sensitive areas. It is important in these areas to maintain the biological diversity and to improve the quality of the ecological environment, which should be strictly protected and explicitly controlled. Grade II ecological red line zones display areas with minimum requirements for maintaining the basic needs of a livable environment and human health, moderate to minor levels of ecological importance and high to moderate levels of environmental stress. To better control and protect such ecological red lines, setting up an ecological inventory through remote sensing satellites and ground-level monitoring and appraising the effectiveness of dynamical protection are highly recommended.																	2071-1050					JUL	2015	7	7					9461	9477		10.3390/su7079461								WOS:000360354500068						
J	Feng, YJ; Liu, Y; Liu, D				Feng, Yongjiu; Liu, Yan; Liu, Dan			Shoreline mapping with cellular automata and the shoreline progradation analysis in Shanghai, China from 1979 to 2008	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												This paper presents a cellular automata (CA) algorithm to extract shorelines from remote sensing images by analysing the edge directional information of the images. Using this algorithm, the tide-coordinated shorelines along the entire coast in Shanghai Municipality of China were extracted and analysed using the multi-temporal Landsat TM images from 1979 to 2008. The shorelines of four sub-regions, including the mainland and three islands (Changxing, Hengsha and Chongming) were analysed along with six areas experiencing drastic shoreline changes. The results show a total progradation of 551.7 km(2) along the coastal area of Shanghai over the past 30 years, due to both long-term sediment deposition and short-term land reclamation. Furthermore, both horizontal and vertical displacements along the shorelines were identified. Fractal analyses between the length of the shorelines and the spatial resolution of the images achieved goodness-of-fit (R-2) values above 0.6 for the shorelines of the entire Shanghai as well as for each of the four subregions, indicating that the relationship between the length of the shorelines and the spatial resolution of the images accord with the power laws. The fractal dimension values indicate that the shorelines of both Changxing and Chongming Islands were getting regular. The paper also demonstrates that the CA-based shoreline extractor can detect shoreline information of both artificial and muddy coasts from remote sensing images. The shoreline extraction and change analysis tool is valuable not only for shoreline mapping but also for comprehensive coastal management.

J	Yousif, M				Yousif, Mohamed			Integration of the geomorphologic and geologic studies for water potentialities development in El Zarraqa and El Harraqa basins, East Matrouh, northwestern coast, Egypt	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The northwestern coast of Egypt represents one of the highest-priority regions for future development. Two contiguous basins were chosen from the northwestern coast for this research: El Zarraqa and El Harraqa basins. The main objective of the present study is to provide geomorphologic and geological data in order to work on the water potentiality development in the study area. The obtained data through the present study reveal that, although the two studied basins are close to each other, they are not compatible with all features. The morphometric parameters reveal that the studied basins have opportunities for surface runoff occurrence and also for groundwater recharge through infiltration process. The geology of the study area is dominated by sedimentary rocks of Tertiary and Quaternary ages. The study area has favorable conditions for groundwater accumulation, where this area receives an average annual precipitation of 151.95 mm, which provides the opportunity for groundwater recharge. The hydrogeological investigations reflect that two groundwater aquifers (Middle Miocene and Pleistocene) are recorded in the El Harraqa basin, and only the Middle Miocene aquifer is recorded in the El Zarraqa basin. The Middle Miocene aquifer needs more hydrogeophysical investigations to explore its potentialities where its rocks have a wide distribution and are mainly fractured. The difference in groundwater salinity in both aquifers accompanied by different hydrogeologic data confirms that the carbonate aquifer in the studied basins is heterogeneous and has anisotropic characters. The current research set up a proposed plan which includes multiactivities for the protection and development of the water resources.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				JUL	2015	8	7					4603	4626		10.1007/s12517-014-1522-8								WOS:000357101200026

Spatial distribution analysis of soil variables for agronomic development in El-Omayed Area, North-Coastal of Egypt	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Geostatistical modeling has recently been developed for spatial prediction of environmental variables. The current research aims to utilize geographic information capabilities, remote sensing imagery and soil data, for decision-making in natural resources management of El-Omayed area, N-W coast of Egypt. El-Omayed geographically limited by latitudes 30 degrees 45'N south and the Mediterranean Sea at the north. The selected region represents an extended territory having an area of 102,35 ha, and considers a promising location for future development, keeping the ecological protectorate site as a reference. It was possible to investigate the distribution of selected soil variables and their relation with the actual properties to carry out a detailed suitability evaluation for specific agricultural uses. Spatial patterns of some chemical and physical soil properties were analysed. Data were investigated both statistically and geostatistically based on the semivariogram analysis. Among the considered soil parameters, the spatial distribution model varied and showed moderate to strong spatial dependence. EC, gypsum and sand soil texture were strongly spatially dependent. Using a suitability model built in ALESarid software, the obtained results indicate that the area currently lacks high suitability classes. Following an improving soil properties program may enhance the soil capability status. An area of 70,109 ha (68.5 %) would become marginally suitable, then suitability for different common crops land use (wheat, sunflower, maize, olive, fig, onion, tomato, potato and watermelon) can elaborated. The usage of geospatial data, distribution analysis and GIS proved to be suitable tools to fulfill the needed large computational requirements.

Ocean dynamics, however, impose a challenge for correlation between oil seeps detected on the water surface and its source at the ocean floor. This hinders the potential use of seeps in petroleum exploration. The present study aims to estimate oil exposure time on the water surface via remote sensing in order to help locating ocean floor seepage sources. Spectral reflectance properties of a variety of fresh crude oils, oil films on water and oil-water emulsions were determined. Their spectral identity was used to estimate the duration of exposure of oil-water emulsions based on their temporal spectral responses. Laboratory models efficiently predicted oil status using ultraspectral (>2000 bands), hyperspectral (>300 bands), and multispectral (<10 bands) sensors covering near infrared and shortwave infrared wavelengths. An oil seepage recorded by the ASTER sensor on the Brazilian coast was used to test the designed predictive model. Results indicate that the model can successfully forecast the timeframe of crude oil exposure in the ocean (i.e., the relative "age" of the seepage). The limited spectral resolution of the ASTER sensor, though, implies less accurate estimates compared to higher resolution sensors. The spectral libraries and the method proposed here can be reproduced for other oceanic areas in order to approximate the duration of exposure of noticeable natural oil seepages. This type of information is optimal for seepage tracing and, therefore, for oceanic petroleum exploration and environmental monitoring. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Seasonal sea ice changes in the Amundsen Sea, Antarctica, over the period of 1979-2014	ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE												Recent attention has focused on accelerated glacial losses along the Amundsen Sea coast that result from changes in atmosphere and ocean circulation, with sea ice playing a mediating but not well-understood role. Here, we investigated how sea ice has changed in the Amundsen Sea over the period of 1979 to 2014, focusing on spatio-temporal changes in ice edge advance/retreat and percent sea ice cover in relation to changes in winds. In contrast to the widespread sea ice decreases to the east and increases to the west of the Amundsen Sea, sea ice changes in the Amundsen Sea were confined to three areas: (i) offshore of the shelf break, (ii) the southern Pine Island Polynya, and (iii) the eastern Amundsen Sea Polynya. Offshore, a 2-month decrease in ice season duration coincided with seasonal shifts in wind speed and direction from March to May (relating to later ice advance) and from September to August (relating to earlier retreat), consistent with reported changes in the depth/location of the Amundsen Sea Low. In contrast, sea ice decreases in the polynya areas corresponded to episodic or step changes in spring ice retreat (earlier by 1-2 months) and were coincident with changes to Thwaites Iceberg Tongue (located between the two polynyas) and increased southeasterly winds. Temporal correlations among these three areas were weak, indicating different local forcing and/or differential response to large-scale forcing. Although our analysis has shown that part of the variability can be explained by changes in winds or to the coastal icescape, an additional but unknown factor is how sea ice has responded to changes in ocean heat and freshwater inputs. Unraveling cause and effect, critical for predicting changes to this rapidly evolving ocean-ice shelf-sea ice system, will require in situ observations, along with improved remote sensing capabilities and ocean modeling.

This study presents the results of applying the hierarchical European Nature Information System (EUNIS) to classify and map the benthic habitats of the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park, a marine protected area (MPA), located in the mainland Portuguese southwest coast, in the Iberian Peninsula. The habitat map was modelled by applying a methodology based on EUNIS to merge biotic and abiotic key habitat drivers. The modelling in this approach focused on predicting the association of different data types: substrate, bathymetry, light intensity, waves and currents energy, sediment grain size and benthic macrofauna into a common framework. The resulting seamless medium scale habitat map discriminates twenty six distinct sublittoral habitats, including eight with no match in the current classification, which may be regarded as new potential habitat classes and therefore will be submitted to EUNIS. A discussion is provided examining the suitability of the current EUNIS scheme as a standardized approach to classify marine benthic habitats and map their spatial distribution at medium scales in the Portuguese coast. In addition the factors that most affected the results available in the predictive habitat map and the role of the environmental factors on macrofaunal assemblage composition and distribution are outlined.

A scientific and reasonable assessment of coastline resources will benefit the formulation of coastal development strategy and increase the comprehensive use efficiency of coastline resources. The use of remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) helped to establish the system of indicators for the comprehensive suitability assessment of coastline resources with emphasis on production, human life and ecological protection. Of the total continental coastline of Zhejiang, the coastline with top priority given to production accounted for 4.9%; the coastline with moderate development, 10.3%; the coastline for residence and tourism, 21.9%; the coastline under ecological protection, 1.5%; and the reserve coastline, 61.4%. The coastlines have good port construction conditions and are located at the junction zone coast section of Pinghu City and Haiyan City, the southern mouth of the Yongjiang River, Ningbo to the north bank of Beilun, the coast of Xiangshangang Bay. These coastline sections are suitable for priority development or moderate development. The coastline sections that are suitable for urbanization or tourism development are located east of Haiyan City and northwest of Cixi City. Part of the coastline sections in the east of Xiangshan County and in the middle of Sanmen County need to be strictly protected due to its unique ecological service value.																	0031-7454					JUN	2015	98	2					224	236										WOS:000357837400011

NDVI to Detect Sugarcane Aphid Injury to Grain Sorghum	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												Multispectral remote sensing has potential to provide quick and inexpensive information on sugarcane aphid, Melanaphis sacchari (Zehntner), pest status in sorghum fields. We describe a study conducted to determine if injury caused by sugarcane aphid to sorghum plants in fields of grain sorghum could be detected using multispectral remote sensing from a fixed wing aircraft. A study was conducted in commercial grain sorghum fields in the Texas Gulf Coast region in June 2014. Twenty-six commercial grain sorghum fields were selected and rated for the level of injury to sorghum plants in the field caused by sugarcane aphid. Plant growth stage ranged from 5.0 (watery ripe) to 7.0 (hard dough) among fields; and plant injury rating from sugarcane aphid ranged from 1.0 (little or no injury) to 4.0 (> 40% of plants displaying injury) among fields. The normalized differenced vegetation index (NDVI) is calculated from light reflectance in the red and near-infrared wavelength bands in multispectral imagery and is a common index of plant stress. High NDVI indicates low levels of stress and low NDVI indicates high stress. NDVI ranged from -0.07 to 0.26 among fields. The correlation between NDVI and plant injury rating was negative and significant, as was the correlation between NDVI and plant growth stage. The negative correlation of NDVI with injury rating indicated that plant stress increased with increasing plant injury. Reduced NDVI with increasing plant growth probably resulted from reduced photosynthetic activity in more mature plants. The correlation between plant injury rating and plant growth stage was positive and significant indicating that plant injury from sugarcane aphid increased as plants matured. The partial correlation of NDVI with plant injury rating was negative and significant indicating that NDVI decreased with increasing plant injury after adjusting for its association with plant growth stage. We demonstrated that remotely sensed imagery acquired from grain sorghum fields using an airborne multi-spectral imaging system was sensitive to injury to sorghum plants caused by sugarcane aphid.																	0022-0493	1938-291X				JUN	2015	108	3					1452	1455		10.1093/jee/tov080								WOS:000356239000075	26470276

The method relies on image processing techniques using the IDRISI software, and the Digital Shoreline Analysis System, a free extension for ArcGIS software, which provides a set of tools permitting transects-based calculation of shoreline displacement. First, the Landsat images were radiometrically and geometrically corrected. Second, band ratioing, reclassification, raster to vector conversion, and smoothing techniques are applied successively to detect and extract the multi-temporal shoreline data. Third, these data are overlaid and the changes are calculated using the end points and linear regression methods. The results indicate significant shoreline changes ranging from 8.6 to -42.6 m/year, while some parts remained unchanged. The estimated shoreline change rates are comparable with those obtained through in situ measurements and from the analysis of multi-date aerial photos and toposheets. The main causes of erosion in particular are related to the natural shifting of the Medjerda River course and mouth, damming of Medjerda and its tributaries, construction of Ghar El Melh port, and the destruction of the small bordering dunes in addition to the wave-induced longshore currents, relative sea level rise due mainly to accelerated coastal subsidence, and sand mining.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				JUN	2015	8	6					4239	4255		10.1007/s12517-014-1472-1								WOS:000355336800069

Morphometric analysis of the River Thamirabarani sub-basin in Kanyakumari District, South west coast of Tamil Nadu, India, using remote sensing and GIS	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The quantitative analysis of the drainage morphometric system is vital to understand the hydrological and environmental interaction and its processes of an area. The present study deals with quantitative characteristics of morphometry of steep slope and short length sub-basin of R. Thamirabarani in Kanyakumari District, Tamilnadu, India, using geospatial technology. In this study, the digital elevation model data product (ASTER DEM), Landsat ETM+ image and Survey of India topographical map were used to delineate slope, relief and drainage system structures such as drainage pattern, stream order, stream network and stream length of the sub-basin using ArcGIS 9.3 software. The morphometric analysis deals with hydrologic processes such as stream frequency, bifurcation ratio, circulatory ratio and length of overland flow of the sub-basin area and their influences on the local morphologic landforms. The quantitative measurement of these characteristics is used to explore the basin's contribution to the hydrological cycle and the shape, size and formation of the local landscapes in the region. Moreover, the hypsometric analysis and denudation rate were estimated for understanding the quantitative geomorphological characteristics of the sub-basin. The relationship of the morphometric parameters reveals that the drainage network is strongly controlled by geological and geomorphological structures of the area. The geometry of streams exhibits dendritic drainage pattern associated with coarse drainage texture in primary order of streams present on hilly terrain surface and semi-dendritic pattern in higher stream order flow on less elevated surface with gentle slope. The drainage density of the study area ranges from 0.1 to 1.89 km/km(2), and the maximum density value was found along the higher stream order. The mean bifurcation ratio of this area is 4.21 and the high ratio was measured between the third and fourth order of stream segments. The morphometry of this area is depicted by the length of the stream segment, drainage pattern and stream flow direction, which are influenced by relief, steep slope and local geological structure. Furthermore, the sub-basin is found to be strongly elongated in shape with a length of 42.78 km, and the circularity ratio of this area is measured as 0.33 and elongation ratio as 0.57. The textural dissection of the landforms shows low drainage density in the high elevated hilly terrain in the north and high level in the plain areas in the southern part. The values of the circulatory ratio, length of overland flow and elongation ratio are relatively close to one another and the relationship among them shows their influences on the process of surface runoff and sediment deposition along the estuary landforms in the study area. Moreover, it is observed that the hypsometric curve of this study area is characterized by convex-up shape in nature and represents the youth stage (inequilibrium) of landscapes. Consequently, the hypsometric integral value 0.49 reflects the distribution of a major volume of the landmass (435.32 km(2)) at relatively low elevations (< 180 m). The morphometric parameters-induced denudation rate of this study area is 65.14 t/km(2)/year and indicates the occurrence of a wide range of denudation intensities throughout the sub-basin, which is relatively proportional to the suspended sediment yield that is transported in the suspension per unit area. Based on the realistic output, it is proved that remote sensing and GIS are effective tools for morphometric studies of the drainage basin.

UAV photogrammetry for topographic monitoring of coastal areas	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Coastal areas suffer degradation due to the action of the sea and other natural and human-induced causes. Topographical changes in beaches and sand dunes need to be assessed, both after severe events and on a regular basis, to build models that can predict the evolution of these natural environments. This is an important application for airborne LIDAR, and conventional photogrammetry is also being used for regular monitoring programs of sensitive coastal areas. This paper analyses the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to map and monitor sand dunes and beaches. A very light plane (SwingletCam) equipped with a very cheap, non-metric camera was used to acquire images with ground resolutions better than 5 cm. The Agisoft Photoscan software was used to orientate the images, extract point clouds, build a digital surface model and produce orthoimage mosaics. The processing, which includes automatic aerial triangulation with camera calibration and subsequent model generation, was mostly automated. To achieve the best positional accuracy for the whole process, signalised ground control points were surveyed with a differential GPS receiver. Two very sensitive test areas on the Portuguese northwest coast were analysed. Detailed DSMs were obtained with 10 cm grid spacing and vertical accuracy (RMS) ranging from 3.5 to 5.0 cm, which is very similar to the image ground resolution (3.2-4.5 cm). Where possible to assess, the planimetric accuracy of the orthoimage mosaics was found to be subpixel. Within the regular coastal monitoring programme being carried out in the region, UAVs can replace many of the conventional flights, with considerable gains in the cost of the data acquisition and without any loss in the quality of topographic and aerial imagery data.

Shoreline oscillation of Dhanushkodi, Rameswaram, India	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL												Rameswaram Island located on the southeast coast of India bounded by Gulf of Mannar (GoM) on the south and Palk Bay (PB) on the north, respectively, is unique in nature. The southeastern part of Rameswaram Island known as Dhanushkodi foreland is a long sand spit of about 20 km length. Shoreline erosion/accretion rates are computed based on End-Point Rate, Linear Regression Rate and Net Shoreline Change from Indian Remote sensing Satellite, Linear Imaging Self scanning Sensor III images from 1998 to 2012. Along the PB coast of Dhanushkodi foreland, eroding shorelines are dominant except Arichamunai, whereas it is reversing along GoM. Inter-annual shoreline change revealed that changing trend and stability of Island are affirmed with statistical approaches. An equilibrium shoreline trend is noticed on both the sides of Dhanushkodi foreland. Annual shoreline change rate indicates erosion and accretion in northern and southern coastline of Dhanushkodi foreland varies, respectively.																	1010-6049	1752-0762				MAY 28	2015	30	5					520	531		10.1080/10106049.2014.937465								WOS:000354112800003

In this study, sampling methodology, collection of field and laboratory spectral signatures and post-processing methodologies were investigated for developing an exclusive spectral library of mangrove species using hyperspectral spectroscopic techniques. Canopy level field spectra and leaf level laboratory spectra were collected for 34 species (25 true and 9 associated mangroves) from two different mangrove ecosystems of the Indian east coast. Post-processing steps such as removal of water vapour absorption bands, correction of drifts which occur due to the thermal properties of the instrument during data collection and smoothing of spectra for its further utilisation were applied on collected spectra. The processed spectra were then compiled as spectral library.																	1010-6049	1752-0762				MAY 28	2015	30	5					580	599		10.1080/10106049.2014.985743								WOS:000354112800007

In this paper we apply multidisciplinary analysis (morphotectonic indices, neotectonic mapping, geophysical surveys and remote sensing techniques) to map the recently-recognized east-west trending Pineios River normal fault zone with a high degree of accuracy, and to better understand its contribution to the evolution of the ancient region of Elis during Holocene time. Fault activity seems to be related to frequent changes in river flow patterns and to displacements of the nearby shoreline. We argue that fault activity is the main reason for migration of Pineios river mouth as documented for several time periods during historical time. Quantitative constraints on deformation caused by the faulting were applied through the application of the morphotectonic indices proposed in this paper, including drainage network asymmetry and sinuosity, and mountain front sinuosity, all of which indicate that this is a highly active structure. Slip rates calculated to be as high as 0.48 mm/yr for the last 209 ka (based on previously published dating) were verified by applied geophysical methods. The fault surface discontinuity was identified at depth using vertical electrical resistivity measurements and depositional layers of different resistivity were found to be clearly offset. Displacement increases toward the west, reaching an observed maximum of 110 m. The most spectacular landform alteration due to surface deformation is the north-south migration of the river estuary into completely different open sea areas during the late Quaternary, mainly during the Holocene. The sediment transport path has been altered several times due to these changes in river geometry with and the most recent seeming to have occurred almost 2000 years ago. The river estuary migrated to its contemporary position along the southern coast, settled on the hanging wall, inducing retrograding of the northern coast, and settled on the foot wall, with rates reaching the order of 0.52 m/yr, as concluded from historical and recently-acquired remote sensing data.

J	Armitage, AR; Highfield, WE; Brody, SD; Louchouarn, P				Armitage, Anna R.; Highfield, Wesley E.; Brody, Samuel D.; Louchouarn, Patrick			The Contribution of Mangrove Expansion to Salt Marsh Loss on the Texas Gulf Coast	PLOS ONE												Landscape-level shifts in plant species distribution and abundance can fundamentally change the ecology of an ecosystem. Such shifts are occurring within mangrove-marsh ecotones, where over the last few decades, relatively mild winters have led to mangrove expansion into areas previously occupied by salt marsh plants. On the Texas (USA) coast of the western Gulf of Mexico, most cases of mangrove expansion have been documented within specific bays or watersheds. Based on this body of relatively small-scale work and broader global patterns of mangrove expansion, we hypothesized that there has been a recent regional-level displacement of salt marshes by mangroves. We classified Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper images using artificial neural networks to quantify black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) expansion and salt marsh (Spartina alterniflora and other grass and forb species) loss over 20 years across the entire Texas coast. Between 1990 and 2010, mangrove area grew by 16.1 km(2), a 74% increase. Concurrently, salt marsh area decreased by 77.8 km(2), a 24% net loss. Only 6% of that loss was attributable to mangrove expansion; most salt marsh was lost due to conversion to tidal flats or water, likely a result of relative sea level rise. Our research confirmed that mangroves are expanding and, in some instances, displacing salt marshes at certain locations. However, this shift is not widespread when analyzed at a larger, regional level. Rather, local, relative sea level rise was indirectly implicated as another important driver causing regional-level salt marsh loss. Climate change is expected to accelerate both sea level rise and mangrove expansion; these mechanisms are likely to interact synergistically and contribute to salt marsh loss.																	1932-6203					MAY 6	2015	10	5							UNSP e0125404	10.1371/journal.pone.0125404								WOS:000354049700066	25946132					
J	Brook, A; Ben-Dor, E				Brook, Anna; Ben-Dor, Eyal			Supervised Vicarious Calibration (SVC) of Multi-Source Hyperspectral Remote-Sensing Data	REMOTE SENSING												Introduced in 2011, the supervised vicarious calibration (SVC) approach is a promising approach to radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction of airborne hyperspectral (HRS) data. This paper presents a comprehensive study by which the SVC method has been systematically examined and a complete protocol for its practical execution has been established-along with possible limitations encountered during the campaign. The technique was applied to multi-sourced HRS data in order to: (1) verify the at-sensor radiometric calibration and (2) obtain radiometric and atmospheric correction coefficients. Spanning two select study sites along the southeast coast of France, data were collected simultaneously by three airborne sensors (AisaDUAL, AHS and CASI-1500i) aboard two aircrafts (CASA of National Institute for Aerospace Technology INTA ES and DORNIER 228 of NERC-ARSF Centre UK). The SVC ground calibration site was assembled along sand dunes near Montpellier and the thematic data were acquired from other areas in the south of France (Salon-de-Provence, Marseille, Avignon and Montpellier) on 28 October 2010 between 12:00 and 16:00 UTC. The results of this study confirm that the SVC method enables reliable inspection and, if necessary, in-situ fine radiometric recalibration of airborne hyperspectral data. Independent of sensor or platform quality, the SVC approach allows users to improve at-sensor data to obtain more accurate physical units and subsequently improved reflectance information. Flight direction was found to be important, whereas the flight altitude posed very low impact. The numerous rules and major outcomes of this experiment enable a new standard of atmospherically corrected data based on better radiometric output. Future research should examine the potential of SVC to be applied to super-and-hyperspectral data obtained from on-orbit sensors.																	2072-4292					MAY	2015	7	5					6196	6223		10.3390/rs070506196								WOS:000357596900019						
J	El Bastawesy, M				El Bastawesy, Mohammed			The geomorphological and hydrogeological evidences for a Holocene deluge in Arabia	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Quaternary lakebed deposits have been recorded in different parts across Arabia, which are now drained by the eastward flowing drainage networks from Al Sarawat Mountains. The analyses of digital elevation model (DEM), satellite images, and geological maps show that the lakebed deposits are mainly contained within a great arch depression occupying the trough between Al Sarawat Mountains in the west and the escarpment of Tuwaiq in the east and Hadarmawt plateau in Yemen from the south to Wadi Sirhan depression near the Syrian-Jordanian border in the north. The basins within this mega-depression have been interconnected by tributary flows which was consequent in the northward direction. The conspicuous ridge of Tuwaiq, which extends northward for about 800 km and rises for approximately 200 m above its western floor, has been breached by numerous subsequent deep incised canyons and funnel-shaped cuts carved at different elevations. The formation of several wadi canyons and funnel cuts along the entire extent of Tuwaiq clearly suggests that the breaching of this conspicuous escarpment was sudden and rapid, as the northern outlet of this mega-lake was insufficient to discharge the water. The overflow arms have developed extensive alluvial fans on the Arabian coast; the fan of Wadi Al Batin covered approximately 60,000 km(2) in South Iraq, Kuwait, and northeastern parts of Saudi Arabia. The age dating of the Quaternary deposits in different localities suggests the occurrence of this event between 13,000 and 8,500 years before present; however, the discrepancies could be related to technical issues or the scouring of older bed deposits and its entrainment in the younger deposits of this great flood.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				MAY	2015	8	5					2577	2586		10.1007/s12517-014-1396-9								WOS:000354609000014						
J	Chagaris, D; Mahmoudi, B; Muller-Karger, F; Cooper, W; Fischer, K				Chagaris, David; Mahmoudi, Behzad; Muller-Karger, Frank; Cooper, Wade; Fischer, Keith			Temporal and spatial availability of Atlantic Thread Herring, Opisthonema oglinum, in relation to oceanographic drivers and fishery landings on the Florida Panhandle	FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY												Since 1995, landings of Atlantic Thread Herring (Opisthonema oglinum) on the Florida Panhandle averaged 124mt each spring (April-June) but declined to nearly zero in 1996-97 and 2006. To elucidate causes of recurring periods of low landings, we used generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) to examine the relationship between Atlantic Thread Herring catch in a trawl survey on the west-central coast of Florida and four environmental variables. Chlorophyll-a was significant in the models, indicating a direct relationship between local abundance of baitfish and their planktonic food. Temperature and depth were also significant whereas salinity was not. During 2003 and 2012, synoptic satellite-derived temperature and chlorophyll-a maps were used with the GAMMs to predict monthly spatial availability on the Florida Panhandle fishing grounds (long. 85-88(o) W and depth 12-25m). The predicted monthly availability was significantly correlated with commercial catch rates (Pearson's r=0.26, P=0.004, d.f.=118). We used multiple linear regression (MLR) with lags to describe the effect of river discharge and wind (as a transport mechanism) on surface chlorophyll-a over the Panhandle fishing grounds. Discharge from local rivers was significant in all MLRs, and the Mississippi was only significant as an interaction with wind. We conclude that Atlantic Thread Herring are distributed over the Panhandle fishing grounds based on food availability that is driven by river discharge and eastward transport of Mississippi River plumes. This analysis improves our understating of baitfish dynamics, an important ecosystem component in the Gulf of Mexico.																	1054-6006	1365-2419				MAY	2015	24	3					257	273		10.1111/fog.12104								WOS:000355275100005

Subsurface seeding of surface harmful algal blooms observed through the integration of autonomous gliders, moored environmental sample processors, and satellite remote sensing in southern California	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												An observational study was performed in the central Southern California Bight in Spring 2010 to understand the relationship between seasonal spring phytoplankton blooms and coastal processes that included nutrient input from upwelling, wastewater effluent plumes, and other processes. Multi-month Webb Slocum glider deployments combined with MBARI environmental sample processors (ESPs), weekly pier sampling, and ocean color data provided a multidimensional characterization of the development and evolution of harmful algal blooms (HABs). Results from the glider and ESP observations demonstrated that blooms of toxic Pseudo-nitzschia sp. can develop offshore and subsurface prior to their manifestation in the surface layer and/or near the coast. A significant outbreak and surface manifestation of the blooms coincided with periods of upwelling, or other processes that caused shallowing of the pycnocline and subsurface chlorophyll maximum. Our results indicate that subsurface populations can be an important source for seeding surface Pseudo-nitzschia HAB events in southern California.

Relation between inherent optical properties and land use and land cover across Gulf Coast estuaries	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Land use and land cover (LULC) can affect the watershed exports of optically active constituents such as suspended particulate matter and colored dissolved organic matter, and in turn affect estuarine optical properties. We collected optical data from six estuaries in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico with different watershed LULC characteristics and investigated how estuarine optical properties varied across these systems. Differences in LULC corresponded with significant differences in the estuarine inherent optical properties and specific inherent optical properties (SIOPs), which are known surrogates for phytoplankton cell size, organic particle concentration, and the amount of terrigenous dissolved organic carbon. The results indicated that increasing proportions of developed land use (urban+agriculture) in the watersheds resulted in a linear increase in light attenuation in the estuaries primarily through increased absorption by phytoplankton. Estuarine SIOPs were also linearly related to the proportion of developed land. These findings were used to demonstrate how improved knowledge of the factors regulating estuarine SIOPs may be used to increase the accuracy of semianalytical ocean color remote sensing algorithms in optically complex estuaries.

Could those decline be alleviated by deploying artificial reefs (ARs) in suitable areas? This study investigates effects of a big project conducted in December 2007 that deployed ARs in the southwestern part of Daya Bay. The ARs cover a total dimension of 966.10 x 2850.60 m(2) and surface area of 91,500 m2. This study analyzed the spatial and temporal variations of ecological factors, including Chlorophyll a concentrations (Chl-a), nutrients, attaching organisms and nekton resources, on and around the ARs using both satellite (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, MODIS) and in situ data. Results showed that the potential affected area of ARs in Daya Bay reached a distance of 4.9 km in the water depth of 12.0-15.2 m. In the study area, Chl-a level reached 2.93 mg m(-2) during the post-AR period (2008-2012), that was higher than the pre-AR period (2002-2007) (2.37 mg m(-2)). Nekton biomass increased by 4.66-16.22 times compared with that in the pre-AR survey, and the species diversity increased by 15%-23%. This parallel trend suggested that ARs might have contribution to the increase in nekton biomass. Long-term observations shall be conducted to understand the response of phytoplankton to ARs.

The main goals of this research are focused on the monitoring of land cover and mangrove spatial changes particularly for the Mundra forest in the western coast of Gujarat state, India, which is famous for its unique mangrove bio-diversity. The multi-temporal Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) Linear Imaging Self Scanning (LISS)-II (IRS-1B) and III (IRS 136/RESOURCESAT-1) images captured in the year 1994 and 2010 were utilized for the spatio-temporal analysis of the area. The land cover and mangrove density was estimated by a unique hybrid classification which consists of K means unsupervised following maximum likelihood classification (MLC) supervised classification-based approach. The vegetation and non-vegetation layers has been extracted and separated by unsupervised classification technique while the training-based MLC was applied on the separated vegetation and nonvegetation classes to classify them into 11 land use/land cover classes, The climatic variables of the area involves wind, temperature, dew point, precipitation, and mean sea level investigated for the period of 17 years over the site. To understand the driving factors, the anthropogenic variables were also taken into account such as historical population datasets. The overall analysis indicates a significant change in the frequency and magnitude of sea-level rise from 1994 to 2010. The analysis of the meteorological variables indicates a high pressure and changes in mangrove density during the 17 years of time, which reveals that if appropriate actions are not initiated soon, the Mundra mangroves might become the victims of climate change-induced habitat loss. After analyzing all the factors, some recommendations and suggestions are provided for effective mangrove conservation and resilience, which could be used by forest official to protect this precious ecosystem.

Temporal evolution of patterns and processes related to subsidence of the coastal area surrounding the Bevan River mouth (Northern Adriatic) - Italy	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Subsidence is a widespread phenomenon in the Emilia-Romagna, particularly important along the littoral because the coastal system consists of sandy beaches and coastal wetlands, particularly in the area of the Delta Po Plain. The coasts are affected by a marked natural subsidence, because of tectonic processes and recent sediments consolidation. Since the second half of the last century, the subsidence in coastal area has increased significantly due to intense human activity, namely gas extraction and groundwater exploitation. The work presented in this paper aimed at investigating the temporal evolution of patterns and processes on a stretch of coast located between Lido di Dante and Lido di Classe, including the mouth of the Bevano river near Ravenna (Italy), using remotely sensed datasets. An innovative integration of remote sensing and monitoring method (Permanent Scatter Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar PSInSAR, Small BAeline Subset - SBAS and Empirical Orthogonal Function - EOF analysis of 20 years of Landsat) has been used to study the temporal evolution of subsidence and its correlation with natural and anthropogenic causes. Results show an increase of the subsidence rates obtained for the last decade: the amount of subsidence due only to natural causes is typically a few millimetres per year, while the man-induced subsidence reaches values of several millimetres per years. Marshlands reclamation, groundwater pumping for agricultural and industrial purposes and methane extraction from gas fields near the coastline are the principal anthropogenic causes. Subsidence in combination with sea level rise will get worse inundation risk from the rivers and widens the coastal areas affected by storm surges and tidal inundation. This makes subsidence an insidious threat having significant cumulative effects on flood risk or the integrity of water defenses and infrastructure. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Rani, NNVS; Satyanarayana, ANV; Bhaskaran, PK				Rani, N. N. V. Sudha; Satyanarayana, A. N. V.; Bhaskaran, Prasad Kumar			Coastal vulnerability assessment studies over India: a review	NATURAL HAZARDS												Coastal areas are one of the key systems for global sustainability. These are the transition areas between land and sea. Coastal regions gained importance because of multiple uses, like high productivity of the ecosystem, highly concentrated population, industrial friendly, waste disposal, tourism, transportation, strategic planning in military and many more. These coasts are always in a dynamic state trying to change, and nature always works for maintaining the equilibrium. India, with most diverse ecosystem, high productivity and thickly populated over coastal region, has gained its very own importance. Despite all of these, Indian coasts are under threat due to multiple stresses like global climate change and human intervention. These stresses are driving vulnerabilities like sea-level rise, coastal erosion, frequent extreme events, and saltwater encroachment. In this critical scenario, coastal management has become one of the very important issues in the last two decades. Thus, coastal vulnerability assessment methods have been developed to identify and manage the vulnerable areas over the coast. In the present review, we focussed on different vulnerabilities to coast of India and one of the assessment methods, coastal vulnerability index methodology, applied over India. Vulnerability assessment is the process where we identify the problem, quantify it, and assess the risk rate in formulating development strategies to reduce the risk and vulnerabilities. Proper planning and protection strategies for Indian coast must be taken swiftly by the coastal management and policy makers to safeguard coastal ecosystem and livelihoods. In recent years, there has been much focus on coastal vulnerability assessments using various kinds of data. Most of the reported studies over Indian coast are based on remote sensing and GIS methods.					nalakurthi n v, sudha rani/0000-0002-3496-9077												0921-030X	1573-0840				MAY	2015	77	1					405	428		10.1007/s11069-015-1597-x								WOS:000352224900024

Both commercial and scientific communities are indeed seeking to provide services that could "connect the dots" among in situ and remote observations, numerical ocean modelling, and fisheries. In the Mediterranean Sea and, in particular, in the Sicily Channel the reproductive strategy of the European Anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) is strongly influenced by the oceanographic patterns, which are often visible in sea surface temperature satellite data. Based on these experimental evidences, we propose here a more general approach where the role of ocean currents, wind effects, and mesoscale activity are tied together. To investigate how these features affect anchovy larvae distribution, we pair ichthyoplankton observations to a wide remote sensing data set, and to Lagrangian numerical simulations for larval transport. Our analysis shows that while the wind-induced coastal current is able to transport anchovy larvae from spawning areas to the recruiting area off the Sicilian south-eastern tip, significant cross-shore transport due to the combination of strong northwesterly mistral winds and topographic effects delivers larvae away from the coastal conveyor belt. We then use a potential vorticity approach to describe the occurrence of larvae cross-shore transport. We conclude that monitoring and quantifying the upwelling on the southern Sicilian coast during the spawning season allows to estimate the cross-shore transport of larvae and the consequent decrease of individuals within the recruiting area.

To investigate the physical processes during the atmospheric moisture transport of this event, we study the water vapor isotopic composition using surface in situ observations in Bermuda Island, South Greenland coast (Ivittuut), and northwest Greenland ice sheet (NEEM), as well as remote sensing observations (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) instrument on board MetOp-A), depicting propagation of similar surface and midtropospheric humidity and D signals. Simulations using Lagrangian moisture source diagnostic and water tagging in a regional model showed that Greenland was affected by an atmospheric river transporting moisture from the western subtropical North Atlantic Ocean, which is coherent with observations of snow pit impurities deposited at NEEM. At Ivittuut, surface air temperature, humidity, and D increases are observed. At NEEM, similar temperature increase is associated with a large and long-lasting approximate to 100D enrichment and approximate to 15 deuterium excess decrease, thereby reaching Ivittuut level. We assess the simulation of this event in two isotope-enabled atmospheric general circulation models (LMDz-iso and ECHAM5-wiso). LMDz-iso correctly captures the timing of propagation for this event identified in IASI data but depict too gradual variations when compared to surface data. Both models reproduce the surface meteorological and isotopic values during the event but underestimate the background deuterium excess at NEEM. Cloud liquid water content parametrization in LMDz-iso poorly impacts the vapor isotopic composition. Our data demonstrate that during this atmospheric river event the deuterium excess signal is conserved from the moisture source to northwest Greenland.

Coastal vulnerability assessment of Gujarat coast to sea level rise using GIS techniques: a preliminary study	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												Assessing the preparedness of the coastal region to the anticipated sea level rise is a major task among the coastal management authority, where identification of relative vulnerable of coast is a prime concern. The present research work has utilized Remote Sensing and GIS techniques for assessing vulnerability of the Gujarat coast due to predicted sea level rise. Synergetic use of satellite remote sensing, numerical simulations and filed observations has been done to generate coastal thematic information followed by validation. Coastal vulnerability assessment of the entire Gujarat coast on 1:50,000 scale were carried out considering five physical parameters. They are; coastal geomorphology, coastal slope, shoreline change rate, mean spring tidal range, and significant wave height. The rank values of all the five physical variables are integrated through additive method to compute a Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) where the relative ranking is assigned to various coastal segments based on the vulnerability level. The CVI values categorize Gujarat coast into four risk level classes. The results show that 785 km (45.67 %) of the Gujarat coast is under high to very high risk category and 934 km (54.33 %) of the Gujarat coast is under Moderate to Low risk category due to an anticipated rise in sea level. The coastal regions under very high risk category are along northwestern parts of the Gulf of Khambhat, the northernmost parts of the Gulf of Kachchh and western parts of the Kachchh coast. The southern parts of the Saurashtra coast and southwestern parts of the Kachchh coast is under the low risk category along with isolated segments along the eastern parts of the Gulf of Khambhat. The approach developed for assessing vulnerability of the coast to predicted sea level rise using remote sensing and GIS techniques can be used effectively by coastal management authorities and decision makers to devise better coastal zone management plans as well as to ensure efficient mitigation measures to minimize the losses due to possible impact of predicted sea level rise through which appropriate measures to protect life, property and environment can be timely planned.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				APR	2015	19	2					241	256		10.1007/s11852-015-0384-x								WOS:000356537700010

A standard MODIS algorithm for Chlorophyll-a, is used to obtain a variation of phytoplankton with the help of MODIS time series images from April 2011 to March 2012 that describe the situation for a a whole year, we also used periodical data for each three months, i.e., from April 2011 to June 2011, July 2011 to September, October 2011 to December 2011 and finally January 2012 to March 2012. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), products were retrieved from the sensor data that demonstrates the spatio-temporal variability of phytoplankton concentration in the northern Arabian sea near the coastline and open sea water of Pakistan, India, Iran and Oman. High concentration of Chl-a, were observed during two periods August to September and February to March respectively. It was also revealed that Chl-a, concentration was almost identical between the latitude 20 and 21 degrees N throughout the year.																	0556-3321	2070-3368				APR	2015	47	2					797	805										WOS:000355343000052

This extraordinary event provoked a dramatic perturbation of the water column. In order to understand and quantify the environmental impacts caused, a regular multidisciplinary monitoring was carried out using remote sensing sensors. In this context, we performed the systematic processing of every MODIS and MERIS and selected high resolution Worldview-2 imagery to provide information on the concentration of a number of biological, physical and chemical parameters. On the other hand, the eruption provided an exceptional source of tracer that allowed the study a variety of oceanographic structures. Specifically, the Canary Islands belong to a very active zone of long-lived eddies. Such structures are usually monitored using sea level anomaly fields. However these products have coarse spatial resolution and they are not suitable to perform submesoscale studies. Thanks to the volcanic tracer, detailed studies were undertaken with ocean colour imagery allowing, using the diffuse attenuation coefficient, to monitor the process of filamentation and axisymmetrization predicted by theoretical studies and numerical modelling. In our work, a novel 2-step segmentation methodology has been developed. The approach incorporates different segmentation algorithms and region growing techniques. In particular, the first step obtains an initial eddy segmentation using thresholding or clustering methods and, next, the fine detail is achieved by the iterative identification of the points to grow and the subsequent application of watershed or thresholding strategies. The methodology has demonstrated an excellent performance and robustness and it has proven to properly capture the eddy and its filaments.

Based on the hydrological circulation dynamics, reproduction of phytoplankton (leading to the decomposition of organic matter), and other factors, we comprehensively and systematically investigated the generation and dissipation of the hypoxic zone and underlying mechanisms for the seasonal variation in its position, explored the multi-factorial synergistic reactions during the generation and dissipation process of the hypoxic zone, and revealed the controlled mechanism for the morphology and structure of the hypoxic zone's distribution. Our studies indicate that in the winter and spring seasons, the hydrological environment off the Yangtze River estuary provides a water body with relatively low contents of dissolved oxygen (DO), which is the background for the formation of a hypoxic zone. After entering into the summer season, the hypoxic zone gradually develops towards the north and becomes mature. Because of the impact of the terrain, local decomposition of organic matter, and upwelling of the Kuroshio subsurface water in July-August, the hypoxic zone off the Yangtze River estuary exhibits the characteristics of discontinuous distribution in space and has a south and north "dual-core" structure in the inner continental shelf. In addition, there is a hypoxic core in the eastern outer continental shelf. The degrees of hypoxia vary for different areas; they are strongest overall in the north, next strongest in the south; they are weakest on the outer continental shelf. In summer, the hypoxic zone in the north is related to the northward differentiation of the southern hypoxic zone and results from local development and intensification. In August, the hypoxic zone in the north reaches its peak, and after September, it rapidly retreats southward and disappears because of weakening stratification. In the fall, there is hypoxic zone along the coast of Zhejiang in the south, and there is also a low-DO area to the southwest of Jeju Island, with both zones disappearing rapidly. In addition, the change of dynamic environment also causes the low-DO area of the outer continental shelf to move outward in the fall. The variation in the intensity of the stratification and its cumulative effects as a barrier of vertical DO transportation over long periods of time have a significant impact on the degree of hypoxia in the hypoxic zone. In addition, the seasonal variations in the size of the stratified region, intensity of each current system/water mass, upwelling, front, and high-value area of phytoplankton biomass jointly restrict the extension of the hypoxic zone in the inner continental shelf and latitudinal (south-north direction) movement of its location off the Yangtze River estuary. The combined effect of dynamic factors, such as that of the Kuroshio subsurface water, causes a low-DO core in the outer continental shelf. The bottom cold water to the north of the East China Sea is the dynamic basis for the formation of the low-DO area to the southwest of Jeju Island during the fall season. The special seabed topography and mud area distribution off the Yangtze River estuary have a certain degree of influence on the development of the hypoxic zone. The generation and dissipation of the hypoxic zone and its distribution morphology off the Yangtze River estuary, and seasonal variation of its structure and position are a result of the synergistic effects of various factors.																	1674-7313	1869-1897				APR	2015	58	4					628	648		10.1007/s11430-014-5007-0								WOS:000351861700012

Monitoring and trend mapping of sea surface temperature (SST) from MODIS data: a case study of Mumbai coast	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Sea surface temperature (SST) is one of the most important parameters in monitoring ecosystem health in the marine and coastal environment. Coastal ecosystem is largely dependent on ambient temperature and temperature fronts for marine/coastal habitat and its sustainability. Hence, thermal pollution is seen as a severe threat for ecological health of coastal waters across the world. Mumbai is one of the largest metropolises of the world and faces severe domestic and industrial effluent disposal problem, of which thermal pollution is a major issue with policy-makers and environmental stakeholders. This study attempts to understand the long-term SST variation in the coastal waters off Mumbai, on the western coast of India, and to identify thermal pollution zones. Analysis of SST trends in the near-coastal waters for the pre-and postmonsoon seasons from the year 2004 to the year 2010 has been carried out using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) Thermal Infra-red (TIR) bands. SST is calculated with the help of bands 31 and 32 using split window method. Several statistical operations were then applied to find the seasonal averages in SST and the standard deviation of SST in the study area. Maximumvariation in SSTwas found within a perpendicular distance of 5 km from the shoreline during the study period. Also, a warm water mass was found to form consistently off coast during the winter months. Several anthropogenic sources of thermal pollution could be identified which were found to impact various locations along the coast.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				APR	2015	187	4								10.1007/s10661-015-4386-9								WOS:000350685000012	25743152

Operationally, techniques are used to flag contaminated retrievals; however, these techniques are less precise in removing dust-contaminated values. A commonly stated metric of quality for SST daytime retrievals is 0.5 degrees C; thus dust contents that produce errors greater than this value should be of concern. Here we report on significant correlation between potential SST error and observed aerosol optical depths (AOD) that was found in the tropical region dominated by Saharan dust. Utilizing a radiative transfer model with variable dust contents and typical vertical distributions, errors greater than the desired 0.5 degrees C accuracy are observed for dust AODs as low as 0.05. Errors of over 1 degrees C occur with 0.25 AOD. Analysis of the AERONET data from Cape Verde, which includes the Saharan Air layer off the west coast of Africa, reveals that 90% of the days during the boreal summer are found to have AOD amounts that correspond to error greater than 0.5 degrees C. We found that a correction accurate within 0.25 degrees C requires a mean accuracy of 0.1 AOD and proper vertical placement of the dust layer within 250 m. While empirical SST retrievals often have some measure of climatological dust contamination built into them, this work shows that typical variability in dust loadings is a non-trivial error source against SST retrieval goals.

J	Son, S; Wang, MH				Son, SeungHyun; Wang, Menghua			Diffuse attenuation coefficient of the photosynthetically available radiation K-d(PAR) for global open ocean and coastal waters	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Satellite-based observations of the diffuse attenuation coefficient for the downwelling spectral irradiance at the wavelength of 490 nm, K-d(490) and the diffuse attenuation coefficient for the downwelling photosynthetically available radiation (PAR), K-d(PAR) in the ocean can play important roles for ocean-atmospheric circulation, biogeochemical, and ecosystem models. Since existing K-d(PAR) models for the satellite ocean color data have wide regional variations, we need to improve the K-d(PAR) algorithm for global ocean applications. In this study, we propose a new blended K-d(PAR) model for both open oceans and turbid coastal waters. The new method has been assessed using in situ optical measurements from the NASA Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) Bio-Optical Archive and Storage System (SeaBASS) database. Next, the new method is applied to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) to derive Kd(PAR) products, and is compared with in situ measureinents. Results show that there are significant improvements in model-derived K-d(PAR) values using the new approach compared to those from some existing K-d(PAR) algorithms. In addition, matchup comparisons between MODIS-derived and in situ-measured K-d(PAR) data for the global ocean show a good agreement with mean and median ratios of 1.109 and 1.035, respectively. Synoptic maps of MODIS- and VIIRS-derived Kd(PAR) data generated using the new method provide very similar and consistent spatial patterns in the U.S. East Coast region, although there are some slight differences between two satellite-derived K-d(PAR) images (similar to 1-5% higher in VIIRS K-d(PAR) compared with those from MODIS-Aqua in the shallow water region), which are possibly due to differences in spectral bands and sensor performance (e.g., calibrations). Monthly maps of VIIRS-derived K-d(PAR) data for the global ocean are also generated using the new Kd(PAR) model, and provide spatial and temporal K-d(PAR) distributions that show consistent results with those from previous studies. Thus, results show that satellite-derived K-d(PAR) data using the new K-d(PAR) model, e.g., from MODIS and VIIRS, can provide more accurate K-d(PAR) data to science communities, in particular, as an important input for ocean-atmospheric circulation, biogeochemical, and ecosystem models.

The role of elevation, relative sea-level history and vegetation transition in determining carbon distribution in Spartina alterniflora dominated salt marshes	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Spartina alterniflora salt marshes are among the most productive ecosystems on earth, and represent a substantial global carbon sink. Understanding the spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of both above- and below-ground carbon in these wetland ecosystems is especially important considering their potential in carbon sequestration projects, as well as for conservation efforts in the context of a changing climate and rising sea-level. Through the use of extensive field sampling and remote sensing data (Light Detection and Ranging - LiDAR, and aerial images), we sought to map and explain how vegetation biomass and soil carbon are related to elevation and relative sea-level change in a S. altemiflora dominated salt marsh on Galveston Island, Texas. The specific objectives of this study were to: 1) understand the relationship between elevation and the distribution of salt marsh vegetation percent cover, plant height, plant density, above-and below-ground biomass, and carbon, and 2) evaluate the temporal changes in relative sea-level history, vegetation transitions, and resulting changes in the patterns of soil carbon distribution. Our results indicated a clear zonation of terrain and vegetation characteristics (i.e., height, cover and biomass). In the soil profile, carbon concentrations and bulk densities showed significant and abrupt change at a depth of similar to 10-15 cm. This apparent transition in the soil characteristics coincided temporally with a transformation of the land cover, as driven by a rapid increase in relative sea-level around this time at the sample locations. The amounts of soil carbon stored in recently established S. alterniflora intertidal marshes were significantly lower than those that have remained in situ for a longer period of time. Thus, in order to quantify and predict carbon in coastal wetlands, and also to understand the heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of carbon stocks, it is essential to understand not only the elevation, the relative sea-level rise rate, and the vertical accretion rate - but also the history of land cover change and vegetation transition.

In this study, satellite data were used to identify the method for detecting seagrass beds in turbid bay waters and describing temporal changes over the past 24 years. Moreover, we found the cause of seagrass die-off phenomenon by observing the long-term satellite images and evaluating the impact of the typhoon on seagrass beds. All seagrass spectra from different sensors (Landsat TM/ETM+, Aster, Spot-4, and Kompsat-2) have low reflectance in green and high in NIR regions, whereas unvegetated seawater has the opposite spectrum features. A training area in the green band and Mahalanobis Distance Classification algorithm was adopted for classification and mapping of seagrass beds. The error matrix using the in situ reference data for Kompsat-2 image classification was 72.9% accurate. The average area of seagrass beds was 4.6 km(2) from May 1990 to January 2012, and it was consistently >4.0 km(2). A die-off of seagrass beds was observed in September 2012 after Typhoon Bolaven, Tembin, and Sanba consecutively passed the study site. When Typhoon Sanba passed the study site, it had sustained maximum wind speed (147.6 km h(-1)) during low tide, unlike the other typhoons. We found that the water column buffer did not have any effect on resistance of seagrass bed to disturbance, which led to greater damage. Additionally, the three sequential typhoons that passed through during the short time probably produced a cumulative effect. These results allow an understanding of past changes, and reveal the sudden and influential changes in seagrass distribution. As seagrass removal might have negative effect on other associated communities, comprehensive monitoring is required to ensure that disturbed seagrass habitats is recovered naturally.

The dramatic retreatment was observed during the last century. It is basically due to the construction of Aswan High Dam in 1964, which reduced the flow and sediment discharges. In this paper, four Landsat images (two Thematic Mapper and two Enhanced Thematic Mapper) covering the period from 1984 to 2014 were used. These Landsat images were radio-metrically and geometrically corrected, and then, multi-temporal post-classification analysis was performed to detect land cover changes, extracting shoreline positions to estimate shoreline change rates of the Nile delta coast around Rosetta Promontory. This method provides a viable means for examining long-term shoreline changes. Four categories, including seawater, developed (agriculture and urban), sabkhas (salt-flat), and undeveloped areas, were selected to evaluate their temporal changes by comparing the four selected images. Supervised classification technique was used with support vector machine algorithm to detect temporal changes. The overall accuracy assessment of this method ranged from 97% to 100%. In addition, the shoreline was extracted by applying two different techniques. The first method is based on a histogram threshold of Band 5, and the other uses the combination of histogram threshold of Band 5 and two band ratios (Band 2/Band 4 and Band 2/Band 5). For land cover change detection from 1984 to 2014, it was found that the developed area that increased by 9% although the land in the study area has been contracted by 1.6% due to coastal erosion. The shoreline retreat rate has decreased more than 70% from 1984 to 2014. Nevertheless, it still suffers from significant erosion with a maximum rate of 37 m/year. In comparison to ground survey and different remote sensing techniques, the established trend of shoreline change extracted using histogram threshold was found to be closely consistent with these studies rather than combining band ratio with histogram threshold.

Vessels, submersibles, and a host of unmanned platforms, including satellites, buoys, remotely operated vehicles, and in-water instrument arrays, are providing information that helps us better understand and manage activities that affect the ocean, Great Lakes, and adjacent coasts. Platforms and sensors track animals and ship traffic, send alerts to at-sea operators, map the seabed and its natural and archaeological resources, track spills, sample water, and define ocean soundscapes. Technologies are also employed to support complex diving operations, record marine life, document shipwrecks, log data, produce map products, and broadcast live feeds to the world. The sanctuaries frequently work with commercial, federal, academic, and nonprofit partners to focus a broad range of observing assets on the many issues of concern to marine conservation and protection.																	0025-3324	1948-1209				MAR-APR	2015	49	2					178	192		10.4031/MTSJ.49.2.21								WOS:000355064500020						
J	Disperati, L; Virdis, SGP				Disperati, Leonardo; Virdis, Salvatore Gonario Pasquale			Assessment of land-use and land-cover changes from 1965 to 2014 in Tam Giang-Cau Hai Lagoon, central Vietnam	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												This study integrates the use of multi-source and multi-resolution remote sensing, topographic and field-based datasets to quantify land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes along a coastal stretch of Thua Thien Hue Province (central Vietnam). The LULC change analysis involves the Tam Giang-Cau Hai lagoon, the largest lagoon system in Southeast Asia, which is running nearly 70 km along the coast and having about 22,000 ha of water surface. The LULC change analysis was performed by computer-aided visual interpretation for 5 years (1965, 1989, 2000, 2006 and 2014) using satellite imagery from LANDSAT MSS, TM, ETM and 8, ASTER and SPOTS. National topographic maps were also used for the 1965 and 2000 years. To adequately represent the LULC features and peculiarities of central Vietnam coastal areas, an adapted CORINE Land Cover nomenclature was used where new 3rd and 4th level classes were adopted. Due to their intrinsic relative high spatial and radiometric resolution, SPOTS images from 2006 were assumed as a reference for interpretation keys and first delineation. Changes were mapped by editing those vectors representing features which underwent LULC change prior or after 2006. Spatial and temporal changes were analyzed by post-classification approach and validated by ground truth information. High detail object-based classification was finally performed to infer the capability of medium spatial resolution imagery for extracting cadastral scale pond maps. The accuracy of classification was checked by a polygon by polygon comparison with an existing aquaculture facility inventory. Five LULC maps were obtained by applying a legend of 21 classes including two newly defined: "Aquaculture ponds" and "Mangrove forest". The overall classification accuracy of the LULC map is 85% while the KHAT statistics 0.81 for the year 2006. Accuracy of the object-based aquaculture facilities classification is 84% or better for the SPOTS imagery and 47.9% for the ASTER imagery. The study provides a synoptic LULC representation for the largest lagoon system of Southeast Asia and delivers quantitative estimates of main changes occurred during the last 50 years. Moreover, it reveals the adaptability of the CORINE Land Cover method outside European environment. Finally, SPOTS provides good results to map aquaculture features at cadastral scale, even if in some circumstances (e.g. tidal areas), the integration with higher spatial resolution multispectral sensors should be envisaged.

This is the first spatio-temporal analysis of the large tidal weir (LTW) fishery operating on intertidal sand banks along the world's longest mangrove coast, north Brazil. Airborne synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images and aerial photos were integrated with field sampling to investigate catch and discard compositions of seven LTW during the main fishing season. LTW measurements on the SAR images were used to generate estimates on daily catch, wood extraction, and sand accumulation. In a coastal stretch of 67 km, 793 LTW were identified on SAR images from 2004, including 573 active LTW. The number of active LTW in Tapera double dagger A(0) Bay and Caet, Bay had increased from 87 in 1998 to 132 in 2004 (52% increase), and from 92 to 202 (106% increase), respectively. Sixty-five fish species from 24 families were captured in the LTW. Ariidae, Sciaenidae, Haemulidae, and Carangidae accounted for 45, 20, 10, and 7% of the total sampled catch weight of 3441 kg, respectively. The mean daily catch per LTW was 110 kg +/- 9 SE. Total discards in outer estuarine LTW were > 3 times higher than in inner estuarine LTW. All Aspredinidae, Belonidae, Tetraodontidae, and Trichiuridae, and > 75% of Auchenipteridae, Clupeidae, Engraulidae, Ephippidae, Loricariidae, Scombridae, and Soleidae were discarded. The LTW fishery apparently practices balanced harvesting; however, the massive LTW increase suggests fishing effort reduction to moderate levels. Mangrove wood extraction for LTW construction (22 835 m(3) or 855 390 trees) and sand accumulation (144 802 m(3)) likely have only local scale effects, negligible for the overall ecosystem dynamics. The study highlights the potential of SAR images for use in fisheries data collection and management of tropical coasts, emphasizing the need for integration with ground-truthing field studies.

Dust-storm dynamics over Sistan region, Iran: Seasonality, transport characteristics and affected areas	AEOLIAN RESEARCH												The present work examines the seasonality, dust-plume altitudinal variation and affected areas for dust storms originated from the Sistan region, southeastern Iran during the summer Uune-September) months of the period 2001-2012 synthesizing local meteorological records, satellite observations (TOMS, OMI, METEOSAT, MODIS) and HYSPLIT forward trajectories. Dust-storm days (356 in total) are associated with visibility below 1 km at Zabol, Iran meteorological station with higher frequency and intensity in June and July. Monthly-mean composite maps of TOMS and OMI Al show high (>3-3.5) values over Sistan and nearby downwind areas. HYSPLIT forward-trajectory analysis at 500 m for air masses originated from Sistan on the dust-storm days shows that they usually follow an anti-clockwise transport direction at elevations usually below 2 km, initially moving southwards and then shifting to east-northeast when they are approaching the Arabian Sea coast. This is the result of the influence of the local topography and formation of thermal low-pressure systems over the arid lands. It is found that in few cases the dust storms from Sistan affect central/south Arabian Sea and India, while they control the aerosol loading over northernmost Arabian Sea. The Infrared Difference Dust Index (IDDI) images, which represent brightness temperature reduction due to dust presence over land, are used at specific periods of persistent dust storms over Sistan, confirming the main pathways of the dust plumes and illustrating the importance of the region as one of the most active dust sources in southwest Asia.

J	Ghosh, MK; Kumar, L; Roy, C				Ghosh, Manoj Kumer; Kumar, Lalit; Roy, Chandan			Monitoring the coastline change of Hatiya Island in Bangladesh using remote sensing techniques	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												A large percentage of the world's population is concentrated along the coastal zones. These environmentally sensitive areas are under intense pressure from natural processes such as erosion, accretion and natural disasters as well as anthropogenic processes such as urban growth, resource development and pollution. These threats have made the coastal zone a priority for coastline monitoring programs and sustainable coastal management. This research utilizes integrated techniques of remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) to monitor coastline changes from 1989 to 2010 at Hatiya Island, Bangladesh. In this study, satellite images from Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) were used to quantify the spatio-temporal changes that took place in the coastal zone of Hatiya Island during the specified period. The modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) algorithm was applied to TM (1989 and 2010) and ETM (2000) images to discriminate the land-water interface and the on-screen digitizing approach was used over the MNDWI images of 1989, 2000 and 2010 for coastline extraction. Afterwards, the extent of changes in the coastline was estimated through overlaying the digitized maps of Hatiya Island of all three years. Coastline positions were highlighted to infer the erosion/accretion sectors along the coast, and the coastline changes were calculated. The results showed that erosion was severe in the northern and western parts of the island, whereas the southern and eastern parts of the island gained land through sedimentation. Over the study period (1989-2010), this offshore island witnessed the erosion of 6476 hectares. In contrast it experienced an accretion of 9916 hectares. These erosion and accretion processes played an active role in the changes of coastline during the study period. (C) 2014 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).

The salt marshes in the Liao River Delta of China, dominated by Suaeda heteroptera, experienced a dramatic loss in the 1990s and then recovered in the 2000s. This study investigates these changes of salt marsh using a time series of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images acquired in 1988, 1995, 2000, 2004, 2007, and 2009. The classification tree method was used on these TM images to extract S. heteroptera, and an interactive self-organizing data analysis algorithm was used to determine other land cover types. The conversions between salt marsh and other land cover types were described with conversion matrices. The classification results show that, during 1998-2004, salt marsh decreased dramatically at an average rate of 662.68 ha/y. However, during the period 2004-2009, salt marsh recovered gradually at a rate of 115.51 ha/y. The conversion matrix indicates that, from 1988 to 2004, a large area of former salt marsh was directly replaced by man-made landscape types, such as reed field (5111 ha), aquaculture pond (2655 ha), reservoir (1720 ha), and paddy field (729 ha). In contrast, the result for the period from 2004 to 2009 shows that salt marshes were recovered by the conversion of some areas of former barren beaches and river back to salt marsh. Driving forces analysis suggests that salt marsh dynamics were mainly caused by human activities, with the secondary drivers being climatic warming and dry conditions.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				MAR	2015	31	2					371	377		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-13-00056.1								WOS:000350575300014

A total of 15 datasets prepared during 2009-11 covered cruise data and all monthly datasets, nine datasets followed with better results with paraboloid function, and others followed linear, Gaussian, and Lorentzian function regression fits. Data collection through cruises (397 points), monthly (482 points) coastal sampling, total monthly and cruise (879 points) covering four seasons were used, and the three-dimensional (3D)-paraboloid function showed better results during the seasonal scale study with the R-2 values 0.670, 0.635, 0.465, and 0.693 for the postmonsoon, summer, premonsoon, and monsoon seasons respectively. In the current study, there has been considerable improvement in R-2 (0.670 with 236 points) than the earlier study using postmonsoon data (0.560 with 105 data points). Through this algorithm, a nitrate map was generated for 11 March 2011 using Oceansat-2 Ocean Color Monitor (OCM) and MODIS-aqua-derived chlorophyll and SST data, respectively. The retrieved nitrate map has been validated with in situ dataset of the same date with an R-2 value of 0.718, which suggests that the developed nitrate algorithm was statistically significant with mean normalized bias (MNB) = 0.078, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.412, and standard error of estimate (SEE) = +/- 0.4032, and the algorithm was observed to be working satisfactorily over the SW Bay of Bengal region.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				MAR	2015	31	2					398	406		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12-00270.1								WOS:000350575300017

The optical closure was obtained using the radiative transfer model, Hydrolight (Sequoia Inc.). Hydrolight simulations were carried out at all stations using "average particle" Petzold phase function and Fournier Forand phase function with optimum b (bp)/b (p) value. The optical properties derived from Hydrolight simulations were then compared with the measured optical properties. The widely used "average particle" phase function measured by Petzold 1972 for coastal waters was found to provide poor results for most of the stations while for few others it was found to produce results comparable to Fournier Forand phase function. The mean percentage deviation for water leaving radiance (remote sensing reflectance) simulated using Petzold and Fournier Forand phase function for wavelength 488 nm varied from 3.8 to 240.7 % (3.8 to 240.8 %) and 1.0 to 48.9 % (1.0 % to 49.0 %) respectively. These closure studies are essential in strengthening the confidence in models or algorithms developed for ocean color remote sensing and also in better understanding of the marine optical properties of waters of the study area.																	0255-660X	0974-3006				MAR	2015	43	1					163	171		10.1007/s12524-014-0393-5								WOS:000350890300017

The results indicated that thermokarst lake activity had generally increased rapidly between 1969 and 2010. The number of thermokarst lakes had increased by approximately 534, and their coverage expanded by about 410 ha. The two main changes observed were an increase in the number of small lakes and the expansion of larger lakes. These changes are likely the result of persistent climate warming and a gradually increasing imbalance between precipitation and evapotranspiration (P-ET). However, some non-climatic factors, such as the lake-bottom substrate and local engineering activities, have also influenced the lake changes. If air temperature and P-ET continue to rise, the number of thermokarst lakes and the area they cover may continue to increase in the future.																	2095-9273	2095-9281				MAR	2015	60	5					556	564		10.1007/s11434-015-0730-2								WOS:000350571800008

Therefore, monitoring and forecasting of land-cover changes are important components for sustainable utilization, conservation, and development of these areas. This research has been conducted on Igneada, a legally protected area on the northwest coast of Turkey, which is famous for its unique, mangrove forests. The main focus of this study was to apply a land use and cover model that could quantitatively and graphically present the changes and its impacts on Igneada landscapes in the future. In this study, a Markov chain-based, stochastic Markov model and cellular automata Markov model were used. These models were calibrated using a time series of developed areas derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery between 1990 and 2010 that also projected future growth to 2030. The results showed that CA Markov yielded reliable information better than St. Markov model. The findings displayed constant but overall slight increase of settlement and forest cover, and slight decrease of agricultural lands. However, even the slightest unsustainable change can put a significant pressure on the sensitive ecosystems of Igneada. Therefore, the management of the protected area should not only focus on the landscape composition but also pay attention to landscape configuration.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				MAR	2015	187	3							59	10.1007/s10661-015-4322-z								WOS:000349434900004	25647805

An empirical algorithm using the fluorescence line height to retrieve chlorophyll-a concentration was also employed for the estuarine waters. The modified VGPM was applied to MODIS data for primary productivity estimation. The results indicated a higher productivity in summer and autumn. The average values of the primary productivity in summer and autumn were over 300 mg m(-2) day(-1) while in spring and winter, the values were about 250 mg m(-2) day(-1).																	1559-2723	1559-2731				MAR	2015	38	2					506	518		10.1007/s12237-014-9830-5								WOS:000348789300008

To ease the conflict between the growing population and shrinking usable land and to promote regional sustainable development, large-scale coastal reclamation development activities have been performed in Jiangsu Province since 1949. The present study has integrated multi-source remote sensing images during 1974 to 2012 by using a Multi-point Fast Marching Method (MFMM) to extract the Jiangsu coastal reclamation areas for different time periods. The temporal and spatial patterns of the extent and elevation of the reclamation areas were analysed in order to determine the unused potential for future reclamation. It will provide information necessary to support the development and construction of tidal flats in Jiangsu. Results show that: (1) the reclaimed tidal flats along the Jiangsu coast cover more than 19.86x10(4) hm(2), of which 13.97x10(4) hm(2) is located in Yancheng, 4.84x10(4) hm(2) in Nantong, and 1.05x10(4) hm(2) in Lianyungang; (2) the average elevation of the reclaimed Jiangsu tidal flats has gradually decreased over the last 40 years, while those in Dongtai and Rudong have showed particularly accelerated decrease since the 1990s; and (3) in 2012, very few unused tidal flats two meters above the sea level are left along the Jiangsu coast, and mainly concentrated in Yancheng. As there are still reserving some coastal land resources between 0-2 m, providing us with a potential for future development. All of these findings may be useful for researchers and local authorities for the development and utilization of tidal flat resources in Jiangsu.

J	Jones, EM; Doblin, MA; Matear, R; King, E				Jones, Emlyn M.; Doblin, Martina A.; Matear, Richard; King, Edward			Assessing and evaluating the ocean-colour footprint of a regional observing system	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												A recurring problem with point based marine observations is how to scale them up to infer local and regional dynamics, this is especially true of biogeochemical (BGC) variables such as chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and dissolved inorganic nutrients. The recent study by Oke and Sakov (2012) uses a combination of historical satellite imagery, and numerical model output to assess the footprint of physical variables in regional observing system. However, in the absence of long integrations of marine biogeochemical models, there are very few tools to interpret the biological dynamics that may be captured by a regional observing system. In this study, a generic approach to assess the biological footprint of regional observing systems is developed. We used the recently reprocessed gridded chlorophyll-a product (NASA OC3M algorithm) to estimate the spatial footprint of the biological observations of the Australian Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) National Reference Station (NRS) network at intra-weekly, intra-monthly and intra-seasonal timescales. From this analysis, it is clear that the NRSs are only able to characterize variability at locations close (typically within 9-50 km) to the NRS sites at weekly timescales. However, at monthly and seasonal timescales, the NRS footprint is large enough to infer shelf and regional scale dynamics that are representative of substantial portions of the Australian shelf. This is a generic method that can be incorporated into the design and evaluation of regional observing systems where gridded ocean colour products are available.

Traditional methods are required to assess the three parts of losses including cleanup, socioeconomic losses, and environmental costs. It is relatively slow because assessment is complex and time consuming. A relatively quick method was developed to improve the efficiency of assessment, and then applied to the Penglai 19-3 accident. This paper uses an SAR image to calculate the oil spill area through Neural Network Classification, and uses historical oil-spill data to build the relationship between loss and other factors including sea-surface wind speed, and distance to the coast. A multiple regression equation was used to assess oil spill damage as a function of the independent variables. Results of this study can be used for regulating and quickly dealing with oil spill assessment. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Surface current and wave measurement during cyclone Phailin by high frequency radars along the Indian coast	CURRENT SCIENCE												Cyclone Phailin originated in the east central Bay of Bengal (BoB) and crossed into the Indian mainland after traversing through the BoB. High frequency radar (HFR) operated by the National Institute of Ocean Technology could track the surface currents and high wave activity within its measuring limits. The radar data provide valuable information on the surface dynamics during the cyclone period. The HFR observations compare well with those of wave rider buoy. This opens up opportunities for observing the wave conditions during the cyclonic period over longer distances from the shore. This method is relatively more robust as HFR is less likely to be disrupted due to the passage of cyclones, unlike moored systems.																	0011-3891					FEB 10	2015	108	3					405	409										WOS:000350265900016

Oceansat-2 Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) and MODIS-Terra sensors-derived chlorophyll images have been generated over the study area during October 2013. There has been observation of drastic change in the chlorophyll concentration of the north-western Bay of Bengal water with effect of the cyclone "Phailin," which hit Gopalpur, Odisha coast on 12 October night at around 21: 00 h IST. The postcyclone images of Oceansat-2 OCM data and retrieved chlorophyll concentration were observed to be very high, 3.0-4.0 mg/m(3) in coastal water, which was around 0.5-1.0 mg/m(3) during precyclone. Similarly, the postcyclone chlorophyll was around 0.80-1.50 mg/m(3) in the offshore water, unusually high compared to precyclone concentration (<0.60 mg/m(3)). The cyclone track of India Meteorological Department (IMD) has been superimposed on chlorophyll images and observed as proxy along the chlorophyll front with algal bloom features. There has been observation of cooling in the northern Bay of Bengal and off Odisha coast with impact of the induced upwelling, entrainment and mixing of the water column, as evident from the sea surface temperature (SST) data analysis. Interesting features such as cold core eddies and fronts have been visualized. This study is important to assess the impact of Phailin cyclone on ocean productivity on the local and basin scale and its deviation from seasonal trend as well.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				FEB	2015	8	2					539	549		10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2347036								WOS:000352277100010

Surface thermal structure in a shallow-water, vertical discharge from a coastal power plant	ENVIRONMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS												The surface temperature field induced by a turbulent buoyant jet, discharging upwards into shallow water and impinging on the water surface, is examined for the case of a power-plant cooling-water outfall off the southern California coast. The data, acquired using an airborne infrared camera, capture the evolution of turbulent-scale structure, as well as the advection of larger-scale patterns that can be used to infer the surface velocity. Some limited in-water measurements were also made. When the ambient, or receiving, water is relatively stagnant, the buoyant fluid moves nearly symmetrically outward from the impingement zone, and both the thermal and velocity fields decay over a radial distance of several tens of meters. Flow in this symmetric case appears to remain supercritical into the far-field, which differs from a recent numerical modeling study that predicts a near-field hydraulic jump. Within the plume, the data show an expanding set of thermal bands, similar to ring-like structures found in laboratory studies of a buoyant vertical jet having a stable near-field. In the presence of an alongshore current, both the plume and thermal bands become stretched out in the downstream direction; but this effect can be accounted for, and the thermal structure made symmetrical, by using an approximate two-dimensional model of the flow field. Characteristics of the observed thermal bands are compared against three ring-creation mechanisms proposed in the literature (jet vortex instability, horizontal shear instability, and internal bore formation), but the present dataset is insufficient to discriminate amongst them.																	1567-7419	1573-1510				FEB	2015	15	1					207	229		10.1007/s10652-014-9373-0								WOS:000352153200011

Our aim was to test the applicability of different image classification methods of hyperspectral data in this complex situation. To reach the highest classification accuracy, we tested traditional image classifiers (maximum likelihood classifier-MLC), machine learning algorithms (support vector machine-SVM, random forest-RF) and feature extraction (minimum noise fraction (MNF)-transformation) on training datasets of different sizes. Digital images were acquired from an AISA EAGLE II hyperspectral sensor of 128 contiguous bands (400-1000 nm), a spectral sampling of 5 nm bandwidth and a ground pixel size of 1 m. For the classification, we established twenty vegetation classes based on the dominant species, canopy height, and total vegetation cover. Image classification was applied to the original and MNF (minimum noise fraction) transformed dataset with various training sample sizes between 10 and 30 pixels. In order to select the optimal number of the transformed features, we applied SVM, RF and MLC classification to 2-15 MNF transformed bands. In the case of the original bands, SVM and RF classifiers provided high accuracy irrespective of the number of the training pixels. We found that SVM and RF produced the best accuracy when using the first nine MNF transformed bands; involving further features did not increase classification accuracy. SVM and RF provided high accuracies with the transformed bands, especially in the case of the aggregated groups. Even MLC provided high accuracy with 30 training pixels (80.78%), but the use of a smaller training dataset (10 training pixels) significantly reduced the accuracy of classification (52.56%). Our results suggest that in alkali landscapes, the application of SVM is a feasible solution, as it provided the highest accuracies compared to RF and MLC. SVM was not sensitive in the training sample size, which makes it an adequate tool when only a limited number of training pixels are available for some classes.

Monthly level 3 and daily level 1 images of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Satellite (MODIS) derived SST and chl-a from July 2002 to June 2011 around the archipelagic waters of Spermonde Indonesia were used to investigate the relationship between SST and chl-a and to forecast the potential fishing ground of Rastrelliger kanagurta. The results indicated that there was positive correlation between SST and chl-a (R=0.3, p<0.05). Positive correlation was also found between SST and chl-a with the catch of R. kanagurta (R=0.7, p<0.05). The potential fishing grounds of R. kanagurta were found located along the coast (at accuracy of 76.9%). This study indicated that, with the integration of remote sensing technology, statistical modeling and geographic information systems (GIS) technique were able to determine the relationship between SST and chl-a and also able to forecast aggregation of R. kanagurta. This may contribute in decision making and reducing search hunting time and cost in fishing activities.																	0126-6039					FEB	2015	44	2					225	232		10.17576/jsm-2015-4402-09								WOS:000352086200009

Recent advances in understanding Colombian mangroves	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Throughout the last 15 years, researchers at the National University of Colombia at Medellin have studied Colombian mangroves. Remote sensing, pollen analysis of superficial and deep sediments, Holocene coastal vegetation dynamics, sediment dating using C-14 and Pb-210, sampling in temporary plots, sampling in temporary and permanent plots, and other techniques have been applied to elucidate long- and shortterm mangrove community dynamics. The studied root fouling community is structured by several regulatory mechanisms; habitat heterogeneity increases species richness and abundance. Fringe mangroves were related to Ca concentration in the soil and the increased dominance of Laguncularia racemosa and other nonmangrove tree species, while the riverine mangroves were associated with Mg concentration and the dominance of Rhizophora mangle. The seedling and mangrove tree distributions are determined by a complex gradient of natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Mangrove pollen from surface sediments and the existing vegetation and geomorphology are close interrelated. Plant pollen of mangrove and salt marsh reflects environmental and disturbance conditions, and also reveals forest types. Forest dynamics in both coasts and their sensitivity of to anthropogenic processes are well documented in the Late Quaternary fossil record. Our studies of short and long term allow us to predict the dynamics of mangroves under different scenarios of climate change and anthropogenic stress factors that are operating in Colombian coasts. Future research arises from these results on mangrove forests dynamics, sea-level rise at a fine scale using palynology, conservation biology, and carbon dynamics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Erosional processes and longshore currents present in the submerged beach represent a serious danger for both people and human infrastructures. A proper integration between traditional and innovative techniques can help in the characterization and management of the beach environment. Several different multispectral and hyperspectral techniques were used to retrieve information about the hydro and morphodynamic settings of the Pisa province coast (Tuscany, Italy). Results were validated using about 130 samples collected along the study area, between the mouths of the Serchio river and the Scolmatore canal. The composition of sand samples was evaluated by means of petrographic microscopy and grain size analyses. The same samples were analyzed using an Analytical Spectral Device (ASD) Fieldspec. The obtained sediment spectral library was used to evaluate the differences in mineralogical composition, which can be related to different source areas. Results coming from spectroscopy were compared to those obtained from the petrographic and grain size analysis. Furthermore a multispectral aerial image was used to evaluate sediment distribution along the submerged beach, to map the geomorphic features and to detect the presence of longshore and rip currents. This works suggests that optical remote sensing technique can be profitably used in order to reduce the need for expensive and time consuming conventional analysis. (C) 2015 The Authors.

J	Deepika, B; Avinash, K; Jayappa, KS				Deepika, B.; Avinash, Kumar; Jayappa, Katihalli Siddappa			Impact of estuarine processes and hydro-meteorological forcing on landform changes: a remote sensing, GIS and statistical approach	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Changes in estuarine morphology and landforms (braided islands, mudflats, barrier spits and marshy land) of Gangolli estuary, west coast of India, have been studied using topographic maps and satellite images of the last 45 years (1967-2012). The seasonal fluctuations in hydrometeorological (river discharge, runoff, rainfall, relative humidity and temperature) conditions play an important role in morphological changes of landforms. The computed results were recorded no significant relationship (p>0.050) between areal extents of the different landforms (except Is7 and Mf3) and hydro-meteorological parameters. The correlation analysis suggests that similar to 65 % of the landforms show medium (r=0.3-0.5) to high (r=0.5-1.0) strength of association between areal extent versus discharge, runoff and temperature. However, similar to 80 % of the landforms show high to medium strength of association between areal extent versus rainfall and relative humidity. The study confides that gradual accumulation of sediment brought by rivers and eventually drifted into the estuary by waves and tidal currents is responsible for stabilisation and growth of the different landforms such as estuarine banks, braided islands and spits. By contrast, both natural and anthropogenic activities have played a major role in dynamic changes of estuarine morphology and landforms of Gangolli estuary, but human interventions especially construction of harbour, sand mining and reclamation are the most significant factors.

One of the most important water quality parameters that can be assessed in coastal waters and river estuaries using remote sensing techniques is suspended sediment concentration (SSC). It regulates primary production and has substantial influence on the migration of pollutants, temperature, and marine life. In this study, Moderate-Resolution Imagine Spectrometry (MODIS) images were used to retrieve the SSC along the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. MODIS of 250 m resolution data were utilized because they have the highest spatial resolution of all the MODIS bands. In situ data were gathered with multiple campaigns with fast motor boats, while the MODIS sensor was passing over the study area. The goal of this article is to apply artificial neural networks (ANN) to retrieve SSC from satellite remote sensing imagery. ANN function as an intelligent structure to model a variety of nonlinear relationships because iteration-based inversion methods need long computation times for common usage. Using a validation data set and a testing data set, the network could be validated. The learning process was more efficient which resulted in a shorter learning time. The validation data set played a vital role as a stopping criterion during the training procedure to overcome the overtraining problem. A robust relationship between MODIS bands 1 and 2 and in situ data was established based on a three-layer ANN with six neurons in the hidden layer. Root mean squared error and R-2 values for this model were 0.853 and 0.969 mg/L, respectively, for all data. Results of this study reveal that the SSC in the Caspian Sea gradually decreases from west to east.

Greg			Multi-satellite time series of inherent optical properties in the California Current	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Satellite ocean color radiometry is a powerful method to study ocean biology but the relationships between satellite measurements and the in situ ocean properties are not well understood. Moreover, the measurements made with one satellite sensor may not be directly compatible with similar measurements from another sensor. We estimate inherent optical properties (IOPs) in the California Current by applying empirically optimized versions of the Quasi-Analytical Algorithm (QAA) of Lee et al. (2002) to satellite remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) from four ocean color sensors (OCTS, SeaWiFS, MODISA and MERIS). The set of estimated IOPs includes the total absorption coefficient at 490 nm (a490), phytoplankton absorption coefficient at 440 nm (aph440), absorption by dissolved and detrital organic matter at 440 nm (adg440) and particle backscattering coefficient at 490 nm (bbp490). The empirical inversion models are created by minimizing the deviations between satellite match-ups with in situ measurements and between the estimates of individual overlapping satellite sensors. The derived empirical algorithms were then applied to satellite Level-3 daily Rrs to create merged multi-sensor time series of the near-surface optical characteristics in the California Current region for a time period of over 16 years (November 1996-December 2012). Due to the limited number of in situ match-ups and their uneven distribution as well as the large errors in the satellite-derived Rrs, the uncertainty in the retrieved lOPs is still significant and difficult to quantify. The merged time series show the dominant annual cycle but also significant variability at interannual time scales. The ratio of adg440 to aph440 is around 1 in the transition zone, is > 1 in the coastal zone and generally <I offshore. adg440 decreases towards south and towards offshore. The long-term (similar to 16 years) trend in aph440, representative of phytoplankton biomass, shows a significant (P < 0.01) increasing trend in a wide band (similar to 500 km) along the coast and a significant decreasing trends in the oligotrophic North Pacific gyre. The trend of increasing aph440 in the upwelling areas off California is positively correlated with the increasing wind speed along the coast. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
