J	Etzold, J; Munzner, F; Manthey, M				Etzold, Jonathan; Muenzner, Franziska; Manthey, Michael			Sub-alpine and alpine grassland communities in the northeastern Greater Caucasus of Azerbaijan	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: Which are the main sub-alpine and alpine grassland communities in the northeastern Greater Caucasus of Azerbaijan and what are their environmental and anthropogenic drivers? Location: Grasslands at 1800 and 3500 m a.s.l. on northern macroslope of the Greater Caucasus in Azerbaijan near Shahdag Mt. Methods: We established a randomized sampling design with stratification by geomorphology and altitude and validation using remote sensing data. The vegetation survey on 194 releves in a nested plot design of up to 100 m(2) encompassed examiniation of various site conditions. We applied cluster and indicator species analysis for vegetation classification, and indirect multivariate ordination to assess vegetation-environment relationships. Results: We classified 13 unranked communities in two sub-alpine groups and one alpine group, plus the very distinct vegetation around camp sites of semi-nomadic herders. Important drivers for vegetation differentiation are altitude as proxy for temperature, latitude as proxy for orographically founded differences in bedrock and precipitation, aspect, soil factors, such as content of organic matter and variables connected to land-use types and intensity (e.g. pasturing vs hay meadows, browsing tracks). In consequence, also effects on species richness are detectable. Furthermore, we found only partial concordance of our communities with existing vegetation classifications in the Greater Caucasus. Conclusions: A state-of-the-art classification and ordination of regional high-mountain grassland communities and their environmental drivers fills a gap in knowledge about this vegetation. It is widely unknown to international audience and remained almost unstudied during the last 25 yr, when severe shifts in land use remarkably changed the natural conditions. The study can help to identify problems in current grassland management and their consequences for biodiversity conservation. Desirable changes towards sustainable grassland utilization require combined socio-ecological assessments beforehand.																	1402-2001	1654-109X				APR	2016	19	2					316	335		10.1111/avsc.12207								WOS:000374545600015						
J	Lombardo, V				Lombardo, V.			Influence of pre-existing topography on downflow lava discharge rates estimated from thermal infrared airborne data	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL												Remote sensing thermal data of active lava flows allow the evaluation of effusion rates. This is made possible by a simple formula relating the lava effusion rate to the heat flux radiated per unit time from the surface of the flow. Due to the assumptions of the model, this formula implies that heat flux, surface temperature and lava temperature vary as a function of the flow thickness. These relationships, never verified or validated before, have been used by several authors as a proof of the weakness of the model. Here, multispectral infrared and visible imaging spectrometer (MIVIS) high spatial resolution (5-10 m) thermal data acquired during Etna's 2001 eruption were used to investigate downflow heat flux variations in the lava flow emitted from a vent located at 2100 m a.s.l. A high correlation between the downflow heat flux and the lava flow thickness (measured from a pre-existing digital elevation model) was found. Topography beneath the flow appears to play an important role both in lava emplacement mechanisms and flow dynamics. MIVIS-derived downflow effusion rates are consistent with the law of conservation of mass assessing the reliability of remote sensing techniques.																	0956-540X	1365-246X				APR	2016	205	1					122	133		10.1093/gji/ggv557								WOS:000374479800010						
J	Tsai, HP; Yang, MD				Tsai, Hui Ping; Yang, Ming-Der			Relating Vegetation Dynamics to Climate Variables in Taiwan Using 1982-2012 NDVI3g Data	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												This research aims to improve our understanding of vegetation dynamics and associated climate variables in Taiwan by utilizing mean-variance analysis (MVA), relative directional persistence analysis, and Pearson's product moment correlation analysis on the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)-derived NDVI3g data from 1982 to 2012. The results indicate a slightly increasing mean-normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) value with a relatively higher variance during the 1990s and lower variance during the 2000s, which may be explained by the observed fluctuation in precipitation. Additionally, NDVI patterns are identified as increasing in the first half of the year and decreasing in the second half of the year. Spatially, decreasing patterns are observed in all regions except that the northern counties exhibit an increasing NDVI pattern supported by the observed increase in precipitation. Moreover, sunshine duration and temperature are positively correlated with NDVI, whereas precipitation and cloud amount exhibit a negative correlation with NDVI in Taiwan. In the context of global environmental change, this research highlights the utility of applying a combined spatial-temporal approach to remote sensing products. This is an approach with potential applications such as landscape management, conservation practice, and water resource management for policy makers and stakeholders in and beyond Taiwan.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				APR	2016	9	4					1624	1639		10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2511742								WOS:000375868800024

There are nine vegetation types distinguished i.e. wet evergreen forest, shola, semi evergreen forest, moist deciduous forest, dry deciduous forest, savannah, reed brakes, scrub and grasslands using Resoursesat-2 LISS III data. The spatial extent of burnt area found to be highly varying and has been estimated as 7.95 km(2) in 1973, 17.19 km(2) in 1985, 5.51 km(2) in 1989, 9.55 km(2) in 1990, 4.55 km(2) in 1994, 6.89 km(2) in 1996 and 5.80 km(2) in 1999. Analysis of burnt area coverage for recent decade based on 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 reveals fire affected area as 8.10, 4.20, 12.21, 5.52, 3.19, 0.62, 1.81, 2.03, 3.00 and 1.36 km(2) area respectively. Spatial analysis indicates, an area of 47.51 km(2) (19.5 % of total vegetation cover) affected by varying frequencies of fires from 1973 to 2014. High frequencies of fires have been observed in dry deciduous forests and grasslands. Buffer zone of national park has undergone frequent fires which may degrade climax forest vegetation and affects the regeneration and adaptability of indigenous species. Spatial tracking reveals 58.1 % grid cells were affected by forest fires. Overall, there is a declining trend of forest fires indicates management effectiveness in Silent Valley National Park.

J	Zhang, B; Niu, T; Fang, SF; Wu, DY				Zhang Bo; Niu Ting; Fang Shi-feng; Wu De-yan			Research on the Spectral Characteristic of Typical Vegetation in Desert-Oasis Crisscross Zone	SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS												Vegetations in desert play key a role in protecting eco-environment, especially in desert-oasis crisscross zone. Vegetations are of great significance in soil conservation and improving the shear resistance of land. Therefore, they can help to prevent soil from wind erosion and keep land from desertification. Analyzing the spectral data of typical vegetation in desert-oasis crisscross zone by using the hyper spectral technology can be a guidance for remote sensing vegetation classification and serve as the basis for remote vegetation monitoring. In our research, four kinds of typical vegetations have been selected: cotton, tamarix chinensis, Haloxylon ammodendron and Halostachys caspica. The researcher collected series of spectral data of different typical vegetations under different conditions with the help of Field Spec 4 high resolution spectrometer. The collected data was classified, flitted and synthesized with two kinds of transform methods: FDR (First Order Derivative Reflectance) and RLR (Reciprocal Logarithmic Reflectance) transformation. And then three kinds of data were used in further research to analyze the sensitive spectrum band and expression of different vegetation. The result shows that the spectral curve of different vegetations show the same changing trend; different vegetation show different expression in "red edge" with the near infrared band of 780 similar to 1 260 nm. The visible light absorption of vegetation is very strong, and the difference of absorption extent causes peaks and troughs. The "red edge" characteristic is unique, which will carry the proper information of certain vegetation, and the result of different kinds of transformation show that FDR can express the red edge characteristic much better than other ways. At last, three ways were used to calculate NDVI, using the original spectral data, transforming spectral data with FDR and transforming spectral data with RLR Result shows that the NDVI, which calculated by RLR can help to distinguish the type of vegetation with higher accuracy is.																	1000-0593					APR	2016	36	4					1104	1108		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2016)04-1104-05								WOS:000374625000037

G.; Heard, Matthew S.; Jordan, William C.; Sumner, Seirian; Wang, Jinliang; Carvell, Claire			Effects of habitat composition and landscape structure on worker foraging distances of five bumble bee species	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) are important pollinators of both crops and wildflowers. Their contribution to this essential ecosystem service has been threatened over recent decades by changes in land use, which have led to declines in their populations. In order to design effective conservation measures, it is important to understand the effects of variation in landscape composition and structure on the foraging activities of worker bumble bees. This is because the viability of individual colonies is likely to be affected by the trade-off between the energetic costs of foraging over greater distances and the potential gains from access to additional resources. We used field surveys, molecular genetics, and fine resolution remote sensing to estimate the locations of wild bumble bee nests and to infer foraging distances across a 20-km(2) agricultural landscape in southern England, UK. We investigated five species, including the rare B. ruderatus and ecologically similar but widespread B. hortorum. We compared worker foraging distances between species and examined how variation in landscape composition and structure affected foraging distances at the colony level. Mean worker foraging distances differed significantly between species. Bombus terrestris, B. lapidarius, and B. ruderatus exhibited significantly greater mean foraging distances (551, 536, and 501 m, respectively) than B. hortorum and B. pascuorum (336 and 272 m, respectively). There was wide variation in worker foraging distances between colonies of the same species, which was in turn strongly influenced by the amount and spatial configuration of available foraging habitats. Shorter foraging distances were found for colonies where the local landscape had high coverage and low fragmentation of seminatural vegetation, including managed agri-environmental field margins. The strength of relationships between different landscape variables and foraging distance varied between species, for example the strongest relationship for B. ruderatus being with floral cover of preferred forage plants. Our findings suggest that management of landscape composition and configuration has the potential to reduce foraging distances across a range of bumble bee species. There is thus potential for improvements in the design and implementation of landscape management options, such as agri-environment schemes, aimed at providing foraging habitat for bumble bees and enhancing crop pollination services.																	1051-0761	1939-5582				APR	2016	26	3					726	739		10.1890/15-0546								WOS:000374840500007	27411246

This area has been the site for many research projects; however, no project has been carried out for forest fire susceptibility assessment. Thus, protection of the forest including fire prevention is one of the main concerns of the local authorities. This work aims to produce a tropical forest fire susceptibility map for the Cat Ba National Park area, which may be helpful for the local authorities in forest fire protection management. To obtain this purpose, first, historical forest fires and related factors were collected from various sources to construct a GIS database. Then, a forest fire susceptibility model was developed using Kernel logistic regression. The quality of the model was assessed using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the ROC curve (AUC), and five statistical evaluation measures. The usability of the resulting model is further compared with a benchmark model, the support vector machine (SVM). The results show that the Kernel logistic regression model has a high level of performance in both the training and validation dataset, with a prediction capability of 92.2%. Since the Kernel logistic regression model outperforms the benchmark model, we conclude that the proposed model is a promising alternative tool that should also be considered for forest fire susceptibility mapping in other areas. The results of this study are useful for the local authorities in forest planning and management.

In this study, Worldview-2 (WV-2) imagery was combined with field sampling to demonstrate the capability of mapping species type, percentage cover, and above-ground biomass of seagrasses in monsoonal southern Thailand. A high accuracy positioning technique, involving the Real Time Kinematic (RTK) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), was used to record field sample data positions and reduce uncertainties in matching locations between satellite and field data sets. Our results showed high accuracy (90.67%) in mapping seagrass distribution and moderate accuracies for mapping percentage cover and species type (73.74% and 75.00%, respectively). Seagrass species type mapping was successfully achieved despite discrimination confusion among Halophila ovalis, Thalassia hemprichii, and Enhalus acoroides species with greater than 50% cover. The green, yellow, and near infrared spectral channels ofWV-2 were used to estimate the above-ground biomass using a multiple linear regression model (RMSE of +/- 10.38 g.DW/m(2), R = 0.68). The average total above-ground biomass was 23.95 +/- 10.38 g.DW/m(2). The seagrass maps produced in this study are an important step towards measuring the attributes of seagrass biodiversity and can be used as inputs to seagrass dynamic models and conservation efforts.

Development of national database on long-term deforestation (1930-2014) in Bangladesh	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												The aim of the present study is to prepare a nation-wide spatial database on forest cover to assess and monitor the land use changes associated with deforestation in Bangladesh. The multi-source data were interpreted to get the forest cover map of 1930, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2006 and 2014. The spatial information generated on total area under forest cover, rate of deforestation and afforestation, changes across forest types, forest canopy density, replacement land use in deforested area and deforestation hotspots. This spatial analysis has indicated that forest cover is undergoing significant negative change in area and quality. We report that forests in Bangladesh covered an area of 23,140 km(2) in 1930 which has decreased to 14,086 km(2) in 2014, a net loss of 9054 km2 (39.1%) in eight decades. Analysis of annual rate of gross deforestation for the recent period indicates 0.77% during 2006-2014. During the past eight decades, semi-evergreen forests show loss of 56.4% of forest cover followed by moist deciduous forests (51.5%), dry deciduous forests (43.1%) and mangroves (6.5%). The loss of 23.5% of dense forest cover was found from 1975 to 2014. Dense semi-evergreen forests shows more negative change (36.9%) followed by dense moist deciduous forest (32.7%) from 1975 to 2014. Annual rate of deforestation is higher in dense forests compared to open forests from 2006 to 2014 and indicates increased threat due to anthropogenic pressures. The spatial analysis of forest cover change in mangroves has shown a lower rate of deforestation. Most of the forest conversions have led to the degradation of forests to scrub and transition to agriculture and plantation. The study has identified the 'deforestation hotspots' can help in strategic planning for conservation and management of forest resources. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Rawat, KS; Mishra, AK; Bhattacharyya, R				Rawat, Kishan Singh; Mishra, Ainl Kumar; Bhattacharyya, Ranjan			Soil erosion risk assessment and spatial mapping using LANDSAT-7 ETM+, RUSLE, and GIS-a case study	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												This paper discusses the application of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) in conjunction with LANDSAT-7 ETM+ remote sensing data, and geographical information system (GIS) to the spatial mapping of soil erosion risk in Jhagrabaria Watershed Allahabad, U.P., India. Soil map and topographical data were used to develop the soil erodibility factor (K), and a digital elevation model (DEM) image was used to generate the topographic factor (LS). The cover-management factor (C) was developed based on vegetation, shade, and soil fraction images derived from spectral mixture analysis of a LANDSAT Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (LANDSAT-7 ETM+) image, and support practice factor (P) was developed by crossing operation between land use/land cover classification map and slope map. Assuming the same climatic conditions in the study area, the rainfall-runoff erosivity (R) factor was not used. The value of K for the study area lies between 0.25 and 0.485, LS values were less than 1.4, and C and P values were less than 1. A soil erosion risk map with five classes (very low, low, medium, medium high, and high) was produced based on the simplified RUSLE within the GIS environment and was linked to land use/land cover (LULC) image to explore the relationships between soil erosion risk (SER) and LULC distribution. The results indicated that the land use/land cover (LULC) having the most succession and mature vegetation are in low-erosion-risk areas, while the barren and fallow lands are usually associated with high-to medium-erosion-risk areas. The spatial maps of the SER has been generated that can be utilized in the policy matter and planning for the watershed studied. This research also implied that the remote sensing and GIS tools and techniques provide the highly promising and important tools for evaluating and mapping soil erosion risk in the Jhagrabaria Watershed.

Mapping Changes in Land Cover Composition and Pattern for Comparing Mediterranean Rangeland Restoration Alternatives	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												The limited amount of studies addressing the long-term effectiveness of restoration actions to combat land degradation is a constraint for current landscape restoration planning and implementation. Remote sensing data provide a unique opportunity for gathering information on the spatial and temporal variability of restoration processes and may contribute to fill this knowledge gap. The aim of this study is to compare different management actions undertaken in Mediterranean degraded rangelands (i.e.dense pine plantations, thinned pine plantations, protection and passive management) by analysing landscape composition and pattern change assessed from object-based classification of aerial photograph of 1954, 1977 and 2006. Results show a clear link between landscape composition and structure and the different restoration actions, allowing comparison between their spatial and temporal dynamics. All restoration actions promoted an increase in woody vegetation cover compared with non-restored areas. However, only protection and passive management favoured the restoration of dense, complex and well-connected patches of native Mediterranean maquis. The proposed methodology is discussed with respect to its applicability for future Mediterranean landscape restoration planning in a wider geographic and ecological perspective.

Large-scale Modeling of Soil Erosion with RUSLE for Conservationist Planning of Degraded Cultivated Brazilian Pastures	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Pasture degradation is one of the major environmental and economic problems of Brazilian livestock production. Based on the estimates of soil loss in 140,297km(2) pasturelands of Goias State and the Federal District, the effects of land use and management and conservation practices on soil erosion by water were evaluated. Soil loss was estimated with the empirical revised universal soil loss equation model under four scenarios of land use and management of pastures and the implementation of terraces. The effects of converting hilly areas into permanently preserved areas were also evaluated. Well-managed pastures planted in terraces and highly sloped areas with native vegetation featured a reduction of 709% in the rate of soil erosion by water in comparison with poorly managed pastures without soil conservation practices. The environmental consequences of pasture degradation become particularly important when they are associated with land use in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes because farmers in these regions are forced to open new natural areas. In addition, the high indices of bare soil in degraded pastures contribute significantly to sediment deposition in rivers and dams. The modeling of soil loss is demonstrated to be an important tool for land use planning and supporting public policies focused on the sustainable use of natural resources. The results of these simulations demonstrate the importance of actions to recover degraded pastures, such as the Federal Government's program known as ABC (Low Carbon Agriculture).

J	Wang, HL; Qiu, F; Ruan, XF				Wang, Haoluan; Qiu, Feng; Ruan, Xiaofeng			Loss or gain: A spatial regression analysis of switching land conversions between agriculture and natural land	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												This article comprehensively investigates the gains and losses between agriculture and natural land in the case of the Edmonton-Calgary Corridor, Canada. Using remote sensing data from 2000 to 2012, factors that drive land-use conversions, including environmental and socio-economic characteristics, are explored. This study also adopts spatial techniques to allow for neighborhood effects from land-use activities in neighboring areas. Key findings include the following: higher land suitability hinders the process of agricultural land abandonment; road density prohibits agricultural land conversion to natural land; the implementation of conservation sites protects land in its natural status; and land-use activities have strong neighborhood effects on nearby regions. Incorporating spatial interactions can generate less biased empirical results and provide more accurate policy recommendations. In addition, an investigation of bi-directional land-use transitions helps to better understand the associated gains and losses between agriculture and natural land and offers further insights into the effectiveness of preservation programs that aim to protect wild space and maintain ecological balance.

Individuals that engage in interspecific aggression often suffer fitness consequences if the benefits of securing resources do not outweigh the risks associated with agonism. In the southern Appalachians, interspecific aggression frequently occurs between chestnut-sided warblers, Setophaga pensylvanica, and golden-winged warblers, Vermivora chrysoptera, a species that is experiencing sharp declines in population numbers. Using a combination of correlative and experimental approaches, we explored two potential explanations for interspecific aggression: interspecific competition and mistaken identity. It is commonly inferred that aggressive interactions are the product of competition due to an ecological niche overlap. However, because these warblers have similar crown coloration and aggressive interactions appear stochastic, aggression may be a result of mistaken identity. First, in 2014, we documented spatial overlap of the two species and measured reproductive success and habitat preference (using remote sensing) of golden-winged warblers. We found that golden-winged warblers that settled among high densities of chestnut-sided warblers were more aggressive, but chestnut-sided warbler density did not negatively influence their reproductive success; rather, habitat structure best predicted reproductive success. Next, in 2015, we tested for misidentification using models of conspecifics and heterospecifics in simulated territorial intrusions. We found that both warbler species were equally likely to both types of models, and that the most aggressive individuals were more likely to attack models. Our results suggest that, from the golden-winged warbler's perspective, sympatry is not detrimental and aggression is probably a function of mistaken identity. Yet, these behavioural interactions should be maladaptive, which may lead to the segregation of habitat types or divergence in crown morphology between species.

Remotely sensed temperature and precipitation data improve species distribution modelling in the tropics	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												AimSpecies distribution modelling typically relies completely or partially on climatic variables as predictors, overlooking the fact that these are themselves predictions with associated uncertainties. This is particularly critical when such predictors are interpolated between sparse station data, such as in the tropics. The goal of this study is to provide a new set of satellite-based climatic predictor data and to evaluate its potential to improve modelled species-climate associations and transferability to novel geographical regions. LocationRain forests areas of Central Africa, the Western Ghats of India and South America. MethodsWe compared models calibrated on the widely used WorldClim station-interpolated climatic data with models where either temperature or precipitation data from WorldClim were replaced by data from CRU, MODIS, TRMM and CHIRPS. Each predictor set was used to model 451 plant species distributions. To test for chance associations, we devised a null model with which to compare the accuracy metric obtained for every species. ResultsFewer than half of the studied rain forest species distributions matched the climatic pattern better than did random distributions. The inclusion of MODIS temperature and CHIRPS precipitation estimates derived from remote sensing each allowed for a better than random fit for respectively 40% and 22% more species than models calibrated on WorldClim. Furthermore, their inclusion was positively related to a better transferability of models to novel regions. Main conclusionsWe provide a newly assembled dataset of ecologically meaningful variables derived from MODIS and CHIRPS for download, and provide a basis for choosing among the plethora of available climate datasets. We emphasize the need to consider the method used in the production of climate data when working on a region with sparse meteorological station data. In this context, remote sensing data should be the preferred choice, particularly when model transferability to novel climates or inferences on causality are invoked.

Spatio-temporal changes associated with natural and anthropogenic factors in wetlands of Great Rann of Kachchh, India	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												Studies about wetlands have been identified as a key component of environmental change. The present study assesses the spatio-temporal changes in the wetlands of the Great Rann of Kachchh, in the Kachchh Biosphere Reserve, India, using remote sensing and GIS techniques. Satellite time-series data from Landsat (1977, 1990 and 1999) and IRS P6 (2006, 2008-2012) were used. The Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) was derived for each year and the layers were manually edited to obtain a high classification accuracy. The analysis found that the area has undergone considerable change from 1977 to 2011. The natural wetland area of 30.6 km(2) was converted to salt pans. An area of about 255 km(2) (41.6 %) of natural grassland was invaded by Prosopis juliflora, which raises further conservation concerns and emphasises the importance of having intervention plans to manage this ecosystem. The highest water spread of 1171 km(2) was observed in September 2011, followed by 2010, 2009 and 2008 in the same month. The present study is useful in planning the long-term management and conservation of the Great Rann of Kachchh wetland.

J	Feng, L; Han, XX; Hu, CM; Chen, XL				Feng, Lian; Han, Xingxing; Hu, Chuanmin; Chen, Xiaoling			Four decades of wetland changes of the largest freshwater lake in China: Possible linkage to the Three Gorges Dam?	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Wetlands provide important ecosystem functions for water alteration and conservation of bio-diversity, yet they are vulnerable to both human activities and climate changes. Using four decades of Landsat and HJ-1A/1B satellites observations and recently developed classification algorithms, long-term wetland changes in Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake of China, have been investigated in this study. In dry seasons, while the transitions from mudflat to vegetation and vice versa were comparable before 2001, vegetation area increased by 620.8 km(2) (16.6% of the lake area) between 2001 and 2013. In wet seasons, although no obvious land cover changes were observed between 1977 and 2003, similar to 30% of the Nanjishan Wetland National Nature Reserve (NWNNR) in the south lake changed from water to emerged plant during 2003 and 2014. The changing rate of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in dry seasons showed that the vegetation in the lake center regions flourished, while the growth of vegetation in the off-water areas was stressed. Rapid NDVI increase was also found in the NWNNR in the wet seasons. The relationships between the water levels and vegetation coverage also showed two regimes in both dry and wet seasons for the pre-Three Gorges Dam (TGD) period (before 2003) and post-TGD period (after 2003). Analyses of long-term hydrological and meteorological data clearly indicated that while local precipitation remained stable, the water level of Poyang Lake decreased significantly after the impoundment of the TGD, which is likely the main reason for the wetland expansion in recent years.

Mapping the structure of Borneo's tropical forests across a degradation gradient	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												South East Asia has the highest rate of lowland forest loss of any tropical region, with logging and deforestation for conversion to plantation agriculture being flagged as the most urgent threats. Detecting and mapping logging impacts on forest structure is a primary conservation concern, as these impacts feed through to changes in biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Here, we test whether high-spatial resolution satellite remote sensing can be used to map the responses of aboveground live tree biomass (AGB), canopy leaf area index (LAI) and fractional vegetation cover (FCover) to selective logging and deforestation in Malaysian Borneo. We measured these attributes in permanent vegetation plots in rainforest and oil palm plantations across the degradation landscape of the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems project. We found significant mathematical relationships between field-measured structure and satellite-derived spectral and texture information, explaining up to 62% of variation in biophysical structure across forest and oil palm plots. These relationships held at different aggregation levels from plots to forest disturbance types and oil palms allowing us to map aboveground biomass and canopy structure across the degradation landscape. The maps reveal considerable spatial variation in the impacts of previous logging, a pattern that was less clear when considering field data alone. Up-scaled maps revealed a pronounced decline in aboveground live tree biomass with increasing disturbance, impacts which are also clearly visible in the field data even a decade after logging. Field data demonstrate a rapid recovery in forest canopy structure with the canopy recovering to pre-disturbance levels a decade after logging. Yet, up-scaled maps show that both LAI and FCover are still reduced in logged compared to primary forest stands and markedly lower in oil palm stands. While uncertainties remain, these maps can now be utilised to identify conservation win-wins, especially when combining them with ongoing biodiversity surveys and measurements of carbon sequestration, hydrological cycles and microclimate.

However, there is a lack of unified methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of nature reserves, particularly in China, the world's most populous nation supporting some of the most valuable biodiversity hotspots in the world. In this study, we conducted a long-term and large-scale analysis of the effectiveness of 20 of the earliest nature reserves established in Hainan Province, an island home to among the highest concentration of plants and animals in China. Remote sensing imagery from 1988, 1998, and 2008 were analyzed to investigate the temporal and spatial changes of natural forests in these nature reserves and surrounding areas. We also conducted transition matrix analysis and principle component analysis to identify the driving factors that affect the protection effectiveness of nature reserves. The results were as follows: 1) During the 20-year period from 1988 to 2008, natural forests coverage of the 20 studied nature reserves dropped 2.34 percentage points, whereas the natural forests coverage dropped 11.31 percentage points in a 0-5 km outside reserve buffer and 9.36 percentage points in a 5-10 km outside reserve buffer, indicating a significant inhibitory effect of the nature reserves on the loss of natural forests. 2) Natural forests coverage dropped in 60% of the studied nature reserves during the 20-year period, suggesting a poor protection effectiveness of these reserves, while the coverage proportion showed some increase (0%/yr-5%/yr) in other reserves. 3) Expansion of rubber and pulp forests as part of a booming economy were the main factors affecting the effectiveness of the nature reserves for conserving natural forests in Hainan Province. The results of this study provide an important empirical basis for the protection of natural forests in Hainan Province, which can be used as a blueprint for nature reserve evaluation in other places in China.																	1002-0063	1993-064X				APR	2016	26	2					208	215		10.1007/s11769-016-0800-7								WOS:000372238400008						
J	Li, BBV; Pimm, SL				Li, Binbin V.; Pimm, Stuart L.			China's endemic vertebrates sheltering under the protective umbrella of the giant panda	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												The giant panda attracts disproportionate conservation resources. How well does this emphasis protect other endemic species? Detailed data on geographical ranges are not available for plants or invertebrates, so we restrict our analyses to 3 vertebrate taxa: birds, mammals, and amphibians. There are gaps in their protection, and we recommend practical actions to fill them. We identified patterns of species richness, then identified which species are endemic to China, and then which, like the panda, live in forests. After refining each species' range by its known elevational range and remaining forest habitats as determined from remote sensing, we identified the top 5% richest areas as the centers of endemism. Southern mountains, especially the eastern Hengduan Mountains, were centers for all 3 taxa. Over 96% of the panda habitat overlapped the endemic centers. Thus, investing in almost any panda habitat will benefit many other endemics. Existing panda national nature reserves cover all but one of the endemic species that overlap with the panda's distribution. Of particular interest are 14 mammal, 20 bird, and 82 amphibian species that are inadequately protected. Most of these species the International Union for Conservation of Nature currently deems threatened. But 7 mammal, 3 bird, and 20 amphibian species are currently nonthreatened, yet their geographical ranges are <20,000 km(2) after accounting for elevational restriction and remaining habitats. These species concentrate mainly in Sichuan, Yunnan, Nan Mountains, and Hainan. There is a high concentration in the east Daxiang and Xiaoxiang Mountains of Sichuan, where pandas are absent and where there are no national nature reserves. The others concentrate in Yunnan, Nan Mountains, and Hainan. Here, 10 prefectures might establish new protected areas or upgrade local nature reserves to national status. Los Vertebrados Endemicos de China y su Resguardo bajo la Sombrilla Protectora del Panda GiganteEl panda gigante(Ailuropoda melanoleuca) atrae recursos desproporcionados para la conservacion. Buscamos determinar que tanto este enfasis protege a las demas especies endemicas de China. La informacion detallada para las plantas y los invertebrados no estuvo disponible, asi que restringimos nuestros analisis a las aves, mamiferos y anfibios para los cuales habia disponibilidad de mapas de distribucion en Birdlife International y en la Lista Roja de la UICN. Usamos los datos de extension de estas fuentes para identificar los patrones de la riqueza de especies. Despues identificamos cuales especies son endemicas de China y cuales especies, como el panda, viven en los bosques. Despues de refinar la extension de cada especie de acuerdo a su extension conocida en el gradiente de elevacion y de mantener el bosque como el habitat determinado para la teledeteccion, identificamos al 5% de las areas mas ricas como centros de endemismo. Las montanas del sur, especialmente las montanas Hengduan del este, fueron centros para los tres taxones. Mas del 96% del habitat del panda se traslapo con los centros de endemismo. Asi, invertir en casi cualquier habitat del panda beneficia a muchas otras especies endemicas. Las reservas naturales nacionales en las que se protege al panda cubren a todas salvo a una de las especies endemicas que se traslapa con la distribucion del panda. Para China en su totalidad, son de particular interes 14 especies de mamiferos, 20 de aves y 82 de anfibios que no estan protegidas adecuadamente. La Union Internacional para la Conservacion de la Naturaleza enlista a la mayoria de estas especies como amenazadas, pero 7 especies de mamiferos, 3 de aves y 20 de anfibios estan actualmente como no amenazadas, aunque sus extensiones geograficas sean < 20, 000 km(2) despues de considerar la restriccion de la elevacion y el habitat permaneciente. Estas especies estuvieron concentradas principalmente en cuatro areas: Sichuan, Yunnan, las montanas Nan y Hainan. En Sichuan hubo una concentracion alta en el este de las montanas Daxiang y Xiaoxiang, en donde los pandas estan ausentes y no hay reservas naturales nacionales. En las cuatro areas mencionadas, si 10 de las prefecturas establecieran areas protegidas nuevas o actualizaran las reservas naturales locales a la condicion nacional, estarian protegidas mas especies endemicas.

Scaling up the diversity-resilience relationship with traitdatabases and remote sensing data: the recovery ofproductivity after wildfire	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Understanding the mechanisms underlying ecosystem resilience - why some systems have an irreversible response to disturbances while others recover - is critical for conserving biodiversity and ecosystem function in the face of global change. Despite the widespread acceptance of a positive relationship between biodiversity and resilience, empirical evidence for this relationship remains fairly limited in scope and localized in scale. Assessing resilience at the large landscape and regional scales most relevant to land management and conservation practices has been limited by the ability to measure both diversity and resilience over large spatial scales. Here, we combined tools used in large-scale studies of biodiversity (remote sensing and trait databases) with theoretical advances developed from small-scale experiments to ask whether the functional diversity within a range of woodland and forest ecosystems influences the recovery of productivity after wildfires across the four-corner region of the United States. We additionally asked how environmental variation (topography, macroclimate) across this geographic region influences such resilience, either directly or indirectly via changes in functional diversity. Using path analysis, we found that functional diversity in regeneration traits (fire tolerance, fire resistance, resprout ability) was a stronger predictor of the recovery of productivity after wildfire than the functional diversity of seed mass or species richness. Moreover, slope, elevation, and aspect either directly or indirectly influenced the recovery of productivity, likely via their effect on microclimate, while macroclimate had no direct or indirect effects. Our study provides some of the first direct empirical evidence for functional diversity increasing resilience at large spatial scales. Our approach highlights the power of combining theory based on local-scale studies with tools used in studies at large spatial scales and trait databases to understand pressing environmental issues.

J	Kindu, M; Schneider, T; Teketay, D; Knoke, T				Kindu, Mengistie; Schneider, Thomas; Teketay, Demel; Knoke, Thomas			Changes of ecosystem service values in response to land use/land cover dynamics in Munessa-Shashemene landscape of the Ethiopian highlands	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Land use/land cover (LULC) dynamics alter ecosystem services values (ESVs), yet quantitative evaluations of changes in ESVs are seldom attempted. Using Munessa-Shashemene landscape of the Ethiopian highlands as an example, we showed estimate of changes in ESVs in response to LULC dynamics over the past four decades (1973-2012). Estimation and change analyses of ESVs were conducted, mainly, by employing GIS using LULC datasets of the year 1973, 1986, 2000 and 2012 with their corresponding global value coefficients developed earlier and our own modified conservative value coefficients for the studied landscape. The results between periods revealed a decrease of total ESVs from US$ 130.5 million in 1973, to US$ 118.5, 114.8 and 111.1 million in 1986, 2000 and 2012, respectively. While using global value coefficients, the total ESVs declined from US$ 164.6 million in 1973, to US$ 135.8, 127.2 and 118.7 million in 1986, 2000 and 2012, respectively. The results from the analyses of changes in the four decades revealed a total loss of ESVs ranging from US$ 19.3 million when using our own modified value coefficients to US$ 45.9 million when employing global value coefficients. Changes have also occurred in values of individual ecosystem service functions, such as erosion control, nutrient cycling, climate regulation andwater treatment, which were among the highest contributors of the total ESVs. However, the value of food production service function consistently increased during the study periods although not drastically. All in all, it must be considered a minimum estimate of ESV changes due to uncertainties in the value coefficients used in this study. We conclude that the decline of ESVs reflected the effects of ecological degradation in the studied landscape and suggest further studies to explore future options and formulate intervention strategies.

Estimation of Soil Erosion Dynamics in the Koshi Basin Using GIS and Remote Sensing to Assess Priority Areas for Conservation	PLOS ONE												High levels of water-induced erosion in the transboundary Himalayan river basins are contributing to substantial changes in basin hydrology and inundation. Basin-wide information on erosion dynamics is needed for conservation planning, but field-based studies are limited. This study used remote sensing (RS) data and a geographic information system (GIS) to estimate the spatial distribution of soil erosion across the entire Koshi basin, to identify changes between 1990 and 2010, and to develop a conservation priority map. The revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) was used in an ArcGIS environment with rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, slope length and steepness, cover-management, and support practice factors as primary parameters. The estimated annual erosion from the basin was around 40 million tonnes (40 million tonnes in 1990 and 42 million tonnes in 2010). The results were within the range of reported levels derived from isolated plot measurements and model estimates. Erosion risk was divided into eight classes from very low to extremely high and mapped to show the spatial pattern of soil erosion risk in the basin in 1990 and 2010. The erosion risk class remained unchanged between 1990 and 2010 in close to 87% of the study area, but increased over 9.0% of the area and decreased over 3.8%, indicating an overall worsening of the situation. Areas with a high and increasing risk of erosion were identified as priority areas for conservation. The study provides the first assessment of erosion dynamics at the basin level and provides a basis for identifying conservation priorities across the Koshi basin. The model has a good potential for application in similar river basins in the Himalayan region.																	1932-6203					MAR 10	2016	11	3							e0150494	10.1371/journal.pone.0150494								WOS:000371993000040	26964039

Use of a Florida Gulf Coast Barrier Island by Spring Trans-Gulf Migrants and the Projected Effects of Sea Level Rise on Habitat Availability	PLOS ONE												Barrier islands on the north coast of the Gulf of Mexico are an internationally important coastal resource. Each spring hundreds of thousands of Nearctic-Neotropical songbirds crossing the Gulf of Mexico during spring migration use these islands because they provide the first landfall for individuals following a trans-Gulf migratory route. The effects of climate change, particularly sea level rise, may negatively impact habitat availability for migrants on barrier islands. Our objectives were (1) to confirm the use of St. George Island, Florida by trans-Gulf migrants and (2) to determine whether forested stopover habitat will be available for migrants on St. George Island following sea level rise. We used avian transect data, geographic information systems, remote sensing, and simulation modelling to investigate the potential effects of three different sea level rise scenarios (0.28 m, 0.82 m, and 2 m) on habitat availability for trans-Gulf migrants. We found considerable use of the island by spring trans-Gulf migrants. Migrants were most abundant in areas with low elevation, high canopy height, and high coverage of forests and scrub/shrub. A substantial percentage of forest (44%) will be lost by 2100 assuming moderate sea level rise (0.82 m). Thus, as sea level rise progresses, less forests will be available for migrants during stopover. Many migratory bird species' populations are declining, and degradation of barrier island stopover habitat may further increase the cost of migration for many individuals. To preserve this coastal resource, conservation and wise management of migratory stopover areas, especially near ecological barriers like the Gulf of Mexico, will be essential as sea levels rise.																	1932-6203					MAR 2	2016	11	3							e0148975	10.1371/journal.pone.0148975								WOS:000371724200014	26934343

This work used remote sensing with the extending contingency-based method to quantify the interchange relationship of land use types, and landscape metrics including spatially nuanced difference at patch level to track immigrants' resettlement impacts at the semi-arid Hongsipu region with decadal agricultural pumping irrigation development in Ning Xia, China. Landsat-TM images acquired in 1989, 1999, 2003, and 2008 were used to study landscape changes in three periods, the earlier development from 1989 to 1999, the middle period in 1999-2003, and final stage in 2003-2008. The results showed the over 50 % landscape area experienced drastic change in each period with heavy immigrants' perturbations since 1998. The nearly natural landscape with 1: 1 area between desert and steppe in 1989 10 years before development, however, became the overwhelming barren landscape with almost 80 % of the study area in 2008, grassland and shrub land almost disappeared respectively, and cultivated land climbed to the third large type from about 2 % in 1989 to more than 16 % in 2008. The landscape became more fragmented, more regular shape with human disturbance spreading from the northwest low mountain and flat basin to the southeast diluvial fan, even high mountain at the end. Although Hongsipu pumping irrigation zone alleviates poor population pressure in the fragile ecological southern mountainous areas of Ningxia, the new artificial oasis creates another possible new ecological risk of the study area. Therefore, besides the economic development, the ecological conservation and restoration measures should be also the primary objectives in order to successful resettlement immigrants.																	1865-0473	1865-0481				MAR	2016	9	1					21	33		10.1007/s12145-015-0228-0								WOS:000375341900002						
J	Zhang, ZB; Ke, CQ				Zhang, Zuobang; Ke, Changqing			Monitoring and analysis of changes in a wetland landscape in Xingzi county	EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS												Wetlands play an important role in water conservation, environmental protection, and biodiversity conservation. Remote sensing is an economical and efficient technique for wetland monitoring which can limit disturbance in sensitive areas and support wetland conservation. In this paper, we used three phases of Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (TM/ETM+) remote sensing images from October 1989, October 1999, and October 2009 to study wetlands in Xingzi County. The images were segmented using the object-oriented remote sensing image interpretation software eCognition Developer 8.64, then segmented images were classified by slope, digital elevation model (DEM) data, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Specific Leaf Area Vegetation Index (SLAVI), and Land and Water Masks (LWM) index to produce land type classification maps. Land use change information was obtained by analyzing the superposition of two classification maps of the wetland area from different years. The results showed that landscape patches in Xingzi County displayed fragmentation in their spatial distribution over time. Based on an index of changes in landscape patches, the fastest growing landscape type is grassland, while the fastest decreasing type is irrigated land. Dominant driving factors of changes in Xingzi County's wetland landscape are population growth and policy changes.																	1865-0473	1865-0481				MAR	2016	9	1					35	45		10.1007/s12145-015-0232-4								WOS:000375341900003

Analyzing the landscape characteristics promoting the establishment and spread of gorse (Ulex europaeus) along roadsides	ECOSPHERE												The International Union for Conservation of Nature listed gorse (Ulex europaeus, Fabaceae), a heliophilous evergreen shrub, as one of the world's 100 worst invasive species. Over the years, multiple attempts have been made for controlling gorse, including biological methods, but they have not been fully successful. This study aims to investigate some aspects that still remain unexplored such as the relationship between anthropogenic disturbances with the spatial mechanisms of species spread. We aimed to fill this gap by analyzing the role of transportation network configurations and landscape context on gorse propagation. We surveyed the presence of gorse in southern Brazilian forest-grassland mosaics by completing landscape-level road transects coupled with remote sensing, to evaluate land use and landscape structure. A binary logistic regression model was performed to test the influence of independent variables (e.g., road orientation, type and category in addition to distance to the nearest habitat patch of forest, grassland and anthropogenic area) on gorse occurrence. Our results showed that the structure of road networks can facilitate the spread of heliophilous taxa like gorse. Specifically, local, paved, NWSE and NS-oriented (which exhibited high light exposure) roads had the highest probability of finding gorse. This suggests that human transportation activity (traffic, road construction, and maintenance) constitutes a significant dispersal agent for the species. In addition, the landscape matrix context also played a significant role; gorse was most prevalent along roadsides close to urban or agricultural areas than to forests and grasslands. No area was completely free from disturbances, such as fire, livestock grazing, and silviculture, in these seminatural landscapes. We concluded that, disturbances affecting small-scale processes, at roadside and adjacent habitat patches, were probably as important factors explaining gorse occurrence as the urban impact. Furthermore, the current work also emphasizes the need of understanding the complexity of interacting factors. Our work has important implications for ecosystem conservation and habitat management, and consequently should be considered a prior step in establishing new approaches for gorse control.

We used point count-based distance sampling survey data and LiDAR-fused CIR aerial photography to model density of the Golden-cheeked Warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia), an endangered songbird, on the 10000-ha Balcones Canyonlands National Wildlife Refuge (BCNWR). We developed a novel set of candidate models to explain Golden-cheeked Warbler detection probability and density using habitat covariates characterizing vegetation structure, composition, and complexity as well as habitat fragmentation, topography, and human infrastructure. We had the most model support for covariates calculated using focal means representing a 3.2ha territory size (100 m radius) vs. 1.8 and 7.0 ha territory sizes. Detection probability decreased with canopy cover and increased with topographic roughness. Golden-cheeked Warbler density increased with canopy cover, was highest at a 7:3 ratio of Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei) to broadleaf tree canopy cover, and decreased with global solar radiation. Predicted warbler densities using 3 min point counts were similar to six estimates from independently collected warbler territory mapping on BCNWR with a mean difference of 6% and a Root Mean Squared Error of 1.88 males/40 ha. The total population size for BCNWR was estimated at 884 Golden-cheeked Warbler males (95% CI 662, 1206) and predicted densities across the refuge ranged from 0.0 to 0.50 male warblers per ha. On the basis of observed habitat relationships, we defined high quality habitat as having at least 60% canopy cover with Ashe juniper comprising 50-90% of the canopy. We estimated 48% of the area at BCNWR managed for Golden-cheeked Warblers was in high quality habitat conditions and identified patches within the lower habitat quality areas (14% of warbler management areas) that had the greatest potential to become high quality habitat with management. Our approach combined robust wildlife surveys with highly scalable remotely sensed data to examine habitat relationships, estimate population size, and identify existing areas of high quality habitat. This method can be applied to other species of conservation interest and can be used with multiple years of remotely sensed data to assess changes in habitat at local to regional scales.																	2150-8925					MAR	2016	7	3							e01220	10.1002/ecs2.1220								WOS:000374896800004

Major land policies have recently resulted in remarkable landscape modifications throughout the basin. The availability of precise regional land cover change information is crucial to better understand the prevailing dynamics and underlying factors influencing the current processes in such a complex system and can additionally serve as a valuable component for modeling and decision making. Such comprehensive and detailed information is lacking for the Yellow River Basin so far. In this study, we derived land cover characteristics and dynamics from the complete last decade based on optical high-temporal MODIS Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series for the whole Yellow River Basin. After filtering and smoothing for noise reduction with the use of the adaptive Savitzky-Golay filter, the processed time series was used to derive a large variety of phenological and annual metrics. The final classifications for the basin (2003 and 2013) were based on a random forest classifier, trained by reference samples from very high-resolution imagery. The accuracy assessment for all 18 thematic classes, which was based on a 30% reference data split, yielded an overall accuracy of 87% and 84% for 2003 and 2013, respectively. Major land cover and land use changes during the last decade have occurred on the Loess Plateau, where land and conservation reforms triggered large-scale recovery of grassland and shrubland habitat that had been previously covered by agriculture or sparse vegetation. Agricultural encroachment and urban area expansion are other processes influencing the dynamics in the basin. The necessity for regionally-adapted land cover maps becomes obvious when our land cover products are compared to existing global products, where thematic accuracy remains low, particularly in a heterogeneous landscape, such as the Yellow River Basin. The basin-wide novel land cover and land use products of the Yellow River Basin hold a large potential for climate, hydrology and biodiversity modelers, as well as river basin and regional governmental authorities and will be shared upon request.																	2072-4292					MAR	2016	8	3								10.3390/rs8030186								WOS:000373627400085

First, observed field survey based spatial patterns of species richness including threatened species are presented to test their linear relationship with remote sensing based DHI (2001-2010 MODIS). Areas with a high cumulative DHI component are associated with relatively high species richness, and threatened species richness increases in regions with frequently varying levels of the cumulative DHI component. The analysis of geographical and statistical distributions yields the following results on interdependence, polarization and change detection: (1) The decadal mean Cumulative Annual Productivity (DHI- [GRAPHICS] < 4) in Northwest China and (DHI- [GRAPHICS] > 4) in Southeast China are in a stable (positive) relation to the Minimum Annual Apparent Cover (DHI- [GRAPHICS] ) and is positively (negatively) related to the Seasonal Variation of Greenness (DHI- [GRAPHICS] ); (2) The decadal tendencies show bimodal frequency distributions aligned near DHI- [GRAPHICS] ~0.05 and DHI- [GRAPHICS] ~0.5 which separated by zero slopes; that is, regions with both small DHI-min and DHI-sea are becoming smaller and vice versa; (3) The decadal tendencies identify regions of land-cover change (as revealed in previous research). That is, the relation of strong and significant tendencies of the three DHI components with climatic or anthropogenic induced changes provides useful information for conservation planning. These results suggest that the spatial-temporal dynamics of China's terrestrial species and threatened species richness needs to be monitored by first and second moments of remote sensing based information of the DHI.																	2072-4292					MAR	2016	8	3								10.3390/rs8030227								WOS:000373627400083

To understand the distributions, change processes and temporal-spatial characteristics of the wetlands of the inland river basin in an arid region (Heihe River Basin, HRB), this paper employed multi-source remote sensing data to facilitate multi-temporal monitoring of the HRB wetland using a wetland information extraction method. First, we performed monitoring of these wetlands for the years 2000, 2007, 2011 and 2014; then, we analyzed the variation characteristics of the spatial-temporal dynamics of the wetlands in the HRB over the last 15 years via the landscape dynamic change model and the transformation matrix. In addition, we studied the possible driving mechanisms of these changes. The research results showed that the total area of the HRB wetlands had decreased by 2959.13 hectares in the last 15 years (Since 2000), and the annual average loss was -1.09%. The dynamics characterizing the HRB wetlands generally presented a trend of slow increase after an initial decrease, which can be classified into three stages. From 2000 to 2007, the total wetland area rapidly decreased; from 2007 to 2011, the area slowly decreased; and from 2011 to 2014, the area gradually increased. The dynamic changing processes characterizing the wetland resources were ascribed to a combination of natural processes and human activities. The main driving mechanisms of wetland dynamic changes include climatic conditions, upper reach water inflows, population, water resources, cultivated area, and policy. The findings of this study can served as reference and support for the conservation and management of wetland resources in the HRB.				westgis.CAREERI, SCI paper/O-2255-2013; Wang, Haibo/P-3026-2015; Mingguo, Ma/A-8087-2013	westgis.CAREERI, SCI paper/0000-0001-5298-1494; Wang, Haibo/0000-0002-1233-4484; 												1996-1073					MAR	2016	9	3								10.3390/en9030166								WOS:000373625500073

We assess the status and trends of key ecosystem services in this region where native forest conversion has accelerated to make way for housing and farm development. This is a mountainous forested area that is valuable for both conservation and multiple human uses including recreation and farming. It contains globally significant natural habitats for in situ conservation of biological diversity. A rapid, qualitative, and participatory approach was used including interviews with local households and experts in combination with assessment of land use/cover remote sensing data to identify and map priority ecosystem services in the Geographic Information System (GIS). Based on the interests of the beneficiaries, eight priority services (food production, water supply, raw materials, soil conservation, water regulation, climate regulation, biodiversity, and recreation) were identified and mapped. The results indicate the current typical spatial distribution of the provided services based on structural characteristics of the study landscape and their changing trends through a comparison of past, present and future land use, and land cover. Although food production and recreation have greatly increased in recent decades, the other services, in particular timber production, biodiversity, and water purification and supply are being gradually lost. The results of this study and of others elsewhere should raise awareness of ecosystem service status and trends and the value of examining these since they provide much of the information to inform natural resources policy and decision making. The declines in supply of key ecosystem services both within and outside the protected area are creating conflicts within communities as well as impacting on the integrity of the area and careful planning and conservation is required to provide win-win opportunities.																	1999-4907					MAR	2016	7	3								10.3390/f7030051								WOS:000373700800003

Species richness representation within protected areas is associated with multiple interacting spatial features	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim To assess the relative effects of the spatial features of protected areas (PAs), and their interactions, on species richness representation. Location Continental America and associated islands. Methods We used a novel dataset comprising species richness estimates for amphibians, birds and mammals for more than 400 PAs in the Western Hemisphere. Using spatial tools and remote sensing imagery, we calculated four spatial features for each PA: size, shape index, fragmentation level and proximity to the closest PA. The relative effect size of both PA spatial features and environmental covariates on levels of species richness, and how they interact, were assessed using generalized mixed effect models. Results Spatial features and environmental covariates explained about 61% of the variation in species richness within PAs, with the magnitude of the effect remaining similar among spatial features and taxonomic groups. While area had a positive effect on species richness, shape index and fragmentation had negative effects. Proximity had a significant positive effect only for mammals and a negative effect for all the taxa combined. PA spatial features showed significant interactions between them and with environmental covariates. Main conclusions We provide the first empirical evidence for the combined and interactive effects of terrestrial PA spatial features on predicting species richness. Our results suggest that the spatial features of PAs have an important effect on species richness and while the magnitude of this effect varies across taxonomic groups, its direction is consistent. Additionally, we show that the effect of one spatial design feature can be amplified or attenuated by that of another. These findings contribute towards a better understanding of the effect of spatial features on the performance of PAs and therefore how best to enhance the spatial configuration of existing and future PAs.

Monitoring and predicting land use changes in the Huai Thap Salao Watershed area, Uthaithani Province, Thailand, using the CLUE-s model	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Deforestation in Thailand is mainly caused by human activities. Because the remaining wildlife sanctuaries are surrounded by community areas, they are sensitive to changes, including the expansion of deforestation for agriculture and settlement-related land uses. This is the case at the study site in the Huai Thap Salao watershed (HTSW) in Changwat Uthaithani, Thailand. A geographic information system (GIS), remote sensing and the CLUE-s model were used to gather and analyze the spatial patterns of land use changes and to predict future land use patterns more quickly and efficiently. Changes in the detected land use in HTSW during the 1988-2007 period revealed that the total forest land decreased by 41.2 km(2) (7.36 % of the forested area in 1988), whereas agricultural land increased by 21.1 km(2) (10.5 %) over this time period, followed by water bodies (13.61 km(2); 491 %) and urban/built-up land (6.45 km(2); 195 %). The CLUE-s model was used to simulate the past land use patterns and to predict future land use patterns over the next two decades (until 2027) with and without any designated conservation (wildlife reserve) area. Without any spatial policy and/or restrictions, the predicted trend was an increased amount of forest land being converted into new areas of agricultural and urban/built-up land in the middle of the watershed area and an expansion of agricultural and urban/built-up land into parts of the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAR	2016	75	6							533	10.1007/s12665-016-5322-1								WOS:000373127400025

Spatial Analysis of a Coastal Area for Conservation and Fishery of Mangrove Edible Crab (Ucides cordatus)	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					14th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)	MAR 06-11, 2016	Sydney, AUSTRALIA	Univ Sydney, Geocoastal Res Grp, Coastal Educ & Res Fdn, JCR				Mangroves are productive ecosystems of tropical coastal landscapes, constituting habitat for many commercial fisheries, as the crab Ucides cordatus. In Brazil this crab holds a major socio-economic importance for artisanal fishery, but with obvious decline on their productivity. In this study we determined and mapped the more suitable mangrove areas for the conservation and fishery of this crab in the Sao Francisco River Estuary (Northeastern Brazil). We applied a Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) in a GIS environment. Ten criteria in total were used, including crab biotic parameters, land use/cover and social factors. Maps of each criterion were produced by GIS techniques with CBERS and SPOT images and by field data. Mangroves more suitable for the conservation of U. cordatus (9.4 km(2)) are near to the river mouth, due to high density and frequency of non-commercial size crabs (NCSC), low density of commercial size crabs (CSC), small crabs and low degree of use for fishery. On the other hand, the mangroves for the crab fishery occurred with a similar area (10.2 km(2)) located farther away from the river mouth, with a high density and frequency of CSC, low density of NCSC, big crabs, medium-high degree of use for fishery and near to the villages. These information and thematic maps can aid government agencies in delineating extractive and fishery exclusion areas, thus contributing to the management plan for this species.

Spatial Variation in Carbon Storage: A Case Study for Currambene Creek, NSW, Australia	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					14th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)	MAR 06-11, 2016	Sydney, AUSTRALIA	Univ Sydney, Geocoastal Res Grp, Coastal Educ & Res Fdn, JCR				Quantifying carbon storage in coastal wetland environments is important for identifying areas of high carbon sequestration value that could be targeted for conservation. This study combines remote sensing and sediment analysis to identify spatial variation in soil carbon storage for Currambene Creek, New South Wales, Australia to establish whether vegetation structure influences soil carbon storage in the upper 30 cm. Wetland vegetation was delineated to capture structural complexity within vegetation communities using Light detection and ranging (Lidar) point cloud data and aerial imagery with an object-based image analysis approach. Sediment cores were collected and analysed for soil carbon content to quantify below-ground carbon storage across the site. The total soil carbon storage in the upper 30 cm for the wetland (59.6 ha) was estimated to be 3933 +/- 444 Mg C. Tall mangrove were found to have the highest total carbon storage (1420 +/- 198 Mg C), however are particularly sensitive to changes in sea-level as they are positioned lowest in the intertidal frame. Conservation efforts targeted at protecting areas of high carbon sequestration, such as the tall mangrove, will lead to a greater contribution to carbon mitigation efforts.

Deforested areas were delineated by satellite image interpretation of forest cover change. A questionnaire survey was conducted for 161 households in six villages within three districts having varying degrees of forest cover changes per capita over a period of 5 years. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze characteristics of households affected by deforestation in their fuelwood and NTFP collections. The characteristics vary with the collection activity examined, either fuelwood or NTFP collection. We revealed that deforestation notably affects villagers whose non-forest fuelwood sources are scarce. People who collected fuelwood in forests after deforestation are more likely to be affected if the remaining forest area per capita near their village is less. In contrast, for NTFP collection, the size of the deforested area per capita near villages is more important than that of the remaining forest area, particularly to those who depend on NTFP collection as one of their main livelihood activities before deforestation. In contrast with much of the literature that has stated that the poor depend more on NTFPs, our results show that the relationship between household wealth and NTFP dependence was more than a simple negative correlation; i.e., the local people's material wealth was not a strong determinant in our NTFP model. The importance of stakeholder analysis and consultation with local residents in impact assessments and natural resource management involving land-use changes has been progressively acknowledged in the academic literature. In this context, we argue that it is essential to identify potentially affected groups among local residents in terms of their fuelwood and NTFP collections in a short-term period widely distributed at the provincial level. The combination of our findings, method applied and existing demographic survey networks in Cambodia provides an approach of identifying the affected residents in a transparent manner.

Reducing shifting cultivation is a high priority for policy-makers and conservationists; however, spatially explicit evidence of shifting cultivation is lacking due to the difficulty of mapping it with common remote sensing methods. To overcome this challenge, we adopted a landscape mosaic approach to assess the changes between natural forests, shifting cultivation and permanent cultivation systems at the regional level from 1995 to 2011. Our study confirmed that shifting cultivation is still being used to produce subsistence rice throughout the region, but there is a trend of intensification away from shifting cultivation towards permanent rice production, especially near protected areas. While large continuous forest exists today only in the core zones of protected areas, the agricultural matrix is still dominated by a dense cover of tree crops and smaller forest fragments. We believe that this evidence makes a crucial contribution to the development of interventions to prevent further conversion of forest to agricultural land while improving local land users' well-being.

J	Hsu, CM				Hsu, Chengmin			Development of a Framework for Predicting Incident Probabilities of All Terrain Vehicle Use Across a Semi-Arid Landscape	APPLIED SPATIAL ANALYSIS AND POLICY												Recreational All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV) activities can fulfill people's needs in physical, mental, and spiritual well-being, as well as provide significant economic contributions to local jurisdictions. Nevertheless, ATV use creates multiple environmental issues ranging from air and water pollution to soil erosion. Accurately forecasting the incidence locations of ATV activities helps to form the foundation for robust environmental management and conservation intervention. However, drivers' behavioral patterns have rarely been investigated within a geospatial context to enhance forecasting ability. This paper presents a novel process for estimating occurrence probability of ATV activities in a landscape near Las Cruces, New Mexico, USA, based on a 5 m-resolution web that unifies information extracted from the applications of remote sensing and GIS technologies. The model is composed of three major aspects: object-based classification and validation for the generation of the trail inventory, parameterization, and logistic regression analysis. Rider behavioral patterns were parameterized by quantifying the relationship embedded in the interactions between riders and the terrain. The model outcomes were then analyzed to portray riding patterns in responding to landscape features. The analyses demonstrated that the involvement of riding patterns, such as tailing of ridge branches and previous disturbances, generated significant results. The application of the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUROC) validation technique results in an accuracy value greater than 0.8. Accurately foreseeing the spatial distribution of possible newly formed places for ATV activities will facilitate the inauguration of sound recreational policies, which in turn reduces ATV impacts on environments and retains welfare of non-motorized tourists.																	1874-463X	1874-4621				MAR	2016	9	1					55	75		10.1007/s12061-014-9129-8								WOS:000372327000004

Unlike satellite imagery, aerial imagery can be captured and processed within hours rather than days. In addition, the spatial resolution of aerial imagery is an order of magnitude higher than the imagery produced by the most sophisticated commercial satellites today. Both the United States Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the European Commission's Joint Research Center (JRC) have noted that aerial imagery will inevitably present a big data challenge. The purpose of this article is to get ahead of this future challenge by proposing a hybrid crowdsourcing and real-time machine learning solution to rapidly process large volumes of aerial data for disaster response in a time-sensitive manner. Crowdsourcing can be used to annotate features of interest in aerial images (such as damaged shelters and roads blocked by debris). These human-annotated features can then be used to train a supervised machine learning system to learn to recognize such features in new unseen images. In this article, we describe how this hybrid solution for image analysis can be implemented as a module (i.e., Aerial Clicker) to extend an existing platform called Artificial Intelligence for Disaster Response (AIDR), which has already been deployed to classify microblog messages during disasters using its Text Clicker module and in response to Cyclone Pam, a category 5 cyclone that devastated Vanuatu in March 2015. The hybrid solution we present can be applied to both aerial and satellite imagery and has applications beyond disaster response such as wildlife protection, human rights, and archeological exploration. As a proof of concept, we recently piloted this solution using very high-resolution aerial photographs of a wildlife reserve in Namibia to support rangers with their wildlife conservation efforts (SAVMAP project, http://lasig.epfl.ch/savmap). The results suggest that the platform we have developed to combine crowdsourcing and machine learning to make sense of large volumes of aerial images can be used for disaster response.

Role of flocculation and settling processes in development of the mangrove-colonized, Amazon-influenced mud-bank coast of South America	MARINE GEOLOGY												The Guianas coast downdrift (northwestward) of the Amazon River mouth is characterized by the periodic migration of mud banks that originate from the Amazon. The characteristic sizes of these banks as well as their rates of alongshore migration have been estimated from remote sensing. However, the physical mechanisms leading to their displacement are not yet fully understood. The present work is aimed at investigating a number of micro-scale processes involved in the coastal and estuarine dynamics of fine sediments, and expected to occur during the migration of mud banks. The relative magnitudes of flocculation, hindered settling and consolidation have been determined. Sampling of coastal mud was carried out during a field survey in 2001 that focussed on the fluid mud layer in the leading edge of a mud bank in French Guiana. Settling column experiments were conducted under quiescent conditions for various mean sediment concentrations in the range of 2.5-110 g.l(-1), which is typical of mud bank concentrations. The time dependent vertical profiles of suspended sediment concentration were monitored using an optical settling tank equipped with 32 pre-calibrated optical sensors. The corresponding settling velocities were deduced from the equation of the conservation of mass. The results show that the timescales of hindered settling and consolidation processes are much larger than the timescales of mixing mechanisms such as tides or propagating waves. The individual floc settling velocities are too small to counterbalance the turbulent mixing induced by breaking waves. Hindered settling, favoured by wave action and by the high background suspended sediment concentrations, is thus an overarching process in wave-driven mud bank migration. This pervasive hindered settling regime is characteristic of the wave-exposed outer and leading edges of mud banks where active mobilization of mud assures mud bank migration. As a result, consolidation is theoretically precluded. The experiments pointed out, however, that additional flocculation and differential settling should enhance sedimentation during slack water and under low wave conditions. We deduce from this that enhanced settling in the inner,subtidal-intertidal, parts of leading edges of banks during such conditions is important in the temporary sedimentation that generates gel-like fluid mud patches and mud bars. These low-energy inner, leading parts of banks form an accreted substrate colonized by mangroves, which further contribute to enhanced settling and rapid sedimentation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Prescribed moorland burning meets good practice guidelines: A monitoring case study using aerial photography in the Peak District, UK	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Upland moors in the UK have been managed for centuries using rotational prescribed-burning, but in recent years there has been contentious debate over its continuing use due to varying effects on moorland ecosystem services. Prescribed-burning should only be carried out using good-practice codes, which include restrictions on the size, location and frequency of burns. Good burning practice is an indicator of management standards and habitat condition in moorland landscapes. However, there has been little attempt to assess management performance with respect to these restrictions. We investigated prescribed-burning on a case-study estate (Howden Moor) in the Peak District National Park from 1988 to 2009 using management maps and aerial photography. The annual area burned (0.9%) was far below recommendations (10%) and patches were in keepingwith the target sizes specified (mean +/- se: 2370 +/- 70 m(2)). The risk of a large or escaped fire was very low, with less than 1% of fires greater than 15,000 m(2). However, only 28.9% of the total burnable area was burned, leaving the rest unmanaged and accumulating fuel. Future guidelines might recommend the application of prescribed-burning across the range of Calluna vulgaris growth phases, to reduce fuel load and promote biodiversity at the landscape scale. We show that vegetation mapping and aerial photography are an effective method for monitoring prescribed burning practice on moorlands. The information derived from such monitoring studies should lead to greater confidence in the standard of prescribed-burning and adherence to good-practice guidelines and requirements imposed by statutory authorities.

The aim of the study was to analyse the condition of non-forest mountain communities: synanthropic communities and natural grasslands. UNESCO's M&B Karkonosze Transboundary Biosphere Reserve was selected as the research area. The analysis was based on 40 field test polygons and APEX hyperspectral images. The field measurements allowed the collection of biophysical parameters - Leaf Area Index (LAI), fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fAPAR) and chlorophyll content - which were correlated with vegetation indices calculated using the APEX images. Correlations were observed between the vegetation indices (general condition, plant structure) and total area of leaves (LAI), as well as fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fAPAR). The outcomes show that the non-forest communities in the Karkonosze are in good condition, with the synanthropic communities characterised by better condition compared to the natural communities.

To protect their diversity and functionality, spatially explicit monitoring systems are needed. In remote areas, monitoring is difficult and recurrent field surveys are costly. By using Lidar or the more cost-effective and repetitive optical satellite data, remote sensing could provide proxies for habitat structure supporting measures for the conservation of biodiversity. Here we compared the explanatory power of both, airborne Lidar and optical satellite data in modeling the spatial distribution of biodiversity of birds across a complex tropical mountain forest ecosystem in southeastern Ecuador. We used data from field surveys of birds and chose three measures as proxies for different laspects of diversity: (i) Shannon diversity as a measure of alpha-diversity that also includes the relative abundance of species, (ii) phylodiversity as a first proxy for functional diversity, and (iii) community composition as a proxy for combined alpha- and beta-diversity. We modeled these diversity estimates using partial least-square regression of Lidar and optical texture metrics separately and compared the models using a leave-one-out validated R-2 and root mean square error. Bird community information was best predicted by both remote sensing datasets, followed by Shannon diversity and phylodiversity. Our findings reveal a high potential of optical texture metrics for predicting Shannon diversity and a measure of community composition, but not for modeling phylodiversity. Generalizing from the investigated tropical mountain ecosystem, we conclude that texture information retrieved from multispectral data of operational satellite systems could replace costly airborne laser-scanning for modeling certain aspects of biodiversity.

This paper simulated and analysed the impact of sediment-trapping dams (STDs, a type of large-sized check dam used to prevent sediment from entering the Yellow River main stem) on hydrological processes, and the study area was located in the 3246km(2) Huangfuchuan River basin. Changes in the hydrological processes were analysed, and periods of natural and disturbed states were defined. Subsequently, the number and distribution of the STDs were determined based on data collected from statistical reports and identified from remote sensing images, and the topological relationships between the STDs and high-resolution river reaches were established. A hydrological model, the digital Yellow River integrated model, was used to simulate the STD impact on the hydrological processes, and the maximum STD impact was evaluated through a comparison between the simulation results with and without the STDs, which revealed that the interception effect of the STDs contributed to the decrease of the streamflow by approximately 39%. This paper also analysed the relationship between the spatial distribution of the STDs and rainfall in the Huangfuchuan River basin and revealed that future soil and water conservation measures should focus on areas with a higher average annual rainfall and higher number of rainstorm hours.

Quantification and monitoring of forest cover changes in Agasthyamalai Biosphere Reserve, Western Ghats, India (1920-2012)	CURRENT SCIENCE												Protected areas need to be monitored regularly to realize the effectiveness of conservation measures. In this study, Agasthyamalai Biosphere Reserve of Western Ghats has been monitored for deforestation in a historic time frame. The study attempted to identify the changes that occurred within the Biosphere Reserve from the early 1920s to the recent by mapping the land use/land cover and quantifying the forest cover changes that have occurred in the Biosphere Reserve individually for each conservation zone and protected area. Multi-temporal satellite datasets and topographical maps were used for mapping the forest cover of the study area. Visual interpretation technique involving on screen digitization was used for mapping and post-classification comparison method was used for carrying out change detection process. In addition, grid wise spatial tracking was carried out for the periods of 1920-1973 and 1973-2012 to prioritize change areas. Results showed that 747.1 km(2) of forests have been lost during the period of 1920-2012. The present study demonstrates the importance of long-term land use/land cover information to examine conservation effectiveness by utilizing remote sensing and GIS techniques to carry out best management practices.																	0011-3891					FEB 25	2016	110	4					508	520		10.18520/cs/v110/i4/508-520								WOS:000370491500018

A review of the role of active remote sensing and data fusion for characterizing forest in wildlife habitat models	REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION												Spatially explicit maps of wildlife habitat relationships have proven to be valuable tools for conservation and management applications including evaluating how and which species may be impacted by large scale climate change, ongoing fragmentation of habitat, and local land-use practices. Studies have turned to remote sensing datasets as a way to characterize vegetation for the examination of habitat selection and for mapping realized relationships across the landscape. Potentially one of the more difficult habitat types to try to characterize with remote sensing are the vertically and horizontally complex forest systems. Characterizing this complexity is needed to explore which aspects may represent driving and/or limiting factors for wildlife species. Active remote sensing data from lidar and radar sensors has thus caught the attention of the forest wildlife research and management community in its potential to represent three dimensional habitat features. The purpose of this review was to examine the applications of active remote sensing for characterizing forest in wildlife habitat studies through a keyword search within Web of Science. We present commonly used active remote sensing metrics and methods, discuss recent advances in characterizing aspects of forest habitat, and provide suggestions for future research in the area of new remote sensing data/techniques that could benefit forest wildlife studies that are currently not represented or may be underutilized within the wildlife literature. We also highlight the potential value in data fusion of active and passive sensor data for representing multiple dimensions and scales of forest habitat. While the use of remote sensing has increased in recent years within wildlife habitat studies, continued communication between the remote sensing, forest management, and wildlife communities is vital to ensure appropriate data sources and methods are understood and utilized, and so that creators of mapping products may better realize the needs of secondary users.																	1133-0953	1988-8740				FEB	2016		45			SI		1	14		10.4995/raet.2016.3981								WOS:000374670200001

Identifying predictable foraging habitats for a wide-ranging marine predator using ensemble ecological niche models	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim Ecological niche modelling can provide valuable insight into species' environmental preferences and aid the identification of key habitats for populations of conservation concern. Here, we integrate biologging, satellite remote-sensing and ensemble ecological niche models (EENMs) to identify predictable foraging habitats for a globally important population of the grey-headed albatross (GHA) Thalassarche chrysostoma Location Bird Island, South Georgia; Southern Atlantic Ocean. Methods GPS and geolocation-immersion loggers were used to track at-sea movements and activity patterns of GHA over two breeding seasons (n = 55; brood-guard). Immersion frequency (landings per 10-min interval) was used to define foraging events. EENM combining Generalized Additive Models (GAM), MaxEnt, Random Forest (RF) and Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) identified the biophysical conditions characterizing the locations of foraging events, using time-matched oceanographic predictors (Sea Surface Temperature, SST; chlorophyll a, chl-a; thermal front frequency, TFreq; depth). Model performance was assessed through iterative cross-validation and extrapolative performance through cross-validation among years. Results Predictable foraging habitats identified by EENM spanned neritic (<500 m), shelf break and oceanic waters, coinciding with a set of persistent biophysical conditions characterized by particular thermal ranges (3-8 degrees C, 12-13 degrees C), elevated primary productivity (chl-a > 0.5 mg m(-3)) and frequent manifestation of mesoscale thermal fronts. Our results confirm previous indications that GHA exploit enhanced foraging opportunities associated with frontal systems and objectively identify the APFZ as a region of high foraging habitat suitability. Moreover, at the spatial and temporal scales investigated here, the performance of multi-model ensembles was superior to that of single-algorithm models, and cross-validation among years indicated reasonable extrapolative performance. Main conclusions EENM techniques are useful for integrating the predictions of several single-algorithm models, reducing potential bias and increasing confidence in predictions. Our analysis highlights the value of EENM for use with movement data in identifying at-sea habitats of wide-ranging marine predators, with clear implications for conservation and management.

J	Denton, RK; Hogan, A; Thomas, RD				Denton, Robert Kenneth, Jr.; Hogan, Ashley; Thomas, Ronald Drew			The Integration of Data Review, Remote Sensing and Ground Survey for a Regional-Level Karst Assessment	ENVIRONMENTAL & ENGINEERING GEOSCIENCE												Detailed karst terrain assessments require the identification and survey of surface features such as closed depressions, sinkholes, and cave entrances. Typically, surveys are carried out at sites encompassing several hundred acres or less; however, the traditional methods have proven impractical from a time and expense viewpoint for extensive, regional-level surveys in well-developed karst terrain. This subject survey covered a 76-mi (122.3-km) length of a natural gas transmission pipeline. The goal of the study was to assist the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in assessing habitat vulnerability for the Madison Cave Isopod, a federally protected threatened species found only in phreatic ground water of the Great Valley of Virginia and West Virginia. The survey used an integrated approach involving the evaluation of topographic maps, digital elevation models, shaded relief maps, satellite imagery, and historic aerial photographs to identify "concentrations" of karst features. Ground surveys were then undertaken by walking sections of the pipeline right-of-ways that occurred within karst concentrations, and documenting the features using GPS instrumentation. The karst survey encompassed 48,640 acres (19.2 hectares), and was the largest utility-associated karst assessment ever conducted in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Approximately 216 closed depressions and 28 cave entrances were located, identified, and described based on their geology, physical appearance, and drainage characteristics. The use of an integrated approach significantly reduced the time and cost of the study. The study's findings and recommendations have been used to develop conservation-based avoidance and minimization measures intended to limit the impact to the species' habitat.																	1078-7275	1558-9161				FEB	2016	22	1					81	92		10.2113/gseegeosci.22.1.81								WOS:000372077100006

Moving Towards Dynamic Ocean Management: How Well Do Modeled Ocean Products Predict Species Distributions?	REMOTE SENSING												Species distribution models are now widely used in conservation and management to predict suitable habitat for protected marine species. The primary sources of dynamic habitat data have been in situ and remotely sensed oceanic variables (both are considered measured data), but now ocean models can provide historical estimates and forecast predictions of relevant habitat variables such as temperature, salinity, and mixed layer depth. To assess the performance of modeled ocean data in species distribution models, we present a case study for cetaceans that compares models based on output from a data assimilative implementation of the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) to those based on measured data. Specifically, we used seven years of cetacean line-transect survey data collected between 1991 and 2009 to develop predictive habitat-based models of cetacean density for 11 species in the California Current Ecosystem. Two different generalized additive models were compared: one built with a full suite of ROMS output and another built with a full suite of measured data. Model performance was assessed using the percentage of explained deviance, root mean squared error (RMSE), observed to predicted density ratios, and visual inspection of predicted and observed distributions. Predicted distribution patterns were similar for models using ROMS output and measured data, and showed good concordance between observed sightings and model predictions. Quantitative measures of predictive ability were also similar between model types, and RMSE values were almost identical. The overall demonstrated success of the ROMS-based models opens new opportunities for dynamic species management and biodiversity monitoring because ROMS output is available in near real time and can be forecast.																	2072-4292					FEB	2016	8	2							149	10.3390/rs8020149								WOS:000371898800052

The fact that fine-scale surveys of grassland plant communities are time-consuming may limit the spatial extent of ground-based diversity surveys. Remote sensing tools have the potential to support field-based sampling and, if remote sensing data are able to identify grassland sites that are likely to support relatively higher or lower levels of species diversity, then field sampling efforts could be directed towards sites that are of potential conservation interest. In the present study, we examined whether aerial hyperspectral (414-2501 nm) remote sensing can be used to predict fine-scale plant species diversity (characterized as species richness and Simpson's diversity) in dry grazed grasslands. Vascular plant species were recorded within 104 (4 m x 4 m) plots on the island of oland (Sweden) and each plot was characterized by a 245-waveband hyperspectral data set. We used two different modeling approaches to evaluate the ability of the airborne spectral measurements to predict within-plot species diversity: (1) a spectral response approach, based on reflectance information from (i) all wavebands, and (ii) a subset of wavebands, analyzed with a partial least squares regression model, and (2) a spectral heterogeneity approach, based on the mean distance to the spectral centroid in an ordinary least squares regression model. Species diversity was successfully predicted by the spectral response approach (with an error of ca. 20%) but not by the spectral heterogeneity approach. When using the spectral response approach, iterative selection of important wavebands for the prediction of the diversity measures simplified the model but did not improve its predictive quality (prediction error). Wavebands sensitive to plant pigment content (400-700 nm) and to vegetation structural properties, such as above-ground biomass (700-1300 nm), were identified as being the most important predictors of plant species diversity. We conclude that hyperspectral remote sensing technology is able to identify fine-scale variation in grassland diversity and has a potential use as a tool in surveys of grassland plant diversity.																	2072-4292					FEB	2016	8	2							133	10.3390/rs8020133								WOS:000371898800025

Floodplain meadows are challenging ecosystems for monitoring and conservation because of their highly biodiverse nature. Our aim was to understand and explain spectral differences among key members of floodplain meadows and also characterize differences with respect to functional traits. The study was conducted on a typical floodplain meadow in UK (MG4-type, mesotrophic grassland type 4, according to British National Vegetation Classification). We compared two approaches to characterize floodplain communities using field spectroscopy. The first approach was sub-community based, in which we collected spectral signatures for species groupings indicating two distinct eco-hydrological conditions (dry and wet soil indicator species). The other approach was species-specific, in which we focused on the spectral reflectance of three key species found on the meadow. One herb species is a typical member of the MG4 floodplain meadow community, while the other two species, sedge and rush, represent wetland vegetation. We also monitored vegetation biophysical and functional properties as well as soil nutrients and ground water levels. We found that the vegetation classes representing meadow sub-communities could not be spectrally distinguished from each other, whereas the individual herb species was found to have a distinctly different spectral signature from the sedge and rush species. The spectral differences between these three species could be explained by their observed differences in plant biophysical parameters, as corroborated through radiative transfer model simulations. These parameters, such as leaf area index, leaf dry matter content, leaf water content, and specific leaf area, along with other functional parameters, such as maximum carboxylation capacity and leaf nitrogen content, also helped explain the species' differences in functional dynamics. Groundwater level and soil nitrogen availability, which are important factors governing plant nutrient status, were also found to be significantly different for the herb/wetland species' locations. The study concludes that spectrally distinguishable species, typical for a highly biodiverse site such as a floodplain meadow, could potentially be used as target species to monitor vegetation dynamics under changing environmental conditions.

J	Rose, ET; Simons, TR				Rose, Eli T.; Simons, Theodore R.			Avian response to fire in pine-oak forests of Great Smoky Mountains National Park following decades of fire suppression	CONDOR												Fire suppression in southern Appalachian pine-oak forests during the past century dramatically altered the bird community. Fire return intervals decreased, resulting in local extirpation or population declines of many bird species adapted to post-fire plant communities. Within Great Smoky Mountains National Park, declines have been strongest for birds inhabiting xeric pine-oak forests that depend on frequent fire. The buildup of fuels after decades of fire suppression led to changes in the 1996 Great Smoky Mountains Fire Management Plan. Although fire return intervals remain well below historic levels, management changes have helped increase the amount of fire within the park over the past 20 years, providing an opportunity to study patterns of fire severity, time since burn, and bird occurrence. We combined avian point counts in burned and unburned areas with remote sensing indices of fire severity to infer temporal changes in bird occurrence for up to 28 years following fire. Using hierarchical linear models that account for the possibility of a species presence at a site when no individuals are detected, we developed occurrence models for 24 species: 13 occurred more frequently in burned areas, 2 occurred less frequently, and 9 showed no significant difference between burned and unburned areas. Within burned areas, the top models for each species included fire severity, time since burn, or both, suggesting that fire influenced patterns of species occurrence for all 24 species. Our findings suggest that no single fire management strategy will suit all species. To capture peak occupancy for the entire bird community within xeric pine-oak forests, at least 3 fire regimes may be necessary; one applying frequent low severity fire, another using infrequent low severity fire, and a third using infrequently applied high severity fire.																	0010-5422	1938-5129				FEB	2016	118	1					179	193		10.1650/CONDOR-15-85.1								WOS:000371609400012

Downscaling Landsat 7 canopy reflectance employing a multi-soil sensor platform	PRECISION AGRICULTURE												Crop growth and yield can be efficiently monitored using canopy reflectance. However, the spatial resolution of freely available remote sensing data is too coarse to fully understand the spatial dynamics of crop status. The objective of this study was to downscale Landsat 7 (L7) reflectance from the native resolution of 30 x 30 m to that typical of yield maps (ca. 5 x 5 m) over two fields in northeastern Colorado, USA. The fields were cultivated with winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in the 2002-2003 growing season. Geospatial yield measurements were available (1 per ca. 20 m(2)). Geophysical (apparent soil electrical conductivity and bare-soil imagery) and terrain (micro-elevation) data were acquired (resolution <5 x 5 m) to characterize soil spatial variability. Geographically-weighted regressions were established to study the relationships between L7 reflectance and the geophysical and terrain data at the 30 x 30 m scale. Geophysical and terrain sensors could describe a large portion of the L7 reflectance spatial variability (0.83 < R-2 < 0.94). Maps for regression parameters and intercept were obtained at 30 x 30 m and used to estimate the L7 reflectance at 5 x 5 m resolution. To independently assess the quality of the downscaling procedure, yield maps were used. In both fields, the 5 x 5 m estimated reflectance showed stronger correlations (average increase in explained variance = 3.2 %) with yield than at the 30 x 30 m resolution. Land resource managers, producers, agriculture consultants, extension specialists and Natural Resource Conservation Service field staff would be the beneficiaries of downscaled L7 reflectance data.

Assessment and monitoring of long-term forest cover changes (1920-2013) in Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												Western Ghats are considered as one of the global biodiversity hotspots. There is an information gap on conservation status of the biodiversity hotspots. This study has quantified estimates of deforestation in the Western Ghats over a period of past nine decades. The classified forest cover maps for 1920, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2013 indicates 95,446 (73.1%), 63,123 (48.4%), 62,286 (47.7%), 61,551 (47.2%), 61,511 (47.1%) and 61,511 km(2) (47.1%) of the forest area, respectively. The rates of deforestation have been analyzed in different time phases, i.e., 1920-1975, 1975-1985, 1985-1995, 1995-2005 and 2005-2013. The grid cells of 1 km(2) have been generated for time series analysis and describing spatial changes in forests. The net rate of deforestation was found to be 0.75 during 1920-1975, 0.13 during 1975-1985, 0.12 during 1985-1995 and 0.01 during 1995-2005. Overall forest loss in Western Ghats was estimated as 33,579 km(2) (35.3% of the total forest) from 1920's to 2013. Land use change analysis indicates highest transformation of forest to plantations, followed by agriculture and degradation to scrub. The dominant forest type is tropical semi-evergreen which comprises 21,678 km(2) (35.2%) of the total forest area of Western Ghats, followed by wet evergreen forest (30.6%), moist deciduous forest (24.8%) and dry deciduous forest (8.1%) in 2013. Even though it has the highest population density among the hotspots, there is no quantifiable net rate of deforestation from 2005 to 2013 which indicates increased measures of conservation.																	0253-4126	0973-774X				FEB	2016	125	1					103	114		10.1007/s12040-015-0645-y								WOS:000371447200009

The main goal of this paper is to demonstrate the implementation and effectiveness of the Forest Canopy Density (FCD) model in producing a remote sensing-based and detailed map of montado canopy density over a large territory in southern Portugal. This map will make a fundamental contribution to accurately identifying and assessing High Nature Value farmland in montado areas. The results reveal that the FCD model is an effective approach to estimating the density classes of montado canopy (overall accuracy = 78.0 %, kappa value = 0.71). The study also shows that the FCD approach generated good user's and producer's accuracies for the three montado canopy-density classes. Globally, the results obtained show that biophysical indices such as the advanced vegetation index, the bare soil index, the shadow index and the thermal index are suitable for estimating and mapping montado canopy-density classes. These results constitute the first remote sensing-based product for mapping montado canopy density that has been developed using the FCD model. This research clearly demonstrates that this approach can be used in the context of Mediterranean agro-forestry systems.

Forest cover changes in Bhutan: Revisiting the forest transition	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Reforestation is observed in several tropical countries, mostly in marginal lands including mountain environments. Bhutan, a landlocked and mountainous country characterized by a long tradition of environmental preservation, is considered as one of the few tropical countries which has experienced a recent forest transition, i.e., a shift from net loss to net increase of forest cover. However, doubts persist regarding the contemporary evolution of forest cover in Bhutan as two recent studies reported opposite trends. The objective of this study was to assess whether a forest transition did indeed recently take place in Bhutan. We used topographically corrected Landsat images from 1990, 2001/2002, and 2011 to detect and quantify forest cover change trajectories over Bhutan. Results of the land cover classifications confirmed that forest cover in Bhutan remained very stable, with a forested area covering more than 60% of the country. For both time periods, gross and net forest cover changes were remarkably small. A trend reversal occurred as a net forest loss of 91 km(2) during the 1990s was followed by a net forest gain of 52 km(2) during the following decade. This small transition resulted from both an increase in rates of forest gain and a decrease in rates of forest loss, mostly affecting the broadleaf forest ecosystem of southern low-elevation districts. Northern districts covered by coniferous forests did not contribute to the forest transition. A spatially explicit comparison of our forest cover change maps with two previous studies highlighted the importance of a robust validation of change detection results and of a topographic correction of remote sensing images in rugged environments, as performed in this study. These recent forest cover changes can be explained by socio-economic and political changes associated with the opening of the country to trade, which induced a gradual transition from subsistence shifting cultivation to market-oriented agriculture. This study confirmed that the high forest cover of Bhutan was maintained since 1990, with a slight increase during the 2000s. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ESTIMATION OF SOIL EROSION IN NORTHERN KIRKUK GOVERNORATE, IRAQ USING RUSLE, REMOTE SENSING AND GIS	CARPATHIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												A quantitative assessment of annual soil erosion by water in the northern part of Kirkuk Governorate, north of Iraq was investigated through integration of remote sensing, GIS and empirical RULSE soil erosion model. The five factors of RULSE model (rainfall erosivity R, soil erodibility K, slope length and steepness LS, crop management C, and practice factor P) were derived from different resources such as field survey, archival data, digital elevation model, and LANDSAT 8 multi-bands imagery. The annual soil erosion loss was estimated by multiplying the five factors in raster format using raster calculator of ArcGIS 10.2 software. The estimated annual soil losses rate for the study area ranges from 0 to 245 (t ha(-1) yr(-1)) with an average of 2 (t ha(-1) y(-1)). The value ranges were classified into four categories: minimal, low, moderate, high soil erosion hazard zones using four classification schema: quantile, natural breaks, geometric, and standard deviation. Due to the similarity of results, the comparison was carried out between two schemas: natural breaks and geometric. The area covered by minimal-low soil hazard zones extends over an area of about 88% and 99% based on geometric and natural breaks schema, respectively. In turn, the moderate-high soil hazard zones cover only very small area (0.3%) based on natural breaks and relatively small area (12%) depending on geometric scheme. In general, both method results indicate that hazard of soil erosion is low in the study area. The spatial pattern of classified soil erosion rate indicates that the areas at moderate to high risk is located in the northeast and very small area in the east, while the minimal to low zones cover the other parts. The obtained results of could be useful to implement soil conservation practices in the study area.																	1842-4090	1844-489X				FEB	2016	11	1					153	166										WOS:000370208300014						
J	Logan, MK				Logan, Mary Kotschwar			Assessing site occupancy of Mohave ground squirrels: Implications for conservation	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												To better understand the distribution and habitat relationships of the Mohave ground squirrel (Xerospermophilus mohavensis), a California state threatened species, I investigated site occupancy of squirrels using remote-sensing wildlife cameras (i.e., camera traps). In 2012, I conducted camera trap surveys at 96 randomly selected sites within and adjacent to the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area, in the western Mojave Desert, California. In 1,105 camera trap days, there were 91 detections of squirrels at 30 out of 96 sites. I used single-season, single-species occupancy models to explore several survey and site variables hypothesized to influence detection probability (p) and site occupancy () of the species. Detection probability of squirrels varied with survey date and between 2 study areas, peaking in early April (p=0.23, SE=0.05 and p=0.13, SE=0.05, respectively) but decreasing approximately 4-fold by the end of the study season in mid-May. Site occupancy was positively related to the length of ephemeral stream channel(s) within a site, increasing from 0.24 (SE=0.07) to 0.89 (SE=0.10) with the range of stream channel lengths observed. Vegetation transects conducted at the study sites in 2014 indicated higher percent canopy cover, species richness, and diversity of perennial shrubs along ephemeral stream channels than in the surrounding upland habitat. This study provides the first estimates of site occupancy and detection probability of Mohave ground squirrels using the non-invasive method of camera trapping. The findings have implications for design and timing of future studies, and highlight the importance of protecting ephemeral stream channels for Mohave ground squirrel conservation.

Long-term monitoring of biophysical characteristics of tidal wetlands in the northern Gulf of Mexico - A methodological approach using MODIS	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT					2014 ForestSAT Conference	NOV 04-07, 2014	Riva del Garda, ITALY					Accurate and efficient monitoring is critically important for the effective restoration and conservation of threatened tidal wetlands in the Gulf Coast. The high carbon sequestration potential, habitat for important wildlife and fish, and numerous ecosystem services make these tidal wetlands highly valuable both ecologically and economically to Gulf Coast communities. Our study developed a new methodological approach for mapping biophysical health of coastal tidal wetland habitats in terms of green leaf area index (GLAI), canopy level chlorophyll content (CHL), vegetation fraction (VF), and above ground green biomass (GBM). We measured these biophysical characteristics in tidal wetlands of the northern Gulf of Mexico using a combination of ground data collected from field surveys during the growing seasons of 2010 and 2011 and NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 m and 500 m images. Additionally, we compared and evaluated the performances of both in situ proximal and satellite remote sensing measurements in terms of their potential for mapping the wetland biophysical characteristics. MODIS-based models proved superior at the landscape level compared to models developed from in situ proximal sensing, as species level signals seemed to be diluted at coarser spatial scales. We selected Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI) for MODIS 250 m and Visible Atmospheric Resistant Index (VARI) for MODIS 500 m to map biophysical characteristics of tidal wetlands. Time-series composites and phenological information derived using the MODIS based models captured the impact of the selected disturbances in the last decade on the ecological and physiological status of the tidal wetland habitats in the Gulf Coast. This is the first study to employ MODIS data to analyze the biophysical characteristics of tidal wetlands in the Gulf Coast, which, in turn, has the potential to improve our ability to predict their productivity and carbon sequestration potential. These techniques could also be used to assess the success of previous and ongoing tidal wetland restoration projects, and evaluate the productivity of marshes under threat from developmental activity, sea level rise, and industrial pollution.

Evaluating habitat associations of a fish assemblage at multiple spatial scales in a minimally disturbed stream using low-cost remote sensing	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. Habitat heterogeneity at multiple scales is a major factor affecting fish assemblage structure. However, assessments that examine these relationships at multiple scales concurrently are lacking. The lack of assessments at these scales is a critical gap in understanding as conservation and restoration efforts typically work at these levels. A combination of low-cost side-scan sonar surveys, aerial imagery using an unmanned aerial vehicle, and fish collections were used to evaluate the relationship between physicochemical and landscape variables at various spatial scales (e.g. micro-mesohabitat, mesohabitat, channel unit, stream reach) and stream-fish assemblage structure and habitat associations in the South Llano River, a spring-fed second-order stream on the Edwards Plateau in central Texas during 2012-2013. Low-cost side-scan sonar surveys have not typically been used to generate data for riverscape assessments of assemblage structure, thus the secondary objective was to assess the efficacy of this approach. The finest spatial scale (micro-mesohabitat) and the intermediate scale (channel unit) had the greatest explanatory power for variation in fish assemblage structure. Many of the fish endemic to the Edwards Plateau showed similar associations with physicochemical and landscape variables suggesting that conservation and restoration actions targeting a single endemic species may provide benefits to a large proportion of the endemic species in this system. Low-cost side-scan sonar proved to be a cost-effective means of acquiring information on the habitat availability of the entire river length and allowed the assessment of how a full suite of riverscape-level variables influenced local fish assemblage structure.

Data sets on wetlands required for the representation of aquatic ecosystem biodiversity and systematic wetland conservation planning are typically not available or are inadequate, particularly at country-wide scale, which hinders conservation planning. The improvement in hierarchical classification systems and increased availability of broad-scale data sets offers new opportunities to overcome these limitations. 2. This study demonstrates replicable methods for classifying wetland ecosystem types and condition country-wide using broad-scale data sets in data-scarce countries. 3. A country-wide data set, compiled primarily using remote sensing techniques, was combined with regional and landscape-setting data sets to reflect the ecological and geomorphic biodiversity of wetlands. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) were employed to model wetland types, disturbance indices and identify priority wetlands through threatened faunal species associations using existing data. Accuracy of the national data was assessed through a congruency with two local data sets. 4. Most of the 1 680 306ha of inland wetlands were classified as Natural (80%), of which the majority were located on Valley Floors (68%). However, the national data were found only to represent 54% of wetlands mapped at a local scale, and comparison with local data showed inaccuracies in the types and condition classifications. 5. Problems regarding spatial data quality and scale are discussed and suggestions for improvement are provided. The desktop classification steps can be reproduced easily for other data-scarce countries. Data sets on freshwater ecosystems can assist in raising awareness and influence policy at a national scale.

Assessing the effectiveness of specially protected areas for conservation of Antarctica's botanical diversity	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Vegetation is sparsely distributed over Antarctica's ice-free ground, and distinct plant communities are present in each of the continent's 15 recently identified Antarctic Conservation Biogeographic Regions (ACBRs). With rapidly increasing human activity in Antarctica, terrestrial plant communities are at risk of damage or destruction by trampling, overland transport, and infrastructure construction and from the impacts of anthropogenically introduced species, as well as uncontrollable pressures such as fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) activity and climate change. Under the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, the conservation of plant communities can be enacted and facilitated through the designation of Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs). We examined the distribution within the 15 ACBRs of the 33 ASPAs whose explicit purpose includes protecting macroscopic terrestrial flora. We completed the first survey using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) satellite remote sensing to provide baseline data on the extent of vegetation cover in all ASPAs designated for plant protection in Antarctica. Large omissions in the protection of Antarctic botanical diversity were found. There was no protection of plant communities in 6 ACBRs, and in another 6, <0.4% of the ACBR area was included in an ASPA that protected vegetation. Protected vegetation cover within the 33 ASPAs totaled 16.1 km(2) for the entire Antarctic continent; over half was within a single protected area. Over 96% of the protected vegetation was contained in 2 ACBRs, which together contributed only 7.8% of the continent's ice-free ground. We conclude that Antarctic botanical diversity is clearly inadequately protected and call for systematic designation of ASPAs protecting plant communities by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties, the members of the governing body of the continent.																	0888-8892	1523-1739				FEB	2016	30	1					113	120		10.1111/cobi.12592								WOS:000368938000013	26205208

Effects of reduced water quality on coral reefs in and out of no-take marine reserves	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Near-shore marine environments are increasingly subjected to reduced water quality, and their ability to withstand it is critical to their persistence. The potential role marine reserves may play in mitigating the effects of reduced water quality has received little attention. We investigated the spatial and temporal variability in live coral and macro-algal cover and water quality during moderate and major flooding events of the Fitzroy River within the Keppel Bay region of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park from 2007 to 2013. We used 7 years of remote sensing data on water quality and data from long-term monitoring of coral reefs to quantify exposure of coral reefs to flood plumes. We used a distance linear model to partition the contribution of abiotic and biotic factors, including zoning, as drivers of the observed changes in coral and macro-algae cover. Moderate flood plumes from 2007 to 2009 did not affect coral cover on reefs in the Keppel Islands, suggesting the reef has intrinsic resistance against short-term exposure to reduced water quality. However, from 2009 to 2013, live coral cover declined by approximate to 50% following several weeks of exposure to turbid, low salinity water from major flood plume events in 2011 and subsequent moderate events in 2012 and 2013. Although the flooding events in 2012 and 2013 were smaller than the flooding events between 2007 to 2009, the ability of the reefs to withstand these moderate floods was lost, as evidenced by a approximate to 20% decline in coral cover between 2011 to 2013. Although zoning (no-take reserve or fished) was identified a significant driver of coral cover, we recorded consistently lower coral cover on reserve reefs than on fished reefs throughout the study period and significantly lower cover in 2011. Our findings suggest that even reefs with an inherent resistance to reduced water quality are not able to withstand repeated disturbance events. The limitations of reserves in mitigating the effects of reduced water quality on near-shore coral reefs underscores the importance of integrated management approaches that combine effective land-based management with networks of no-take reserves.

Historical forest management in Romania is imposing strong legacies on contemporary forests and their management	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Historical forest management can heavily affect contemporary forest management and conservation. Yet, relatively little is known about century-long changes in forests, and that limits the understanding of how past management and land tenure affect current forestry practice and ecosystem conservation. Our goal here was to examine the relationship between historical forest management (as depicted by historical forest cover, species composition, age structure and harvesting data) and contemporary forest patterns in Romania. Romania represents an ideal case-study to examine the effects of historical forest management, because it experienced multiple shifts in forest management regimes since the 1800s due to Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, Romanian, Soviet and later EU policy influences, and because it is both a conservation hotspot harboring some of the largest old-growth forest in Europe, and an important source of timber for international markets. We reviewed forestry literature and statistics since the 19th century to reconstruct a time-series of forest cover, composition, disturbance patterns, and ownership patterns and interpreted these data in light of institutional changes. We further assessed changes in forest cover, forest harvest, species composition and age structure between two points in time (1920s and 2010s) at the county level, using a combination of historical forest statistics, remote sensing data and modeled forest composition. We complemented our national data with three case studies for which we had stand level historical and contemporary forest management data. We found that forest area increased in Romania since 1924 by 5% and that the annual rate of forest harvest between 2000 and 2013 was half of the annual rate between 1912 and 1922, which indicates high potential for forest biodiversity conservation. However, the composition, distribution, and age structure of contemporary forests is also substantially different from historical forests. We found an overall increase in coniferous species and several deciduous species (such as Tilia, Populus, Betula, Alnus sp.), a spatial homogenization of species composition, and more even-aged stands. We also observed a drop from 14% to 9% in the relative abundance of old forests (>100 years). Spikes in forest harvest coincided with times of widespread forest privatization, and drastic institutional changes, such as agrarian reforms, or the onset and collapse of the Soviet Regime. Overall, our results suggest that effects of past management, land ownership and institutional changes can persist for centuries, and affect forest ecosystem composition, health and structure, and consequently ecosystem services and habitat availability. Our findings are scientifically important because they provide evidence for legacies of past management and for the effects of forest privatization on harvesting rates. Our findings are also relevant to forest management and conservation practice, because they highlight that environmentally sound management over long time periods is essential for sustainable forestry and old-growth forest protection in Europe and elsewhere.

Quantifying drivers of population dynamics for a migratory bird throughout the annual cycle	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Worldwide, migratory species are undergoing rapid declines but understanding the factors driving these declines is hindered by missing information about migratory connectivity and the lack of data to quantify environmental processes across the annual cycle. Here, we combined range-wide information about migratory connectivity with global remote-sensing data to quantify the relative importance of breeding and non-breeding environmental processes to persistent long-term population declines of a migratory songbird, the wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina). Consistent with theoretical predictions about population limitation of migratory birds, our results suggest that habitat loss and climate have contributed to the observed declines in wood thrush breeding abundance, yet the relative importance of breeding versus non-breeding factors is population-specific. For example, high-abundance core breeding populations appear to be more limited by habitat loss, whereas low-abundance, peripheral populations appear to be limited by climate-driven seasonal interactions. Further, our analysis indicates that the relative impact of breeding habitat loss is at least three to six times greater than the impact of equivalent nonbreeding habitat loss and therefore the steepest regional declines have likely been driven by the loss of breeding habitat. These results underscore the need for population-specific conservation strategies implemented throughout the annual cycle to reverse long-term declines.

Remote Sensing Derived Fire Frequency, Soil Moisture and Ecosystem Productivity Explain Regional Movements in Emu over Australia	PLOS ONE												Species distribution modeling has been widely used in studying habitat relationships and for conservation purposes. However, neglecting ecological knowledge about species, e.g. their seasonal movements, and ignoring the proper environmental factors that can explain key elements for species survival (shelter, food and water) increase model uncertainty. This study exemplifies how these ecological gaps in species distribution modeling can be addressed by modeling the distribution of the emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) in Australia. Emus cover a large area during the austral winter. However, their habitat shrinks during the summer months. We show evidence of emu summer habitat shrinkage due to higher fire frequency, and low water and food availability in northern regions. Our findings indicate that emus prefer areas with higher vegetation productivity and low fire recurrence, while their distribution is linked to an optimal intermediate (similar to 0.12 m(3) m(-3)) soil moisture range. We propose that the application of three geospatial data products derived from satellite remote sensing, namely fire frequency, ecosystem productivity, and soil water content, provides an effective representation of emu general habitat requirements, and substantially improves species distribution modeling and representation of the species' ecological habitat niche across Australia.

Above-ground biomass and carbon estimates of Shorea robusta and Tectona grandis forests using QuadPOL ALOS PALSAR data	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH												Mechanisms to mitigate climate change in tropical countries such as India require information on forest structural components i.e., biomass and carbon for conservation steps to be implemented successfully. The present study focuses on investigating the potential use of a one time, QuadPOL ALOS PALSAR L-band 25 m data to estimate above-ground biomass (AGB) using a water cloud model (WCM) in a wildlife sanctuary in India. A significant correlation was obtained between the SAR-derived backscatter coefficient (sigma degrees) and the field measured AGB, with the maximum coefficient of determination for cross-polarized (HV) sigma degrees for Shorea robusta, and the weakest correlation was observed with co-polarized (HH) sigma degrees for Tectona grandis forests. The biomass of S. robusta and that of T. grandis were estimated on the basis of field-measured data at 444.7 +/- 170.4 Mg/ha and 451 +/- 179.4 Mg/ha respectively. The mean biomass values estimated using the WCM varied between 562 and 660 Mg/ha for S. robusta; between 590 and 710 Mg/ha for T. grandis using various polarized data. Our results highlighted the efficacy of one time, fully polarized PALSAR data for biomass and carbon estimate in a dense forest. (C) 2015 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Rates and drivers of mangrove deforestation in Southeast Asia, 2000-2012	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												The mangrove forests of Southeast Asia are highly biodiverse and provide multiple ecosystem services upon which millions of people depend. Mangroves enhance fisheries and coastal protection, and store among the highest densities of carbon of any ecosystem globally. Mangrove forests have experienced extensive deforestation owing to global demand for commodities, and previous studies have identified the expansion of aquaculture as largely responsible. The proportional conversion of mangroves to different land use types has not been systematically quantified across Southeast Asia, however, particularly in recent years. In this study we apply a combined geographic information system and remote sensing method to quantify the key proximate drivers (i.e., replacement land uses) of mangrove deforestation in Southeast Asia between 2000 and 2012. Mangrove forests were lost at an average rate of 0.18% per year, which is lower than previously published estimates. In total, more than 100,000 ha of mangroves were removed during the study period, with aquaculture accounting for 30% of this total forest change. The rapid expansion of rice agriculture in Myanmar, and the sustained conversion of mangroves to oil palm plantations in Malaysia and Indonesia, are identified as additional increasing and under-recognized threats to mangrove ecosystems. Our study highlights frontiers of mangrove deforestation in the border states of Myanmar, on Borneo, and in Indonesian Papua. To implement policies that conserve mangrove forests across Southeast Asia, it is essential to consider the national and subnational variation in the land uses that follow deforestation.

The study used remote sensing data to investigate the state of vegetation cover along the northern fringes of the park and an adjacent communal grazing area to determine differences in plant based resource endowments between the two areas. The study also involved the discriminant analysis of survey responses from park officials and local communities regarding perceptions about the environmental impacts of Acacia mearnsii invasion, as well as how the species spreads and how the species can be controlled. The objective of the study was to assess park-community conflicts arising from initiatives to limit community access to park resources on the justification of the need to prevent the invasion of the park by A. mearnsii. The study concludes that even though uncontrolled movement of people and livestock creates the obvious danger of invasion of the park by the species, the extent to which the species is viewed as an environmental threat depends on the worldviews of the stakeholders, the bridging of which can only be achieved through negotiation, environmental awareness and education campaigns and provision of training in conflict resolution to the belligerents.																	1943-815X	1943-8168				JAN 2	2016	13	1					37	54		10.1080/1943815X.2015.1130062								WOS:000371995900001

This chapter examines two challenges to tropical forest conservation-the demand for use of land for multiple and continuous spatially and temporally linked purposes, and the gaps in our knowledge to fully understand and characterize resulting land cover change dynamics. This chapter uses the case of the biodiversity hot spot of Madre de Dios in Peru as an example. Here, land-use competition is largely resultant from mutually exclusive activities of Brazil nut harvesting, which depends on intact primary forest, development through construction of the Interoceanic Highway and legal and illegal mining of gold. The analysis compares areas with authorized land-use allocations against remotely sensed satellite data to identify past land cover change events and areas of potential land-use competition and conflict. Based on the case study, this chapter illustrates the increasing importance of distal and transnational commodity demands as a driver for land-use change. Further, it discusses the advantages and caveats of spatially and temporally explicit quantification of change using remote sensing techniques. For the latter, it focusses on issues of simplicity and system boundary definitions that may overlook relevant connections to distal drivers and forest/non-forest functions. This chapter concludes that teleconnected systems that drive local land-use and land cover change (LULCC) must be accounted for when mapping land disturbance dynamics, and discusses the potential paths that remote sensing analysis may take to understand and address these challenges.																			978-3-319-33628-2; 978-3-319-33626-8				2016	6						111	123		10.1007/978-3-319-33628-2_7	10.1007/978-3-319-33628-2							WOS:000409534500008

And in the case if groundwater recharge scenario is primarily concerned, surface runoff is a prime factor to be quantified since it affects to the potential of groundwater recharge. Surface runoff also supports to the information required for groundwater recharging efficiency by providing the behavior of surface water flows for certain geographical terrain. The study area, Bhandara district (Maharastra, India), semi-arid region having geographical area of about 4090 Km(2) (24 watersheds) normally receives average annual rainfall of 1300 mm and is very much concerned about the existing groundwater recharge scenarios. So, in this study an attempt has been made to quantify the annual average surface runoff depth of each watershed so that the potential groundwater recharge could be revealed indirectly. Soil Conservation Services (SCS) curve number method has been employed for the estimation of surface runoff depth integrated with remote sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques. SCS curve number method is basically defined by the curve number (CN) derived from landuse/landcover and hydrological soil groups of the particular geographical area. Landuse/landcover and hydrological soil group have been derived from satellite image (LISS III) using GIS techniques. The watershed-wise results of surface runoff depth were classified into six classes (very low, low, medium low, medium high, high and very high) in the range of 700-1000 mm with 50 mm difference between the classes. The study area is mostly covered by low to medium low runoff depth indicating for medium groundwater recharge potential. These results were re-examined with the average groundwater level fluctuation. Both the results were shown similar conclusion of having moderate groundwater recharge potential in this area.																	0921-092X		978-3-319-40195-9; 978-3-319-40194-2				2016	73						51	68		10.1007/978-3-319-40195-9_5	10.1007/978-3-319-40195-9							WOS:000401843600006

In a pilot research project, we integrate changes in different types of ES along a gradient of land-and seascape units (terrestrial, coastal and marine). This gradient includes developed urban and peri-urban areas, and undeveloped areas including submerged lands in the coastal (territorial) waters of Israel. The emphasis in our research is on development of a practical methodology for sustainable (urban and rural) development. Goals of the pilot project presented here include: (1) evaluation of various ecosystem services based on categorical indicators for each of the four ES types: provisional, regulating, supporting and cultural; (2) development of a method that can be used on a wider scale across varying landscape units; and (3) refinement of scenario building relevant to local planning institutions and frameworks. The project's final product consists of GIS-generated maps. These maps are the basis for weighing trade-offs in ES across relevant land-and seascape units in the Mt. Carmel region of Israel. Despite some limitations, this approach to ES assessment is helpful, and if improved upon in some of the ways described herein, it can provide the first steps for infusing ES values within planning frameworks in Israel and beyond.																			978-3-319-26218-5; 978-3-319-26216-1				2016	14						23	41		10.1007/978-3-319-26218-5_3	10.1007/978-3-319-26218-5							WOS:000398203700003						
J	Eisavi, V; Yazdi, AM; Niknezhad, SA				Eisavi, Vahid; Yazdi, Ahmad Maleknezhad; Niknezhad, Seyeed Ali			Spatial and temporal modeling of wetland surface temperature using Landsat-8 imageries in Sulduz, Iran	JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF FORESTRY-ISTANBUL UNIVERSITY												Wetland Surface Temperature (WST) maps are an increasingly important parameter to understand the extensive range of existing processes in wetlands. The Wetlands placed in neighborhoods of agricultural and industrial lands are exposed to more chemical pollutants and pesticides that can lead to spatial and temporal variations of their surface temperature. Therefore, more studies are required for temperature modeling and the management and conservation of these variations in their ecosystem. Landsat 8 time series data of Sulduz region, Western Azerbaijan province, Iran were used in this study. The WST was derived using a mono-window algorithm after implementation of atmospheric correction. The NDVI (Normalized Differential Vegetation Index) threshold method was also employed to determine the surface emissivity (EX). Our findings show that the WST experienced extensive spatial and temporal variations. It reached its maximum value in June and also experienced the highest mean in the same month. In this research, August (12.08.2013) had a lowest spatial standard deviation regarding surface temperature and June (28.06.2013) had the highest one. Wetlands' watersides adjacent to industrial zones have a higher surface temperature than the middle lands of these places. The map obtained from the WST variance over time can be exploited to reveal thermal stable and unstable zones. The outcome demonstrates that land use, land cover effectively contribute to wetland ecosystem health. The results are useful in the water management, preventive efforts against drying of wetland and evapotranspiration modeling. The approach employed in this research indicates that remote sensing is a valuable, low-cost and stable tool for thermal monitoring of wetlands health.																	0535-8418	1309-6257					2016	66	1					46	58		10.17099/jffiu.26733								WOS:000410443400004

Land Use Change Assessment, Prediction Using Remote Sensing, and GIS Aided Markov Chain Modelling at Eleyele Wetland Area, Nigeria	JOURNAL OF SETTLEMENTS AND SPATIAL PLANNING												Land use change involve changes in the area extent of a given type of land use or cover and such changes have significant impact on natural and human environment at all geographic scales. We performed a land use classification and analysis by using GIS and Remote sensing technique, and GIS aided 'Markov Cellular Automata' technique was used to model the land use change and determine the magnitude, rate and dynamics of change in the spatial extent of the Eleyele wetland area, Nigeria. We also identified the factor responsible for the observed changes with the objectives of predicting future change in the next 30 years. Four multi-temporal datasets comprising Landsat TM 1984, 2000 and Landsat OLI/TIRS 2014 imageries were classified using ArcGIS 10.0 version with support of ground truth data. Post-classification comparison with GIS overlay to map the spatial dynamics of land use/cover change was conducted. Land use Change Modeller (LCM) and Markovian processes were employed to analyze the pattern and trend of change. Based on the past trend of land use changes (from 1984 to 2014), the future land use map of Eleyele wetland area for the year of 2044 was generated using the neural network built-in module in the Idrisi Selva. The study revealed that the lake area decreased from 1.28 km(2) in 1984 to 0.99 km(2) in 2000 and further to 0.60 km(2) in 2014. The study concluded that the increase in built area around the lake has resulted in the loss of vegetal cover, which has a negative implication for biodiversity conservation in the study area. This type of research will help shaping the urban form of the city in a planned manner.																	2069-3419	2248-2199					2016	7	1					51	63		10.19188/06JSSP012016								WOS:000408238700006						
J	Ongsomwang, S; Boonchoo, K				Ongsomwang, Suwit; Boonchoo, Krittawat			INTEGRATION OF GEOSPATIAL MODELS FOR THE ALLOCATION OF DEFORESTATION HOTSPOTS AND FOREST PROTECTION UNITS	SURANAREE JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Geospatial models play an important role in predicting land use and land cover (LULC) data and are applied in various aspects such as land use planning and management, and deforestation vulnerability analysis for forest conservation and protection. Therefore, integration of geospatial models for a LULC prediction and deforestation vulnerability analysis (DVA) are here examined for the allocation of deforestation hotspots and forest protection units to prevent deforestation in the protected forest areas (PFAs) of Phuket Island. The main objectives of the study were: (1) to identify the optimum geospatial model for the LULC prediction, (2) to examine the optimum geospatial model for the DVA and zonation, and (3) to allocate deforestation hotspots and forest protection units for the PFAs. The 4 main components of the research methodology that were implemented comprised: (1) data collection and preparation; (2) optimum geospatial modelling for the LULC prediction; (3) optimum geospatial modelling for the DVA; and (4) the allocation of deforestation hotspots and forest protection units. From the results of the LULC interpretation of remote sensing data between 1995 and 2014, all 15 PFAs on Phuket Island were deforested with an annual rate ranging between 0.0001-0.2082 sq. km. The causes of deforestation were the conversion of forest land to urban and built-up areas and the expansion of agricultural land. In this study, the CLUES and CA-Markov models were chosen as the optimum geospatial models for the LULC prediction of 9 and 6 PFAs, respectively, while the frequency ratio model was identified as the optimum geospatial model for the DVA and zonation of the 15 PFAs. According to the LULC prediction for 2026, the highest annual deforestation rate of the PFAs during the period from 2014 to 2026 will occur in Khao Kamala national reserved forest (NRF) with a value of 0.1400 sq. km, while the lowest annual deforestation rate will occur in Khong Tarau NRF with a value of 0.0001 sq. km. Meanwhile, the number of PFAs with low and high risks of deforestation in the future based on the percentages of deforestation vulnerability zonation was 11 and 4, respectively. In the case of the allocation of deforestation hotspots and forest protection units, 408 deforestation hotspots were distributed over 12 FPAs, with the exception of Khao Sam Liam, Khao Tosae, and Khlong Tarau NRFs, while 5 PFAs - Khao Kamala, Khao Nak Keod, Khlong U-Tapao, Khlong Para, and Khlong Tajin NRFs - required the establishment of 15, 20, 1, 2, and 6 forest protection units, respectively In conclusion, it appears that the integration of geospatial models for the LULC prediction and DVA with zonation can be used as an efficient tool for the allocation of deforestation hotspots and forest protection units to fulfill the forest conservation and protection program of the Thai Government.																	0858-849X						2016	23	3					283	307										WOS:000408354400007

Low Level Vision Processing and Vegetation Extraction using IRS-1C LISS III Image	2016 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL AND INFORMATION PROCESSING (ICONSIP)					International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (IConSIP)	OCT 06-08, 2016	Nanded, INDIA					Removal of noise is essential for remote sensing applications, as its existence in images is inevitable and results in random misrepresentations to the region of interest, in the image. This paper proposes a method for low level vision processing and vegetation feature extraction for IRS-1C LISS III remote sensing images using a combination of partial differential equations (PDEs), and normalized band ratioing method in order preprocess and to extract vegetation features. The purpose of image low level vision processing was to remove the effect of noise, edge conservation, making the resulting segmented vegetation feature images approximate the ideal image. Effectiveness of the algorithm was proven statistically and visual interpretations of results are clearer. Results show that, the proposed algorithm obtains better performance on different frames of the study area with higher PSNR values, reduced RMSE and enhanced visual quality.																			978-1-5090-1522-1				2016																		WOS:000405686000048

By combining a multi-source merging method and aerial photo-interpretation, we analyzed land cover dynamics during the 1998-2009 period. The analysis across 3 dates of the cartographic database for the 4450km(2) at 1: 15,000 scale, with of 23 land cover types, showed a rapid and steady urban growth at the expense of agricultural areas, with an expansion greater than 6% during the ten-year period. A synthetic overview of changes at municipality scale showed the prominence of newly artificialized areas not only in the valleys around Grenoble but also in the main, predominantly agricultural plain areas of Bievre and Voiron. Most of the changes are contiguous to already urbanized areas. Therefore they induce limited landscape fragmentation, as new built-up areas are emerging alongside existing ones or within existing ones as part of a densification process. The results obtained for this area illustrate an emerging major preoccupation in the Western European Alps (Switzerland, Italy, Austria...), namely that the present rate of urbanization is not sustainable in the longer run in fragile Alpine valleys. In this respect, our cartographic database will provide baseline information for a participatory prospective exercise performed with local stakeholders of the Grenoble region, aiming to support sustainable land management and planning.																	1278-3366						2016									UNSP 791	10.4000/cybergeo.27800								WOS:000404585900058

Analysis of Precipitation and Evapotranspiration in Atlantic Rainforest Remnants in Southeastern Brazil from Remote Sensing Data	TROPICAL FORESTS: THE CHALLENGES OF MAINTAINING ECOSYSTEM SERVICES WHILE MANAGING THE LANDSCAPE												The Atlantic Rainforest has been intensely devastated since the beginning of the colonization of Brazil, mainly due to wood extraction and urban and rural settlement. Although the Atlantic Rainforest has been reduced and fragmented, its remnants are important sources of heat and water vapor to the atmosphere. The present study aimed to characterize and to analyze the temporal dynamics of precipitation and evapotranspiration in the Atlantic Rainforest remnants in Sao Paulo state, southeastern Brazil, for the period from January 2000 to December 2010. To achieve this, global precipitation and evapotranspiration data from TRMM satellite and MOD16 algorithm as well as forest remnant maps produced by SOS Mata Atlantica Foundation and Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE) were used. Results found in this study demonstrated that the use of remote sensing was an important tool for analyzing hydrological variables in Atlantic Rainforest remnants, which can contribute to better understand the interaction between tropical forests and the atmosphere, and for generating input data necessary for surface models coupled to atmospheric general circulation models.

Multitemporal Land Use/Land Cover Change Detection for the Batena Watershed, Rift Valley Lakes Basin, Ethiopia	LANDSCAPE DYNAMICS, SOILS AND HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES IN VARIED CLIMATES	Springer Geography											A majority of the rural population in Ethiopia depends on agriculture. Land use changes during the past couple of decades are mostly linked to agricultural development attributed to factors such as population pressure and environmental changes. Mapping land use/land cover (LULC) to analyze the type, rate, and extent of changes in land use patterns has far reaching significance for policy/decision makers and resource managers to provoke the wide range of applications at regional scales for erosion, landslide, land planning, forest management, and ecosystem conservation. The focus of this chapter is to depict quick and practical approaches to generate spatially and temporally quantified information on land cover dynamics using high-resolution satellite images for the years (1973-2008) in Batena watershed and its environs in southwestern Ethiopia. To quantify the magnitude of LULC change, supervised classification technique was applied using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images employing Bayesian maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) with the aid of ground truth training sites. A majority/minority analysis was used for smoothing the classification results and the accuracy of image classification was carried out by means of a confusion matrix generated through geographic information system (GIS) overlay of the classified maps and the test samples. The classification accuracy was further verified by the strong kappa statistical estimate of more than 90 % as a measure of overall agreement between image and reference data. The final output of remote sensing imagery revealed five land cover classes: Grazing land, bush land, mixed forest, dominantly cultivated agricultural land, and water body. It has been discovered that, there were more active LULC change processes in the area in the first study period (1973-1984) than the second study period (1984-1995) and the third study period (1995-2003). On the other hand, areal extent of cultivated and uncultivated agricultural land has been on a steady decline from 39.7 % in 1995 to 41.4 % in 2003 and a mere 50.1 % in 2008. In the first period, nearly half of the landscape underwent land cover change with more than 17 % of the entire landscape experiencing agricultural expansion. In the second period, the extent of the changes was limited to less than 1/3 of the total area with a smaller amount of agricultural area expansion than before. Though the rate of land cover change was observed to vary across the three periods of study, a general decline of forest cover and amplified increase of agricultural lands of more than 41.7 % was found in the area.

Analyses of Land Use/Land Cover Change Dynamics in the Upland Watersheds of Upper Blue Nile Basin	LANDSCAPE DYNAMICS, SOILS AND HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES IN VARIED CLIMATES	Springer Geography											Investigating land use/land cover (LULC) change is important for effective sustainable land resource management and for understanding the changes in hydrological processes. In this chapter, we investigated LULC dynamics in three experimental watersheds: Mizewa (27 km(2)), Debre Mawi (5.23 km(2)) and Enchilala (4.14 km(2)) of upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia. These watersheds are experimental watersheds for investigating runoff processes, erosion, and soil conservation practices. The LULC changes were measured through interpretation of Landsat images of 1973, 1986, 2000, and 2013 supported by repeated field visits. Based on the image analysis and field survey, cultivated, forest, shrub/bush land, and grazing land are the major LULC classes during the study periods. The result showed an increase in cultivated land mainly at the expense of shrub/bush, forest, and grazing land for all three watersheds. The cultivated land increased from 30 to 68 % in Mizewa, from 67 to 80 % in Debre Mawi, and from 55 to 86 % in Enchilala within the past 40 years. This is likely associated with the population that has been steadily increasing at a growth rate of 2-3 % per year during the past five decades. However, the rate of change of cultivated land of Mizewa (27 ha/year) is greater than Debre Mawi (1.5 ha/year) and Enchilala (3.2 ha/year) watersheds. The higher rate of change is the same for the other land uses. This is likely because the rate of expansion of cultivated land into steep slope, degraded, and marginal lands was found to be much more in Mizewa, which is located on the main road from Bahir Dar to Debre Tabor. The expansion of cultivated land and the decrease of vegetative covers through forest will cause a decrease in evapotranspiration and increase in overland and subsurface flow and will increase soil erosion. This leads to growth of numerous gullies as observed in Debre Mawi and Enchilala. Therefore, the current trends in LULC must be improved, toward the resource management and conservation of the existing vegetation and other natural resources in all the three watersheds. These should be done in collaboration with all stakeholders including local communities, government, and NGOs for effective management of natural resources.

Spatial Runoff Estimation and Mapping of Potential Water Harvesting Sites: A GIS and Remote Sensing Perspective, Northwest Ethiopia	LANDSCAPE DYNAMICS, SOILS AND HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES IN VARIED CLIMATES	Springer Geography											Freshwater resources scarcity is becoming a limiting factor for development and sustenance in most parts of Ethiopia. The Debre Mewi watershed, in northwest Ethiopia, is one of such areas where the need for supplemental water supply through rainwater harvesting is essential. Suitable water harvesting sites were identified through overlay analysis considering both social and technical parameters, such as land use/land cover, slope gradient, soil texture, flow accumulation and stakeholders' priority. This was performed with the integration of GIS and remote sensing applications. Knowledge of runoff resulting from rainfall is most important for designing any water harvesting structure. Direct field-level measurement of runoff is always good, but it is time consuming, labour intensive and expensive. In conditions where direct measurement of runoff could not be possible, remote sensing technology and GIS combined with runoff models are proven to be effective. In this study, the remotely sensed satellite data (Quickbird2) provided spatial information on land use/land cover. Precipitation was obtained from the nearest meteorological station, and soil data were acquired form laboratory analysis. The GIS tools were used to store, manipulate and estimate runoff depth, surface storage and runoff volume, applying Soil Conservation Service (SCS) Curve Number (CN) formula. The direct runoff volume estimated using SCS-CN model is 146,697 m(3) for the month of August, at Debre Mewi watershed, which covers about 508 ha. The result was compared with measured values, and closer relationship was found. This indicates that there is enough runoff water to be harvested for different uses. Remote sensing was found to be a very important tool in providing input parameters. GIS was also found to be a very important tool in mapping and integrating the different variables, in the process of runoff estimation and suitable water harvesting sites selection.

In this paper, we study energy conservation in scattering from layered random rough surfaces using the second order small perturbation method (SPM2). SPM2 includes both first order incoherent scattering and a second order correction to the coherent fields. They are combined to compute the total reflected and transmitted powers, as a sum of integrations over wavenumber k(x), in which each integration includes the surface power spectra of a rough interface weighted by an emission kernel function (assuming the roughness of each interface is uncorrelated). We calculate the corresponding kernel functions which are the power spectral densities for one-dimensional (1D) surfaces in 2D scattering problems and examine numerical results for the cases of 2 rough interfaces and 51 rough interfaces. Because it is known that the SPM when evaluated to second order conserves energy, and it can be applied to second order for arbitrary surface power spectra, energy conservation can be shown to be satisfied for each value of kx in the kernel functions. The numerical examples show that energy conservation is obeyed for any dielectric contrast, any layer configuration and interface, and arbitrary roughness spectra. The values of reflected or transmitted powers predicted, however, are accurate only to second order in small surface roughness.																	1559-8985						2016	157						1	20		10.2528/PIER16080802								WOS:000396744600001

In this paper, we consider the possibility of modern methods usage to estimate archaeological hillforts condition on the territory of the Republic of Tatarstan. In our view, the analysis of medieval fortified settlements of X-XIII centuries, the most common in the territory of the Republic of Tatarstan, has the highest priority. Because always the main criteria for the selection of favorable place to settle was the closeness of the water and the presence of natural fortifications, most of the archaeological sites usually located on the banks and terraces of small rivers, where influence of fluvial and exogenous processes is possible. Intensive territory development (plowing, irrigation, active construction, etc.) also led to a significant change in exterior of monuments and often to their complete disappearance. So, the main task of our investigation is to provide both historical data and operational information about the current state of archaeological sites. This article gives an example of modern techniques application to study hillforts that exposed to different types of negative impacts. The complex method including GIS, multitemporal remote sensing data and GNSS survey provides not only assessment of the risk of study sites damage, but also archaeological data updating and development of specific measures for historical and cultural heritage conservation.

This paper aims to present the current conservation status of some old ecclesiastical buildings of Iasi, a city which represents an ancient religious, cultural, academic and economic urban centre of Romania, correlated to the traces of the human life (socio-cultural and economic) and community attitude towards ecclesiastical heritage. For this purpose, the studies have been conducted on the local monuments using GIS technologies for a better understanding and valorisation of the cultural heritage in an integrated manner. First we created a spatial database of ecclesiastical heritage included into the most recent national list of cultural heritage, in 2015. Then we attached specific attributes such as the year or period of construction, the year of the last interventions/restorations/reconstructions over time, etc. to each vector object. In this way it was possible to generate a number of maps that emphasize the old ecclesiastic city centre, the monuments in unstable areas etc. This attributes data base can be updated in real time, and in this way the governmental institutions can decide their conservation policies in a more accurate way, comparing with the traditional methods. The updated data regarding the conservation status of ecclesiastical heritage represent an important component in monitoring, protection and valorisation processes of local heritage and, in the same time, offer the possibility to involve the members of local community into heritage management for a sustainable development.

The Sajo river can connect the area and the common interest catchment, so its protection, the common use of water resources, the environment-, nature-, and flood protection are a public interest. Tasks specified in the river basin management plans necessitate a standardized survey of the Sajo river and its environment to the proper water-course maintenance planning, the hydro-meteorological forecast development, the operational preparation of the flood control and the planning of the water management, environmental protection and nature conservation. During the survey we used series of remote sensing technics, like LiDAR, hyperspectral imaging and ortophoto. Combining data from different technology allows us to provide a series useful information set for planning of river basin management. This set of information could be used in flooding situation for operational activity too.

Thus, the IUCN Council recently adopted a new Red List criteria as a global standard for ecosystem risk assessment, aims to establish a global Red List of ecosystem. Remote sensing is one of the most powerful technology for earth observation at macro-scale, which have great potential to impetus the establishment of a global Red List of ecosystem. Here we operated a systematic assessment of ecosystems with this protocol in Southwestern China, to present the procedure of assessment for biodiversity at ecosystem level based on remote sensing data and test the applicability of IUCN Red List criteria in high heterogeneous region. The result show that the red lists of this area contain all the nationally protected types of Atlas of China's vegetation, which means the high robustness of the protocol. The prospects indicate that remote sensing may play a more important role in achieving the goal of global Red List of ecosystems.					tan, jian bo/0000-0002-1483-5995												2153-6996		978-1-5090-3332-4				2016							1307	1310		10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729332								WOS:000388114601107

In arid regions, quantitative estimation of crop water requirement is the base of appraising terrestrial NPP, regional water consumption, soil water transport, crop production, and land use under changing climate. In this study, we selected the middle reaches of Heihe river basin as the study area and estimated the crop water requirement for 2009 use SEBS model, remote sensing data (MOD021KM , MOD03, MOD 09GA) and crop phenological data. We found that: 1) SEBS model performed well and can be used to estimate the spatial distribution of crop water requirement in the arid regions; 2) The corresponding results can provide baseline aimed to fulfill water requirement for crop production at middle reach and vegetation conservation at lower reach of Heihe River basin.																	2153-6996		978-1-5090-3332-4				2016							6281	6283		10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730642								WOS:000388114606031

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE REMOTE SENSING DATA USED IN THE PROPOSED UNFCCC REDD plus FOREST REFERENCE EMISSION LEVELS (FRELS)	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VIII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				Developing countries must submit forest reference emission levels (FRELs) to the UNFCCC to receive incentives for REDD+ activities (e.g. reducing emissions from deforestation/forest degradation, sustainable management of forests, forest carbon stock conservation/enhancement). These FRELs are generated based on historical CO2 emissions in the land use, land use change, and forestry sector, and are derived using remote sensing (RS) data and in-situ forest carbon measurements. Since the quality of the historical emissions estimates is affected by the quality and quantity of the RS data used, in this study we calculated five metrics (i-v below) to assess the quality and quantity of the data that has been used thus far. Countries could focus on improving on one or more of these metrics for the submission of future FRELs. Some of our main findings were: (i) the median percentage of each country mapped was 100%, (ii) the median historical timeframe for which RS data was used was 11.5 years, (iii) the median interval of forest map updates was 4.5 years, (iv) the median spatial resolution of the RS data was 30m, and (v) the median number of REDD+ activities that RS data was used for operational monitoring of was 1 (typically deforestation). Many new sources of RS data have become available in recent years, so complementary or alternative RS data sets for generating future FRELs can potentially be identified based on our findings; e.g. alternative RS data sets could be considered if they have similar or higher quality/quantity than the currently-used data sets.																	2194-9034						2016	41	B8					669	672		10.5194/isprsarchives-XLI-B8-669-2016								WOS:000393156000113

Well-designed conservation plans involve efficient mapping and monitoring systems. Satellite remote sensing is a cost-effective tool for seafloor mapping at large scales. Multispectral remote sensing of coastal habitats, like those of the Arabian Gulf, presents a special challenge due to their complexity and heterogeneity. The present study evaluates the potential of multispectral sensor DubaiSat-2 in mapping benthic communities of United Arab Emirates. We propose to use a spectral-spatial method that includes multilevel segmentation, nonlinear feature analysis and ensemble learning methods. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for comparison of classification performances. Comparative data were derived from the habitat maps published by the Environment Agency-Abu Dhabi. The spectral-spatial method produced 96.41% mapping accuracy. SVM classification is assessed to be 94.17% accurate. The adaptation of these methods can help achieving well-designed coastal management plans in the region.

BIODIVERSITY MAPPING VIA NATURA 2000 CONSERVATION STATUS AND EBV ASSESSMENT USING AIRBORNE LASER SCANNING IN ALKALI GRASSLANDS	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VIII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				Biodiversity is an ecological concept, which essentially involves a complex sum of several indicators. One widely accepted such set of indicators is prescribed for habitat conservation status assessment within Natura 2000, a continental-scale conservation programme of the European Union. Essential Biodiversity Variables are a set of indicators designed to be relevant for biodiversity and suitable for global-scale operational monitoring. Here we revisit a study of Natura 2000 conservation status mapping via airbone LIDAR that develops individual remote sensing-derived proxies for every parameter required by the Natura 2000 manual, from the perspective of developing regional-scale Essential Biodiversity Variables. Based on leaf-on and leaf-off point clouds (10 pt/m(2)) collected in an alkali grassland area, a set of data products were calculated at 0.5 x0.5 m resolution. These represent various aspects of radiometric and geometric texture. A Random Forest machine learning classifier was developed to create fuzzy vegetation maps of classes of interest based on these data products. In the next step, either classification results or LIDAR data products were selected as proxies for individual Natura 2000 conservation status variables, and fine-tuned based on field references. These proxies showed adequate performance and were summarized to deliver Natura 2000 conservation status with 80% overall accuracy compared to field references. This study draws attention to the potential of LIDAR for regional-scale Essential Biodiversity variables, and also holds implications for global-scale mapping. These are (i) the use of sensor data products together with habitat-level classification, (ii) the utility of seasonal data, including for non-seasonal variables such as grassland canopy structure, and (iii) the potential of fuzzy mapping-derived class probabilities as proxies for species presence and absence.																	2194-9034						2016	41	B8					1293	1299		10.5194/isprsarchives-XLI-B8-1293-2016								WOS:000393156000217

This paper identifies, assess and classify natural and environmental vulnerability using landscape pattern from multidisciplinary approach, based on remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques. A model was developed by following thematic layers: land use/cover, vegetation, wetland, geology, geomorphology and soil in ArcGIS 10.2 software. According to numerical results vulnerability classified into five levels: low, sensible, moderate, high and extreme vulnerability by mean of cluster principal. Results are shows that in natural vulnerability maximum area covered by moderate (29.84%) and sensible (38.61%) vulnerability and environmental vulnerability concentrated by moderate (49.30%) vulnerability. So study area has at medial level vulnerability. The results found that the methodology applied was effective enough in the understanding of the current conservation circumstances of the river basin in relation to their environment with the help of remote sensing and GIS. This study is helpful for decision making for eco-environmental recovering and rebuilding as well as predicting the future development.

PROTHEGO aims to make an innovative contribution towards the analysis of geo-hazards in areas of cultural heritage, and uses novel space technology based on radar interferometry (InSAR) to retrieve information on ground stability and motion in the 400+ UNESCO's World Heritage List monuments and sites of Europe. InSAR can be used to measure micro-movements to identify geo-hazards. In order to verify the InSAR image data, field and close range measurements are necessary. This paper presents the methodology for local-scale monitoring of the Choirokoitia study site in Cyprus, inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List, and part of the demonstration sites of PROTHEGO. Various field and remote sensing methods will be exploited for the local-scale monitoring, static GNSS, total station, leveling, laser scanning and UAV and compared with the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry results. The in-situ measurements will be taken systematically in order to document any changes and geo-hazards that affect standing archaeological remains. In addition, ground truth from in-situ visits will provide feedback related to the classification results of urban expansion and land use change maps. Available archival and current optical satellite images will be used to calibrate and identify the level of risk at the Cyprus case study site. The ground based geotechnical monitoring will be compared and validated with InSAR data to evaluate cultural heritage sites deformation trend and to understand its behaviour over the last two decades.

In this study, a methodology based on a WorldView-2 (WV-2) satellite image and in situ spectral signatures measurements was applied to map the Canarian Monteverde ecosystem located in the north of the Tenerife Island (Canary Islands, Spain). Due to the high spectral similarity of vegetation species in the study zone, a Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) was performed. MESMA determines the fractional cover of different components within one pixel and it allows for a pixel-by-pixel variation of endmembers. Two libraries of endmembers were collected for the most abundant species in the test area. The first library was collected from in situ spectral signatures measured with an ASD spectroradiometer during a field campaign in June 2015. The second library was obtained from pure pixels identified in the satellite image for the same species. The accuracy of the mapping process was assessed from a set of independent validation plots. The overall accuracy for the ASD-based method was 60.51 % compared to the 86.67 % reached for the WV-2 based mapping. The results suggest the possibility of using WV-2 images for monitoring and regularly updating the maps of the Monteverde forest on the island of Tenerife.

Carbon sequestration associated to the land-use and land-cover changes in the forestry sector in Southern Brazil	REMOTE SENSING FOR AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS, AND HYDROLOGY XVIII	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XVIII	SEP 26-28, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE				We studied the Paraiba do Sul river watershed, Sao Paulo state (PSWSP), Southeastern Brazil, in order to assess the land use and cover (LULC) and their implications to the amount of carbon (C) stored in the forest cover between the years 1985 and 2015. The region covers an area of 1,395,975 ha. We used images made by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor (OLI/Landsat-8) to produce mappings, and image segmentation techniques to produce vectors with homogeneous characteristics. The training samples and the samples used for classification and validation were collected from the segmented image. To quantify the C stocked in aboveground live biomass (AGLB), we used an indirect method and applied literature-based reference values. The recovery of 205,690 ha of a secondary Native Forest (NF) after 1985 sequestered 9.7 Tg (Teragram) of C. Considering the whole NF area (455,232 ha), the amount of C accumulated along the whole watershed was 35.5 Tg, and the whole Eucalyptus crop (EU) area (113,600 ha) sequestered 4.4 Tg of C. Thus, the total amount of C sequestered in the whole watershed (NF + EU) was 39.9 Tg of C or 145.6 Tg of CO2, and the NF areas were responsible for the largest C stock at the watershed (89%). Therefore, the increase of the NF cover contributes positively to the reduction of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) may become one of the most promising compensation mechanisms for the farmers who increased forest cover at their farms.				bicudo da silva, ramon felipe/U-5304-2017; de Oliveira Bordonal, Ricardo/O-6228-2015	bicudo da silva, ramon felipe/0000-0002-3480-4539; de Oliveira Bordonal, Ricardo/0000-0001-5957-2909												0277-786X		978-1-5106-0400-1; 978-1-5106-0401-8				2016	9998								99981T	10.1117/12.2242094								WOS:000393152800054

USING REMOTE SENSING AND GIS TECHNIQUES TO DETECT CHANGES TO THE PRINCE ALFRED HAMLET CONSERVATION AREA IN THE WESTERN CAPE, SOUTH AFRICA	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				Understanding and identifying the spatial-temporal changes in the natural environment is crucial for monitoring and evaluating conservation efforts, as well as understanding the impact of human activities on natural resources, informing responsible land management, and promoting better decision-making. Conservation areas are often under pressure from expanding farming and related industry, invasive alien vegetation, and an ever-increasing human settlement footprint. This study focuses on detecting changes to the Prince Alfred Hamlet commonage, near Ceres in the Cape Floral Kingdom. It was chosen for its high conservation value and significance as a critical water source area. The study area includes a fast-growing human settlement footprint in a highly productive farming landscape. There are conflicting development needs as well as risks to agricultural production, and both of these threaten the integrity of the ecosystems which supply underlying services to both demands on the land. Using a multi-disciplinary approach and high-resolution satellite imagery, land use and land cover changes can be detected and classified, and the results used to support the conservation of biodiversity and wildlife, and protect our natural resources. The aim of this research is to study the efficacy of using remote sensing and GIS techniques to detect changes to critical conservation areas where disturbances can be understood, and therefore better managed and mitigated before these areas are degraded beyond repair.																	2194-9034						2016	41	B7					475	481		10.5194/isprsarchives-XLI-B7-475-2016								WOS:000393155900073

The development goal of the Project is to contribute to stop biodiversity loss by supporting the development of conservation strategies. An important step in developing conservation of biodiversity requires a successful groundwater protection. Conservation of biodiversity depends on groundwater needs strategies that allows for the use of groundwater in a way that is compatible with the persistence of ecosystems in natural area, such as Limpopo Transfrontier Park, in the Southern African Region. Groundwater is a key element n the SADC region Groundwater is the primary source of water for people living in the SADC region, because it is used extensively throughout the southern African region, including the Limpopo River basin, supplying a large percentage of water for irrigation, rural water supply schemes and mining. The province has limited surface and ground water resources. Most of the water management areas are severely stressed and many people still do not have access to the accepted minimum supply of water. The goal of the strategy is to make sure that the water resources of protected areas are managed in an equitable manner so as to ensure the long-term sustainability of those resources, in order to the continue availability and security of supply of suitable quality water for all consumptive users and for the needs of the environment. Crystalline basement rock is distributed extensively throughout Africa and underlies large parts of the semi-arid Limpopo Province in South Africa. The development of crystalline basement aquifers as a reliable source of water supply is notoriously complex, and groundwater occurrence is spatially highly variable. Some of the greatest groundwater needs occur in the region and groundwater is the only dependable source of water for many users. The aim of the study is to provide an assessment of the actual groundwater monitoring network and in consideration of the growing demand for water, there is a need to understand the effects of planting on water rescouces to estimate crop water requirement for the focus area, as last step of the methodological strategy. This paper would outline a methodology on where to focuse future research.

WETLAND ASSESSMENT USING UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE (UAV) PHOTOGRAMMETRY	XXIII ISPRS Congress, Commission I	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				The use of Unmanned Anal Vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry is a valuable tool to enhance our understanding of wetlands. Accurate planning derived from this technological advancement allows for more effective management and conservation of wetland areas. This paper presents results of a study that aimed at investigating the use of UAV photogrammetry as a tool to enhance the assessment of wetland ecosystems. The UAV images were collected during a single flight within 21/2 hours over a 100 ha area at the Kameelzynkraal farm, Gauteng Province, South Africa. An AKS Y-6 MKII multi-rotor UAV and a digital camera on a motion compensated gimbal mount were utilised for the survey. Twenty ground control points (GCPs) were surveyed using a Trimble GPS to achieve geometrical precision and georeferencing accuracy. Structure-from-Motion (SfM) computer vision techniques were used to derive ultra-high resolution point clouds, orthophotos and 3D models from the multi-view photos. The geometric accuracy of the data based on the 20 GCP's were 0.018 m for the overall, 0.0025 m for the vertical root mean squared error (RMSE) and an overall root mean square reprojection error of 0.18 pixel. The UAV products were then edited and subsequently analysed, interpreted and key attributes extracted using a selection of tools/ software applications to enhance the wetland assessment. The results exceeded our expectations and provided a valuable and accurate enhancement to the wetland delineation, classification and health assessment which even with detailed field studies would have been difficult to achieve.																	2194-9034						2016	41	B1					781	788		10.5194/isprsarchives-XLI-B1-781-2016								WOS:000392750100122

In the Moldavian Plain there is a high potential for cultural and religious tourism, given both by the high concentration of historical monuments and by the biggest religious pilgrimage from Romania. In the past there was a strong connection between human activity, the techniques and materials used and architecture of the regular houses and/or churches, and we believe that is very important to resume this connection. In this regard we made a map of the Moldavian ecclesiastical monuments using GIS to identify the regions with the largest concentration of the historical and most valuable wooden churches, and them tourism potential. At the same time, are explored aspects of participatory and collaborative conservation concepts assumed by the integrated scientific conservation of cultural heritage and are studied ways in which the community members (individuals and companies) can be stimulated to become active and to promote the old monuments and crafts techniques for a superior valorisation of local cultural heritage. So with stimulating the touristic route based on participatory conservation of the cultural heritage we have a new method for local sustainable development.

In the present work a survey on soil variability and within-farm plant is reported, coupling a multi-depth automatic resistivity profiler (ARP(C), Geocarta, France) and the NDVI index derived from Sentinel-2 imagery data. Based on the relationship between resistivity and NDVI index, the objective of the analysis was to test the possibility to monitor the evolution of vegetation index and modulate the agricultural operations depending on soil features and soil tillage techniques management on soft wheat (Triticum Aestivum L.). A comparison of the same homogeneous zones managed with different soil tillage techniques shows an increase of NDVI index from conventional tillage (CT) to minimum tillage (MT) and no-tillage (NT). This is caused by conservation tillage techniques which allow a mitigation of cooling phenomena, higher availability of nutrients and lower number of passages across the field preventing soil compaction.																			978-80-213-2683-5				2016							484	489										WOS:000390603400077

US Army Agriculture Development Teams, Afghanistan: The Role of the Geoscientist	MILITARY GEOSCIENCES AND DESERT WARFARE: PAST LESSONS AND MODERN CHALLENGES	Advances in Military Geosciences				9th International Conference on Military Geosciences (ICMG)	JUN 20-24, 2011	Las Vegas, NV					In the spring of 2008, the National Guard Bureau and the U. S. Army began employing a new counterinsurgency tool in Afghanistan-Agriculture Development Teams (ADT). These specialized, egalitarian U. S. Army teams, consisting of 12 soldier-expert hybrids, work directly with Afghanistan officials and farmers to support their agricultural needs. ADTs provide agriculture-related education, training and sustainable projects, which are U. S. funded and locally operated and maintained. For the Texas ADT, geoscientists are generalists working in three areas: (a) Hydrology, (b) Education and (c) Geology. Hydrologically speaking, control, conservation and management of spring snowmelt from the Hindu Kush is vital to farming and livestock management, so delay-action dams, gabion structures and irrigation projects were developed. In response to village concerns, a dam assessment and hazard-mitigation program was developed and implemented. Team geoscientists also helped in watershed delineation and the selection of dam emplacement locations. With respect to education, university-and high-school-level support and training projects are also developed and implemented. Genuine geology-based projects were atypical due to overall security and time constraints; however, Texas ADT geoscientists completed remote sensing of chromite mineral resources in their area of operation. Overall, ADT geoscientists are essential for mission success because of their flexible approach to problem solving, which is paramount in an ever-changing battle space where data and observations are limited to time, space and support. The role of a geoscientist in these teams varies depending on the unit's deployed location and their commander's intent. The success of an ADT geoscientist, however, is contingent upon the commander's understanding of what a geoscientist IS and DOES!																			978-1-4939-3429-4; 978-1-4939-3427-0				2016							221	236		10.1007/978-1-4939-3429-4_15								WOS:000389807200015

Analysing fragmentation in vulnerable biodiversity hotspots in Tanzania from 1975 to 2012 using remote sensing and fragstats	NATURE CONSERVATION-BULGARIA												Habitat fragmentation is a threat to conservation of biodiversity hotspots in the Morogoro region, Tanzania. However, on-going research on fragmentation has not kept pace with temporal lapses and how individual species respond to habitat transformation and heterogeneity. This study sought to model spatial and temporal fragmentation patterns. Cloud free multi-temporal Landsat imagery with similar spectral resolution were acquired in the same season in 1975, 1995 and 2012. The images were used to characterize the biophysical landscape characteristics and a range of metrics used to quantify the magnitude of fragmentation. Patches and classes in the landscape were assessed using Fragstats, a spatial statistics program useful in computing landscape metrics. Results show that patch number was higher in dense forest and woodland than in less dense forest and grassland in 1975, 1995 and 2012 while the interspersion Juxtaposition Index (IJI) ranged between 0 (for clumped patches) and 100 (for grassland). In 1975 and 1995, the grassland habitat had the highest IJI while in 2012 less dense forest had the highest IJI. The Games-Howell test showed a significant fragmentation trend in less dense forests class (p=0.05). Generally, the study indicates a high fragmentation pattern in the vulnerable tropical eastern arc mountain region of East Africa. This finding demonstrates the value of remotely sensed data in understanding the impact of anthropogenic processes on natural landscape transformation. Furthermore, the study provides a basis for informed conservation policy design and implementation in the region.																	1314-6947	1314-3301					2016		16					19	37		10.3897/natureconservation.16.9312								WOS:000389654600002

Runoff Estimation of Banaras Hindu University South Campus Using ArcGIS and HecGeo-HMS	2016 3rd International Conference on Recent Advances in Information Technology (RAIT)					3rd IEEE International Conference on Recent Advances in Information Technology (RAIT)	MAR 03-05, 2016	Dhanbad, INDIA	IEEE, Indian Sch Mines, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, IEEE Commun Soc, Kolkata Chapter				Water is one of the most incredible natural resource which is vitally important for entire species of living beings present on the planet Earth. Therefore managing water resource is very necessary. Watershed modelling is to organize the watershed such that all the water related problems like water scarcity and flooding can be eliminated. Runoff is the most primary feature that is needed when planning water control strategies like water conservation structures, waterways and erosion control structures etc. Runoff estimation is essential for completing and executing plans, programs and tasks to support and expand watershed utilities. The most accepted technique to measure runoff or water discharge is Soil Conservation Service-Curve Number (SCS-CN) method. This project is dominant because here curve number is calculated on the basis of the properties of Land Use/ Land cover and soil type of the study area. Here Banaras Hindu University's (BHU) South Campus is taken as study area and curve numbers was calculated using HecGeo-HMS tool and by the help of softwares like ArcGIS and Erdas imagine runoff estimation and watershed modelling are done. This project highlights the role of Geographical Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) on calculating Runoff using overlay techniques. Daily rainfall for ten years and LISS-IV satellite image is the data used in this project. And then the calculated Curve number can be used for runoff estimation and watershed modelling.																			978-1-4799-8579-1				2016							607	612										WOS:000389274300103

The book starts with an extended analysis of water and land resources, characterising the natural conditions of Siberian landscapes, their ecosystems, crucial processes and human impacts on soil and water quality. The status of research and monitoring is characterised in another chapter, pointing both on substantial progress achieved during the past decades, but also on gaps in our knowledge. Both chapters reveal the Siberian landscapes' great potential for economically and ecologically viable business activities, but also inefficient and unsustainable land and water management practices and the decay of the rural infrastructure. Sustainable practices should be introduced soon, and this must be based on modern monitoring and management technologies. Some more studies show that thorough and innovative research and monitoring of water and land quality is provided by Siberian institutes and their leading researchers. Addressing climate change requires innovations in landscape research. Further book chapters deal with modern monitoring and management methods developed outside Siberia but having clear potential for application. We depict some highlights which could (a) lead to a significant knowledge shift, (b) initiate sustainable soil resource use and (c) trigger substantial improvement of the ecosystem status, if introduced into Siberia or applied there very soon on a wide scale. These are (1) soil and hydrological laboratory measurement methods, (2) process-based field measurement and evaluation methods of land and water quality, (3) remote sensing and GIS technology-based landscape monitoring methods, (4) process and ecosystem modelling approaches, (5) methods of resource and process evaluation and functional soil mapping and (6) tools for controlling agricultural land use systems such as nutrient balancing methods, conservation agriculture and their technologies. More than 15 concrete monitoring and management tools could immediately be introduced into research and practice, some of them without monetary investment. We conclude that strengthening international and national research cooperation in these fields will be a key for making novel methods operational. Agri-environmental research projects should have high priority as gaps in our knowledge are particular high, and a particularly large amount of novel measurement, evaluation, modelling and management tools are available. Various tools are ready for immediate introduction into Siberian landscapes in the framework of mutual pilot projects: state-of-the-science field monitoring technologies for soil and forest hydrology (EEM-HYPROP, virtual and real lysimeters), agro-ecological models and DSS (MONICA, LandCare-DSS), soil and land quality classification and evaluation tools (WRB 2014, Muencheberg-SQR), nutrient balancing tools, and technologies of conservation agriculture. The role of internationally linked monitoring capacities is particularly emphasised, with some existing stations established in the vast agri-environmental monitoring network and others to be newly built in remote regions of Siberia and the Far East, and supported by the latest remote sensing technologies. The book contributors represent an immense innovation network which should be employed to achieve both significant disciplinary and synergetic outreach effects. This should be imbedded into more sustainable strategies aiming at research cooperation between partners from EU countries, the Russian Federation and countries of Central Asia.

At present, the cultural landscape district of the ancient residential area of Prusias ad Hypium is threatened by growth of the university, and industrial plants are replacing surrounding farmlands. This study aimed to evaluate the natural and cultural resources of Konuralp, to assess the vulnerability of its urban legacy under socio-economic pressures, and to integrate urban heritage values using the historical urban landscape approach. For this study, urban conservation was regarded as the tool for the management of change by integrating it into the broader planning framework. This research examined the city's historical urban landscape by using survey methods and remote sensing to assess the landscape character exchange between the years 1982 and 2015.

In the upper Minjiang River Basin, the amounts of eco-water resources were retrieved from remotely sensed data during 1992 to 2005. Through regression analysis between the retrieved eco-water data and the climate hydrological data mainly including the temperature, the precipitation, and the runoff in the same period, the model of eco-water driving force affecting the evolvement of runoff was established. The accuracy analysis indicates that the model can well describe the relationship between dry season runoff and its driven factors, the measured data validation proves that the model has high precision and good practicability. The eco-water remote sensing inversion provides a valid method to quantify the land surface water conservation capability, and suggests an interesting approach for the driving function quantitative researches of underlying surface factor in the hydrologic cycle.																	1233-2585						2016	23				1		91	96		10.1515/pomr-2016-0051								WOS:000386543300013

The chosen study area South Pirin and Slavyanka mountain represents a conditionally natural area in Bulgaria. Being such kind of area the creation of large-scale landscape map involves few steps: to define and to classify different landscape types, to evaluate their conservation significance and to analyze their integrity. The data used includes: geological map, soil map, topographic maps, climate data, land cover and land use data. Satellite and orthophoto images were also used for more accurate mapping of landscape types. Mapping landscape types, based upon consistent scientific approach is essential for integrated environmental assessment, protection, monitoring and management. Landscapes are ecological meaningful units where both the natural (abiotic and biotic) and the anthropogenic (land use) components and processes interact.																	1314-0604						2016							579	587										WOS:000385790600060

There is a great need for developing Web GIS applications for Natura 2000 protected areas, which to be widely available to the general public. According to the main goal to develop a Web GIS application for the "Bulgarka" Nature Park in Bulgaria, the aim of this study is to create geodatabase of land cover and selected habitats in the park's territory. A reliable and consistent land cover and land use information for natural parks may be used to assess the status and trends of park's ecosystems. It is useful also for natural resource management decisions. Remote sensing and GIS are powerful tools for land cover mapping by providing consistent data with high temporal and spatial accuracy. The present study illustrates maps and analysis of spatial distribution of land cover and species of flora diversity in the "Bulgarka" Nature Park. Data and maps are developed in GIS environment for selected representative park areas with high conservation value. The results of spatial analysis indicate the current diversity and spatial distribution of land cover and protected species of flora. Visualization of created maps and data is designed for integration with a Web GIS application.																	1314-0604						2016							693	703										WOS:000385790600073

An integrated hydrological model for the NSSF is developed, with the objectives to numerically model the hydrological variations, to assess the impact of future climate change as well as to facilitate future eco-hydrology management. The numerical model considers the hydrological processes in a holistic manner, which includes the rainfall-runoff, the evapotranspiration, and the interactions between surface water and groundwater etc. Due to the constraints imposed from setting up monitoring stations in the protected forest, a combined approach is adopted to develop the numerical model which makes use of the field survey data and the alternative remote sensing data. With the climate projection inputs from the Regional Climate Model (RCM), the numerical model is applied to run future scenarios to assess the climate change impact. A few management strategies are also proposed in order to maintain favourable hydrological conditions for conserving the local ecosystem. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Water conservation service had been assessed with the help of multisource remote sensing data, and spatiotemporal features were analyzed from 2000 to 2014 in these ecological services zones. By assuming precipitation scenario as the constant, contribution for water conservation from human activities and climate change was analyzed, and result shows that, because of vegetation restoration by human activities, evapotranspiration increased obviously with the increase of the vegetation coverage. This could reduce the water conservation. However, actual annual increase of water conservation mainly comes from the increase of precipitation. Our analysis revealed that the choice of evaluation model played a decisive role in the reason analysis, which would affect the development of ecological policy.																	1687-9309	1687-9317					2016									5194091	10.1155/2016/5194091								WOS:000385748800001

The population and its relationship with the use and development of the land and water is a critical issue of urban growth, and since ancient times land, water and man were directly involved in the human populations' survival. Nevertheless the current potential of study over this relationship between urban growth, water supply, drainage and water resources conditions becomes more and more attractive due to the possibility to make use of the broader variety of information sources and technologies readily available in recent years, with emphasis on the open data and on the big data as primary sources. In this regard we present some new possibilities of analyses over the demographics, land use/land cover and water supply and conservation based on a study over a Romanian region of development (Bucharest-Ilfov). As urban development usually outgrows the existing water supply systems, the resolution consists in drilling new and deeper wells, building new water distribution pipelines, building longer aqueducts and larger reservoirs, or finding new sources and constructing completely new water supply systems, water supplies may evolve this way from a result into a cause and driver of urban growth. The evolution trends of the studied area was estimated based on the open satellite time-series imagery and remote sensing techniques by land use/land cover extraction and the identification of the changes in urbanization. The survey is mainly focused on the expansion of the water network in terms of areal, total length and number of connections correlated with the amount of water produced, consumed and lost within a supply zone. Some urban human activities including the industrial ones alter water resource by pollution, over pumping of groundwater, construction of dams and reservoirs. In areas of rapid growth the worse problems came from the inadequate amount of potable water, the continuous deterioration of water quality and the slow progress in the water resources management and supply. The effects of urban dynamics over the water use and sustainability deserves an increasing study over the recent history in order to provide for an optimal management of the interrelationships between them.

Italy is the country with the highest number of UNESCO cultural and natural World Heritage sites (51) containing both monuments and archaeological assets of global significance that need to be preserved for future generations, as declared and requested both by UNESCO and the European Commission. VIDEOR, the first web-service completely dedicated to cultural heritage, arises as support tool to institutions and organisations responsible of CH safeguard, with the goal to guarantee a constant and continuous monitoring of cultural assets considered to be at risk. Thanks to its services, VIDEOR allows a periodic situation evaluation, performed with the use of satellite remote sensing data (both optical and SAR) and aerial platform remote sensing data (UAVs), these last used when satellites identify a critical situation that requires deeper analyses. This constant and periodic monitoring will allow not only always updated information about the asset health status, but also early warnings launched by the operative center (NAIS) directly to experts of the responsible institutions (ISCR) after risk identification. The launch of early warnings will be essential for triggering promptly activities of preventive restoration, a less expensive way of intervention if compared to the post-event restoration, both in economic terms and in terms of historical preservation of a country.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-923-8				2016	9688								UNSP 96880V	10.1117/12.2242495								WOS:000385792200030

TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1A, in this regard, are two different models of SAR data provision: very high resolution on-demand imagery with end user-selected acquisition parameters, on one side, and freely accessible GIS-ready products with intended regular temporal coverage, on the other. What this means for change detection analyses in urban areas is demonstrated in this paper via the experiment over Homs, the third largest city of Syria with an history of settlement since 2300 BCE, where the impacts of the recent civil war combine with pre- and post-conflict urban transformation. The potential performance of Sentinel-1A StripMap scenes acquired in an emergency context is simulated via the matching StripMap beam mode offered by TerraSAR-X. Benefits and limitations of the different radar frequency band, spatial resolution and single/multi-channel polarization are discussed, as a proof-of-concept of regular monitoring currently achievable with space-borne SAR in historic urban settings. Urban transformation observed across Homs in 2009, 2014 and 2015 shows the impact of the Syrian conflict on the cityscape and proves that operator-driven interpretation is required to understand the complexity of multiple and overlapping urban changes.

Solar radiation is the prime determinant of how much energy urban surfaces absorb and of temperature distribution patterns in urban areas. Understanding the impacts of urban trees on solar radiation received by buildings is an important way to assess tree shading and potential energy conservation. In this study two remote sensing technologies have been integrated, to estimate solar radiation on building roofs along two major infrastructure routes in Sydney. In particular, the relationship between the radiation received by the roofs and the surrounding tree features has been investigated. The two chosen sources of remotely sensed data are light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and airborne hyperspectral imaging. Integrating these data sets provides a means to build digital surface models (DSMs) which only include trees and permits a distinction between evergreen and deciduous species. Global solar radiation profiles of both corridors have been estimated. Then, the direct and diffuse radiation received by building roofs are modelled by incorporating the LiDAR DSM, at hourly intervals on spring/autumn equinox and summer/winter solstice dates. The very high summer radiation in comparison with winter levels is demonstrated and, by correlating reductions in solar radiation with different tree and building dimensions, this paper shows that tree canopy height is most strongly correlated to solar radiation across the whole study area. The results also demonstrate benefits of more extensive use of deciduous species in industrialised or commercial areas. For landscape planners in Sydney, the importance of having and conserving taller trees for solar radiation reduction is clear. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Anthropogenic habitat alteration and increasing human access to previously remote landscapes are potential source of stress for this species in Iran. Therefore, land cover changes in the Chelcheli protected area were mapped for 1991-2013 using time sequential Landsat TM and ETM at 30 meters resolution. Moreover, Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling was used to investigate habitat selection of brown bear. The results showed that suitable patches overlapped with forest areas (Hyrcanian forest) and rivers. Our results also indicate that the brown bear habitat suitability is negatively influenced by human disturbance (e.g., roads, settlements). Increased human disturbance in brown bear habitat in recent decades may cause bears to avoid the disturbed areas. Therefore, the management plans should focus on reducing the human infrastructures around brown bear habitat. A suggestion is to place the core secure areas for brown bear inside the suitable habitat close to rivers where the human access is restricted. Promoting awareness of biodiversity conservation among tourism should also be one of the major focuses of management plans.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the digital classifier Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) in the characterization of existing vegetation types in the Araguaia State Park (PEA), in the municipality of Novo Santo Antonio, being bounded by the confluence of the Death River and Araguaia River. Through the SVM classifiers and SAM were processed images ASTER (Advanced Thermal Emission and Reflection Spacebone Radiometer). The collection of training samples to generate the digital classifications comprehended the classes: water, mounds fields, Ipucas (forest fragments located in depressions that favors its flooding), monchao (high ground of island covered with savannah species), savanna, cerrado, shoals and bare soil. The samples provided the training for the two algorithms. In SVM algorithm were used three kernel options. In the SAM algorithm were used two alpha values (alpha). Based on the Kappa index was found that the SVM algorithm obtained more precise differentiation of vegetation types, obtaining greater accuracy in the mapping.																	1809-094X	2236-9716				JAN-JUL	2016	6	1					99	114										WOS:000382491600007

For this purpose, Landsat satellite and EO-1 Hyperion imaging spectrometer data were acquired over agricultural fields in central Ohio, near Columbus, in April and May. According to the calculated mean normalized difference tillage index data (NDTI), in the period 2003 to 2014, area of conservation tillage fields increased at a rate of 8.41 %, while no-tillage fields decreased at a rate of 14.45 %. Comparing normalized difference index (NDI) data from 2003 and in 2014 it was determined that a reduction of 10% vegetated areas occurred. Normalized difference senescent vegetation index (NSDVI) values did not evidence significant change over a nearly 10 year period. The best determination of tillage practices was obtained using the cellulose absorption index (CAI) value calculated from Hyperspectral data. By combining information on crop classification with indexes, similar results were obtained for crop distribution over a ten year period.																	2279-7254						2016	49						121	135		10.5721/EuJRS20164907								WOS:000380968700001

Multiple stressors including the risk of decadal-scale drought, the effects of current and predicted global warming, and continued anthropogenic pressures threaten aquatic habitats in the southwest and cienegas are recognized as important sites for conservation and restoration efforts. However, cienegas present a challenge to satellite-imagery based analysis due to their small size and mixed surface cover of open water, exposed soils, and vegetation. We created time series of five well-known vegetation indices using annual Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images retrieved during the April-June dry season, from 1984 to 2011 to map landscape-level distribution of wetlands and monitor the temporal dynamics of individual sites. Indices included the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII). One topographic index, the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), was analyzed to examine the utility of topography in mapping distribution of cienegas. Our results indicate that the NDII, calculated using Landsat TM band 5, outperforms the other indices at differentiating cienegas from riparian and upland sites, and was the best means to analyze change. As such, it offers a critical baseline for future studies that seek to extend the analysis of cienegas to other regions and time scales, and has broader applicability to the remote sensing of wetland features in arid landscapes.

We conducted a supervised, object-oriented classification of imagery from the National Agricultural Imagery Program to develop a high-resolution (1-m) land cover data set with four cover classes, emphasizing accurate characterization of woody riparian vegetation along stream corridors in northern Nevada and southwestern Idaho. The overall classification accuracy was 76%, and producer's accuracy (reflecting false positives) and user's accuracy (reflecting false negatives) for the woody vegetation class were 84% and 70%, respectively. Using logistic and quantile regression models in a model-selection framework, we found woody vegetation to be positively associated with the occurrence and density of Redband Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss gairdneri. In addition, occurrence probabilities and densities were highest at mean August stream temperatures (predicted from a stream temperature model) ranging from 13 degrees C to 17 degrees C. When considered together with stream temperature, percent woody vegetation typically predicted Redband Trout occurrence and density better than most field-measured instream and riparian habitat variables in northern Nevada. Our study highlights how free high-resolution imagery can be used to characterize woody riparian vegetation and Redband Trout habitat across a large and remote desert landscape that can be difficult to access for field surveys. It also suggests that imagery from the National Agricultural Imagery Program may have wider application in identifying stream habitat restoration opportunities, where land and water uses have negatively impacted woody riparian vegetation in desert regions of the interior western United States.																	0002-8487	1548-8659					2016	145	6					1322	1339		10.1080/00028487.2015.1088471								WOS:000380369100020						
J	Zhou, JH; Qin, J; Gao, K; Leng, HB				Zhou, Jianhua; Qin, Jun; Gao, Kai; Leng, Hanbing			SVM-based soft classification of urban tree species using very high-spatial resolution remote-sensing imagery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Classification from remote-sensing data has proved to be fast and effective for mapping tree species. However, the interference from background noise and the weak spectral separability among most tree species have negative impacts on classification accuracy and may make conventional classification methods inappropriate. To solve this problem, a soft classification approach is presented. It consists of the technologies of soft partition, defuzzifying, and feature-location analyses (referred to here as F-L analyses). The soft partition is conducted by combined binary support vector machines, enabling a natural prototype of fuzzy clusters to be formed. Unsure members (members means both patches and pixels) in the clustering prototype can be defuzzified afterwards. F-L analyses run through the entire process in two ways: (1) by adding density description to feature space for classification and (2) through density-constrained defuzzifying. The former can enrich the feature space, thus making the soft partition perform better. By using the latter, the credibility of a class label is indicated by several weighted fuzzy measures in the form of hierarchical densities, thereby reducing the uncertainty of the defuzzifying. Experiments indicate that only 63% of members on average are surely allocated in a clustering prototype and the remainder can be ensured by the explored defuzzifying approach. The mean overall accuracy (OA) of the defuzzified members is very close to that of the originally allocated sure ones. A comparative assessment shows that the mean OA and mean kappa statistic value of members defuzzified using the explored fuzzy measure are, on average, 3.84 and 4.89% respectively higher than those using conventional maximum membership measures. Experiments also show that the former is superior to the latter in regard to the formation of complete tree crown objects.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2016	37	11					2541	2559		10.1080/01431161.2016.1178867								WOS:000379950800006

Remote sensing (RS) technology is one of the most beneficial tools to study spatial and temporal changes of VC. A case study has been conducted in the agro-ecosystem (AE) of Al-Kharj, in the center of Saudi Arabia. Characteristics and dynamics of total VC changes during a period of 26 years (1987-2013) were investigated. A multi-temporal set of images was processed using Landsat images from Landsat4 TM 1987, Landsat7 ETM+2000, and Landsat8 to investigate the drivers responsible for the total VC pattern and changes, which are linked to both natural and social processes. The analyses of the three satellite images concluded that the surface area of the total VC increased by 107.4% between 1987 and 2000 and decreased by 27.5% between years 2000 and 2013. The field study, review of secondary data, and community problem diagnosis using the participatory rural appraisal (PRA) method suggested that the drivers for this change are the deterioration and salinization of both soil and water resources. Ground truth data indicated that the deteriorated soils in the eastern part of the Al-Kharj AE are frequently subjected to sand dune encroachment, while the southwestern part is frequently subjected to soil and groundwater salinization. The groundwater in the western part of the ecosystem is highly saline, with a salinity >= 6 dS m(-1). The ecosystem management approach applied in this study can be used to alike AE worldwide.

Therefore, conservation and monitoring have become a primary objective, not just from an environmental and landscaping point of view but also from the socio-economic. In this context, remote sensing presents an effective tool to map palm groves, to count palm trees and to detect their possible diseases. The present study attempts to map palm trees from very high resolution WorldView 2 (WV 2) imagery, using a new supervised contextual classification method based on Markov Random Fields and palm trees shadow orientation. A combined layer of pan-sharpened multispectral (MS) bands and eight mean texture measures based Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM) were used as input variables. Total accuracy of 83.4% palm trees detection was achieved. Using a decision criterion based on palm trees: shape, shadow orientation and the distance, the total accuracy of palm trees detection reached 88.1%.

Evaluating Nature Reserve Design Efficacy in the Canadian Boreal Forest Using Time Series AVHRR Data	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												This research evaluates the efficacy of candidate reserves in boreal ecosystems with respect to a long-term record of remote-sensing-derived productivity based on the dynamic habitat index (DHI) generated using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data (1987-2007) and compared differences related to reserve location (stratified by land cover, ecozone, and gross primary productivity (GPP)) and reserve size. Effectiveness of candidate reserves was assessed by how productivity values differed from the initial conditions (2000-2005 baseline). Results indicate that small reserves (<1,000km(2)) at high elevations, high latitudes, intermittent environments (wetlands), or dominated by open shrub experienced the greatest amount of interannual variability. To the contrary, larger reserves (1,000km(2); <10,000 km(2)) were stable under these same conditions. Results also indicate that reserves located in highly productive areas (>700 kgC m(-2) yr(-1)) experienced greater interannual variability than low-productivity areas. This approach provides an objective and consistent means of evaluating reserve efficacy across different geographic areas and through time. By highlighting uncertainty associated with change impacts, this approach also offers opportunities to develop more robust long-term conservation targets in new reserves and to test potential mitigation strategies prior to implementation.

The advantages of this approach include safe access to hazardous or difficult terrain and conditions, the ability to survey at specific times and spatial scales, and the increasingly affordable cost of this technology. These benefits have led to a rapidly expanding range of applications in natural resource management and research including mapping of terrain, vegetation cover and condition, threatened species, habitat and the impacts of agriculture, forestry, urbanisation and climate change. The analysis of these often large datasets requires reliable segmentation and classification algorithms to efficiently process information for use in landscape ecology and adaptive management. In this paper, four segmentation methods are compared using images of native vegetation, introduced weeds and agriculture recorded from a quadcopter flown over a warm temperate island (Waiheke Island, New Zealand), and also images recorded from a fixed wing UAV in a polar desert (McMudro Dry Valleys, Antarctica). We propose a post-processing method to improve the segmentation performance of the algorithms and demonstrate how this can contribute to improving research outcomes in natural resource management, conservation and agriculture.																	0302-9743		978-3-319-30285-0; 978-3-319-30284-3				2016	9555						61	72		10.1007/978-3-319-30285-0_6								WOS:000378484300006

System for monitoring ecosystem functioning of Network of National Parks of Spain with remote sensing	REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION												Management of protected areas in the current context of global change requires approaches to characterize and to monitor ecosystem functioning. Remote sensing provides adequate tools for that because it provides indices that inform repeatedly and for large areas of land, about matter and energy exchanges between the biota and land surface. Considering this principle, and the continuous improvements in the availability of satellite data of higher quality and friendly use, we have developed with the Autonomous Organization of National Parks of Spain (OAPN), a monitoring system that complements other monitoring initiatives from this agency to inform about the conservation status of national parks. The system, called REMOTE, is based on the most used spectral vegetation indices on scientific literature, EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), derived from the time series of satellite images of the MODIS-Terra sensor. The systems allows to progress in identification of reference conditions to understand and predict ecosystems response against environmental perturbations or management actions, and their directional changes (trends) they are experiencing. Likewise, establishment of reference conditions helps to identify anomalies that warn of sudden changes in ecosystem functioning. The system uses as ecosystem functioning indicators three attributes related to the annual carbon gains (net primary production) by the canopy, their seasonality and phenology. In addittion, Remote has been designed and programmed on open and free software allowing future modifications and improvements in an easy way. The implementation of this system aims to inform decision-makers and managers of the Network of National Parks of Spain about the health and conservation status of ecosystems.

Currently IFAC develop integrated spectroscopy techniques in the UV-Vis-IR and THz-GHz ranges for the study of the constituent materials and the state of conservation of cultural heritage. The research focuses on devices for non-invasive and in situ characterization of materials and for imaging, as well as on procedures of multivariate analysis of spectral data. Remote sensing techniques based on fluorescence LIDAR were applied for the first time in the survey of monuments by IFAC. Advanced diagnostic, such as LIPS (laser induced plasma spectroscopy) and 3D microscopy were originally developed for archeometric studies. In the field of restoration, IFAC has been a pioneer in the development of laser systems for cleaning of works of art made in stone, metal and painted surfaces, transferring these technologies to the Italian industry, which has become a world leader.

THE BUSHLAND WEIGHING LYSIMETERS: A QUARTER CENTURY OF CROP ET INVESTIGATIONS TO ADVANCE SUSTAINABLE IRRIGATION	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												In 1987-1989, the first irrigated crops were grown on the four large, precision weighing lysimeters at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Research Laboratory at Bushland, Texas, on the Southern High Plains (SHP). Thus began > 25-years of full-and deficit-irrigated crop growth, energy and water balance, evapotranspiration (ET), yield, and water use efficiency (WUE) studies of major SHP crops, including alfalfa, corn and sorghum for both grain and forage, cotton, soybean, sunflower, and winter wheat. Alfalfa studies supported development of the ASCE Standardized Reference ET methodology. The lysimeter effort, led by Terry Howell, Sr., co-designed with Lynne Ebling and Thomas Marek and constructed by Arland Schneider, eventually grew to include a separate lysimeter to study short grass ET, again for the ASCE standard, and a 48-lysimeter facility to study soil type effects on crop water uptake, ET, and WUE using monoliths of four soils typical of SHP irrigated soils. The large lysimeters were managed to be representative of sprinkler-irrigated fields so as to develop crop coefficients used for irrigation scheduling by clients of ET networks developed by Texas A&M AgriLife in collaboration with the USDA-ARS. In addition, the lysimeters were used to test and further develop several technologies important to irrigation science, including soil water sensors, eddy covariance and Bowen ratio systems, scintillometers, thermal remote sensing based ET models, and hydrologic and crop simulation models. With the installation of subsurface drip irrigation systems on two of the lysimeter fields in 2013, the Bushland lysimeters are entering a new phase of advanced irrigation method and management studies.																	2151-0032	2151-0040					2016	59	1					163	179										WOS:000374754700015

Public lands and private waters: scarce mesic resources structure land tenure and sage-grouse distributions	ECOSPHERE												Water scarcity in semiarid environments provides a model system to evaluate the role of mesic resources in structuring the distribution and abundance of wildlife. We used remote sensing and point process analyses to evaluate spatio-temporal variability in limited mesic resources in relation to greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) distributions in Oregon, California, and northwest Nevada, USA, 1984-2011. We then link population distribution to changes in resource availability over time, space, and land tenure. Despite encompassing only 2.4% of landscape area, mesic sites influenced sage-grouse breeding distributions as evidenced by significantly shorter lek to mesic resource distances in observed (5.3 km) vs. predicted (8.2 km) values. Population abundance increased with proximity to mesic sites. Lag effects evident in abundance and proximity trends of mesic resources suggest a level of drought tolerance that moderated climatic variability. Mesic abundance and proximity remained relatively stable during the study period in comparison to more dynamic climatic patterns. Drought effects were most pronounced during multiyear events as evidenced by the 1987-1992 period that decreased mesic abundance >25% and approximately doubled mean lek to mesic resource distances (4.8-8.3 km). In our study area, 75% of all mesic resources were in private ownership, where the predominant land use is livestock ranching. Results suggest a holistic conservation strategy inclusive of private and public lands is needed to ensure sage-grouse habitat requisites are met throughout the life cycle of this landscape species.																	2150-8925					JAN	2016	7	1							e01208	10.1002/ecs2.1208								WOS:000374895800002

Therefore, the main purpose of this study was the use of geoestatistic methods to analyse bathymetric (depth), physical-oceanographic (currents and waves) and weather (winds) data of the access channel to the Port of Cabedelo and its evolution basin. It also includes resources as Remote Sensing (LANDSAT ETM+ images) in order that the images, the maps and the achieved results may be integrated into Geographical Information Systems and used as an aid in the elaboration of measures and contingency plans that have as purpose the environmental conservation of coastal areas under the influence of large facilities in the event of accidental oil spills in the region. As main results can be pointed out the elaboration of five bathymetric charts with meter depth on the scale of 1: 2000 according to the standard of the Diretoria de Hidrografia e Navegacao (DHN), showing the main submerged morphologies for the evolution basin (place where the ships moor) and the access channel to the Port of Cabedelo. From the dispersion diagram of the currents vectors of the Port of Cabedelo evolution basin, it can be observed as the tide current suffers a canalization due to the river Paraiba do Norte channel and in a bidirectional way caused by the tide effects (low and high tide) in the Port of Cabedelo evolution basin, in the NW-SE direction and that the currents highest speed happens at low tide. The weather characterization showed values within the expected averages. The integration of multi-sources products (digital maps and remote sensors images) appeared to be efficient to describe and set submerged features off which had been not yet noticed on the images.																	1519-1540	2236-5664					2016	17	1					125	143										WOS:000373296400008

Conceptual design of a measurement network of the global change	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The global environment is changing rapidly due to anthropogenic emissions and actions. Such activities modify aerosol and greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, leading to regional and global climate change and affecting, e.g., food and fresh-water security, sustainable use of natural resources and even demography. Here we present a conceptual design of a global, hierarchical observation network that can provide tools and increased understanding to tackle the inter-connected environmental and societal challenges that we will face in the coming decades. The philosophy behind the conceptual design relies on physical conservation laws of mass, energy and momentum, as well as on concentration gradients that act as driving forces for the atmosphere-biosphere exchange. The network is composed of standard, flux and/or advanced and flagship stations, each of which having specific and identified tasks. Each ecosystem type on the globe has its own characteristic features that have to be taken into consideration. The hierarchical network as a whole is able to tackle problems related to large spatial scales, heterogeneity of ecosystems and their complexity. The most comprehensive observations are envisioned to occur in flagship stations, with which the process-level understanding can be expanded to continental and global scales together with advanced data analysis, Earth system modelling and satellite remote sensing. The denser network of the flux and standard stations allows application and up-scaling of the results obtained from flagship stations to the global level.

The methods applied so far typically concentrate on the structure of the overstorey. For various conservation and management applications, however, information on lower layers is also of great interest. Detecting understorey cover by remote sensing is challenging, as passive sensors do not penetrate to the forest ground layer. An alternative to these is 3D metrics from active light detection and ranging (LiDAR). Here, we evaluate this technique for describing the vegetation density of multiple stand layers within the temperate stands of a large protected area in southeastern Germany. We combined LiDAR metrics and information on forest habitat types with regression models to investigate LiDAR metrics that are significantly correlated with vegetation density. The top canopy and the herbal layer showed strong correlations with the applied LiDAR metrics, whereas the predictive power was lower for the intermediate stand layers. Moreover, our results suggest that the relationship between LiDAR predictors and vegetation density depends on the forest type. A comparison of the regression models with random forest predictions showed no major improvement in predictive error. In conclusion, this study highlights the value of the LiDAR metrics for characterizing the structural properties of lower forest layers, which has implications for wildlife and forest management applications, especially in protected areas.

Prioritization of agricultural sub-watersheds in semi arid middle region of Gujarat using remote sensing and GIS	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												In this study, proven capability of remote sensing and GIS are used for watershed prioritization. 19 different sub-watersheds are prioritised through geomorphological analysis and suitable structures are proposed for soil and water conservation in a Limkheda agricultural watershed situated in semi arid middle region of Gujarat, India. Remote sensing images such as SRTM are used to delineate the watershed and to generate slope thematic maps, soil maps are applied to generate soil type, whereas LISS III remote sensing image is used for generating land use maps. Prioritization of sub-watersheds using geomorphological analysis is carried out by seven different linear and shape parameters. Then different sub-watersheds are prioritised by assigning ranks using compound parameter. After prioritization, land use, soil type and land slope categories of sub-watersheds are integrated to propose suitable soil and water conservation structures. In this study, it is proposed that soil conservation measures should be adopted as per the priority assigned to reduce the adverse effect on the land and environment. Overall, it is concluded in this study that delineation of watersheds into sub-watersheds and prioritization of these sub-watersheds are very relevant, helpful and important in semi-arid regions of middle Gujarat, where there is high diversity in agricultural practices and size of land holdings. Adaptation of soil conservation measures priority-wise will not only reduce the soil erosion but also increase the water availability in the surface and as groundwater and will further reduces the possibility of droughts as well as floods and finally environmental hazards.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2016	75	2							137	10.1007/s12665-015-4935-0								WOS:000370240800048

The in situ observed conservation of the stratigraphic sequence of the Turtle Mountain anticline's normal limb in the deposit is interpreted as the consequence of the collapse mode, involving simple shearing of the mass accompanied by a rotational movement, i.e., a "simple shear" parallel to the topography, and a breakage of the hinge, followed by overthrusting of the normal limb on the inverse limb. Coherence between the block size distributions of the source area and the deposit carapace is interpreted as a demonstration of the primary control of preexisting fracturing on the fragmentation processes. Remote-sensing indexes allow us to uncover a priori hidden morphological features preserved on the surface of the deposit, i.e., longitudinal and compressional features, as well as lobes. Their location on the carapace provides evidence of lateral heterogeneity in the propagation, highlighted by three different types of propagation behaviors. This comprehensive study not only provides elements that contribute to an understanding of the Frank Slide rock avalanche, but it also provides insight into essential parameters to take into account in further modeling of these types of phenomena.

Quantification and monitoring of deforestation in India over eight decades (1930-2013)	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												There is still large uncertainty over the status of global forest cover owing to the paucity of comprehensive and holistic studies related to long term forest cover change. The aim of the present work is to prepare a nation-wide multi-date forest cover database which describes and quantifies historical and recent changes in natural forests of India. This analysis facilitated the determination of the state of Indian forest cover changes over last eight decades. Here, we have mapped the total area under forest cover, evaluated the spatial tracking of changes in natural forests, estimated the rate of deforestation and afforestation, analysed the biogeographic zone wise and state wise forest cover change, existing land use in deforested area, influence of environmental factors such as terrain on deforestation and implication of different definitions of forest used by agencies reporting deforestation in India. The results indicated that forests covered an area of 869,012 km(2) in 1930 which has decreased to 625,565 km(2) in 2013, a net loss of 243,447 km(2) (28 %) in eight decades. The highest annual average forest loss was found to be 4795 km(2) during 1930-1975, 1476 km(2) during 1975-1985, 767 km(2) during 1985-1995, 356 km(2) during 1995-2005 and 209 km(2) during 2005-2013. Between 1930 and 1975, forest experienced large scale deforestation at gross annual rate of 0.77 % which has declined to 0.29 % and 0.14 % for the 1975-1985 and 1985-1995 periods respectively. Quantification of annual rate of gross deforestation for the recent period indicates 0.07 % during 1995-2005 and 0.05 % during 2005-2013. The lower rates of deforestation during recent period support effectiveness of conservation measures taken at national level. It was found that deforestation rate has decreased in many biogeographic zones by 2005, except for Andaman & Nicobar Islands and North East. The major deforestation has mostly occurred due to conversion of forests to agriculture. The construction of reservoirs contributed to 4.1 % of forest loss. The tropical forests have experienced large scale deforestation followed by subtropical forests. The findings of the study will be useful to prioritize conservation and protection of forest cover at the regional level. It shall also provide a base for future research on the impacts of deforestation on carbon flux and biodiversity.

J	Wang, T; Zhang, HS; Lin, H; Fang, CY				Wang, Ting; Zhang, Hongsheng; Lin, Hui; Fang, Chaoyang			Textural-Spectral Feature-Based Species Classification of Mangroves in Mai Po Nature Reserve from Worldview-3 Imagery	REMOTE SENSING												The identification of species within an ecosystem plays a key role in formulating an inventory for use in the development of conservation management plans. The classification of mangrove species typically involves intensive field surveys, whereas remote sensing techniques represent a cost-efficient means of mapping and monitoring mangrove forests at large scales. However, the coarse spectral resolution of remote sensing technology has up until recently restricted the ability to identify individual species. The more recent development of very high-resolution spatial optical remote sensing sensors and techniques has thus provided new opportunities for the accurate mapping of species within mangrove forests over large areas. When dealing with the complex problems associated with discriminating among species, classifier performance could be enhanced through the adoption of more intrinsic features; such as textural and differential spectral features. This study explored the effectiveness of textural and differential spectral features in mapping mangrove inter-species obtained from WorldView-3 high-spatial-resolution imagery for mangrove species in Hong Kong. Due to the different arrangement of leaves, the branch density, and the average height and size of plants, we found that the differential spectral features could aid in reducing inner-species variability and increasing intra-species separation. Using a combination of textural and differential spectral features thus represents a promising tool for discriminating among mangrove species. Experimental results suggest that combining these features can greatly improve mapping accuracy, thereby providing more reliable mapping results.

Assessing the distribution and impacts of Prosopis juliflora through participatory approaches	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Invasive species pose global biological and economic challenges. Over the past four decades, Prosopis taxa have emerged as a major invader of the arid and semi-arid regions of the world. Prosopis juliflora, one of the highly invasive Prosopis species, is dominantly present in the Afar region of Ethiopia and continues to spread into the surrounding areas. The objective of this study was to aid the mapping, utilization, and management of the invasive P. juliflora in Afar, by employing participatory research techniques. We assessed the introduction history, impacts, uses, and control strategies of invasive P. juliflora by interviewing 108 pastoralists and agro-pastoralists. In addition, we used Participatory Mapping (PM), Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Global Positioning System (GPS), and remote sensing technologies and approaches to map sites invaded by P. juliflora. Sketch maps were produced by men, women, pastoralist and agro-pastoralist groups. Experts aggregated, scaled and reproduced the sketch maps with support from the Afar communities. We provided GPS and GIS trainings to selected community members who assisted us in collecting the GPS locations of more than 70 key features and landmarks. The sketch maps were digitized and geo-referenced by experts using the 70 GPS records as control points. Geo-referenced community maps were superimposed on pan-sharpened Landsat 8 satellite images and presented to the communities for verification. We overlaid the verified community maps on ancillary land-cover layers, and detected the land-cover classes that were most affected by P. juliflora invasion. Despite its uses as source of fire wood, charcoal, and animal fodder, the species has adverse impacts on native species and livestock resources. Afar communities mapped P. juliflora infestations, particularly those that occurred near their villages, using high and moderate density classes. The two highly invaded land-cover categories were dense grassland, and exposed sand & soils. Participants collaborated in creating the produced maps, suggesting that participatory research approaches are another tool for early detection of invasive species and guiding fine-scale management strategies.

Projected SST trends across the Caribbean Sea based on PRECIS downscaling of ECHAM4, under the SRES A2 and B2 scenarios	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												The Caribbean Sea and adjacent land areas are highly sensitive to the projected impacts of global climate change. The countries bordering the Caribbean Sea depend heavily on coastal and marine assets as a major source of livelihood support. Rising sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are known to be associated with coral bleaching, ocean acidification, and other phenomena that threaten livelihoods in the region. The paucity of SST systematic observations in both the Caribbean Sea and adjoining Western Atlantic waters is a limiting factor in the projection of future climate change impacts on the region's marine resources. Remote sensing of SST by satellites began only within the last three decades and although the data collected so far might be insufficient to provide conclusive definitions of long-term SST variations in the Caribbean waters, these data along with the output from climate model simulations provide a useful basis for gaining further insights into plausible SST futures under IPCC SRES scenarios. In this paper, we examine the recent SST records from the NESDIS AVHRR satellite data and NOAA Optimum Interpolation (OI) sea surface temperature V2 and provide a comparative analysis of projected SST changes for the Caribbean Sea up to the end of the twenty-first century, under the SRES A2 and B2 scenarios' simulations of the sea surface skin temperatures (SSsT) using the Hadley Centre's regional model, PRECIS. The implications of these projected SST changes for bleaching of coral reefs, one of the region's most valuable marine resource, and for rainfall are also discussed.																	0177-798X	1434-4483				JAN	2016	123	1-2					199	215		10.1007/s00704-014-1346-1								WOS:000368715000016

Location: Serra de Arga mountain range, a Natura 2000 protected site in the NW region of Portugal where drastic changes in pastoral activities have occurred over recent decades. Methods: An UAV platform was used to collect very high-resolution (6 cm) images and to produce a DSM (10 cm). From these data, several features were extracted related to colour, band ratios, as well as texture features calculated from colour imagery and surface elevation. Based on a systematic sampling design, field data were collected for both training and validation of a supervised classifier. Extracted features and ground truth training data were combined to calibrate a pixel-based Random forest classifier, with the purpose of devising a habitat map for the entire study area. Map validation was performed to assess classification accuracy, and feature importance metrics were calculated. Results: Validation results revealed good mean overall accuracy (0.89), with some performance decrease in situations of high interspersion of habitat types. The priority habitat type 6230* (Nardus grasslands), defining the vegetation matrix of the test site, obtained 0.96 and 0.91, considering, respectively, producer and user accuracy. In turn, priority habitat type 4020* (Atlantic wet heathlands) recorded 0.68 and 0.77. The obtained habitat map allowed measurement of the extent, description of the spatial arrangement and provided an indication of the conservation condition of target habitat types. Test results regarding the discrimination ability of different features highlighted the importance of surface elevation textures derived from the DSM, followed by band ratios textures and other more complex texture features calculated from colour imagery. Conclusions: Overall, the developed methodology showed promising results for assessing the extent and condition of habitats of high conservation priority in fine-scale, dynamic vegetation mosaics. Future advances in the use of UAV platforms may play an important role in monitoring protected sites and fulfil legal reporting obligations of EU member states, while reducing the costs associated with intensive in-field assessments.

Using remotely sensed data to model suitable habitats for tree species in a desert environment	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												QuestionsCan the species-environment relationship be understood using current remote sensing techniques? Can the derived indicators of remotely sensed data serve as a proxy for variables that affect habitat suitability of plant species? Which remote sensing predictors are best associated with woody species occurrence in a desert environment? How well do models with derived indicators of remotely sensed data predict the occurrence of these species? What are the potential distributions of Ramorinoa girolae, Prosopis spp. and Bulnesia retama in the study area? LocationIschigualasto Provincial Park, San Juan province, Argentina. MethodsWe selected random field points from a Landsat 8 OLI to determine presence/absence of trees species. We calculated Brightness index (BI) using the same image and used this index to calculate texture measures on a 3x3 moving window size. We used the following subset of texture measures: (1) first-order: range, (2) second-order: mean, variance, contrast, entropy, second moment and correlation. We also calculated Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), slope angle and slope aspect from Global Digital Elevation Model. Results and ConclusionSecond-order mean of BI had an important effect on the occurrence of target trees species. TWI was an important variable for Prosopis spp. and B.retama, whereas slope angle was important for R.girolae and B.retama. In addition, the occurrence of R.girolae was affected by second-order variance of BI and slope aspect; and the presence of B.retama was affected by second-order contrast of BI. All the variables that had important effects on the occurrence of tree species provide environmental information about their different habitat requirements; therefore, our findings indicate that the remote sensing data are reliable to derive indicators of tree species presence in our study area.

We analyzed the relationship between the changes in the dominant waterbird populations (Charadriidae, Anatidae, Ardeidae, and Laridae) and the changes in their corresponding habitats from 2000 to 2012. In natural wetlands, the species number of Anatidae was significantly positively correlated with the Scirpus mariqueter (hereafter Scirpus) habitat but significantly negatively correlated with the Phragmites australis (hereafter Phragmites) habitat. The densities of Charadriidae and Laridae were both significantly positively correlated with the deep water habitat but significantly negatively correlated with the Spartina alterniflora (hereafter Spartina) habitat. The density of Charadriidae, however, also exhibited significantly positive correlation with the Scirpus habitat. In the aquaculture ponds, the changes in the density of Anatidae in the winter were significantly negatively correlated with the changes in aquaculture ponds. Other waterbirds only exhibited positive or negative correlation trends with their habitats, which did not reach the statistically significant levels. Consequently, changes in waterbird populations are significantly correlated with changes in natural wetlands and aquaculture ponds in the Chongming Dongtan wetlands. Natural wetlands and aquaculture ponds are important to migratory waterbirds during the peak of migration and wintering. Our results promote the development of wetland management strategies for protecting migratory waterbirds in the coastal area of the Yangtze River.																	1559-2723	1559-2731				JAN	2016	39	1					273	286		10.1007/s12237-015-9991-x								WOS:000367525900021						
J	Uitto, JI				Uitto, Juha I.			Evaluating the environment as a global public good	EVALUATION												Global public goods are defined as non-excludable and non-rivalrous. Global environmental challenges, such as biodiversity conservation or climate change mitigation, fall squarely into this category. This contribution focuses on the specific dimensions of evaluating the provision of global public goods in light of experiences from the Global Environment Facility. As global environmental problems persist, it is important that evaluations focus on the results and impact of our actions beyond the immediate outputs and outcomes of individual projects and programs. It is essential to be able to assess whether these actions are making a difference on the health of the global environment and in the lives of people depending on it. Multiple methods ranging from quantitative to qualitative, and innovations, such as the use of remote sensing and GIS, are needed and have been utilized by the GEF independent evaluation office. The contribution also discusses ways of making global environmental evaluations more influential amongst stakeholders.

J	Valbuena, R; Eerikainen, K; Packalen, P; Maltamo, M				Valbuena, Ruben; Eerikainen, Kalle; Packalen, Petteri; Maltamo, Matti			Gini coefficient predictions from airborne lidar remote sensing display the effect of management intensity on forest structure	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												In this study, two forest sites located in Finland were compared by means of predictions of Gini coefficient (GC) obtained from airborne laser scanning (ALS). We discuss the potential of the proposed method for identifying differences in structural complexity in relation with the management history of forests. The first study site (2200 ha), the Koli National Park (NP), includes areas where human intervention was restricted after 1907, in addition to forests which were protected only after the 1990s. The second study site in the municipality of Kiihtelysvaara (800 ha) has been under intensive management. These are commercial forests which include areas with different types of ownership: a large estate owned by an industrial company together with smaller private properties. We observed that GC predictions may be used to evaluate the effects of management practice on forest structure. Conservation and commercial forests showed significant differences, with the old-protected area of Koli having the highest, and the most intensively managed area in Kiihtelysvaara the lowest GC values. The effect of management history was revealed, as the 1990s' extensions of Koli NP were more similar to unprotected areas than to forests contained within the original borders of the 1907s' state property. Yet, their conservation status for almost two decades has been sufficient for developing significant differences against the outside of the NP. In Kiihtelysvaara, we found significant differences in GC according to the type of ownership. Moreover, the ALS predictions of GC also detected differences near lakeshores, which are driven by limitations on logging governed by Finnish law. Estimating this indicator with ALS remote sensing allowed to observe its spatial distribution and to detect peculiarities which would otherwise be unavailable from field plot sampling. Consequently, the method presented appears to be well suited for monitoring the effects of management practice, as well as verifying its compliance with legal restrictions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Gibbs, MS; Clarke, K; Taylor, B				Gibbs, Matthew Scott; Clarke, Kenneth; Taylor, Ben			Linking spatial inundation indicators and hydrological modelling to improve assessment of inundation extent	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Environmental water requirements (EWRs), including past inundation regimes, provide useful information for the conservation and management of wetlands systems. However, determining past inundation regimes is difficult as very few wetlands have historical records of water level or flow to determine EWRs. Generally, two approaches have been used to reconstruct wetland inundation regimes; remote sensing or hydrological modelling. Remote sensing methods have applied spectral indices of inundation to multi-temporal archival satellite imagery and developed simple empirical models to link inundation extent to rainfall or stream flow records. Hydrological models use a water balance approach and simple relationships between volume and area based on the wetland bathymetry to derive an inundation regime. While remote sensing approaches can provide a high spatial resolution of information, the temporal resolution is limited to an image every few weeks, and the usability of each image is subject to cloud cover. Hydrological models require some data in the region of interest for calibration, and often the model is not sensitive to the inundation variables of interest when calibrating to the data available. A study is presented where this is the case, where good results are achieved by a hydrological model when compared to downstream flow data, but very different wetland inundation regimes can be simulated. Due to this limitation, the remotely-sensed inundation regime was required as another source of information to calibrate the hydrological model, constraining the parameters involved in the modelled wetland storages. The remote-sensing constrained hydrological model provided greater confidence in the representation of processes occurring in the simulated wetland storages, and hence could be considered appropriate to be applied to a validation time period and for scenario testing. The findings of this research support the combination of remotely sensed indicators of inundation and hydrological modelling to increase confidence in the spatial representation of the dynamics of inundation. Understanding wetland inundation dynamics is critical to the understanding and management of threatened wetland ecosystems. Hence, the methods outlined in paper will ultimately assist in informing better management of wetlands. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Digital and real-habitat modeling of Hipparchia statilinus based on hyper spectral remote sensing data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The abandonment of military areas leads to succession processes affecting valuable open-land habitats and is considered to be a major threat for European butterflies. We assessed the ability of hyper spectral remote sensing data to spatially predict the occurrence of one of the most endangered butterfly species (Hipparchia statilinus) in Brandenburg (Germany) on the basis of habitat characteristics at a former military training area. Presence-absence data were sampled on a total area of 36 km(2), and N = 65 adult individuals of Hipparchia statilinus could be detected. The floristic composition within the study area was modeled in a three-dimensional ordination space. Occurrence probabilities for the target species were predicted as niches between ordinated floristic gradients by using Regression Kriging of Indicators. Habitat variance could be explained by up to 81 % with spectral variables at a spatial resolution of 2 x 2 m by transferring PLSR models to imagery. Ordinated ecological niche of Hipparchia statilinus was tested against environmental predictor variables. N = 6 variables could be detected to be significantly correlated with habitat preferences of Hipparchia statilinus. They show that Hipparchia statilinus can serve as a valuable indicator for the evaluation of the conservation status of Natura 2000 habitat type 2330 (inland dunes with open Corynephorus and Agrostis grasslands) protected by the Habitat Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC).

J	Sivakumar, R; Ghosh, S				Sivakumar, R.; Ghosh, Snehasish			Wetland spatial dynamics and mitigation study: an integrated remote sensing and GIS approach	NATURAL HAZARDS												Wetland is a valuable and most important natural resource in the environment. The present research aimed to study the wetland spatial dynamics by analysing the multidated satellite images and to develop a wetland mitigation plan through integrated geoinformatics techniques. The four stages of methodology include data acquisition, thematic database generation, wetland spatial dynamic study and mitigation plan. The satellite data, toposheets and other relevant data were collected from different sources and analysed in the GIS platform to study the spatial dynamics of wetland. The various thematic databases were prepared to better understand the physical environmental features of the study area. The analytical result shows that the total wetland area has reduced from 140.01 to 31.64 km(2) during 1977-2011. Many wetland areas are reduced due to increasing rate of siltation and eutrophication process. Mankind has also stressed wetlands by dumping garbage and industrial waste over the wetland. It further contaminates groundwater and affects human health. Also, the impact of natural factors leads to the depletion of groundwater level, which makes further vulnerable condition to the wetland ecosystems. The thematic databases were integrated with field data to develop wetland mitigation plan for the conservation of existing wetland and the restoration of lost wetland.

Basin-scale spatial soil erosion variability: Pingshuo opencast mine site in Shanxi Province, Loess Plateau of China	NATURAL HAZARDS												Opencast mining and relevant land reclamation measurements can have a large impact on the surrounding landscape by altering vegetation, topography, and subsurface. Mining processes will induce changes in runoff, erosion, surface drainage system, and ecological functions. In this present study, Sanggan River (SGR) watershed with a surface area of about 1480 km(2), which contains Pingshuo mine lying in the central part of this basin, was chosen for applying RUSLE model. RUSLE was applied in conjunction with geographic information systems and remote sensing to estimate erosion risks and assess impacts of mining on the channels and hydrologic system, in order to implement better water and soil conservation and reclamation practices. The RUSLE factors (R, K, LS, C, P) in 3 years, 1986, 2000, and 2013, were computed. Erosion in the study area for each of those years was classified into six grades: slight, light, moderate, intense, severe, and aggressive rates. Topographic factor (LS) and conservation practice factor (P) influenced the erosion to a greater extent and had higher correlation with soil erosion. High soil erosion rate was observed in areas with high terrain alteration, high slopes, and land with sparse vegetation. Hilly areas, grasslands, and the newly constructed mine dumps were more degraded with higher erosion.																	0921-030X	1573-0840				JAN	2016	80	2					1213	1230		10.1007/s11069-015-2019-9								WOS:000367305200026

This study aimed at: (1) mapping the spatial patterns, and (2) quantifying SOC and TN stocks to 30 cm depth in the Eastern Mau Forest Reserve using field, remote sensing, geographical information systems (GIS), and statistical modelling approaches. This is a critical ecosystem offering essential services, but its sustainability is threatened by deforestation and degradation. Results revealed that elevation, silt content, TN concentration, and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager band 11 explained 72% of the variability in SOC stocks, while the same factors (except silt content) explained 71% of the variability in TN stocks. The results further showed that soil properties, particularly TN and SOC concentrations, were more important than that other environmental factors in controlling the observed patterns of SOC and TN stocks, respectively. Forests stored the highest amounts of SOC and TN (3.78 Tg C and 0.38 Tg N) followed by croplands (2.46 Tg C and 0.25 Tg N) and grasslands (0.57 Tg C and 0.06 Tg N). Overall, the Eastern Mau Forest Reserve stored approximately 6.81 Tg C and 0.69 Tg N. The highest estimates of SOC and TN stocks (hotspots) occurred on the western and northwestern parts where forests dominated, while the lowest estimates (coldspots) occurred on the eastern side where croplands had been established. Therefore, the hotspots need policies that promote conservation, while the coldspots need those that support accumulation of SOC and TN stocks.																	1009-637X	1861-9568				JAN	2016	26	1					102	124		10.1007/s11442-016-1257-4								WOS:000366952500008

For a 262.3 km(2) agricultural watershed located in the northwest part of South Korea, the Landsat TM and KOMPSAT-2 could produce 8 and 25 land use classes from spatial resolutions of 30 m and 2 m, respectively. For each land use condition, the SWAT model was calibrated and validated using 8 years (2000-2007) of daily streamflow and monthly sediment, Total Nitrogen (T-N), and Total Phosphorous (T-P) data. The average Nash-Sutcliffe model Efficiencies (NSEs) of streamflow for KOMPSAT-2 and Landsat were 0.80 and 0.71, respectively. The average NSEs of sediment, T-N, and T-P were 0.52, 0.97, and 0.67 for KOMPSAT-2 and 0.30, 0.77, and 0.35 for Landsat, respectively. From the difference in the areal statistics and distribution between the two land uses, the key parameter for streamflow calibration was SCS-CN (Soil Conservation Service-CN). The watershed average SCS-CN value from KOMPSAT-2 was 1.05-fold greater than that from Landsat TM. The larger SCS-CN value increased the surface runoff and subsequently increased the sediment, T-N and T-P transport in the stream.

J	Felardo, J; Lippitt, CD				Felardo, Jeff; Lippitt, Christopher D.			Spatial forest valuation: The role of location in determining attitudes toward payment for ecosystem services policies	FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS												Forests provide many benefits (e.g., esthetics, water purification, habitat carbon sequestration) to humans when they are conserved. However, forest conservation efforts may conflict with other uses, particularly timber harvest. Incentives for forest conservation can be established through payment for ecosystem services (PES) policies. PES policies rely on forest valuation studies which traditionally have valued the whole forest, or characteristics of a forest. Methods that allow variability in estimated forest values over space can provide valuation information at a finer scale and aid in the optimization of PES policies. These spatially explicit values provide information critical to many policy decisions, particularly conservation prioritization and planning. Using moderate resolution satellite remote sensing (i.e., LandSat) and a forest use survey conducted in Kam. Cha i, Thailand, methods to estimate forest product valuation for spatially heterogeneous plots are demonstrated. These estimates are produced using geographic information system (GIS) multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA). The MCDA method combines forest use data with associated travel costs and vegetation cover estimates to provide spatially explicit estimates of forest values. This information is then used to compare local use values against potential carbon credit values estimated from the literature. The results show that a majority of the forest plots have higher PES values than for local forest products. Some do not, however, which suggests a possible cause for resistance against potential PES policies implemented in these areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Land-use and Agricultural Management Practices web-Service (LAMPS) was developed to provide crop rotation and management information for user-specified areas within the 48 contiguous states of the USA. LAMPS links three data sources: (1) annual Cropland Data Layers (CDLs) from the CropScape Web service based on high-resolution remote sensing data for recent years provided by the National Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS), (2) maps of irrigated areas compiled by the U.S. Geological Survey, and (3) the Land Management and Operation Database (LMOD) by the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service containing agricultural management practices. The workflow within LAMPS for generating crop rotation and management information is described in detail, including details of the algorithm for matching annual crop sequences from CropScape to regional rotations in LMOD. Instructions for using the Web service are specified with example input and response listings. A study area of 15 fields in Colorado, USA is presented to demonstrate and evaluate LAMPS outputs using ground observations of crop types. LAMPS automatically detected actual crop rotations with a similarity to the ground observations better than using only CropScape detected dominant crop sequences. LAMPS is available for public use, further nation-wide evaluation, and extension to other spatial data provisioning related to agroecosytem modelling. Published by Elsevier B.V.

JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Groundwater-dependent ecosystems are threatened worldwide by unsustainable groundwater (GW) extraction. This is the case of the Prosopis tamarugo Phil forest in the hyper-arid Atacama Desert (Northern Chile), one of the most extreme ecosystems on Earth. Despite concerns about the conservation of this ecosystem, little research has been done to quantify the effects of the increasing GW depth (GWD) on the Tamarugo population. Here we provide a spatio-temporal assessment of the water condition of Tamarugo trees and propose GWD thresholds for their conservation. We studied spatio-temporal changes of GWD and the water status of the forest using Landsat images and hydrogeological records (1988-2013). This was complemented with a digital inventory and estimation of the green canopy fraction (GCF) of all trees using fine resolution satellite images. Since Tamarugos are solar trackers, their canopy spectral reflectance changes on a diurnal and seasonal basis. Thus, novel remote sensing drought stress indicators were defined: the mean NDVI in winter (NDVIW) accounting for foliage loss and the NDVI difference between mean winter and summer (Delta NDVIW-S) accounting for canopy water loss. NDVIW and Delta NDVIW-S of the Tamarugo forest declined on average 19% and 51%, respectively, while GW depleted on average 3 m over the period 1988-2013. About 730,000 trees were identified in the study area, from which 5.2% showed a GCF < 0.25 associated with severe drought stress. A GWD > 12 m increasingly limited the paraheliotropic leaf movement, leading to dehydration and foliage loss. Tamarugos at 12-16 m GWD suffered moderate drought stress while GWD of 16-20 m implied severe drought stress. We suggest 20 m GWD as a critical threshold for the survival of Tamarugo trees.

The shapes of the urban lakes have been deeply affected by the rapid urbanization in recent decades. This study analyzed the temporal-spatial change of East Lake as the largest urban lake in China using remote sensing images during 1990-2013. Then the STIRPAT model is employed to assess the impact of human activities as driving force on lake changes. The results indicated that the surface area of East Lake showed a slight decrease trend in the first decade and a sharply reduce trend from 2000 to 2013. The accelerated decline trend of landscape shape indexes showed that the shapes complexity of East Lake's water body was decreasing and human intervention was intensifying in the study area. The increasing population and urbanization are found to be the principal driving forces of recession of East Lake ecosystem. And we conclude the driving mechanism of morphological change of urban lake to better understand the reasons of the urban lake change. The conservation of urban lake should be emphasized due to its fragility during rapid urban expansion. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Infestation and outbreak of the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae; HWA) along the eastern coast of the USA, has led to widespread loss of hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr.), and a shift in tree species composition toward hardwood stands. Developing an understanding of the geographic distribution of individual species can inform conservation practices that seek to maintain functional capabilities of ecosystems. Modeling is necessary for understanding changes in forest composition, and subsequent changes in biodiversity, and one that can be implemented at the species level. By integrating the use of remote sensing, modeling, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) coupled with expert knowledge in forest ecology and disturbance, we can advance the methodologies currently available in the literature on predictive modeling. This paper describes an approach to modeling the spatial distribution of the less common but foundational tree species eastern hemlock throughout the state of Maine (similar to 84,000 km(2)) at a high resolution. There are currently no published accuracy assessments on predictive models for high resolution continuous distribution of eastern hemlock relative basal area that span the geographic extent covered by our model, which is at the northern limit of the species' range. A two stage mapping approach was used where presence/absence was predicted with an overall accuracy of 85% and the continuous distribution (percent basal area) was predicted with an accuracy of 84%. Overall, these findings are quite good despite high variability in the training dataset and the general minor component that eastern hemlock represents in the primary forest types in Maine. Eastern hemlock occurs along the southern half of the state stretching the east-west span with little to no occurrence in the northern regions. Several environmental and site characteristics, particularly average yearly maximum and minimum temperatures, were found to be positively correlated with hemlock occurrence. Eastern hemlock dominated stands appeared predominantly in the southwest corner of the state where HWA monitoring efforts can be focused. Given the importance of climate variables in predicting eastern hemlock, forecasts of future range shifts should be possible using data generated from climate scenarios. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Xu, H				Xu, Hao			ASSESSMENT OF CHANGES IN GREEN SPACE OF NANJING CITY USING 1998 AND 2007 LANDSAT SATELLITE DATA.	OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL												Conservation of green space is crucial to the sustainable urban development of China. Nanjing is a central city in the Yangtze River Delta cluster in eastern China. Owing to urbanization, the green spaces in this city have been affected significantly in terms of their scale and structure. Assessing such changes can provide a basis for environmental protection measures and sustainable development. Using Landsat remote-sensing image data from 1998 and 2007, we constructed a distribution map of the patches of green spaces in Nanjing, and analyzed and assessed the changes in scale and spatial layout of the green spaces using various landscape metrics including CA, PLAND, PD, MPS, LPI, NP, PD, TE, ED, MPI, and LSI. Coinciding with a sharp increase in urban population, the area of green spaces in Nanjing decreased by 27.06% between 1998 and 2007. The patches of green space increased by 39%, and the average area per patch decreased by about 47.52%. Green space patches were found to be unevenly distributed among the districts of Nanjing. In urban areas, significant numbers of such patches were found primarily in various types of parks, while in suburban areas, they were concentrated mainly in the hilly forestlands. Green spaces exhibited tendencies towards fragmentation, miniaturization, and discretization.																	0168-2601					DEC	2015	40	4					63	70										WOS:000373433800011

We conducted the present study to examine factors influencing the diversity and spatial distribution of herpetofauna in the Chakwal District (Chakwal Tehsil), Punjab, Pakistan. We gathered data from March 2011 through July 2013 in selected sampling sites of the study area using standard methods. We used satellite images to identify and classify different landscape features. We found that the herpetofaunal diversity varied from 2.07 (unprotected tropical thorn forest) to 0.27 (mixed habitat in a wildlife sanctuary), while evenness oscillated between 1.76 (unprotected tropical thorn forest) and 0.21 (mixed habitat in a wildlife sanctuary). The two units with the highest similarity (0.82) were wetlands inside a protected area and wetlands outside of a protected area. Of the 12 variables tested, the factor analysis produced seven significant variables (r > 0.80) influencing the herpetofauna of the study area. These included hard substrate, water availability, agriculture activities, road network, traffic, road mortality, and habitat conversion. The processed image of the area shows that the area is still dominated by natural vegetation and forest. However, the natural areas are intersected by road networks that make them easily accessible. Changes in the land-use practices such as habitat conversion for residential development, housing schemes, and road development may cause reductions in the diversity of amphibians and reptiles. Data on current diversity and distribution is needed for planning and we have suggested options for herpetofauna conservation and management.																	2151-0733	1931-7603				DEC	2015	10	3					801	810										WOS:000369505400001						
J	Shen, XL; Li, S; Wang, DJ; Lu, Z				Shen, Xiaoli; Li, Sheng; Wang, Dajun; Lu, Zhi			Viable contribution of Tibetan sacred mountains in southwestern China to forest conservation	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												The Tibetan sacred mountains (TSMs) cover a large area and may represent a landscape-scale conservation opportunity. We compared the conservation value of forests in these mountains with the conservation value of government-established nature reserves and unmanaged open-access areas in Danba County, southwestern China. We used Landsat satellite images to map forest cover and to estimate forest loss in 1974-1989, 1989-1999, and 1999-2013. The TSMs (n = 41) and nature reserves (n = 4) accounted for 21.6% and 29.7% of the county's land area, respectively. Remaining land was open-access areas (i.e., areas without any restrictions on resource use) (56.2%) and farmlands (2.2%). Within the elevation range suitable for forests, forest cover did not differ significantly between nature reserves (58.8%) and open-access areas (58.4%), but was significantly higher in TSMs (65.5%) after controlling for environmental factors such as aspect, slope, and elevation. The TSMs of great cultural importance had higher forest cover, but patrols by monastery staff were not necessarily associated with increased forest cover. The annual deforestation rate in nonsacred areas almost tripled in 1989-1999 (111.4 ha/year) relative to 1974-1989 (40.4 ha/year), whereas the rate in TSMs decreased in the later period (19.7 ha/year vs. 17.2 ha/year). The reduced forest loss in TSMs in 1989-1999 was possibly due to the renaissance of TSM worship and strengthened management by the local Buddhist community since late 1980s. The annual deforestation rate in Danba decreased dramatically to 4.4 ha/ year in 1999-2013, which coincided with the implementation of a national ban on logging in 1998. As the only form of protected area across the Tibetan region during much of its history, TSMs have positively contributed to conserving forest at a landscape scale. Conservation of TSM forests largely relied on the strength of local religious institutions. Integrating community-based conservation of TSMs within the government conservation network would benefit the conservation of the Tibetan region.																	0888-8892	1523-1739				DEC	2015	29	6					1518	1526		10.1111/cobi.12587								WOS:000368334800005	26371613					
J	Xu, DD; Guo, XL				Xu, Dandan; Guo, Xulin			Evaluating the impacts of nearly 30 years of conservation on grassland ecosystem using Landsat TM images	GRASSLAND SCIENCE												When grassland degradation became a global issue because of overgrazing and other human activities, grassland managers implemented different management methods in an attempt to restore grassland ecosystems (e.g. conservation actions). Few studies have investigated the impacts of conservation actions (removing large grazers and conserving biodiversity) on grassland ecosystems, therefore, this study aims to evaluate the impacts of conservation actions and to measure the time lag of the significant influences of grassland conservations on mixed grasslands that were assessed by five different biophysical parameters (biodiversity, soil organic matter, fresh biomass, litter cover and green cover). Instead of measuring the biophysical parameters from field data and remotely sensed images, the methodology of this study focused on the difference in biophysical parameters between the ecological comparison sites (grazing sites and conserved sites), which enhance the impacts of grassland conservation on grasslands comparing to grazing management. The results show that: (i) biodiversity in conserved grasslands increased gradually in the first 3-5 years, decreased gradually over the next 4 or 5 years, and then stabilized after that; (ii) soil organic matter increased and reached its maximum value within 7-9 years of conservation and then remained at this level, while litter accumulated the maximum level one year later than soil organic matter; (iii) soil organic matter is the primary factor of biodiversity in the grasslands with low litter accumulation, while high-density litter layers are the primary cause of decreases in biodiversity; (iv) fresh biomass decreased over a period of 7-10 years under conservation and remained nearly unchanged after that; (v) green vegetation fraction was also increased by conservation action in about 6-7 years. The result of this study provides the fundamental information for implementing and adjusting grassland management policies.

Implication of regionalization and connectivity analysis for marine spatial planning and coastal management in the Gulf of Cadiz and Alboran Sea	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												This work proposes a regionalization of marine waters south of the Iberian Peninsula, north Morocco and Algeria based on empirical orthogonal functions and GIS analysis. The regions identified are consistent and correspond to hydrological mesoscale and macroscale structures well characterized from physical and biological viewpoints. Although it is difficult to determine the boundaries of a fluid continuously moving, the procedure used recognizes the most frequent patterns and can be used to geographically reference the most likely position of the limit among the regions. Once established the regions, the connectivity among them is addressed by means of geostrophic currents derived from altimetry data. The main geostrophic circulation pattern depict an elevated connectivity in the area that might facilitate the conservation and recovery of species, but also imply a higher vulnerability to negative external forces and highlight the need of models, marine spatial planning, and coastal management approaches that include the pelagic ecosystem and connectivity of the seas. Furthermore, the results confirm that the cooperation between public authorities at different levels (local, regional, state) as well as among coastal countries is essential for Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) and prevention of potential risk derived from upcoming marine activities in the framework of the 2020 Agenda and Blue Growth Strategy (European Commission, 2012). The recently approved Directive for Marine Spatial Planning and Integrated Coastal Zone Management (European Commission, 2013), with the objective to avoid conflicts among diverse users and guarantees stable environment and sustainable growth, requiring information concerning regionalization and connectivity in the sea, but this information is not always available in all regions, space and time scales. Our approach offers a cheap, fast and universal applicable methodology for mesoscale regionalization and connectivity estimation as a starting point of a nested MSP approach until further detailed oceanographic studies can be carried out at the most interesting points identified in the respective area considered in the MSP.

Yet they are increasingly threatened by deforestation, conversion to agriculture and development, reducing the benefits they provide for local livelihoods, coastal protection and climate change mitigation. Accordingly, accurate estimates of mangrove area and change are fundamental for developing strategies for sustainable use, conservation and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+). The Zambezi River Delta in Mozambique contains one of the largest mangrove forests in Africa, and deforestation has been reported to be substantial, however these estimates vary widely. We used Landsat imagery from 1994, 2000 and 2013, to estimate a total current mangrove area of 37,034 ha, which is a net increase of 3723 ha over 19 years. The land cover change assessment was also used to provide perspective on ecosystem carbon stocks, showing that the Zambezi Delta mangrove ecosystem acts as a large carbon sink. Our findings reinforce the importance of conducting land cover change assessments using coherent data and analytical models, coupled with field validation. Broader application of our approach could help quantify the rates of natural change from erosion and land aggradation contrasted with anthropogenic causes.																	2072-4292					DEC	2015	7	12					16504	16518		10.3390/rs71215838								WOS:000367534000036

Despite the existence of very high-resolution remote sensing technology for nearly two decades, comprehensive assessment of coral reef habitats at national to regional spatial scales and at very high spatial resolution is still scarce. Here, we develop benthic habitat maps at a sub-national scale by analyzing large multispectral QuickBird imagery dataset covering similar to 686 km(2) of the main shallow coral fringing reef along the southern border with Tanzania (4.68 degrees S, 39.18 degrees E) to the reef end at Malindi, Kenya (3.2 degrees S, 40.1 degrees E). Mapping was conducted with a user approach constrained by ground-truth data, with detailed transect lines from the shore to the fore reef. First, maps were used to evaluate the present management system's effectiveness at representing habitat diversity. Then, we developed three spatial prioritization scenarios based on differing objectives: (i) minimize lost fishing opportunity; (ii) redistribute fisheries away from currently overfished reefs; and (iii) minimize resource use conflicts. We further constrained the priority area in each prioritization selection scenario based on optionally protecting the least or the most climate exposed locations using a model of exposure to climate stress. We discovered that spatial priorities were very different based on the different objectives and on whether the aim was to protect the least or most climate-exposed habitats. Our analyses provide a spatially explicit foundation for large-scale conservation and management strategies that can account for ecosystem service benefits.

J	Aneece, I; Epstein, H				Aneece, Itiya; Epstein, Howard			Distinguishing Early Successional Plant Communities Using Ground-Level Hyperspectral Data	REMOTE SENSING												Abandoned agricultural fields have recently become more abundant in the U.S. and remain susceptible to species invasions after cultivation disturbance. As invasive species become more widespread with increases in anthropogenic activities, we need more effective ways to use limited resources for conservation of native ecosystems. Remote sensing can help us monitor the spread and effects of invasive species, and thus determine the species and locations to target for conservation. To examine this potential, we studied plant communities dominated by exotic invasive plant species in secondary successional fields in northern Virginia using ground-level hyperspectral data. Within these communities, ordination analyses of vegetation surveys revealed differences in species compositions among plots and fields. These differences among communities were also observed in the spectral data. Stepwise multiple linear regression analyses to determine which species influenced the ordination axes revealed that many of the influential species are considered invasive, again underscoring the influence of invasive species on community properties. Stepwise regression analyses also revealed that the most influential wavelengths for discrimination were distributed along the spectral profile from the visible to the near-infrared regions. A discriminant analysis using wavelengths selected with a principal components analysis demonstrated that different plant communities were separable using spectral data. These spectrally observable differences suggest that we can use hyperspectral data to distinguish among invasive-dominated successional plant communities in this region.

In areas with poor drainage, human-induced forest fires and logging can produce flooded conditions and organic matter accumulation, which generates an ecosystem called anthropogenic peatland. Productive management activities such as Sphagnum moss harvesting and livestock grazing take place there. Our hypothesis was that productive management has a strong impact on the aboveground C reservoir and increases the presence of exotic species. We established 44 sampling points in a 16-ha anthropogenic peatland on Chiloe Island, Chile, comparing productive and conservation types of managements. Carbon stocks, vegetation structure and composition variables were quantified. These variables were used to classify the ecosystem into microsites to analyze the different locations in the peatland. In addition, predictive models of aboveground carbon were created using Landsat 8 OLI and Pleiades images. The results revealed a carbon stock of 11.99 +/- 0.77 kg C m(-2), which is smaller than in natural peatlands, and showed a wide variability of conditions within the peatland itself. This variability, mainly expressed in aboveground carbon, produces microsites dominated by either shrubs, species of the genus Juncus or grasses. Productive management reduced accumulated carbon in the aboveground stock and in the woody debris. However, the strongest impact was found on the vegetation variables, with a decrease in total cover, cover of shrubs and herbaceous plants, and in vegetation height. There was also an increase in the richness and presence of exotic species. The spatial prediction of aboveground carbon yielded significant results using only spectral indices, showing also that the impact of productive management is not homogenous, being less intense in waterlogged areas. This study is the first to quantify carbon reservoirs in this type of ecosystem and to propose variables that can be used as indicators of the impact of human activities.

We summarize the role of remote sensing (both satellite and aircraft) for observational monitoring of forests, including measuring changes in their current and past extent for setting baselines, their carbon stock density for estimating emissions in areas that are deforested or degraded, and their regrowth dynamics following disturbance. We emphasize the synergistic role of integrating field inventory measurements with remote sensing for best practices in monitoring, reporting and verification. We also address the potential of remote sensing for enforcing safeguards on conservation of natural forests and biodiversity. We argue that capabilities exist now to meet operational needs for REDD+ measurement, reporting, and verification and reference levels. For some other areas of importance for REDD+, such as safeguards for natural forests and biodiversity, monitoring capabilities are approaching operational in the near term. For all REDD+ needs, measurement capabilities will rapidly advance in the next few years as a result of new technology as well as advances in capacity building both within and outside of the tropical forest nations on which REDD+ is primarily focused.

J	Levin, N; Kark, S; Crandall, D				Levin, Noam; Kark, Salit; Crandall, David			Where have all the people gone? Enhancing global conservation using night lights and social media	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Conservation prioritization at large scales is complex, combining biological, environmental, and social factors. While conservation scientists now more often aim to incorporate human-related factors, a critical yet unquantified challenge remains: to identify which areas people use for recreation outside urban centers. To address this gap in applied ecology and conservation, we developed a novel approach for quantifying human presence beyond populated areas by combining social media "big data" and remote sensing tools. We used data from the Flickr photo-sharing website as a surrogate for identifying spatial variation in visitation globally, and complemented this estimate with spatially explicit information on stable night lights between 2004 and 2012, used as a proxy for identifying urban and industrial centers. Natural and seminatural areas attracting visitors were defined as areas both highly photographed and non-lit. The number of Flickr photographers within protected areas was found to be a reliable surrogate for estimating visitor numbers as confirmed by local authority censuses (r = 0.8). Half of all visitors' photos taken in protected areas originated from under 1% of all protected areas on Earth (250 of 27 000). The most photographed protected areas globally included Yosemite and Yellowstone National Parks (USA), and the Lake and Peak Districts (UK). Factors explaining the spatial variation in protected areas Flickr photo coverage included their type (e.g., UNESCO World Heritage sites have higher visitation) and accessibility to roads and trails. Using this approach, we identified photography hotspots, which draw many visitors and are also unlit (i.e., are located outside urban centers), but currently remain largely unprotected, such as Brazil's Pantanal and Bolivia's Salar de Uyuni. The integrated big data approach developed here demonstrates the benefits of combining remote sensing sources and novel geo-tagged and crowd-sourced information from social media in future efforts to identify spatial conservation gaps and pressures in real time, and their spatial and temporal variation globally.

J	Kusimi, JM				Kusimi, John Manyimadin			Characterizing land disturbance in Atewa Range Forest Reserve and Buffer Zone	LAND USE POLICY												Changes in land cover of protected areas and their buffers have serious implications on the conservation of biodiversity within such biomes because land use has been recognized as one of the major drivers of biodiversity change. Atewa Range Forest Reserve is one of Ghana's Upper Guinea Forests declared as a Globally Significant Biodiversity Area (GSBA). But the reserve is under threat from several human disturbances which could impact on the land cover of the reserve.This study examined the spatial and temporal changes in land cover of Atewa Range Forest Reserve and it's buffer between 1986 and 2013 using remote sensing. Land use and land cover (LULC) classification and change detections were undertaken using one Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) image of 1986 and Landsat ETM+ images of 2003 and 2013.The study also investigated the driving forces of LULC and the effectiveness of the Forest and Wildlife Policy of 1994 in the management of the reserve. Results of image classification showed that much of the peripheral closed and open vegetative covers have been converted to farms and bushes with little disturbance within the interior of the reserve. The study revealed that, the conservation management policies were yielding very little results due to a number of policy deficiencies including low staff strength, lack of logistics and low remuneration. Enforcement of legal instruments against illegal logging, small scale mining and farming activities within the reserve, improvement in the staff strength and their condition of service, intensification of public education on the value of forest and the need to protect it are some of the major recommendations that could curb encroachment on the reserve.

J	Diaz-Paniagua, C; Aragones, D				Diaz-Paniagua, Carmen; Aragones, David			Permanent and temporary ponds in Donana National Park (SW Spain) are threatened by desiccation	LIMNETICA												In Donana National Park, most aquatic habitats are temporary. Ponds dry up during the summer, and are filled again when phreatic levels rise after heavy rains. Permanent and semipermanent ponds, and a chain of long-hydroperiod ponds are formed in an area of the park where discharges of the dune and regional aquifers coincide. Over the last few decades, groundwater abstractions have severely affected the park. Using Landsat images (1975-2014), we estimated the variation in the inundated areas of the park's largest ponds. All ponds have increased their dependency on annual rainfall in recent decades. Two seasonal ponds located close to urban pumping stations are currently dry. We found that other seasonal ponds have tended to have shorter hydroperiod and have dried up in the summer in recent years, including in very rainy years. The largest permanent pond had not such wide interannual fluctuations in its inundated area in the 1970s as those experienced recently. During the last decades, its inundated area is strongly correlated with annual rainfall, and the pond is close to desiccation in years of low rainfall. These results show that this pond network is severely threatened by desiccation. It is urgent to control groundwater extraction in the area to preserve the integrity of this important wetland.

J	Nost, E				Nost, Eric			Performing nature's value: software and the making of Oregon's ecosystem services markets	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A												Geographers of technology illustrate software code's contexts, effects, and agencies as they shape urban space and everyday life, but the consequences of code for nature remain understudied. Political ecologists have critiqued remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) based conservation projects, but have not engaged more broadly with the role of software in the contested production, circulation, and application of ecological knowledge. Yet, around the world, data analytics firms and conservation nonprofits argue for optimizing environmental management through faster and bigger data collection and new techniques of data manipulation and visualization. I present a case study from the US state of Oregon, illustrating how conservationists and environmental regulators employ computer programming to plan markets in which entrepreneurs restore stream and wetland ecosystem services to earn offset credits. In these markets, code-executed algorithms constituting spreadsheets, web maps, and GIS utilities generate, relate, and make sense of the data that define credit commodities. I argue that code tends toward three effects: producing a landscape defined by wetlands' modeled value, performing social relations associated with nature's neoliberalization and financialization, and legitimating these moves. Although emphasis on the performativity of code and other technological objects is warranted, the contexts in which these are authored, deployed, and evaluated should remain central to understanding environmental governance. This is to caution against seeing technology as reducing nature and society to state or capitalist rationalities and to hesitate to differentiate prima facie code's work on space and on nature. I call for bridging political ecology and geographies of technology in ways that can explain how code is generative of environmental knowledge, change, and conflict.																	0308-518X	1472-3409				DEC	2015	47	12					2573	2590		10.1177/0308518X15616631								WOS:000366667200011

Nationwide classification of forest types of India using remote sensing and GIS	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												India, a mega-diverse country, possesses a wide range of climate and vegetation types along with a varied topography. The present study has classified forest types of India based on multi-season IRS Resourcesat-2 Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) data. The study has characterized 29 land use/land cover classes including 14 forest types and seven scrub types. Hybrid classification approach has been used for the classification of forest types. The classification of vegetation has been carried out based on the ecological rule bases followed by Champion and Seth's (1968) scheme of forest types in India. The present classification scheme has been compared with the available global and national level land cover products. The natural vegetation cover was estimated to be 29.36 % of total geographical area of India. The predominant forest types of India are tropical dry deciduous and tropical moist deciduous. Of the total forest cover, tropical dry deciduous forests occupy an area of 2,17,713 km(2) (34.80 %) followed by 2,07,649 km(2) (33.19 %) under tropical moist deciduous forests, 48,295 km(2) (7.72 %) under tropical semievergreen forests and 47,192 km(2) (7.54%) under tropical wet evergreen forests. The study has brought out a comprehensive vegetation cover and forest type maps based on inputs critical in defining the various categories of vegetation and forest types. This spatially explicit database will be highly useful for the studies related to changes in various forest types, carbon stocks, climate-vegetation modeling and biogeochemical cycles.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				DEC	2015	187	12							777	10.1007/s10661-015-4990-8								WOS:000365871600052	26615560					
J	Mohammad, FS; Adamowski, J				Mohammad, Fawzi S.; Adamowski, Jan			Interfacing the geographic information system, remote sensing, and the soil conservation service-curve number method to estimate curve number and runoff volume in the Asir region of Saudi Arabia	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Runoff coefficients are widely used as a diagnostic variable of runoff generation in process studies and as an important input parameter in hydrologic design. Many regions of Saudi Arabia do not have sufficient historical records and the detailed runoff information needed for physically based distribution models. The US Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service Curve Number (USDA-NRCS-CN) method was used in this study for determining the curve number and runoff depth for Asir region, Saudi Arabia. Runoff curve number was determined based on the factors of hydrologic soil group, land use and land cover, and slope gradient in the Asir region of Saudi Arabia using the geographic information system (GIS). The region was not subjected before for any previous studies concerning runoff generation or rainwater harvesting by using GIS and remote sensing. ArcGIS 9.3 and the global positioning system were used to develop the soil map on the basis of samples collected during a field survey. Soil textures were identified and used to build a map of the hydrological soil groups. Unsupervised and supervised classification of Landsat images was used to generate land use and land cover maps. The land cover distribution in the study area revealed that the largest class in the area, barren and sparsely vegetated land, occupied 62,832.38 km(2) of the study area (more than 80 % of the total area), followed by shrubland (15,212.66 km(2)), cropland and pasture (52.34 km(2)), mixed shrubland/grassland (40.89 km(2)), and grassland (12.27 km(2)). Built-up land occupied only 11.45 km(2). The slope map for the Asir region was generated from a 15-m digital elevation model. The GIS technique was used to develop the CN for the region based on the Soil Conservation Service method. The annual runoff depth was derived from the annual rainfall and CN per pixel using the raster calculator tool in ArcGIS. The rainfall distribution in the study area showed the wise identification of suitable sites for rainwater harvesting, as most of the constructed dams were located in the areas with higher rainfall. The analysis also revealed that the annual runoff for the study area ranged from 27 to 69 % of the total rainfall, with variation as low as 80 to 300 mm/year. This is the highest amount of runoff that can be generated in Saudi Arabia. The runoff volume was calculated for the entire region using the previously developed runoff depth map and basin areas. The results showed that the runoff volume (M3) in the Asir region varied from as low as 237,000 m(3) to a maximum of 2,140,000 m(3); this result revealed a significant yearly amount of runoff that can be harvested for any use. Moreover, the calculated runoff depth in the area agreed with the actual dam capacities for the existing dams in the Asir region. This approach can be applied in other regions in Saudi Arabia for rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				DEC	2015	8	12					11093	11105		10.1007/s12517-015-1994-1								WOS:000365450800065

In this study, we investigated the diversity and patterns of wild landscapes in relation to ecological factors, human disturbances and land protection regime in the Mo river basin (Central Togo). First, we used geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing techniques to quantify and spatially explicit the major land cover types occurring in the area. We performed a supervised classification of Landsat 8 image from 2014. Next, we used vegetation ordination and classification methods to detect vegetation group types and their similarity level from forest inventory data collected at 75 sites. Data from soil samples at the 75 sites and DEM-based topographical indices were used as biophysical variables to analyze factors of current landscape structure. Both satellite image classification and the outputs from ordination methods indicated that three major vegetation types (forestlands, woodlands and savannahs/shrubs) occurred in protected (PA) and unprotected (UPA) areas. Image classification showed that savannahs/shrubs are the most widespread vegetation types (54.4%) while forestlands and woodlands cover 10.4% and 26.4% of the total area, respectively. UPA showed high rates of human disturbances that shaped the occurrence of a fourth vegetation type made up mainly by degraded savannahs and woodlands. Along the land protection gradient, the landscapes are driven by soil nutrients and moisture, in combination with the influence of topography and human disturbances. In both PA and UPA, and along protection gradient, majority of features exhibited significant differences among plant communities. The spatial analyses combined with the field data providing information on vegetation cover, species richness, and human footprint indices suggested that some areas outside protection still exhibit high potentials for land conservation. In multifunctional landscapes of Mo basin, conservation strategies could also be encouraged in the wild landscapes of community common lands to promote both biodiversity conservation and sustainable provision of ecosystem services.

We sampled saproxylic beetles with window traps on fresh aspen dead wood and conducted field surveys of dead wood in the surroundings (1, 2 and 3 km radius). In addition, we used maps derived from satellite imagery to extract data on forest age and volume for the same surroundings. We found that species richness of saproxylic beetles was related to dead wood volume estimated by field survey within 1 or 2 km radius from the trapping points. However, the map-derived variable describing area of forest with high levels of deciduous wood volume was the overall best predictor of species richness. The scale of response to this variable differed; species richness of all saproxylic beetles was best predicted by estimates for the 2 km radius whereas richness of species more strongly associated with aspen was best predicted by estimates for the 3 km radius. This might indicate that aspen-associated beetles disperse over larger distances than many other beetles; possibly an adaptation to the scattered distribution and ephemeral nature of aspen dead wood in boreal forests. Our results show that substrate variables must be measured at the scale that is ecologically relevant for the study organism to elicit a response. We also show that remote sensing data -often easy to obtain for large scales-can be used to complement studies of scale-specific responses and thus improve conservation measures for saproxylic beetle species.

The winter-flooded rice fields in the Qinling Mountains, China, are the last refuge for the endangered Asian crested ibis (Nipponia nippon), and intensive efforts have been made to protect this anthropogenic habitat. Analyses of multi-temporal satellite data indicate that winter-flooded rice fields have been continuously reduced across the current range of crested ibis during the past two decades. The rate of loss of these fields in the core-protected areas has unexpectedly increased to a higher level than that in non-protected areas in the past decade. The best fit (R (2) = 0.87) numerical response model of the crested ibis population shows that a reduction of winter-flooded rice fields decreases population growth and predicts that the population growth will be constrained by the decline of traditional winter-flooded rice fields in the coming decades. Our findings suggest that the decline of traditional rice farming is likely to continue to pose a threat to the long-term survival and recovery of the crested ibis population in China.

H.; Cai Chongfa; Zhu Dun			Assessing soil erosion hazard -a raster based GIS approach with spatial principal component analysis (SPCA)	EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS												Soil erosion is one of the most serious environmental problems affecting the quality of soil, land, and water resources upon which humans depend for their sustenance. A soil erosion hazard map is highly useful for environmental planning, soil conservation and management in soil erosion prone areas. In order to assess the soil erosion hazard, remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) technologies were adopted, and a numerical model was developed using spatial principal component analysis (SPCA). Here, an integrated soil erosion hazard index (SEHI) was computed and classified into four levels of soil erosion hazard viz. low, average, high, and very high. In the process, nine factors were selected together with the degree of importance of the factors in hazard of the soil erosion. Integrated RS and GIS techniques and models were applied to generate the necessary factors for the SPCA approach. In addition, erosion hazard and calculated rate of soil erosion were used to find out the risk of soil erosion. Soil erosion risk was identified as actual occurrence and potential risk. Results show that, in general, an average hazardous condition of soil erosion was found in the area. The potential risk was more extensive in terms of involved area compared to the actual occurrence, and both actual occurrence and potential risk were higher at the mid-level elevation of the area. This study highlighted that priority should be given where the actual occurrence is high to very high and the probability of potential risk is average to high for protecting the land at present and in the future as well. Therefore, the application of SPCA combined with RS and GIS provided an effective methodology to solve the complex decisional problem for soil erosion hazard and risk assessment.

Out of various types of issues, coverage and connectivity is one of the unsolved issues till date in wireless sensor network that potentially degrade the efficient performance capability of the applications in wireless sensor network. This paper introduces a graph based coverage and connectivity technique (GCCT) that is aimed to attain better optimization of coverage and connectivity issues in large scale wireless sensor network considering the issues of energy depletion factor. A model is developed considering the radio and energy model of hierarchical routing protocol and a new module is introduced called as super-leader node, which aims to attain energy efficiency at a same time.

Algorithms were tested using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images and historical ground-truth observations collected from August 2002 to December 2011. A total of 2323 phytoplankton cell count samples collected by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) matched valid ocean color satellite observations over this period. Techniques were tested using the F-measure (FM) statistic. FM evaluates the proportion of image pixels that matches or misclassifies ground-based K. brevis observations. Several ocean color data products, such as normalized Fluorescence Line Height (nFLH), were also tested independently or combined to evaluate their effectiveness to detect K. brevis blooms. Techniques were optimized by altering their specific thresholds until the maximum FM was obtained. The historical techniques with the best performance were the Red Band Difference (RBD) and the R-rs-nFLH technique. This last method (R-rs-nFLH) is a combination of two standard ocean color data products: nFLH (>0.033 mW cm(-2) mu m(-1) sr(-1) ) and the remote sensing reflectance at 555 nm (R(rs)555 <0.007 sr(-1)). Both techniques resulted in an FM of 0.62 and less than 3% false positives. The performance of most of the techniques improved significantly after optimization (the average FM increased from 0.47 to 0.57). The addition of a nFLH criterion improved the performance of most methods. We provide a list of recommendations on how to best apply the various techniques. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we review recent studies that utilize remote sensing to understand the supply and demand of ecosystem services, with a specific focus on pollination services by bees in forested and agroforestry contexts. Pollination by bees is a globally threatened ecosystem service that supports the production of food crops and maintains plant biodiversity. We explore how studies that use remote sensing to characterize landscapes, monitor individual organisms, measure biodiversity proxies or species habitat, and describe ecosystem processes may improve modeling of pollination services on spatial scales that match large-scale management efforts, such as forest conservation policy. We then discuss future research opportunities, such as exploring LiDAR and radar for 3-D habitat measurements, mapping phenology in space and time, and direct measurement of pollination events and outcomes.																	2198-6436					DEC	2015	1	4					261	274		10.1007/s40725-015-0024-6								WOS:000218418900004

We present results showing the distribution and structure of forest landscapes across protected areas in two states (Cross River and Delta) within the Niger Delta using multi-temporal remote sensing. Satellite images were classified and validated using ground data, existing maps, Google Earth, and historic aerial photographs over 1986, 2000 and 2014. The total area of forest landscape for 1986, 2000 and 2014 across the identified protected areas were 535,671 ha, 494,009 ha and 469,684 ha (Cross River) and 74,631 ha, 68,470 ha and 58,824 ha (Delta) respectively. The study showed annual deforestation rates for protected areas across both states from 1986 to 2000 were 0.8%. However, the overall annual deforestation rate between 2000 and 2014 was higher in Delta (1.9%) compared to Cross River (0.7%). This study shows accelerated levels of forest fragmentation across protected areas in both states as a side effect of the prevalence of agricultural practices and unsupervised urbanisation. The results show the need for government intervention and policy implementation, in addition to efforts by local communities and conservation organisations in protected area management across ecologically fragile areas of Nigeria.																	2076-3298					DEC	2015	2	4					500	520		10.3390/environments2040500								WOS:000214774300005

Shared Ligands Between Organic Anion Transporters (OAT1 and OAT6) and Odorant Receptors	DRUG METABOLISM AND DISPOSITION												The multispecific organic anion drug transporters OAT6 (SLC22A20) and OAT1 (SLC22A6) are expressed in nasal epithelial cells and both can bind odorants. Sequence analysis of OAT6 revealed an evolutionarily conserved 79-amino acid (AA) fragment present not only in OAT6 but also in other SLC22 transporters, such as the organic anion transporter (OAT), organic carnitine transporter (OCTN), and organic cation transporter (OCT) subfamilies. A similar fragment is also conserved in some odorant receptors (ORs) in both humans and rodents. This fragment is located in regions believed to be important for ligand/substrate preference and recognition in both classes of proteins, raising the possibility that it may be part of a potential common ligand/substrate recognition site in certain ORs and SLC22 transporters. In silico screening of an odorant database containing known OR ligands with a pharmacophore hypothesis (generated from a set of odorants known to bind OAT6 and/or OAT1), followed by in vitro uptake assays in transfected cells, identified OR ligands capable of inhibiting OAT6-and/or OAT1-mediated transport, albeit with different affinities. The conservation of the AA fragments between these two different classes of proteins, together with their coexpression in olfactory as well as other tissues, suggests the possibility that ORs and SLC22 transporters function in concert, and raises the question as to whether these transporters function in remote sensing and signaling and/or as transceptors.																	0090-9556	1521-009X				DEC	2015	43	12					1855	1863		10.1124/dmd.115.065250								WOS:000364000000003	26358290					
J	Chen, L; Han, Z				Chen, Lin; Han, Zhen			Study of the Influence of the Deep-Water Channel Project in the Yangtze River Estuary on Ecological Landscape and Fractal Dimensions of Jiuduan Shoal Tidal Channels	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The Jiuduan Shoal has the most extensive tidal channel system in the Yangtze River estuary diara, and the construction of the Deep-Water Channel Project in the Yangtze River estuary has had a significant effect on the distribution and morphology of tidal channels. Taking tidal channels in the Jiuduan Shoal in Yangtze River estuary as a research object, using remote sensing data which was extracted from 1997 to 2013, we analyzed the influence of the Deep-Water Channel Project in the Yangtze River estuary on the ecological landscape of Jiuduan Shoal tidal channels by using landscape indexes such as Total Class Area (CA), Number of Patches (NP), Patch Density (PD), Percentage of Landscape (PLAND), Landscape Shape Index (LSI), Fractal Dimension Index (FRAC), and Largest Patch Index (LPI). Graded tidal channels by using the principle of Horton - Strahler of image of 2013. We found that, in the 1st and the 2nd phase of the project, the proportion of the tidal channel area increased compared to the previous period, but by the end of the 2nd phase project in 2013, the proportion of the total landscape area made up of tidal channels accounted for less in successive years; NP, PD, LSI, and LPI fluctuated in the first phase of Deep-Water Channel Project, after this tidal channels of Jiuduan Shoal maintained the same trend, namely, the tidal channels aggregation degree decreased year by year. The distribution of tidal channels tended toward separation which shows that the tidal channels fragmentation is increasing year by year. By the end of the third phase of construction, the shape of the tidal channels became gradually different and tended to be more discrete. The shape complexity increased and the tidal channels became more and more mature and complicated and can be seen in the same grade of Jiuduan Shoal tidal channels, which on the left side of the dimensions change range are greater than the right, namely, the tidal channels on the left side are more complex than the right. In different grades of of tidal channels, the change range of the minimum width is little, but the maximum is quite large. There is little relevance between the changes in the width of the different grades of tidal channels and its fractal dimension difference values between the left and right sides. In different grades of tidal channels, whether left or right, the fractal dimension values increase with the average width and grade number of tidal channels.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				WIN	2015					73		146	154		10.2112/SI73-026.1								WOS:000351538400027

To make effective conservation and management, it is essential to understand the wetlands' distribution and changes. In this study, an approach based on decision rules algorithm in conjunction with maximum likelihood classification is proposed for coastal wetland mapping using multi-temporal remotely sensed imagery and ancillary geospatial data. As a case study, Multi-temporal Advanced Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer type 2 images acquired by Japanese Advanced Land Observation Satellite are analysed to investigate the seasonal change pattern of coastal wetlands in Washington State, USA. Geospatial data, including Digital Elevation Model and spatial neighbourhood knowledge, are further integrated to characterize wetland features and discriminate classes within a certain elevation ranges. The final result is a refined coastal wetland map with 15 land cover categories. Preliminary evaluation of the final result shows that the proposed approach is effective in coastal wetland mapping.																	1010-6049	1752-0762				NOV 26	2015	30	10					1172	1188		10.1080/10106049.2015.1034194								WOS:000360656000007

Tsetse control is a key component for the integrated management of both plagues, but local eradication successes have been limited to less than 2% of the infested area. This is attributed to either resurgence of residual populations that were omitted from the eradication campaign or reinvasion from neighboring infested areas. Here we focused on Glossina palpalis gambiensis, a riverine tsetse species representing the main vector of trypanosomoses in West Africa. We mapped landscape resistance to tsetse genetic flow, hereafter referred to as friction, to identify natural barriers that isolate tsetse populations. For this purpose, we fitted a statistical model of the genetic distance between 37 tsetse populations sampled in the region, using a set of remotely sensed environmental data as predictors. The least-cost path between these populations was then estimated using the predicted friction map. The method enabled us to avoid the subjectivity inherent in the expert-based weighting of environmental parameters. Finally, we identified potentially isolated clusters of G. p. gambiensis habitat based on a species distribution model and ranked them according to their predicted genetic distance to the main tsetse population. The methodology presented here will inform the choice on the most appropriate intervention strategies to be implemented against tsetse flies in different parts of Africa. It can also be used to control other pests and to support conservation of endangered species.

We assessed the potential of high-resolution satellite imagery for generating habitat covariates using camera-trapping data from Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, within an occupancy framework. We tested the predictive power of covariates generated from satellite imagery at different resolutions and extents (focal patch sizes, 10-500 m around sample points) on estimates of occupancy patterns of six small to medium sized mammal species/species groups. High-resolution land cover information had considerably more model support for small, patchily distributed habitat features, whereas it had no advantage for large, homogeneous habitat features. A comparison of different focal patch sizes including remote sensing data and an in-situ measure showed that patches with a 50-m radius had most support for the target species. Thus, high-resolution satellite imagery proved to be particularly useful in heterogeneous landscapes, and can be used as a surrogate for certain in-situ measures, reducing field effort in logistically challenging environments. Additionally, remote sensed data provide more flexibility in defining appropriate spatial scales, which we show to impact estimates of wildlife-habitat associations.																	2045-2322					NOV 24	2015	5								17041	10.1038/srep17041								WOS:000365205700001	26596779					
J	Stephens, D; Diesing, M				Stephens, David; Diesing, Markus			Towards Quantitative Spatial Models of Seabed Sediment Composition	PLOS ONE												There is a need for fit-for-purpose maps for accurately depicting the types of seabed substrate and habitat and the properties of the seabed for the benefits of research, resource management, conservation and spatial planning. The aim of this study is to determine whether it is possible to predict substrate composition across a large area of seabed using legacy grain-size data and environmental predictors. The study area includes the North Sea up to approximately 58.44 degrees N and the United Kingdom's parts of the English Channel and the Celtic Seas. The analysis combines outputs from hydrodynamic models as well as optical remote sensing data from satellite platforms and bathymetric variables, which are mainly derived from acoustic remote sensing. We build a statistical regression model to make quantitative predictions of sediment composition (fractions of mud, sand and gravel) using the random forest algorithm. The compositional data is analysed on the additive log-ratio scale. An independent test set indicates that approximately 66% and 71% of the variability of the two log-ratio variables are explained by the predictive models. A EUNIS substrate model, derived from the predicted sediment composition, achieved an overall accuracy of 83% and a kappa coefficient of 0.60. We demonstrate that it is feasible to spatially predict the seabed sediment composition across a large area of continental shelf in a repeatable and validated way. We also highlight the potential for further improvements to the method.

J	Tun, KKK; Shrestha, RP; Datta, A				Tun, Kyawt K. K.; Shrestha, Rajendra P.; Datta, Avishek			Assessment of land degradation and its impact on crop production in the Dry Zone of Myanmar	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY												Land degradation in terms of soil degradation is a major environmental issue posing threat to sustainable livelihood in the semi-arid region of Central Myanmar. However, the studies on soil degradation status and its impacts in this region are very scanty. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of land degradation on crop production both in terms of area and yield in the Dry Zone of Myanmar. Remote sensing and geographic information system-based modelling was utilized to assess and map soil erosion rates. Household survey was conducted to understand the causes of land degradation and its impacts on crop productivity and livelihoods. It has been found out that the current rate of soil erosion ranged from 0 to 114tha(-1) yr(-1), and that the average rate of soil erosion increased from 14.2 to 54.6tha(-1) yr(-1) over a period from 2000 to 2012. The major types of land degradation were physical and chemical soil degradation. Farmers identified topographic condition, soil types, improper crop management practices and climatic factors as the main causes of soil erosion. The observed crop yields of monsoon rice, groundnut, sesame and cotton in the highly degraded area were 3-12 times lower compared with the yields of these crops grown in less degraded area. Livelihoods of the farmers in the high-degraded area were affected by crop yield reduction, increased cultivation cost and increased uncultivable land area. The impact of land degradation on crop production was dependent on the severity of degradation. This suggests that advanced conservation measures are immediately required and the supportive policy strategies need to be implemented to educate farmers and to strengthen extension services for sustainable land management in the Dry Zone of Myanmar.

The advent of new high resolution multispectral sensors with unique bands has provided an opportunity to map the spatial distribution of detailed LULC classes over a large fragmented area. The objectives of the present study were: (1) to map LULC classes using multispectral WorldView-2 (WV-2) data and SVM in a fragmented ecosystem; and (2) to compare the accuracy of three WV-2 spectral data sets in distinguishing amongst various LULC classes in a fragmented ecosystem. WV-2 image was spectrally resized to its four standard bands (SB: blue, green, red and near infrared-1) and four strategically located bands (AB: coastal blue, yellow, red edge and near infrared-2). WV-2 image (8bands: 8B) together with SB and AB subsets were used to classify LULC using support vector machines. Overall classification accuracies of 78.0% (total disagreement = 22.0%) for 8B, 51.0% (total disagreement = 49.0%) for SB, and 64.0% (total disagreement = 36.0%) for AB were achieved. There were significant differences between the performance of all WV-2 subset pair comparisons (8B versus SB, 8B versus AB and SB versus AB) as demonstrated by the results of McNemar's test (Z score >= 1.96). This study concludes that WV-2 multispectral data and the SVM classifier have the potential to map LULC classes in a fragmented ecosystem. The study also offers relatively accurate information that is important for the indigenous forest managers in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa for making informed decisions regarding conservation and management of LULC patterns.																	2225-8531					NOV	2015	4	4					414	433		10.4314/sajg.v4i4.5								WOS:000382875600005

Official data indicate a reduction of 71% in this biome's forests, what is a worrying indicator, since it is worldwide recognized as the fifth of the 34 hot spots of the planet and with high biodiversity so as high degree of endemism. In this context, the aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in the forest fragmentation of the Atlantic forest in the city of Caxias do Sul-RS, calibrating a spatial dynamic model for this process and simulating a scenario for the year of 2021. To achieve the proposed goal it was used a time series of Landsat 5 satellite images from the years of 1985, 2004 and 2011, with topography and soil information data. The results indicated an increase of native forest from 1985 to 2011 (increase of 36%) and to the 2021 simulated scenario (20% of forest areas). This increase in forest cover in the evaluated area is possibly associated with the rural exodus, more rigorous enforcement of environmental laws and strict enforcement by the environmental agency. This presents relevant information for decision making in relation to the management and monitoring of forest resources.																	0100-6762					NOV-DEC	2015	39	6					1019	1030		10.1590/0100-67622015000600004								WOS:000370522100004

However, there is a lack of qualified professionals for pedological characterization and mapping, particularly at scales of greater detail. Due to this shortage and due to advances in computational tools and remote sensing, Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) arose in order to assist and expedite pedological survey activities. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop a method for delineation of soil units in toposequences through the spectral response of soils in the Vis-NIR (Visible-Near Infrared) wavelength. The spectral method consisted of obtaining soil spectral curves by means of a spectroradiometer, FieldSpec Pro, and reduction in the amount of spectral information by Principal Component Analysis, followed by clustering of samples by the fuzzy k-means method. Five toposequences with 30 m equidistant points were selected for soil class characterization and sampling. Eight distinct soil classes were identified and received detailed characterization and classification in pedological profiles. For the remaining points, the characterization of soil classes was based on the soil classification contained in the pedological profiles, with samples collected using a soil auger at depths of 0.00-0.20 and 0.80-1.00 m, for a total of 162 samples across the five toposequences. The samples were analyzed by the conventional and spectral method so that the results could be compared and evaluated. Thus, morphological, physical (texture), and chemical analyses of soil samples were made. In the five toposequences studied, the results were similar, and some soils were not perfectly individualized by spectral method, due to great similarity in their spectral curves, as demonstrated by Latossolo Vermelho Ferrico and Nitossolo Vermelho Ferrico. The spectral method was able to differentiate soils with distinct spectral responses and establish limits in toposequences, showing great potential for implementation in soil surveys.

A GIS-BASED PROCEDURE FOR AUTOMATICALLY CALCULATING SOIL LOSS FROM THE UNIVERSAL SOIL LOSS EQUATION: GISUS-M	APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE												The integration of methods for calculating soil loss caused by water erosion using a geoprocessing system is important to enable investigations of soil erosion over large areas. Geographic information system (GIS)-based procedures have been used in soil erosion studies; however in most cases it is difficult to integrate the functionality in a single system to compute all soil loss factors. We developed a system able to combine all factors of the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) with the computer functionality of a GIS. The GISus-M provides tools to compute the topographic (LS-factor) and cover and management (C-factor) from methods using remote sensing data. The other factors necessary to use the USLE, including soil erodibility, rainfall erosivity, and conservation practices, are also integrated in this tool. We describe in detail the GISus-M system and show its application in the Ribeirao do Salto sub-basin. From our new system, it is possible to work with different types of databases, making the GIS-procedure developed here a useful tool for researchers and decision makers to use spatial data and different methods to create future scenarios of soil erosion risk.

Cultural heritage management and monitoring using remote sensing data and GIS: The case study of Paphos area, Cyprus	COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS												Cultural heritage (CH) sites are threatened from a variety of natural and anthropogenic factors. Innovative and cost effective tools for systematic monitoring of landscapes and CH sites are needed to protect them. Towards this direction, the article presents a multidisciplinary approach, based on remote sensing techniques and Geographical Information System (GIS) analysis, in order to assess the overall risk in the Paphos district (Cyprus). Paphos region has a great deal of archaeological sites and isolated monuments, which reflect the long history of the area, while some of them are also listed in the UNESCO catalogue of World Cultural Heritage sites. Several natural and anthropogenic hazards have been mapped using different remote sensing data and methodologies. All data were gathered from satellite images and satellite products. The results from each hazard were imported into a GIS environment in order to examine the overall risk assessment based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology. The results found that the methodology applied was effective enough in the understanding of the current conservation circumstances of the monuments in relation to their environment as well as predicting the future development of the present hazards.

Evaluating the long-term impacts of promoting "green" agriculture in the Amazon	AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS												Frontier development in the Brazilian Amazon has created vast areas of largely deforested landscapes. Conservation efforts in these post-frontier zones seek to protect the remaining forest fragments and promote sustainable agricultural practices that absorb labor, meet market demand, and generate ecosystem services. Assessments of these efforts often find that rates of sustained uptake are disappointingly low and that impacts are difficult to discern, but this could be due to the short-time frames of both the efforts themselves and their evaluation. We investigate the impacts of participation in an internationally sponsored farmer association that for 15 years promoted sustainable agricultural practices in the heavily deforested state of Rondonia, Brazil. Using data from a georeferenced four-period panel survey of farmers in combination with remote sensing data on land use spanning the life of the association, we apply matching methods to estimate the impacts of participation. We find that membership resulted in more diversified production systems, including more land allocated to agroforestry. Members also deforested less of their farms, but this difference is not statistically significant after we control for selection bias in membership.																	0169-5150	1574-0862				NOV	2015	46			1			83	102		10.1111/agec.12200								WOS:000367554600007

Reconnecting fragments into an integrated network of coastal forests in Rome	RENDICONTI LINCEI-SCIENZE FISICHE E NATURALI												Preserving relict coastal forests from urbanization is a priority target for sustainable land management. Monitoring forests through remote-sensing diachronic approaches is an important tool to identify networks of natural areas and to inform conservation policies for high-quality wood patches. The present study applies the monitoring approach proposed by Hansen et al. (Science 342(6160): 850-853, 2013) to the forest landscape in coastal Rome, central Italy, providing indicators assessing forest cover and short-term wood loss and gain. Forest land (with 1 to 100 % cover) extends through 16.9 % of the total area with prevailing classes at 21-40 % and 71-100 % density. These classes indicate distinct forest types: the largest remnants of mixed coastal forests and the sparse woods embedded in the rural matrix and characterized by structural fragmentation. Dense forest classes (71-100 %) prevail in two urban districts (Castelporziano and Lido di Castelfusano). Percent forest loss (2000-2012) increases more than proportionally with percent forest cover. Forest gain-to-loss ratio decreases for moderately dense classes (31-70 %) and increases for both sparse (>= 30 %) and very dense (>70 %) forest classes. Multivariate analysis identifies a land cover gradient from strictly forest districts to agricultural and peri-urban districts. Spatial planning is increasingly required to preserve and reconnect mesophilous forest patches, pinewoods and isolated woodlots into a green network embedded in the agricultural matrix.

However, several problematic issues (e.g., imagery correction and registration, image interpretation, habitat type and quality definitions, assessment and monitoring procedures, uncertainties inherent in mapping, expert knowledge integration, scale selection, analysis of the interrelationships between habitat quality and landscape structure) challenge the effective and reliable use of such data and techniques. We discuss these issues, as a contribution to the development of a common language, framework and suite of research approaches among ecologists, remote-sensing experts and stakeholders (conservation managers) on the ground, and highlight recent theoretical and applied advances that provide opportunities for meeting these challenges.

J	Bell, G; Neal, S; Medcalf, K				Bell, Gemma; Neal, Samuel; Medcalf, Katie			Use of remote sensing to produce a habitat map of Norfolk	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Information on the extent, location and condition of semi-natural habitats is essential to deliver the national targets to achieve the UK commitment to Biodiversity 2020 (Defra, 2011). This strategy aims to halt overall biodiversity loss by 2020 and move towards a position of net gain. In order to achieve this, both local and national bodies need detailed information on the habitats present over their entire area. Remote sensing provides opportunities for cost-effective, rapid and repeatable habitat mapping. This paper presents a method used to produce a seamless habitat map of the county of Norfolk, UK, of sufficient detail to inform land management decisions. Key aspects of the method were the development of parallel classification systems using different input data combinations and a long-term, volunteer-based map validation and update procedure. The habitat classification method utilised multiple earth observation platforms characterised by differences in spatial resolution, spectral range and season of image capture. The combinations of image data used were very important for the success of the analyses. The classification process was guided by ecological principles and local knowledge, along with targeted ground-truthing to guide class associations, confirm underlying ecological processes and to assess accuracy, and map revision. The study found that automated methods of analysis were most effective when classifying habitats characterised by distinctive dominant cover species, or groups of dominant species. The methods were least effective at identifying habitats defined by the presence of low growth-form species at low frequency or where they form understorey vegetation; in such cases field checking is vital to confirm the habitat class assignment. This scale of mapping can be used in combination with targeted, sustainable field survey effort to provide the level of information needed by decision makers to support Biodviersity 2020 targets and a wide range of other policy needs. The map has already been adopted by a wide range of organisations and finding application in such areas as Green Infrastructure, Living Landscape and habitat suitability modelling.

However, often it is perceived that the needs of the terrestrial conservation community are not being met by the remote sensing community. The first step to bridging this gap is the improved communication between both communities, and the compilation of a list of needs and best practises for conservation applications. Here we review five recent workshops that help to answer the broad question "What conservationists need and want from remote sensing". We identify recurring requests, and consider potential ways forward for the conservation and remote sensing communities to start to deliver data or tools to address these needs.

J	Peng, H; Jia, YW; Tague, C; Slaughter, P				Peng, Hui; Jia, Yangwen; Tague, Christina; Slaughter, Peter			An Eco-Hydrological Model-Based Assessment of the Impacts of Soil and Water Conservation Management in the Jinghe River Basin, China	WATER												Many soil and water conservation (SWC) measures have been applied in the Jinghe River Basin to decrease soil erosion and restore degraded vegetation cover. Analysis of historical streamflow records suggests that SWC measures may have led to declines in streamflow, although climate and human water use may have contributed to observed changes. This paper presents an application of a watershed-scale, physically-based eco-hydrological modelthe Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System (RHESSys)in the Jinghe River Basin to study the impacts of SWC measures on streamflow. Several extensions to the watershed-scale RHESSys model were made in this paper to support the model application at larger scales (>10,000 km(2)) of the Loess Plateau. The extensions include the implementation of in-stream routing, reservoir sub-models and representation of soil and water construction engineering (SWCE). Field observation data, literature values and remote sensing data were used to calibrate and verify the model parameters. Three scenarios were simulated and the results were compared to quantify both vegetation recovery and SWCE impacts on streamflow. Three scenarios respectively represent no SWC, vegetation recovery only and both vegetation recovery and SWCE. The model results demonstrate that the SWC decreased annual streamflow by 8% (0.1 billion m(3)), with the largest decrease occurring in the 2000s. Model estimates also suggest that SWCE has greater impacts than vegetation recovery. Our study provides a useful tool for SWC planning and management in this region.

Shelf break exchange events near the De Soto Canyon	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Observations of currents, temperature, sea-surface height, sea-surface temperature and ocean color, derived from moorings, surface and deep drifters, hydrographic surveys, and satellites, are used to characterize shelf-slope exchange events near the apex of the De Soto Canyon in the northeast Gulf of Mexico. During the winter of 2012-2013, shelf-break time series showed a number of events where cold shelf water extruded over the slope. These events were largely consistent with slope eddies of both signs influencing shelf break currents. larger-scale circulations, derived from the Loop Current and a separating Loop Current eddy, strongly influenced circulation over the De Soto slope during summer 2012, with flow patterns consistent with potential vorticity conservation over shoaling topography. Statistical investigation into shelf-slope exchange using large numbers of surface drifters indicated that export from the shelf is larger than vice-versa, and is more uniformly distributed along the shelf break. Import onto the shelf appears to favor a region just east of the Mississippi Delta, which is also consistent with the observed onshore transport of surface oil from the Deepwater Horizon disaster.

Accordingly, accurate estimates of their spatial extent, fragmentation, and degree of regeneration are critical in evaluating the success of current conservation policies. This study focused on a well-protected secondary TDF in Santa Rosa National Park (SRNP) Environmental Monitoring Super Site, Guanacaste, Costa Rica. We used spectral signature analysis of TDF ecosystem succession (early, intermediate, and late successional stages), and its intrinsic variability, to propose a new multiple criteria spectral mixture analysis (MCSMA) method on the shortwave infrared (SWIR) of HyMap image. Unlike most existing iterative mixture analysis (IMA) techniques, MCSMA tries to extract and make use of representative endmembers with spectral and spatial information. MCSMA then considers three criteria that influence the comparative importance of different endmember combinations (endmember models): root mean square error (RMSE); spatial distance (SD); and fraction consistency (FC), to create an evaluation framework to select a best-fit model. The spectral analysis demonstrated that TDFs have a high spectral variability as a result of biomass variability. By adopting two search strategies, the unmixing results showed that our new MCSMA approach had a better performance in root mean square error (early: 0.160/0.159; intermediate: 0.322/0.321; and late: 0.239/0.235); mean absolute error (early: 0.132/0.128; intermediate: 0.254/0.251; and late: 0.191/0.188); and systematic error (early: 0.045/0.055; intermediate: 0.211/-0.214; and late: 0.161/0.160), compared to the multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA). This study highlights the importance of SWIR in differentiating successional stages in TDFs. The proposed MCSMA provides a more flexible and generalized means for the best-fit model determination than common IMA methods.

Following successful breeding at the facility, a group of birds was released on Sado Island on 25th September 2008, with further reintroductions in subsequent years. Habitat restoration is also necessary to facilitate the re-introduction program of this endangered species. The aim of this study was to detect suitable nesting areas for the released ibises on Sado Island for subsequent nature restoration. Since little ibis nesting information was available for Sado Island, the nesting model was constructed from nesting information from China, from which results were extrapolated for Sado Island. Land usage was assessed using LAND-SAT/ETM+ data for China and SPOT/HRG images for Sado Island. In this study, land-use information was used to define the environmental parameters related to nest site selection of the Crested Ibis. For the nesting model, a generalized linear mixed model, with seven environmental factors, was employed. The multi-spatial scale for Crested Ibis nesting was also analyzed. We took the spatial scale into consideration at intervals of 100 m from a buffer size of 100 m to 2500 m. Because nest site selection was influenced by the results of the previous year, nesting location data in 2005 and 2006 were distinguished and models built accordingly. Several important environmental factors were identified for nest site selection: the ratio of broadleaved deciduous forest to coniferous forest; the shape of the forest edge; and, the distance from rice fields and other wetlands. The model's accuracy was verified using the Boyce index, and shows the validity of the model's results. Suitable nesting areas for the Crested Ibis were found mainly on: the Kuninaka plain; the ridgeline between the Kuninaka plain and the Osado or Kosado mountain ranges; the area around Lake Kamo; and, the midwestern area of the Kosado region. Suitable nesting sites for the Crested Ibis were all found to be concentrated in what is known as Yatsuda, a traditional Japanese landscape structure providing a complex mosaic of forest and rice fields with complex ecotones. Eastern Kosado, the region that has been designated by the Ministry of the Environment as the conservation area for the reintroduced birds, was not judged to provide suitable nesting habitat for the Crested Ibis. Unfortunately, no evaluation of habitat suitability was made prior to the release of the first captive-bred Crested Ibis into the wild on Sado Island. Had an evaluation of habitat suitability been performed prior to release, more effective nature restoration could have been planned. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Remote sensing to monitor cover crop adoption in southeastern Pennsylvania	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												In the Chesapeake Bay Watershed, winter cereal cover crops are often planted in rotation with summer crops to reduce the loss of nutrients and sediment from agricultural systems. Cover crops can also improve soil health, control weeds and pests, supplement forage needs, and support resilient cropping systems. In southeastern Pennsylvania, cover crops can be successfully established following corn (Zea mays L.) silage harvest and are strongly promoted for use in this niche. They are also planted following corn grain, soybean (Glycine max L.), and vegetable harvest. In Pennsylvania, the use of winter cover crops for agricultural conservation has been supported through a combination of outreach, regulation, and incentives. On-farm implementation is thought to be increasing, but the actual extent of cover crops is not well quantified. Satellite imagery can be used to map green winter cover crop vegetation on agricultural fields and, when integrated with additional remote sensing data products, can be used to evaluate wintertime vegetative groundcover following specific summer crops. This study used Landsat and SPOT (System Probatoire d' Observation de la Terre) satellite imagery, in combination with the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service Cropland Data Layer, to evaluate the extent and amount of green wintertime vegetation on agricultural fields in four Pennsylvania counties (Berks, Lebanon, Lancaster, and York) from 2010 to 2013. In December of 2010, a windshield survey was conducted to collect baseline data on winter cover crop implementation, with particular focus on identifying corn harvested for silage (expected earlier harvest date and lower levels of crop residue), versus for grain (expected later harvest date and higher levels of crop residue). Satellite spectral indices were successfully used to detect both the amount of green vegetative groundcover and the amount of crop residue on the surveyed fields. Analysis of wintertime satellite imagery showed consistent increases in vegetative groundcover over the four-year study period and determined that trends did not result from annual weather variability, indicating that farmers are increasing adoption of practices such as cover cropping that promote wintertime vegetation. Between 2010 and 2013, the occurrence of wintertime vegetation on agricultural fields increased from 36% to 67% of corn fields in Berks County, from 53% to 75% in Lancaster County, from 42% to 65% in Lebanon County, and from 26% to 52% in York County. Apparently, efforts to promote cover crop use in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed have coincided with a rapid increase in the occurrence of wintertime vegetation following corn harvest in southeastern Pennsylvania. However, despite these increases, between 25% and 48% of corn fields remained without substantial green vegetation over the wintertime, indicating further opportunity for cover crop adoption.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				NOV-DEC	2015	70	6					340	352		10.2489/jswc.70.6.340								WOS:000364917700007

Habitat selection following recent disturbance: model transferability with implications for management and conservation of moose (Alces alces)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Site-specific variation in relative habitat abundance and disturbance regimes may produce differences in habitat preferences of associated populations. An evaluation of the predictive power of habitat selection models across space would benefit our understanding of the reliability of models of selection and space use in predicting animal occurrence. We used presence-absence data from winter surveys of moose (Alces alces (L., 1758)) to estimate resource selection functions (RSFs) across two study sites using Far North Land Cover updated with recent disturbance from fire and timber harvest. Moose selected foraging habitat (e.g., deciduous land cover) and for increasing deciduous foliage cover (Delta NDVI, i.e., the difference in the normalized difference vegetation index). Snow depth negatively influenced habitat selection, likely due to increased predation risk and reduced movement and foraging efficiency. Models lost little predictive power when applied to another site based on comparison of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Our results corroborated the current body of knowledge concerning moose habitat selection, i.e., moose preferentially use forest stands dominated by deciduous species, but suggested that moose strongly avoided very recently disturbed areas. Minimal site-specific variation and ROC comparison suggests that RSFs may be extended into novel systems, given adequate consideration for habitat quality and abundance, thereby simplifying management needs of this important species.

Such methodology can be applied, at screening level, also in areas where field data are lacking, and consists in two steps. In the first one, candidate areas are ranked according to criteria which take into account the risk of cage breaking due to wave actions and fish welfare requirements. This step involves the post-processing of satellite data and results of operational oceanographic models by means a multi-criteria methodology implemented in a GIS environment. In the second step, an integrated aquaculture impact assessment model is applied to the most suitable areas in order to obtain a preliminary assessment of the potential interaction of a newly established cage with benthic habitats. The methodology was applied to an Algerian coastal area near the town of Bejaia where the central government is planning to develop aquaculture activities. Results show that the procedure allows to perform a site selection, which combines the quality of a site from the aquaculture use perspective with the conservation of endangered benthic habitats (Posidonia oceanica meadows) under the spatial restrictions imposed by existing activities. This result goes in the direction of defining site selection methodologies complying with the principles of the ecosystem approach to aquaculture and providing a science-based support in the framework of the implementation of the UNEP/MAP ecological approach.

To protect and recover ES, governments need more information about the relationship between land use and ecosystem services. Based on GIS platform, three periods of remote sensing images were processed to be land use maps. Then we analyzed the change of ecosystem services with land use from 2002 to 2013 by mathematical models. Result showed the whole ES degenerated from 2002 to 2013; all land use types except settlements and mining sites (SMS) had a positive effect on the total ES value in the whole period; the main land use type is agricultural landscapes, but in ecological sense, it was not the best efficient land use type. Subsequently, an improved Markov model was used to predict the ES change trendy with land use in the year of 2017. These information of ES change with land use can be used for making sustainable land use plan.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				NOV	2015	8	11					9015	9022		10.1007/s12517-015-1846-z								WOS:000363719600005

This paper assessed a long-term (1990-2013) landscape changes and avifauna community dynamics in the Yellow River wetland natural reserves, China. Remote sensing information was combined with field surveys to collect critical data on land use and avifaunal populations. The results reveal that land use has dramatic changes during 1990-2013. Utilized water features have significantly decreased over 20 years, whereas artificial land features such as paddy, dry field and built-up area have shown a steady increasing trend in the three riverine wetlands. The spatial landscape patterns of the three wetlands have become fragmented and notably heterogeneous as results of rapid economic development. With the changes of utilized water features, avifauna data show that some overwintering and transient species are becoming permanent residents. Though there is an abundant and diverse array of bird species utilizing the wetlands, migrating traits of these avifauna species have changed. This study can provide basic information for making effective and sustainable conservation plans for the entire Yellow River wetland natural reserves. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

K.; Litton, Creighton M.; Trauernicht, Clay			Future directions for forest restoration in Hawai'i	NEW FORESTS												Hawai'i has served as a model system for studies of nutrient cycling and conservation biology. The islands may also become a laboratory for exploring new approaches to forest restoration because of a common history of degradation and the growing number of restoration projects undertaken. Approximately half of the native ecosystems of Hawai'i have been converted to non-native conditions. Many restoration projects have focused on intensively managed out plantings of native plants with emphasis on threatened and endangered species. While these projects have been effective in stabilizing plant populations, this model is often prohibitively expensive for restoration at the scale needed to protect watersheds and provide habitat for rare bird species. Here we suggest ways of rethinking ecological restoration that are applicable across the tropics, particularly on islands and fire-prone grasslands. First, we suggest making use of non-native, non-invasive species to help reclaim degraded or invaded sites or as long-term components of planned restoration outcomes. Second, we suggest incorporating remote sensing techniques to refine where restoration is carried out. Finally, we suggest borrowing technologies in plant production, weed control, and site preparation from industrial forestry to lower restoration costs. These suggestions would result in ecosystems that differ from native reference systems in some cases but which could be applied to much larger areas than most current restoration efforts while providing important ecosystem services. We also stress that community involvement is key to successful restoration, as a major goal of almost all restoration projects is to re-connect the community with the forest.

J	Nieland, S; Moran, N; Kleinschmit, B; Forster, M				Nieland, Simon; Moran, Niklas; Kleinschmit, Birgit; Foerster, Michael			An ontological system for interoperable spatial generalisation in biodiversity monitoring	COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES												Semantic heterogeneity remains a barrier to data comparability and standardisation of results in different fields of spatial research. Because of its thematic complexity, differing acquisition methods and national nomenclatures, interoperability of biodiversity monitoring information is especially difficult. Since data collection methods and interpretation manuals broadly vary there is a need for automatised, objective methodologies for the generation of comparable data-sets. Ontology-based applications offer vast opportunities in data management and standardisation. This study examines two data-sets of protected heathlands in Germany and Belgium which are based on remote sensing image classification and semantically formalised in an OWL2 ontology. The proposed methodology uses semantic relations of the two data-sets, which are (semi-)automatically derived from remote sensing imagery, to generate objective and comparable information about the status of protected areas by utilising kernel-based spatial reclassification. This automatised method suggests a generalisation approach, which is able to generate delineation of Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) of the European biodiversity Natura 2000 network. Furthermore, it is able to transfer generalisation rules between areas surveyed with varying acquisition methods in different countries by taking into account automated inference of the underlying semantics. The generalisation results were compared with the manual delineation of terrestrial monitoring. For the different habitats in the two sites an accuracy of above 70% was detected. However, it has to be highlighted that the delineation of the ground-truth data inherits a high degree of uncertainty, which is discussed in this study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Tuanmu, MN; Jetz, W				Tuanmu, Mao-Ning; Jetz, Walter			A global, remote sensing-based characterization of terrestrial habitat heterogeneity for biodiversity and ecosystem modelling	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Habitat heterogeneity has long been recognized as a key landscape characteristic determining biodiversity patterns. However, a lack of standardized, large-scale, high-resolution and temporally updatable heterogeneity information based on direct observations has limited our understanding of this connection and its effective use for biodiversity conservation. To address this, we develop here remote sensing-based metrics to characterize global habitat heterogeneity at 1-km resolution and assess their value for biodiversity modelling. Location Global. Methods We develop 14 heterogeneity metrics (available at ) based on the textural features of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and closely examine a complementary core set of six of these metrics. We evaluate their ability to provide fine-grain habitat heterogeneity by comparing the heterogeneity information captured by them with that measured by 30-m Landsat-based land-cover data. Using spatial autoregressive models, we then compare their utility with that of more conventional metrics (derived from topography or categorical land-cover data) for modelling the species richness of bird communities across the conterminous United States based on Breeding Bird Survey data. Results The newly derived metrics capture different aspects of habitat heterogeneity and provide fine-grain information for locations deemed homogeneous by traditional land-cover classifications at both continental and global extents. Most of them strongly exceed conventional heterogeneity variables in capturing the spatial variation in bird species richness, with Homogeneity emerging as the strongest predictor. Main conclusions This study develops and validates the performance of readily usable metrics of textural measures capturing fine-grain habitat heterogeneity. The presented metrics outperform conventional measures in capturing detailed spatial variation in habitats and in predicting key biodiversity patterns. They provide a rigorous and comparable basis for understanding heterogeneity-diversity relationships, and offer a powerful tool for monitoring and understanding the responses of biodiversity and ecosystems to the changing environment.																	1466-822X	1466-8238				NOV	2015	24	11					1329	1339		10.1111/geb.12365								WOS:000362796400012

Among the different soil erosion risk factors, the cover-management factor (C-factor) is the one that policy makers and farmers can most readily influence in order to help reduce soil loss rates. The present study proposes a methodology for estimating the C-factor in the European Union (EU), using pan-European datasets (such as CORINE Land Cover), biophysical attributes derived from remote sensing, and statistical data on agricultural crops and practices. In arable lands, the C-factor was estimated using crop statistics (% of land per crop) and data on management practices such as conservation tillage, plant residues and winter crop cover. The C-factor in non-arable lands was estimated by weighting the range of literature values found according to fractional vegetation cover, which was estimated based on the remote sensing dataset F-cover. The mean C-factor in the EU is estimated to be 0.1043, with an extremely high variability; forests have the lowest mean C-factor (0.00116), and arable lands and sparsely vegetated areas the highest (0.233 and 0.2651, respectively). Conservation management practices (reduced/no tillage, use of cover crops and plant residues) reduce the C-factor by on average 19.1% in arable lands. The methodology is designed to be a tool for policy makers to assess the effect of future land use and crop rotation scenarios on soil erosion by water. The impact of land use changes (deforestation, arable land expansion) and the effect of policies (such as the Common Agricultural Policy and the push to grow more renewable energy crops) can potentially be quantified with the proposed model. The C-factor data and the statistical input data used are available from the European Soil Data Centre. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Vegetation maps based on remote sensing are informative predictors of habitat selection of grassland birds across a wetness gradient	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Vegetation is a major environmental factor influencing habitat selection in bird species. High resolution mapping of vegetation cover is essential to model the distribution of populations and improve the management of breeding habitats. However, the task is challenging for grassland birds because microhabitat variations relevant at the territory scale cannot be measured continuously over large areas to delineate areas of higher suitability. Remote sensing may help to circumvent this problem. We addressed this issue by using SPOT 5 imagery and phytosociological data. We mapped grassland vegetation in a floodplain using two methods. We (i) mapped the continuous Ellenberg index of moisture and (ii) identified 5 vegetation classes distributed across the wetness gradient. These two methods produced consistent output maps, but they also provided complementary results. Ellenberg index is a valuable proxy for soil moisture while the class approach provided more information about vegetation structure, and possibly trophic resources. In spite of the apparent uniformity of meadows, our data show that birds do not settle randomly along the moisture and vegetation gradients. Overall birds tend to avoid the driest vegetation classes, i.e. the highest grounds. Thus, vegetation maps based on remote sensing could be valuable tools to study habitat selection and niche partition in grassland bird communities. It is also a valuable tool for conservation and habitat management. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Estimating the Counterfactual Impact of Conservation Programs on Land Cover Outcomes: The Role of Matching and Panel Regression Techniques	PLOS ONE												Deforestation and conversion of native habitats continues to be the leading driver of biodiversity and ecosystem service loss. A number of conservation policies and programs are implemented-from protected areas to payments for ecosystem services (PES)-to deter these losses. Currently, empirical evidence on whether these approaches stop or slow land cover change is lacking, but there is increasing interest in conducting rigorous, counterfactual impact evaluations, especially for many new conservation approaches, such as PES and REDD, which emphasize additionality. In addition, several new, globally available and free high-resolution remote sensing datasets have increased the ease of carrying out an impact evaluation on land cover change outcomes. While the number of conservation evaluations utilizing 'matching' to construct a valid control group is increasing, the majority of these studies use simple differences in means or linear cross-sectional regression to estimate the impact of the conservation program using this matched sample, with relatively few utilizing fixed effects panel methods-an alternative estimation method that relies on temporal variation in the data. In this paper we compare the advantages and limitations of (1) matching to construct the control group combined with differences in means and cross-sectional regression, which control for observable forms of bias in program evaluation, to (2) fixed effects panel methods, which control for observable and time-invariant unobservable forms of bias, with and without matching to create the control group. We then use these four approaches to estimate forest cover outcomes for two conservation programs: a PES program in Northeastern Ecuador and strict protected areas in European Russia. In the Russia case we find statistically significant differences across estimators-due to the presence of unobservable bias-that lead to differences in conclusions about effectiveness. The Ecuador case illustrates that if time-invariant unobservables are not present, matching combined with differences in means or cross-sectional regression leads to similar estimates of program effectiveness as matching combined with fixed effects panel regression. These results highlight the importance of considering observable and unobservable forms of bias and the methodological assumptions across estimators when designing an impact evaluation of conservation programs.

We map its grounding line positions in 1996 and 2013 using differential radar interferometry (InSAR) data and develop precise, high-resolution topographies of its ice surface and ice draft using NASA Operation IceBridge data, InSAR data, and a mass conservation method. We detect a 1 to 3km retreat of the grounding line in 17years. The retreat is asymmetrical along a two-lobe pattern, where ice is only grounded a few 10m above sea level, or ice plain, which may unground further with only modest amounts of ice thinning. The pattern of retreat indicates ice thinning of 12m in 17years or 0.70.1m/yr at the grounding line on average. Sustained thinning will cause further grounding line retreat but may not be conducive to a marine instability.

Forest Loss in Protected Areas and Intact Forest Landscapes: A Global Analysis	PLOS ONE												In spite of the high importance of forests, global forest loss has remained alarmingly high during the last decades. Forest loss at a global scale has been unveiled with increasingly finer spatial resolution, but the forest extent and loss in protected areas (PAs) and in large intact forest landscapes (IFLs) have not so far been systematically assessed. Moreover, the impact of protection on preserving the IFLs is not well understood. In this study we conducted a consistent assessment of the global forest loss in PAs and IFLs over the period 2000-2012. We used recently published global remote sensing based spatial forest cover change data, being a uniform and consistent dataset over space and time, together with global datasets on PAs' and IFLs' locations. Our analyses revealed that on a global scale 3% of the protected forest, 2.5% of the intact forest, and 1.5% of the protected intact forest were lost during the study period. These forest loss rates are relatively high compared to global total forest loss of 5% for the same time period. The variation in forest losses and in protection effect was large among geographical regions and countries. In some regions the loss in protected forests exceeded 5% (e.g. in Australia and Oceania, and North America) and the relative forest loss was higher inside protected areas than outside those areas (e.g. in Mongolia and parts of Africa, Central Asia, and Europe). At the same time, protection was found to prevent forest loss in several countries (e.g. in South America and Southeast Asia). Globally, high area-weighted forest loss rates of protected and intact forests were associated with high gross domestic product and in the case of protected forests also with high proportions of agricultural land. Our findings reinforce the need for improved understanding of the reasons for the high forest losses in PAs and IFLs and strategies to prevent further losses.

Foraging distribution of Cape gannets in relation to oceanographic features, prey availability and marine protected areas	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Seabirds forage in a dynamic environment of heterogeneously distributed prey resources. Many seabird species use oceanographic features that promote prey aggregation, as a means of locating prey patches. The combination of tracking data, remote-sensing data and estimates of prey availability is useful in determining how seabirds locate prey. GPS tracks of foraging Cape gannets Morus capensis were collected across 3 breeding seasons and tested for inter-annual changes in home range size and foraging effort, and compared against the availability of their predominant prey (sardine Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus) as determined from acoustic surveys. Biophysical features associated with foraging were compared to a random point dataset using a binomial general linear mixed model, while foraging distributions of Cape gannets were compared against the placement of marine protected areas (MPAs). The total home range of foraging Cape gannets, breeding at Bird Island, South Africa, propagated westwards over the 3 breeding seasons, which coincided with a concurrent westward contraction in the distribution of sardine and anchovy. Foraging effort showed an apparent increase in response to low prey densities and occurred mostly outside MPAs. Although gannets seemed to forage in relatively cold waters, biophysical features were generally unreliable predictors of gannet foraging distribution. The relationship between home range and prey distribution, coupled with recent declines in local prey availability, demonstrates the ability of gannets to track the distribution of their prey resources. However, the ephemeral and dynamic nature of these prey resources places a major constraint on conservation-based spatial planning involving Cape gannets.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				OCT 14	2015	537						277	288		10.3354/meps11428								WOS:000363180900021						
J	Aziz, AA; Phinn, S; Dargusch, P				Aziz, Ammar Abdul; Phinn, Stuart; Dargusch, Paul			Investigating the decline of ecosystem services in a production mangrove forest using Landsat and object-based image analysis	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve is widely recognised as a sustainably managed mangrove forest. However, recently evidence of multiple ecosystem services decline has emerged. The primary objective of this study was to apply remote sensing techniques to assess the impact of the silviculture in the mangrove forest reserve on the provision of ecosystem services. It applied an object-based approach to classify multi-temporal Landsat imagery. The classified images enabled the study to characterise and analyse the spatiotemporal changes in the distribution of stand age composition and structure over a 35 year period. Links were established between the classified images and the ecosystem services assessment based on the assumption that the classification results provided a reliable proxy for an indirect analysis on the temporal and spatial distribution of aboveground biomass of the mangrove forest reserve. The relationship between the potential impacts of the observed changes derived from the classified images with the data obtained from the ecosystem services assessment were analysed. The analysis showed that the fluctuation in greenwood yield was affected by varying rates of regeneration, exposure to excessive thinning and delays in harvesting. The production of blood cockles around the mudflats of the mangrove forest reserve was determined to be influenced by both timber extraction and natural coastal erosion. An undetected ecological change in the late eighties and anthropogenic disturbances were possible key factors behind the decline in the population of the Milky Stork and migratory shorebirds. The study highlights the importance of understanding and managing the trade-offs between wood production and ecosystem services in a managed mangrove forest and provides an important reference for the future management of the Matang Forest Reserve and other multiple-use wetland forests.

Amongst nearshore ecosystems, seagrass beds play a major role enhancing biodiversity and water quality. Consequently, the development of new approaches to create extensive and high-resolution habitat maps is required not only to implement conservation, restoration and management plans, but also to establish adaptation plans to face climate change impacts. This study particularly assesses the capability of hyperspectral airborne imagery acquired with Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) to discriminate and map estuarine habitats, with special focus on Zostera noltii seagrass meadows. To this end, 13 habitats were defined along the supralittoral, intertidal and subtidal zones of an estuary, including Z noltii seagrass meadows. The CASI sensor was configured to acquire 25 bands in the visible and near infrared wavelengths with a ground sampling distance of 2 m. Spectral bands were selected for species discrimination based on the spectral signature of the different habitat classes. Six different band combinations were tested applying maximum likelihood classification algorithm. The most accurate classification was obtained with 10 band combination (a mean producer accuracy 92% and a mean user accuracy 94%). The classification of Z noltii beds has been found to be restricted to moderate and high dense meadows, however a vegetation index has been defined which could be applied for mapping Z noltii meadow cover. These results highlight the value of CASI data to discriminate and map estuarine habitats, providing key information to be used in supporting the implementation of environmental legislation, protection and conservation of coastal habitats.

A review of accomplishments and challenges	MAMMAL REVIEW												1. Regular monitoring of animal populations must be established to ensure wildlife protection, especially when pressure on animals is high. The recent development of drones or unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) opens new opportunities. UASs have several advantages, including providing data at high spatial and temporal resolution, providing systematic, permanent data, having low operational costs and being low-risk for the operators. However, UASs have some constraints, such as short flight endurance. 2. We reviewed studies in which wildlife populations were monitored by using drones, described accomplishments to date and evaluated the range of possibilities UASs offer to provide new perspectives in future research. 3. We focused on four main topics: 1) the available systems and sensors; 2) the types of survey plan and detection possibilities; 3) contributions towards anti-poaching surveillance; and 4) legislation and ethics. 4. We found that small fixed-wing UASs are most commonly used because these aircraft provide a viable compromise between price, logistics and flight endurance. The sensors are typically electro-optic or infrared cameras, but there is the potential to develop and test new sensors. 5. Despite various flight plan possibilities, mostly classical line transects have been employed, and it would be of great interest to test new methods to adapt to the limitations of UASs. Detection of many species is possible, but statistical approaches are unavailable if valid inventories of large mammals are the purpose. 6. Contributions of UASs to anti-poaching surveillance are not yet well documented in the scientific literature, but initial studies indicate that this approach could make important contributions to conservation in the next few years. 7. Finally, we conclude that one of the main factors impeding the use of UASs is legislation. Restrictions in the use of airspace prevent researchers from testing all possibilities, and adaptations to the relevant legislation will be necessary in future.																	0305-1838	1365-2907				OCT	2015	45	4					239	252		10.1111/mam.12046								WOS:000368509700004

This study analyzed the wetlands in Shanghai, a province-level city, using remote sensing, image processing, and geographic information systems (GIS) techniques based on the Chinese national wetland inventory procedure and standards. FORMOSAT imagery acquired in 2012 and Navy nautical charts of the Yangtze estuarine area were used in conjunction with object-oriented segmentation, expert interpretation, and field validation to determine wetland status. Landsat imagery from 1985, 1995, 2000, 2003 and 2013 as well as social-economic data collected from 1985 to 2013 were used to further assess wetland changes. In 2013, Shanghai contained 376970.6 ha of wetlands, and 78.8% of all wetlands were in marine or estuarine systems. Estuarine waters comprised the single largest wetland category. Between the first national wetland inventory in 2003 and the second national wetland inventory in 2013, Shanghai lost 50519.1 ha of wetlands, amounting to a mean annual loss rate of 1.2% or an 11.8% loss over the decade. Declines were proportionately higher in marine and estuarine wetlands, with an annual loss of 1.8%, while there was a sharp increase of 1882.6% in constructed water storage areas for human uses. Diking, filling, impoundment and reclamation, which are all attributable to the economic development and urbanization associated with population increases, were the major factors that explained the gain and loss of wetlands. Additional factors affecting wetland losses and gains include sediment trapping by the hydropower system, which reduces supply to the estuary and erodes wetlands, and sediment trapping by the jetties, spur dikes, and diversion bulwark associated with a navigation channel deepening project, which has the converse effect, increasing saltmarsh wetland area at Jiuduansha shoal by three times between 2000 and 2013.

However, serious lack of in-situ measurements in remote alpine mountains is hindering our current understanding of regional TWS change in the Tarim River Basin (TRB), a large and typical arid endorheic area in Northwest China of Central Asia. To solve the problem, four different hydrology products from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite, model simulations from Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) in conjunction with in-situ measurements, are utilized to investigate patterns and underlying causes of TWS and its component changes. An excess of precipitation over evapotranspiration (ET) plus runoff contributes to an increase of TWS. The phase of Total Soil Moisture (TSM) lags that of Snow Water Equivalent (SWE), indicating a recharge from snowmelt to TSM. Increasing TWS together with decreasing SWE resulted in an increase of subsurface water. Our results are of great value to amend basin-wide water management and conservation strategies for the similar arid regions considering climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Chu, T; Das, A; Lindenschmidt, KE				Chu, Thuan; Das, Apurba; Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich			Monitoring the Variation in Ice-Cover Characteristics of the Slave River, Canada Using RADARSAT-2 Data-A Case Study	Remote Sensing												The winter regime of river-ice covers in high northern latitude regions is often a determining factor in the management of water resources, conservation of aquatic ecosystems and preservation of traditional and cultural lifestyles of local peoples. As ground-based monitoring of river-ice regimes in high northern latitudes is expensive and restricted to a few locations due to limited accessibility to most places along rivers from shorelines, remote sensing techniques are a suitable approach for monitoring. This study developed a RADARSAT-2 based method to monitor the spatio-temporal variation of ice covers, as well as ice types during the freeze-up period, along the main channel of the Slave River Delta in the Northwest Territories of Canada. The spatio-temporal variation of ice covers along the river was analyzed using the backscatter-based coefficient of variation (CV) in the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 winters. As a consequence of weather and flow conditions, the ice cover in the 2013-2014 winter had the higher variation than the 2014-2015 winter, particularly in the potential areas of flooded/cracked ice covers. The river sections near active channels (e.g., Middle Channel and Nagle Channel), Big Eddy, and Great Slave Lake also yielded higher intra-annual variation of ice cover characteristics during the winters. With the inclusion of backscatter and texture analysis from RADARSAT-2 data, four water and ice cover classes consisting of open water, thermal ice, juxtaposed ice, and consolidated ice, were discriminated in the images acquired between November and March in both the studied winters. In addition to river geomorphology and climatic conditions such as river width, sinuosity or air temperature, the fluctuation of water flows during the winter has a significant impact on the variation of ice cover as well as the formation of different ice types in the Slave River. The RADARSAT-2 based monitoring algorithm can also be applied to other river systems in high latitude ecosystems to annually monitor their river-ice variation and formation during the freeze-up and ice cover progression period.																	2072-4292					OCT	2015	7	10					13664	13691		10.3390/rs71013664								WOS:000364328600050

Long-term spatio-temporal changes in a West African bushmeat trade system	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Landscapes in many developing countries consist of a heterogeneous matrix of mixed agriculture and forest. Many of the generalist species in this matrix are increasingly traded in the bushmeat markets of West and Central Africa. However, to date there has been little quantification of how the spatial configuration of the landscape influences the urban bushmeat trade over time. As anthropogenic landscapes become the face of rural West Africa, understanding the dynamics of these systems has important implications for conservation and landscape management. The bushmeat production of an area is likely to be defined by landscape characteristics such as habitat disturbance, hunting pressure, level of protection, and distance to market. We explored (SSG, tense) the role of these four characteristics in the spatio-temporal dynamics of the commercial bushmeat trade around the city of Kumasi, Ghana, over 27 years (1978 to 2004). We used geographic information system methods to generate maps delineating the spatial characteristics of the landscapes. These data were combined with spatially explicit market data collected in the main fresh bushmeat market in Kumasi to explore the relationship between trade volume (measured in terms of number of carcasses) and landscape characteristics. Over time, rodents, specifically cane rats (Thryonomys swinderianus), became more abundant in the trade relative to ungulates and the catchment area of the bushmeat market expanded. Areas of intermediate disturbance supplied more bushmeat, but protected areas had no effect. Heavily hunted areas showed significant declines in bushmeat supply over time. Our results highlight the role that low intensity, heterogeneous agricultural landscapes can play in providing ecosystem services, such as bushmeat, and therefore the importance of incorporating bushmeat into ecosystem service mapping exercises. Our results also indicate that even where high bushmeat production is possible, current harvest levels may cause wildlife depletion.																	0888-8892	1523-1739				OCT	2015	29	5					1446	1457		10.1111/cobi.12545								WOS:000363729100019	26104770

Nonconventional Weed Management Strategies for Modern Agriculture	WEED SCIENCE												Weeds are a significant problem in crop production and their management in modern agriculture is crucial to avoid yield losses and ensure food security. Intensive agricultural practices, changing climate, and natural disasters affect weed dynamics and that requires a change in weed management protocols. The existing manual control options are no longer viable because of labor shortages; chemical control options are limited by ecodegradation, health hazards, and development of herbicide resistance in weeds. We are therefore reviewing some potential nonconventional weed management strategies for modern agriculture that are viable, feasible, and efficient. Improvement in tillage regimes has long been identified as an impressive weed-control measure. Harvest weed seed control and seed predation have been shown as potential tools for reducing weed emergence and seed bank reserves. Development in the field of allelopathy for weed management has led to new techniques for weed control. The remarkable role of biotechnological advancements in developing herbicide-resistant crops, bioherbicides, and harnessing the allelopathic potential of crops is also worth mentioning in a modern weed management program. Thermal weed management has also been observed as a useful technique, especially under conservation agriculture systems. Last, precision weed management has been elaborated with sufficient details. The role of remote sensing, modeling, and robotics as an integral part of precision weed management has been highlighted in a realistic manner. All these strategies are viable for today's agriculture; however, site-specific selection and the use of right combinations will be the key to success. No single strategy is perfect, and therefore an integrated approach may provide better results. Future research is needed to explore the potential of these strategies and to optimize them on technological and cultural bases. The adoption of such methods may improve the efficiency of cropping systems under sustainable and conservation practices.

Sudhakar			Geospatial monitoring and prioritization of forest fire incidences in Andhra Pradesh, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Forest fire has been identified as one of the key environmental issue for long-term conservation of biodiversity and has impact on global climate. Spatially multiple observations are necessary for monitoring of forest fires in tropics for understanding conservation efficacy and sustaining biodiversity in protected areas. The present work was carried out to estimate the spatial extent of forest burnt areas and fire frequency using Resourcesat Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) data (2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2014) in Andhra Pradesh, India. The spatio-temporal analysis shows that an area of 7514.10 km(2) (29.22 % of total forest cover) has been affected by forest fires. Six major forest types are distributed in Andhra Pradesh, i.e. semi-evergreen, moist deciduous, dry deciduous, dry evergreen, thorn and mangroves. Of the total forest burnt area, dry deciduous forests account for >75 %. District-wise analysis shows that Kurnool, Prakasam and Cuddapah have shown >100 km(2) of burnt area every year. The total forest burnt area estimate covering protected areas ranges between 6.9 and 22.3 % during the study period. Spatial burnt area analysis for protected areas in 2014 indicates 37.2 % of fire incidences in the Nagarjunasagar Srisailam Tiger Reserve followed by 20.2 % in the Sri Lankamalleswara Wildlife Sanctuary, 20.1 % in the Sri Venkateswara Wildlife Sanctuary and 17.4 % in the Gundla Brahmeswaram Wildlife Sanctuary. The analysis of cumulative fire occurrences from 2009 to 2014 has helped in delineation of conservation priority hotspots using a spatial grid cell approach. Conservation priority hotspots I and II are distributed in major parts of study area including protected areas of the Nagarjunasagar Srisailam Tiger Reserve and Gundla Brahmeswaram Wildlife Sanctuary. The spatial database generated will be useful in studies related to influence of fires on species adaptability, ecological damage assessment and conservation planning.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				OCT	2015	187	10							616	10.1007/s10661-015-4821-y								WOS:000362284700011	26350795

However, accessing localized information can be difficult or impossible in developing countries. Additionally, global medium-resolution land use land cover datasets may be insufficient for conservation planning purposes at the scale of a country or smaller. We thus introduce a new tool, GE Grids, to bridge this gap. This tool creates an interactive user-specified binary grid laid over Google Earth's high-resolution imagery. Using GE Grids, we manually identified anthropogenic land conversion across East Africa and compared this against available land cover datasets. Nearly 30% of East Africa is converted to anthropogenic land cover. The two highest-resolution comparative datasets have the greatest agreement with our own at the regional extent, despite having as low as 44% agreement at the country level. We achieved 83% consistency among users. GE Grids is intended to complement existing remote sensing datasets at local scales. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Pitkanen, TP; Skanes, H; Kayhko, N				Pitkanen, Timo P.; Skanes, Helle; Kayhko, Niina			Detecting subpixel deciduous components to complement traditional land cover classifications in Southwest Finland	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												To ensure successful conservation of ecological and cultural landscape values, detailed and up-to-date spatial information of existing habitatpatterns is essential. However, traditional satellite-based and raster classifications rely on pixels that are assigned to a single category and often generalized. For many fragmented key habitats, such a strategy is too coarse and complementary data is needed. In this paper, we aim at detecting pixel-wise fractional coverage of broadleaved woodland and grassland components in a hemiboreal landscape. This approach targets ecologically relevant deciduous fractions and complements traditional crisp land cover classifications. We modeled fractional components using a k-NN approach, which was based on multispectral satellite data, assisted by a digital elevation model and a contemporary map database. The modeled components were then analyzed based on landscape structure indicators, and evaluated in conjunction with CORINE classification. The results indicate that both broadleaved forest and grassland components are widely distributed in the study area, principally organized as transition zones and small patches. Landscape structure indicators show a substantial variation based on the fractional threshold, pinpointing their dependency on the classification scheme and grain. The modeled components, on the other hand, suggest high internal variation for most CORINE classes, indicating their heterogeneous appearance and showing that the presence of deciduous components in the landscape are not properly captured in a coarse land cover classification. To gain a realistic perception of the landscape, and use this information for the needs of spatial planning, both fractional results and existing land cover classifications are needed. This is because they mutually contribute to an improved understanding of habitat patterns and structures, and should be used to complement each other. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Generally, detailed surveillance has been conducted as fieldwork, numerical analysis of satellite images or manual interpretation of aerial images, but methods of object-based image analysis (OBIA) and machine learning have recently produced promising examples of automated classifications of aerial imagery. The spatial application potential of such models is however still questionable since the transferability has rarely been evaluated. We investigated the potential of mosaic aerial orthophoto red, green and blue (RGB)/near infrared (NIR) imagery and digital elevation model (DEM) data for mapping very fine-scale vegetation structure in semi-natural terrestrial coastal areas in Denmark. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm, with a wide range of object-derived image and DEM variables, was applied for classification of vegetation structure types using two hierarchical levels of complexity. Models were constructed and validated by cross-validation using three scenarios: (1) training and validation data without spatial separation, (2) training and validation data spatially separated within sites, and (3) training and validation data spatially separated between different sites. Without spatial separation of training and validation data, high classification accuracies of coastal structures of 92.1% and 91.8% were achieved on coarse and fine thematic levels, respectively. When models were applied to spatially separated observations within sites classification accuracies dropped to 85.8% accuracy at the coarse thematic level, and 81.9% at the fine thematic level. When the models were applied to observations from other sites than those trained upon the ability to discriminate vegetation structures was low, with 69.0% and 54.2% accuracy at the coarse and fine thematic levels, respectively. Evaluating classification models with different degrees of spatial correlation between training and validation data was shown to give highly different prediction accuracies, thereby highlighting model transferability and application potential. Aerial image and DEM-based RF models had low transferability to new areas due to lack of representation of aerial image, landscape and vegetation variation in training data. They do, however, show promise at local scale for supporting conservation and management with vegetation mappings of high spatial and thematic detail based on low-cost image data.

Population Status of Chimpanzees in the Masito-Ugalla Ecosystem, Tanzania	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY												More than 75 percent of Tanzania's chimpanzees live at low densities on land outside national parks. Chimpanzees are one of the key conservation targets in the region and long-term monitoring of these populations is essential for assessing the overall status of ecosystem health and the success of implemented conservation strategies. We aimed to assess change in chimpanzee density within the Masito-Ugalla Ecosystem (MUE) by comparing results of re-walking the same line transects in 2007 and 2014. We further used published remote sensing data derived from Landsat satellites to assess forest cover change within a 5km buffer of these transects over that same period. We detected no statistically significant decline in chimpanzee density across the surveyed areas of MUE between 2007 and 2014, although the overall mean density of chimpanzees declined from 0.09 individuals/km(2) in 2007 to 0.05 individuals/km(2) in 2014. Whether this change is biologically meaningful cannot be determined due to small sample sizes and large, entirely overlapping error margins. It is therefore possible that the MUE chimpanzee population has been stable over this period and indeed in some areas (Issa Valley, Mkanga, Kamkulu) even showed an increase in chimpanzee density. Variation in chimpanzee habitat preference for ranging or nesting could explain variation in density at some of the survey sites between 2007 and 2014. We also found a relationship between increasing habitat loss and lower mean chimpanzee density. Future surveys will need to ensure a larger sample size, broader geographic effort, and random survey design, to more precisely determine trends in MUE chimpanzee density and population size over time.

In this study, we analyze the land cover dynamics in the Osa Peninsula region of Costa Rica between 1987 and 2009 that provides a good scenario for evaluating the effects over forest trends of the environmental policies set up in 1996. Remote sensing imagery from Landsat and SPOT 2 satellites was classified using the See5 algorithm to obtain land cover maps for 1987, 1998, 2003 and 2009. Our results show that land cover changes in Osa County are driven by grassland/forest dynamics. Forest area diminished over the 1987-1998 period, whereas it increased by 5 and 6 % during the 1998-2003 and 2003-2009 periods, respectively. Grassland abandonment was identified as the main driver of the net increase in forest cover area. Fragmentation analysis was done over the forest class of these maps disclosing secondary forest of the persistent forest of each period. Persistent forest patches decrease in number, but increase in size through time, forming areas of persistent forest established in bigger patches with lower edge density. Secondary forest patches have increased in number and size, forming larger areas of forest established in bigger patches. Nearly half of the reforested area in the period 1987-2009 remained as secondary forest in 2009, playing a key role by decreasing forest fragmentation and strengthening the natural corridor connecting the conservation areas of the region.

Threatened birds of the Angolan Central Escarpment: distribution and response to habitat change at Kumbira Forest	ORYX												Kumbira Forest is the best representative area of Angola's Central Escarpment and the only site known to hold significant populations of four of the five threatened endemic bird species of this habitat. However, the forest is disappearing as a result of human activities. Remote-sensing techniques were used to assess changes in forest cover, and bird and habitat surveys were performed to assess the effect of land-use changes on endemic species and the bird community. No relationships could be established between the presence of endemics and habitat and landscape variables. This lack of effect may be attributable to the low number of records and compounded by the mosaic structure of the landscape. Although forest cover has been maintained in Kumbira, old-growth forest has been replaced by secondary growth in many areas. Nevertheless these secondary-growth forest patches can maintain a bird community similar to that found in old-growth forest.

J	Hu, YF; Tian, GH; Mayer, AL; He, RZ				Hu, Yanfang; Tian, Guohang; Mayer, Audrey L.; He, Ruizhen			Risk assessment of soil erosion by application of remote sensing and GIS in Yanshan Reservoir catchment, China	NATURAL HAZARDS												Soil erosion is considered to be a serious problem for environmental sustainability. Healthy and stable soils are crucial for human well-being, providing important ecosystem functions and services. There is a need for a simple and practical approach which estimates and maps soil erosion risk that uses available information as input data to facilitate water and soil conservation. In this work, we developed a predictive approach to estimating the soil erosion risk of the Yanshan Reservoir catchment, which combines remote sensing information, geographic information system spatial analysis technology and a soil erosion risk assessment model. Three dominating factors affecting soil erosion were considered: vegetation coverage, topographic slope and land use. The soil erosion risk was divided into six levels: slight, light, moderate, intense, severe and extremely severe. The slight and light erosion risk accounted for about 83 % of the watershed and was prominent in cultivated land areas, while areas with relatively higher erosion risk were on steep slopes. This approach pointed to inappropriate land use and development as a source of increased risk of soil erosion of the Yanshan Reservoir catchment. Compared with field survey data, the soil erosion modeling approach was shown to have a high accuracy. Therefore, this model could be used to estimate and map soil erosion intensity and distribution at the catchment scale, and could provide useful information for managers and planners to make land management and conservation decisions.

Spectral data and derived indices from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) have been used for hydrological monitoring of large wetlands. However, comparable studies for small wetlands (< 25 km(2)) are lacking. Our aims are to examine whether MODIS-derived indices at 500-m spatial resolution can perform this task for small wetlands, and to compare the performance of various indices. First we evaluated if water levels are a good indicator for wetland inundation extent. A high correlation between water level and Landsat-derived inundation extent was found (R (2) = 0.957). Secondly, we compared 10 years of water level fluctuations with seven spectral indices at a 16-day interval. The Tasseled Cap brightness index (TCBI) had the highest correlation with water level for the complete time series including dry and wet years. Thirdly, we analyzed how these indices behave for areas with different inundation characteristics. Again TCBI showed a consistently accurate performance, which was independent of inundation frequency. We therefore conclude that TCBI is the best-suited index for monitoring of hydrological variability in small seasonally-flooded wetlands such as the Fuente de Piedra lake in southern Spain. We recommend testing this index further for other seasonally-flooded wetlands in semi-arid areas.

In the current study, we built a habitat suitability index (HSI) model for the breeding red-crowned crane in wetlands of the Zhalong National Nature Reserve of the Songnen Plain, China. The assessing factors to construct the HSI model were selected according to the habitat requirements of red-crowned crane in the breeding period, including the potential nest site (emergent marsh), habitat composition (the area percentage of emergent marsh in species home range), water depth, vegetation cover, and distance to human disturbance. Efficient techniques have been used to quantify predictor variables using multi-source data (i.e. optical imagery, radar imagery and ancillary topographic data). In addition, we illustrated the extraction method of habitat factors in detail and the significances of these factors in evaluating the breeding habitat suitability for the red-crowned crane. Analysis results indicated that the GIS-based HSI model successfully identified potentially suitable red-crowned cranes nesting sites. This analysis not only enables wildlife managers to identify priority locations and conservation status for red-crowned crane, but also provides an effective and prompt method that can be used to infer other waterfowl species nest sites.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				OCT	2015	35	5					955	967		10.1007/s13157-015-0686-7								WOS:000361002300011

Ecology of the Ocean Sunfish, Mola mola, in the southern California Current System	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												The common ocean sunfish, Mola mola, occupies a unique position in the eastern Pacific Ocean and the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME) as the world's heaviest, most fecund bony fish, and one of the most abundant gelativores. M. mola frequently occur as bycatch in fisheries worldwide and comprise the greatest portion of the bycatch in California's large-mesh drift gillnet fishery. In this first long-term tagging study of any ocean sunfish species in the eastern Pacific, 15 M. mola (99 cm to 200 cm total length) were tagged in the southern California Bight (SCB) between 2003 and 2010 using 14 satellite pop-off archival tags (PATs) and one Fastloc Mk10 GPS tag. Ten tags provided positional data for a cumulative dataset of 349 tracking days during the months of july through March. Thirteen tags provided temperature and depth data. All M. mola remained within similar to 300 km of the coast, and nearly all exhibited seasonal movement between the SCB and adjacent waters off northern and central Baja California, Mexico. No tagged individuals were tracked north of the SCB. Tag depth data showed diel vertical migration and occasional deep (>500 m) dives. Data from the Fastloc GPS tag allowed close examination of the relationship between the movements of the largest tagged ocean sunfish (2 m TL) and fine-scale oceanographic features. Near-instantaneous satellite sea surface temperature images showed this individual associated with upwelling fronts along its migration path, which exceeded 800 km and ranged from 6 to 128 km from the coast. Tag depth data showed active use of the water column within the frontal zones. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images demonstrated that surface slicks, which often indicate convergent circulation, coincided with this type of front. Zooplankton tows in the southern region of tracking off central Baja California, Mexico revealed dense populations of salps toward the warm side of these fronts. Satellite tag and ecosystem data suggest that bio-physical interactions in coastal upwelling fronts create favorable foraging habitat. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Yu, L; Shi, YC; Gong, P				Yu, Le; Shi, Yichuan; Gong, Peng			Land cover mapping and data availability in critical terrestrial ecoregions: A global perspective with Landsat thematic mapper and enhanced thematic mapper plus data	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Land cover provides objective and multi scale information on the extent and conditions of habitats both currently and retrospectively. Over four decades since the launch of the first land-observation satellite Landsat-1 in 1972, a tremendous number of earth observation images have been acquired and archived. Here we examined land cover mapping in 142 critical terrestrial ecoregions (identified by WWF Global 200) from three aspects: Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (TM/ETM+) data availability, literature and existing global land cover map. We found that: (1) the availability of Landsat TM/ETM+ for historical land-cover change analysis in those ecoregions is poor. Only 17 ecoregions and 38 ecoregions have sufficient number of seasonal images in the Landsat archive for change analysis at 10-year and 5-year intervals, respectively. (2) Only 26 of 142 ecoregions belong to research hotspots of land cover mapping based on a spatialized literature database. (3) From a 30 m global land cover map (which is FROM-GLC, Finer Resolution Observation and Monitoring - Global Land Cover), only 28 ecoregions have greater than 80% map accuracy while 36 ecoregions have poorer than 50% map accuracy. Our finding suggests a significant gap of observation and understanding of these critical ecoregions from space, and an urgent need to meet the requirement of the conservation science community, in order for land cover data to fulfil its potential to timely monitor the loss of biodiversity from space, improve our knowledge of the state of conservation, and inform better decision making.

S.; Masters, Ronald E.; Drake, Jason; Weishampel, John; Branquinho, Cristina			Structural diversity indices based on airborne LiDAR as ecological indicators for managing highly dynamic landscapes	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												An objective, quantifiable index of structural biodiversity that could be rapidly obtained with reduced or no field effort is essential for the use of structure as universal ecological indicator for ecosystem management. Active remote sensing provides a rapid assessment tool to potentially guide land managers in highly dynamic and spatially complex landscapes. These landscapes are often dependent on frequent disturbance regimes and characterized by high endemism. We propose a modified Shannon-Wiener Index and modified Evenness Index as stand structural complexity indices for surrogates of ecosystem health. These structural indices are validated at Tall Timbers Research Station the site of one of the longest running fire ecology studies in southeastern U.S. This site is dominated by highly dynamic pine-grassland woodlands maintained with frequent fire. Once the dominant ecosystem in the Southeast, this woodland complex has been cleared for agriculture or converted to other cover types, and depends on a frequent (1- to 3-year fire return interval) low- to moderate-intensity fire regime to prevent succession to mixed hardwood forests and maintain understory species diversity. Structural evaluation of the impact of multiple disturbance regimes included height profiles and derived metrics for five different fire interval treatments; 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, mixed fire frequency (a combination of 2- and 4-year fire returns), and fire exclusion. The 3-dimensional spatial arrangement of structural elements was used to assess hardwood encroachment and changes in structural complexity. In agreement with other research, 3-year fire return interval was considered to be the best fire interval treatment for maintaining the pine-grassland woodlands, because canopy cover and vertical diversity indices were shown to be statistically higher in fire excluded and less frequently burned plots than in 1- and 2-year fire interval treatments. We developed a LiDAR-derived structural diversity index, LHDI, and propose that an ecosystem-specific threshold target for management intervention can be developed, based on significant shifts in structure and composition using this new index. Structural diversity indices can be valuable surrogates of ecosystem biodiversity, and ecosystem-specific target values can be developed as objective quantifiable goals for conservation and ecosystem integrity, particularly in remote areas.

Land use change detection in Solan Forest Division, Himachal Pradesh, India	FOREST ECOSYSTEMS												Background: Monitoring the changing pattern of vegetation across diverse landscapes through remote sensing is instrumental in understanding the interactions of human activities and the ecological environment. Land use pattern in the state of Himachal Pradesh in the Indian Western Himalayas has been undergoing rapid modifications due to changing cropping patterns, rising anthropogenic pressure on forests and government policies. We studied land use change in Solan Forest Division of Himachal Pradesh to assess species wise area changes in the forests of the region. Methods: The supervised classification (Maximum likelihood) on two dates of IRS (LISS III) satellite data was performed to assess land use change over the period 1998-2010. Results: Seven land use categories were identified namely, chir pine (Pinus roxburghii) forest, broadleaved forest, bamboo (Dendrocalamus strictus) forest, ban oak (Quercus leucotrichophora) forest, khair (Acacia catechu) forest, culturable blank and cultivation. The area under chir pine, cultivation and khair forests increased by 191 ha (4.55 %), 129 ha (13.81 %) and 77 ha (23.40 %), whereas the area under ban oak, broadleaved, culturable blank and bamboo decreased by 181 ha (16.58 %), 152 ha (6.30 %), 71 ha (2.72 %) and 7 ha (0.47 %), respectively. Conclusions: The study revealed a decrease in the area under forest and culturable blank categories and a simultaneous increase in the area under cultivation primarily due to the large scale introduction of horticultural cash crops in the state. The composition of forests also exhibited some major changes, with an increase in the area of commercially important monoculture plantation species such as pine and khair, and a decline in the area of oak, broadleaved and bamboo which are facing a high anthropogenic pressure in meeting the livelihood demands of forest dependent communities. In time deforestation, forest degradation and ecological imbalances due to the changing forest species composition may inflict irreversible damages upon unstable and fragile mountain zones such as the Indian Himalayas. The associated common property externalities involved at local, regional and global scales, necessitate the monitoring of land use dynamics across forested landscapes in developing future strategies and policies concerning agricultural diversification, natural forest conservation and monoculture tree plantations.																	2095-6355	2197-5620				SEP 29	2015	2								26	10.1186/s40663-015-0050-7								WOS:000362009000001

To improve characterizing forest canopies with TLS, we forged a methodological paradigm that combines physics and statistics to derive foliage profile, leaf area index (LAI), and leaf angle distribution (LAD): We modeled laser-vegetation interactions probabilistically and then developed a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of vegetation parameters. Unlike classical gap-based algorithms, MLE explicitly accommodates laser scanning geometries, fully leverages raw laser ranging data, and simultaneously derives foliage profile and LAD. We evaluated MLE using both synthetic lidar data and real TLS scans at sites in Everglades National Park, USA. Estimated LAI differed between algorithms by an average of 26%. Compared to classical gap analyses, MLE derived foliage density profile and LAD more accurately. Also, MLE has a rigorous statistical foundation and generated error intervals better indicative of the true uncertainties of estimated canopy parameters an aspect often overlooked but essential for credible use of lidar vegetation products. The theoretical justification and experimental evidence converge to suggest that classical gap methods are sub-optimal for exploiting tiny-footprint lidar data and MLE offers a paradigm-shifting alternative. We envision that MLE will further boost confident use of terrestrial lidar as a versatile tool for environmental applications, such as forest survey, ecological conservation, and ecosystem management.

The annual average soil loss was generated separately for years 1984 and 2011, in order to expose possible soil loss differences occurred in 27years. In addition, sediment accumulation and sediment yield of the studied watershed was also predicted and discussed. The results indicated that very severe erosion risk areas in 1984 was 13.4% of the area, but it was increased to 15.3% by the year 2011, which needs immediate attention from soil conservation point of view. Furthermore, the estimated annual sediment yield of the Nilufer creek watershed was increased from 903 to 979Mgkm(-2) y(-1) in 27years period. The study also provides useful information for decision-makers and planners to take appropriate land management practices in the area.

Habitat Associations of Breeding Mallards and Canada Geese in Southern Ontario, Canada	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												Understanding habitat associations of breeding mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and Canada geese (Branta canadensis maxima) in the eastern US and Canada is important for conservation planning, yet studies at spatial scales useful to conservation planners have mostly occurred in the midcontinent prairie pothole region (PPR). Our broad objective was to determine whether breeding pairs were associated with similar habitat types in an eastern ecozone, the mixed woodland plain of southern Ontario, Canada, as they are in the PPR, despite substantial differences in relative habitat availability and land use practices. We used helicopter surveys and remote sensing to investigate habitat associations at landscape (25 km(2)) and local (500 m wetland buffer [79 ha]) scales during the 2008 and 2009 breeding seasons. At both spatial scales, mallard indicated breeding pairs (IBP) were positively associated with the abundance or area of temporary open water and emergent (seasonal or semipermanent) wetland types, similar to the PPR. However, against expectations, we did not detect an effect of grassland area. Canada goose IBP were most strongly associated with total wetland abundance, and not specifically with emergent and permanent open-water wetlands as expected. At the local scale, goose IBP presence was positively associated with riverine wetland area. Unlike the PPR, our study area contained a high proportion of forested and riverine wetlands; however, with the exception of the riverine wetland-Canada goose association noted above, we did not detect a disproportionate influence of these wetland types on mallards or geese.

Forest cover dynamics of shifting cultivation in the Democratic Republic of Congo: a remote sensing-based assessment for 2000-2010	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Shifting cultivation has traditionally been practiced in the Democratic Republic of Congo by carving agricultural fields out of primary and secondary forest, resulting in the rural complex: a characteristic land cover mosaic of roads, villages, active and fallow fields and secondary forest. Forest clearing has varying impacts depending on where it occurs relative to this area: whether inside it, along its primary forest interface, or in more isolated primary forest areas. The spatial contextualization of forest cover loss is therefore necessary to understand its impacts and plan its management. We characterized forest clearing using spatial models in a Geographical Information System, applying morphological image processing to the Forets d'Afrique Central Evaluee par Teledetection product. This process allowed us to create forest fragmentation maps for 2000, 2005 and 2010, classifying previously homogenous primary forest into separate patch, edge, perforated, fragmented and core forest subtypes. Subsequently we used spatial rules to map the established rural complex separately from isolated forest perforations, tracking the growth of these areas in time. Results confirm that the expansion of the rural complex and forest perforations has high variance throughout the country, with consequent differences in local impacts on forest ecology and habitat fragmentation. Between 2000 and 2010 the rural complex grew by 10.2% (46 182 ha), increasing from 11.9% to 13.1% of the total land area (1.2% change) while perforated forest grew by 74.4% (23 856 ha), from 0.8% to 1.5%. Core forest decreased by 3.8% (54 852 ha), from 38% to 36.6% of the 2010 land area. Of particular concern is the nearly doubling of perforated forest, a land dynamic that represents greater spatial intrusion of forest clearing within core forest areas and a move away from the established rural complex.																	1748-9326					SEP	2015	10	9							094009	10.1088/1748-9326/10/9/094009								WOS:000367141000012						
J	Petrou, ZI; Manakos, I; Stathaki, T				Petrou, Zisis I.; Manakos, Ioannis; Stathaki, Tania			Remote sensing for biodiversity monitoring: a review of methods for biodiversity indicator extraction and assessment of progress towards international targets	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Recognizing the imperative need for biodiversity protection, the convention on biological diversity (CBD) has recently established new targets towards 2020, the so-called Aichi targets, and updated proposed sets of indicators to quantitatively monitor the progress towards these targets. Remote sensing has been increasingly contributing to timely, accurate, and cost-effective assessment of biodiversity-related characteristics and functions during the last years. However, most relevant studies constitute individual research efforts, rarely related with the extraction of widely adopted CBD biodiversity indicators. Furthermore, systematic operational use of remote sensing data by managing authorities has still been limited. In this study, the Aichi targets and the related CBD indicators whose monitoring can be facilitated by remote sensing are identified. For each headline indicator a number of recent remote sensing approaches able for the extraction of related properties are reviewed. Methods cover a wide range of fields, including: habitat extent and condition monitoring; species distribution; pressures from unsustainable management, pollution and climate change; ecosystem service monitoring; and conservation status assessment of protected areas. The advantages and limitations of different remote sensing data and algorithms are discussed. Sorting of the methods based on their reported accuracies is attempted, when possible. The extensive literature survey aims at reviewing highly performing methods that can be used for large-area, effective, and timely biodiversity assessment, to encourage the more systematic use of remote sensing solutions in monitoring progress towards the Aichi targets, and to decrease the gaps between the remote sensing and management communities.																	0960-3115	1572-9710				SEP	2015	24	10					2333	2363		10.1007/s10531-015-0947-z								WOS:000361601400001						
J	Zhou, JH; Qin, J; Gao, K; Xu, S				Zhou, Jianhua; Qin, Jun; Gao, Kai; Xu, Si			Feature-location analyses for identification of urban tree species from very high resolution remote sensing data	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												The interference from background noises and the weak spectral separability between species have negative impacts on the identification of urban tree species from remote sensing images. The density of neighbouring members (members mean both pixels and patches) similar to the centre pixel in some image features may offer an opportunity to improve the separability. This paper focuses on the density-involved feature-location analyses (refer to as F-L analyses) developed from the framework of integrated analysis of feature and space. We expressed the density of feature-carried members in two elaborated models: using the density dimension and adding the density descriptors to a feature space to conduct the F-L analyses during a procedure of classifying urban tree species. Experimental results indicate that the two models cannot only increase the number of available independent components for constructing an input vector therefore making the feature space richer, but also provide the reference of spatial dependence among the feature-carried members thus finally making the identification less difficult. The method with the density-involved F-L analyses obviously outperforms that with only conventional spectral features analyses in the classification. The average overall accuracy (OA) derived from the former is 23% higher than that from the latter. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A geo-statistical approach to model Asiatic cheetah, onager, gazelle and wild sheep shared niche and distribution in Turan biosphere reserve-Iran	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Presence data for four mammals in the Turan Biosphere Reserve in Iran including the Asiatic cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus), the Persian onager (Equus hemionus onager), the wild sheep (Ovis vignei), and the gazelle (Gazelle Bennettii) were used to analyze and model their potential interaction, facilitation, habitat coverage and niche dimensions. A geostatistical approach using the spatial autocorrelation between the locality points, and their relationship with habitat resources and characteristics with application of remotely sensed maximum enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and surface temperature, elevation, aspect, vegetation cover and soil moisture was used to predict herbivores species niche. The potential suitable habitat of herbivores along with environmental variables was used to model the predator species (cheetah) niche. The model results were tested using fivefold cross validation by area under the curve (AUC) values on set of independent testing data and were compared to more commonly used models of generalized linear model (GLM) and MaxEnt The results show that cheetah's potential suitable habitat has 61% overlap with wild sheep, 36% with onager, and 30% with gazelle. Onager habitat has 64% overlap with gazelle and 60% the wild sheep. Wild sheep on the hand, shares only 37% of its habitat with gazelle. The most prey and predator interaction exists between cheetahs and wild sheep, while onagers provides facilitation for gazelles and wild sheep by potentially providing extra water sources. Among the implemented modeling techniques, spatial GLM showed better performance over GLM and MaxEnt We suggest that conservation effort should focus more on maintaining the population of wild sheep and onagers to support other species in the habitat.

Remote Sensing and GIS based soil erosion assessment from an agricultural watershed	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Soil resource is important for livelihood of the human being. Soil erosion is a global environmental crisis in the world today that threatens the natural environment and agriculture. The present study was undertaken to assess the annual rate of soil erosion from the study watershed using distributed information for topography, land use, soil, etc. using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) techniques and to compare the simulated sediment loss with observed sediment loss. In the present study, the Shakkar River watershed, lying in Narmada river basin situated in Narsinghpur and Chhindwara districts of Madhya Pradesh, India, was selected. The universal soil loss equation (USLE) integrated with RS and GIS approach was used to predict the spatial distribution of the soil erosion on a cell basis occurring in the study area. Thematic maps of USLE factors like rainfall erosivity factor (R), soil erodibility factor (K), topographic factor (LS), crop/cover management factor (C), and conservation/support practice factor (P) were prepared by using annual rainfall data, soil map, digital elevation model (DEM) and executable C++ program, and satellite image of the area, respectively, in the GIS environment. The annual rate of soil erosion was estimated for 10 years (1997 to 2006), and during this period, the annual rate of sediment loss from study area was found to vary between 6.45 and 13.74 t/ha/year with an average annual rate of 10.04 t/ha/year. The percent deviation between simulated and observed values varies between 2.68 and 18.73 % with coefficient of determination (R (2)) of 0.911.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				SEP	2015	8	9					6967	6984		10.1007/s12517-014-1718-y								WOS:000360227000036

Evaluation of urban growth effects on surface runoff using SCS-CN method and Green-Ampt infiltration model	EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS												Evaluation of land cover/use change and its impact on hydrological design aspects plays a vital role in assessing the capacity of existing storm water conveyance systems and its capability towards the anticipated peak flow. This paper attempts to illustrate an application of Soil Conservation Service (SCS-CN) method for runoff estimation using continuous time series rainfall. And also, the present work proposes a Land use factor based on the Curve Number to correct the infiltration rate according to the prevailing land cover/use. Indian remote sensing (IRS) satellite data for the years 1989, 1992, 1995, 1998, 2001, 2004, 2007, and 2010 are used to evaluate the growth of Tiruchirapalli city, India city and to assess its impact on surface runoff. The Geographical information system (GIS) is used to prepare the different layers belonging to various land covers identified from remotely sensed data. The sub-watersheds are created using Digital Elevation Model (DEM) prepared by ARC GIS software. The single storm event and 50-year return period rainfall data are used as a hydrological input to the model to evaluate the increase in runoff over the years due to change in the land cover of the study area. The study reveals that the impact of land cover/use change is more significant for longer duration storm than short duration storm at the same magnitude. Further, it is noticed from the study that the runoff depth and runoff co-efficient is large for short duration rainfall than long duration rainfall at the same magnitude.																	1865-0473	1865-0481				SEP	2015	8	3			SI		609	626		10.1007/s12145-014-0193-z								WOS:000360693000012

The magnitude of the impact of ungulates on vegetation has been debated for a long time, but quantifying such effects at the continental scale has been difficult. This study presents an attempt to estimate for the first time the potential impact of large natural ungulate grazer herds on African ecosystems. LocationThe African continent (excluding Madagascar). MethodThe potential impacts of grazing on grass biomass, competition between grasses and trees, the occurrence and effects of wildfire and biome distribution were simulated with a model that couples a physiological grazer population model with a physiological dynamic vegetation one (not including the effects of browsing). This model has previously been shown to reproduce grazer densities across African wildlife reserves. ResultsModelled grazer densities corresponded reasonably well with the continental distribution of African grazers represented by the herbivore functional types in the model. The coupled model predicted a hump-shaped relationship between annual precipitation and grazer biomass densities within a range of estimates from independent studies. In accordance with other studies, net primary productivity and the length of the dry season were the strongest predictors of grazer densities in the model. The inclusion of grazers in the model did not substantially alter an already (without grazers) reasonable fit between simulated vegetation biomass and burned area and estimates of these derived from remote sensing data. Nevertheless, the grazer-vegetation model predicted substantial impacts on grass biomass, tree biomass and burned area, particularly in areas with high grazer densities. The biome distribution at the continental scale, however, was similar with and without grazers. Main conclusionThe results suggest that natural large ungulate grazers have been important drivers of ecosystem functioning in some savanna ecosystems, but also that they do not have a large effect on the continental-scale biome distribution and carbon stocks.

Hydro-economic analysis of groundwater pumping for irrigated agriculture in California's Central Valley, USA	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												As in many places, groundwater in California (USA) is the major alternative water source for agriculture during drought, so groundwater's availability will drive some inevitable changes in the state's water management. Currently, agricultural, environmental, and urban uses compete for groundwater, resulting in substantial overdraft in dry years with lowering of water tables, which in turn increases pumping costs and reduces groundwater pumping capacity. In this study, SWAP (an economic model of agricultural production and water use in California) and C2VISim (the California Department of Water Resources groundwater model for California's Central Valley) are connected. This paper examines the economic costs of pumping replacement groundwater during drought and the potential loss of pumping capacity as groundwater levels drop. A scenario of three additional drought years continuing from 2014 show lower water tables in California's Central Valley and loss of pumping capacity. Places without access to groundwater and with uncertain surface-water deliveries during drought are the most economically vulnerable in terms of crop revenues, employment and household income. This is particularly true for Tulare Lake Basin, which relies heavily on water imported from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Remote-sensing estimates of idle agricultural land between 2012 and 2014 confirm this finding. Results also point to the potential of a portfolio approach for agriculture, in which crop mixing and conservation practices have substantial roles.																	1431-2174	1435-0157				SEP	2015	23	6					1205	1216		10.1007/s10040-015-1283-9								WOS:000359776900012

An analysis of the suitability change of habitats is critical to waterbirds' habitats conservation. In this study, the suitability maps of waterbirds' habitats in 1990, 2000, and 2010 were created using the ecological niche suitability model (ENSM) in Bielahong Watershed of Northeast China. Five grades (good suitable, fair suitable, suitable, poor suitable, and not suitable) of suitability for waterbirds' habitats were assessed in a spatial scale. The possible causes and changing characteristics of suitable waterbirds' habitats loss were studied based on landscape metrics and habitat suitability index. The results indicate a significant decrease in the suitable waterbirds' habitats areas over the past 20 years with an average annual decrease rate of 874,3 ha /year. The number of suitable waterbirds' habitats patches (NP) increased substantially from 765 to 1729, and the mean patch size (MPS) decreased from 161,3 to 713 ha. Wetland degradation also occurred over the study period, resulting in the loss and isolation of suitable waterbirds' habitats. Water source change had the largest contribution to the suitable waterbirds' habitats change compared with other waterbirds' habitats suitability indexes. The results show that the shrinkage of suitable waterbirds' habitats may be attributed to human activity, aided by decreased wetland area.																	0255-660X	0974-3006				SEP	2015	43	3					599	607		10.1007/s12524-014-0429-x								WOS:000359730500015

Mapping mangrove changes in the Matang Mangrove Forest using multi temporal satellite imageries	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												The Matang Mangrove Forest is the largest single mangrove forest in Peninsular Malaysia, covering an area of more than 40,000 ha. As a national treasure, it lies under the jurisdiction of both the federal and state authorities. Monitoring temporal changes of mangrove area on a large scale requires a more efficient tool. Remote sensing is often a reliable alternative to ground-survey methods that provides useful source of information and coverage that is timely and complete especially in mangroves areas where accessibility is difficult. In this study, status and changes of land use and land cover in the Matang Mangrove Forest during the past 18 years (1993-1999,1999 to 2011 and 1993 to 2011) were determined using multi temporal satellites, and threats to the ecosystems were also identified. Classification of land use and land cover approach was implemented using the maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) along with vegetation index differencing (NDVI) technique. Classification accuracy at 85.7%, 90%, and 88.9% with Kappa statistics of 0.82, 0.88, and 0.94 respectively for 1993, 1999 and 2011 image were obtained. The overall change in the area during the 18-year period indicated the loss of mangrove area at 8017.3 ha, while 2998 ha was newly planted or rehabilitated. The present study revealed that Rhizophora apiculata and Rhizophora mucronata are still being preserved, accounting to more than 80%. of the total species. Temporal changes of the mangrove for the 18-year period showed that the mangroves were converted to water bodies at 31.1%, dry land forest at 30.6%, oil palm plantation at 18.9%, aquaculture at 11.1%, paddy plantation at 4.9%, horticulture at 3.1%, and urban settlement area at 0.3%. Threats towards the mangrove area were due to erosion, tree harvesting rotation, transitional forest, shrimp ponds, illegal agricultural activities and trespassing. The findings indicated an approach in collecting regular and appropriate mangrove forest area database and detection of activities that violate regulations. This will provide adequate information to the stakeholders in enhancing the management practise and for legislative purposes. Hence, combinations of these approaches has been proven to be adequate in detecting changes in the mangrove area and indicating the nature of the changes which will promote and enhance the management planning process towards sustainability of the Matang Mangrove Forest.

J	Huang, YS				Huang, Yishuo			Detecting the changes in rural communities in Taiwan by applying multiphase segmentation on FORMOSA-2 satellite imagery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Agricultural activities mainly occur in rural areas; recently, ecological conservation and biological diversity are being emphasized in rural communities to promote sustainable development for rural communities, especially for rural communities in Taiwan. Therefore, since 2005, many rural communities in Taiwan have compiled their own development strategies in order to create their own unique characteristics to attract people to visit and stay in rural communities. By implementing these strategies, young people can stay in their own rural communities and the rural communities are rejuvenated. However, some rural communities introduce artificial construction into the community such that the ecological and biological environments are significantly degraded. The strategies need to be efficiently monitored because up to 67 rural communities have proposed rejuvenation projects. In 2015, up to 440 rural communities were estimated to be involved in rural community rejuvenations. How to monitor the changes occurring in those rural communities participating in rural community rejuvenation such that ecological conservation and ecological diversity can be satisfied is an important issue in rural community management. Remote sensing provides an efficient and rapid method to achieve this issue. Segmentation plays a fundamental role in human perception. In this respect, segmentation can be used as the process of transforming the collection of pixels of an image into a group of regions or objects with meaning. This paper proposed an algorithm based on the multiphase approach to segment the normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI, of the rural communities into several sub-regions, and to have the NDV1 distribution in each sub-region be homogeneous. Those regions whose values of NDVI are close will be merged into the same class. In doing so, a complex NDVI map can be simplified into two groups: the high and low values of NDVI. The class with low NDVI values corresponds to those regions containing roads, buildings, and other manmade construction works and the class with high values of NDVI indicates that those regions contain vegetation in good health. In order to verify the processed results, the regional boundaries were extracted and laid down on the given images to check whether the extracted boundaries were laid down on buildings, roads, or other artificial constructions. In addition to the proposed approach, another approach called statistical region merging was employed by grouping sets of pixels with homogeneous properties such that those sets are iteratively grown by combining smaller regions or pixels. In doing so, the segmented NDVI map can be generated. By comparing the areas of the merged classes in different years, the changes occurring in the rural communities of Taiwan can be detected. The satellite imagery of FORMOSA-2 with 2-m ground resolution is employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The satellite imagery of two rural communities (Jhumen and Taomi communities) is chosen to evaluate environmental changes between 2005 and 2010. The change maps of 2005-2010 show that a high density of green on a patch of land is increased by 19.62 ha in Jhumen community and conversely a similar patch of land is significantly decreased by 236.59 ha in Taomi community. Furthermore, the change maps created by another image segmentation method called statistical region merging generate similar processed results to multiphase segmentation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We examine the use of space of a group of bearded capuchin monkeys, a species unique in their use of stone tools to extract encapsulated foods. We define important landscape variables associated with the monkeys' behavior, especially the use of stone tools. Maximum entropy modeling is used to define the landscape characteristics associated with the monkeys' use of space. The variables evaluated in model building include normalized difference vegetation index, distance to roads, distance to areas of human influence, distance to vertical scarps, elevation, land cover/land use class, and percentages of green vegetation, bare soil, and shadow from spectral mixture analysis. Distance to areas of human influence and distance to vertical scarps were the variables most closely associated with capuchin habitat suitability (permutation importance 31.7% and 21%, respectively). Stone tool use occurred in areas of lower elevation and higher percent green vegetation relative to other behavior. These results may inform efforts for conserving the unique stone tool use of this species, especially relevant due to the recent expansion and intensification of industrial agriculture in the region.

There is an urgent need to know how progradation of the Yellow River delta (YRD), an area on which people live and farm, has continued and will continue to respond to these controls. This study examines the changing patterns of water and sediment supply to the YRD over the period of 1950-2013 and, using remote sensing, it evaluates the morphological changes of the delta during 1976-2013. Although both water and sediment input to the delta have been described as declining significantly since the mid 1960s, we show that since 2005 the supply of water has remained at around 20 billion m(3)yr(-1) and that for sediment at about 0.13 billion t yr(-1); water input has been even slightly increasing. The dynamics of extension/shrinking and avulsion in river-mouth channels and accretion/erosion of shorelines is an integrated response to the complex variations in both sediment and water supply. This study develops a quantitative relationship between water and sediment supply and the area of land accretion and it predicts the critical condition for land accretion in the YRD. To ensure that delta land will not be lost, care is needed in the future implementation of the basin-scale water regulation program. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Mapping the spread and distribution of S. alterniflora is the first step toward understanding the factors that determine the population expansion patterns. Remote sensing is a promising tool to monitor the expansion of S. alterniflora. Twelve Landsat TM images and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were used to delineate the invasion of S. alterniflora from 1993 to 2009, and SPOT 6 images and Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) were used to map the distribution of S. alterniflora in 2014. In situ data and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images were used as supplementary data. S. alterniflora spread rapidly in Yueqing Bay over the past 21 years. Between 1993 and 2009, the area of S. alterniflora increased by 608 times (from 4 to 2432 ha). The rapid expansion of S. alterniflora covered almost all of the bare mudflats around the mangrove forests and the cultivated mudflats. However, from 2009 to 2014, the rate of expansion of S. alterniflora began to slow down in Yueqing Bay, and the total area of S. alterniflora in Yantian decreased by 275 ha. These phenomena can be explained by the landscape changes and ecological niches. Through the expansion of S. alterniflora, it was found that the ecological significance and environmental impact of S. alterniflora was different in different regions in Yueqing Bay. The conservation plans for Yueqing Bay should consider both the positive and negative effects of S. alterniflora, and the governmental policy should be based on the different circumstances of the regions.																	1932-6203					AUG 11	2015	10	8							e0135538	10.1371/journal.pone.0135538								WOS:000359353300091	26263172

GIS based drainage morphometry and its influence on hydrology in parts of Western Ghats region, Maharashtra, India	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL												Various drainage morphometric parameters in the Upper Bhima river basin and its influence on hydrological processes (e.g. runoff, peak flow, time to peak, infiltration, overland flow, etc.) were discussed using geographical information system (GIS) and remote sensing techniques. Survey of India topographical maps and ASTER digital elevation model was incorporated for thematic database generation and morphometric parameter evaluation in GIS environment. The whole study basin was divided into 8 sub-basins so that the spatial variation of morphological parameters and its influence on hydrology could be analyzed. The interrelationship between morphometric variables were computed (p<0.05) and presented in a correlation matrix. The study revealed that mean basin slope ( [GRAPHICS] ), drainage density ( [GRAPHICS] ), length of overland flow ( [GRAPHICS] ) and basin relief ( [GRAPHICS] ) are closely associated and significantly related with a large number of morphometric variables. Due to close proximity of Western Ghats, sub-basins 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 are highly influenced by slope, as a result, length of overland flow decreases and water immediately follows channel path. In contrast, sub-basins 3, 7 and 8 are relatively flatter, overland flow is relatively longer and favourable for infiltration. This study emphasizes on qualitative description about the hydrological variables influenced by the morphometric parameters in a mountainous basin in western India. Independent morphometric variables were identified from correlation matrix and used in a multiple criteria analysis (MCA) framework for watershed prioritization. Analytical hierarchical process, a MCA technique, identified the highest (sub-basin 4) and lowest (sub-basin 7) priority sub-basins in the Upper Bhima basin. The outcome of the study may be useful for watershed managers and planners while implementing soil and water conservation measures in the region.																	1010-6049	1752-0762				AUG 9	2015	30	7					755	778		10.1080/10106049.2014.978903								WOS:000359741600003

Remote sensing captures varying temporal patterns of vegetation between human-altered and natural landscapes	PEERJ												Global change has led to shifts in phenology, potentially disrupting species interactions such as plant-pollinator relationships. Advances in remote sensing techniques allow one to detect vegetation phenological diversity between different land use types, but it is not clear how this translates to other communities in the ecosystem. Here, we investigated the phenological diversity of the vegetation across a human-altered landscape including urban, agricultural, and natural land use types. We found that the patterns of change in the vegetation indices (EVI and NDVI) of human-altered landscapes are out of synchronization with the phenology in neighboring natural California grassland habitat. Comparing these findings to a spatio-temporal pollinator distribution dataset, EVI and NDVI were significant predictors of total bee abundance, a relationship that improved with time lags. This evidence supports the importance of differences in temporal dynamics between land use types. These findings also highlight the potential to utilize remote sensing data to make predictions for components of biodiversity that have tight vegetation associations, such as pollinators.

Northwest Yunnan Province is a key region for biodiversity conservation in China, and it has experienced severe droughts since the beginning of this century; however, the extent of the contributions from climate and human-driven changes remains unclear. We calculated the ecosystem evapotranspiration (ET) and water yield (WY) of northwest Yunnan Province, China from 2001 to 2013 using meteorological and remote sensing observation data and a Surface Energy Balance System(SEBS) model. Multivariate regression analyses were used to differentiate the contribution of climate and vegetation coverage to ET. The results showed that the annual average vegetation coverage significantly increased over time with a mean of 0.69 in spite of the precipitation fluctuation. Afforestation/reforestation and other management efforts attributed to vegetation coverage increase in NW Yunnan. Both ET and WY considerably fluctuated with the climate factors, which ranged from 623.29 mm to 893.8 mm and -51.88 mm to 384.40 mm over the time period. Spatially, ET in the southeast of NW Yunnan (mainly in Lijiang) increased significantly, which was in line with the spatial trend of vegetation coverage. Multivariate linear regression analysis indicated that climatic factors accounted for 85.18% of the ET variation, while vegetation coverage explained 14.82%. On the other hand, precipitation accounted for 67.5% of the WY. We conclude that the continuous droughts in northwest Yunnan were primarily climatically driven; however, man-made land cover and vegetation changes also increased the vulnerability of local populations to drought. Because of the high proportion of the water yield consumed for subsistence and poor infrastructure for water management, local populations have been highly vulnerable to climate drought conditions. We suggest that conservation of native vegetation and development of water-conserving agricultural practices should be implemented as adaptive strategies to mitigate climate change.																	1932-6203					AUG 3	2015	10	8							e0134795	10.1371/journal.pone.0134795								WOS:000358942400039	26237220

How remote sensing supports mangrove ecosystem service valuation: A case study in Ca Mau province, Vietnam	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES												This paper highlights the importance of using household survey and remote sensing data for the assessment of mangrove ecosystem services (fisheries and timber related products, carbon sequestration, storm protection) in Ca Mau Province, Vietnam. The results indicate that remote sensing plays an important role in ecosystem service valuation in the large areas where mangroves and aquaculture are mixed. We estimated the value of mangrove ecosystem services using market price and replacement cost approaches to determine an initial assessment of the overall contribution of mangroves to human well-being. The total estimated value was US$ 600 million/year for 187,533 ha (approximately US$ 3000/ ha/year), which is slightly smaller than the gross domestic product (GDP) of the province (US$ 0.69 billion in 2010). However, this is only a partial estimate that does not consider other services (tourism, biocliversity, cultural and social values), clue to the absence of primary data The main contribution of this study is that it is the first to combine the approaches of remote sensing and household survey for the quantification of mangrove ecosystem services in the mangrove-shrimp integrated system. Our findings indicate that the continued expansion of acivaculture has reduced the benefits to local communities provided by the mangrove ecosystem. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we (1) review the current status of the diversity and distribution of coastal ecosystems in BCS, (2) assess the composition and coverage of these ecosystems in PNAs, and (3) identify coastal ecosystems of special interest for conservation. The combination of spatial analysis techniques was carried out using LandSat TM images and GIS processing, considering ecoregions and ecosystems in the coastal zone, as well as through the application of an ecosystem diversity index. In the BCS coastal zone, 11 ecosystems were identified: scrub, coastal water body, riparian, bare soil, halophyte, beach, salt flat, mangrove, salt marsh, coral reef, and seagrass. The ecosystem diversity in BCS results from the coastal features that differentiate the Pacific and the Gulf coasts. PNAs include 17 % of coastal ecosystems. Bahia Magdalena (Pacific) and Bahia Concepcin (Gulf of California), which are key for conservation (including mangroves and seagrasses), should be considered either for classification as PNAs or for inclusion in coastal management programs. The combination of remote sensing and GIS with biogeographic and ecosystemic approaches in our study enabled to determine ecosystem diversity and set coastal conservation priorities in Baja California Sur, Mexico. Specifically, coastal ecosystems that are not currently included within PNAs and which should be considered as conservation priorities were identified.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				AUG	2015	19	4					609	619		10.1007/s11852-015-0411-y								WOS:000362017900015

Simulating acoustic coherent backscattering enhancement from random aggregations of omnidirectional scatterers	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												Coherent backscatter enhancement (CBE) is a multiple scattering phenomenon that can lead to a doubling of the backscattered field intensity from a random aggregation of scatterers. It may be useful for remote sensing of scatterer aggregations, such as fish schools. This paper presents simulations of acoustic CBE from randomly placed omnidirectional point scatterers based on Foldy's field equations. The simulations are verified and validated through comparisons with Bragg scattering and Foldy's effective-medium theory, assessments of acoustic energy conservation, and comparisons with prior optical and acoustical CBE results. To make CBE comparisons with prior optics results, a CBE coherence function was postulated to account for resolution differences between the optics and simulation studies. For the higher-resolution optics studies, the postulated coherence function yields a CBE of 1.68, which matches optical CBE measurements. For the lower-resolution simulations, the same coherence function yields a CBE of 1.034, which agrees with appropriately extrapolated CBE simulation results, 1.030 +/- 0.005. Assuming comparable resolution, the acoustics experiment and simulations both produce a CBE of approximately 1.5. The CBE peak is found to increase approximately monotonically with (k(2)sigma(s))(1/4) (ks)(-1), where k is the wave number, s is the average spacing between scatterers, and sigma(s) is a scatterer's cross section.

The present work analyses the spatial and temporal changes in forest cover in Moncayo Natural Park (Spain) from 1987 to 2010 using remote sensing techniques, geographical information systems (GIS) and quantitative indices of landscape ecology. Four Landsat images were used to map nine representative land cover categories in this preserved area in both years. The overall classification accuracies in land cover cartographies in 1987 and 2010 were 87.65% and 84.56%, respectively. Landscape metrics obtained at the landscape level show an increase in fragmentation and, as a result, an increase in landscape spatial diversity. Focusing on the class level, the results show a forest expansion of sessile oaks (Quercus petraea) and beech forest (Fagus sylvatica), two important bioclimatic indicators in this natural park, because they are the southernmost locations for these species in Europe. The decrease of mainly introduced pine forest and the transformation of mixed shrub areas into natural forested areas explain the aforementioned increase in fragmentation. These results are in agreement with the strategies for nature conservation designed by forest managers during the period evaluated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Populations have already been depleted to approximately 20% of their former size with habitat destruction, alterations, and loss being the main drivers of population declines. Habitat suitability models were computed using a combination of bioclimatic and remote sensing variables as environmental predictors to evaluate habitat suitability and coverage by designated protected areas across the species' distributional range. In addition, population connectivity as well as current and future habitat fragmentation through dam construction was assessed by performing population connectivity models. Habitat suitability models show the spatial extent of suitable habitat to be high (46%), although only a small proportion is covered by designated reserves (11%). Population connectivity models showed remnant populations to be highly fragmented. Considering habitat suitability, coverage of reserves and population connectivity the lower Mekong River Basin stretching from the Xe Champhon and Xe Xangxoy rivers in Lao PDR to the Srepok and Sekong rivers in eastern Cambodia seem to be particularly important for future conservation prioritization for C. siamensis. The presently established protected area network is unsatisfactory in terms of size and population connectivity and needs to be significantly improved to successfully sustain viable populations of the critically endangered Siamese crocodile in the future.

The Effects of Seasonality in Estimating the C-Factor of Soil Erosion Studies	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Monitoring soil erosion risk is an important part of soil conservation practices. It is usually estimated with the Universal Soil Loss Equation, and the C-factor (vegetation cover) is derived from optical satellite images. However, because of lack of data and resources, or in rapid assessments, C-factor is estimated using one or a few satellite observations, despite being temporally variable according to plants' phenology. The aim of this work was to study the effect of seasonality in estimating C-factor. This was achieved by demonstrating first that there is a difference when estimating soil erosion with Universal Soil Loss Equation at variable time steps in a year, namely once, seasonally and monthly. Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer normalized difference vegetation index images and statistical analysis at subcatchment scale, it was shown that there is a significant difference when estimating mean annual soil loss with the aforementioned temporal options. The highest differences were observed between monthly and annual time steps. The second objective was to identify which is the optimum time to estimate C-factor in a year. The results show that November, October and March are the optimum months for single image estimation of annual soil erosion. Statistical analysis with a random point dataset suggested that the spatial variability of the results was influenced by the land cover type, especially in areas with variable leaf cover where a single date estimation of C-factor was not representative of the whole year, such as annual crops and deciduous trees.

Basking sharks and oceanographic fronts: quantifying associations in the north-east Atlantic	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												Understanding the mechanisms that link oceanographic processes and marine vertebrate space use is critical to our knowledge of marine ecosystem functioning, and for effective management of populations of conservation concern. The basking shark Cetorhinus maximus has been observed in association with oceanographic fronts - physical interfaces at the transitions between water masses - exploiting foraging opportunities resulting from zooplankton aggregation. However, the scale, significance and variability of these associations have not previously been established. Here, we quantify the influence of thermal and chlorophyll-a fronts on basking shark habitat use in the north-east Atlantic. We use animal-mounted archival tracking together with composite front mapping via Earth Observation (EO) remote sensing to provide an oceanographic context to shark movements. We investigate levels of association with fronts occurring over two spatio-temporal scales, (i) broad-scale, seasonally persistent frontal zones and (ii) contemporaneous thermal and chl-a fronts. Using random walk simulations and logistic regression within an iterative generalized linear mixed modelling (GLMM) framework, we find that seasonal front frequency is a significant predictor of shark presence. Oceanographic metrics time-matched to shark tracks indicate that sharks show a preference for productive regions and associate with contemporaneous thermal and chl-a fronts more frequently than could be expected at random. Moreover, we highlight the importance of front persistence and cross-frontal temperature step, which appear to interact to affect the degree of prey aggregation along thermal fronts in this shelf-sea system. Our findings confirm that surface frontal activity is a predictor of basking shark presence in the north-east Atlantic, both over seasonal timescales and in near real-time. These insights have clear implications for understanding the preferred habitats of basking sharks in the context of anthropogenic threat management and marine spatial planning in the region.

Where the wild things are: using remotely sensed forest productivity to assess arboreal marsupial species richness and abundance	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												AimHighly productive areas have long been hypothesized to support a greater abundance and diversity of animals than less productive areas. However, evidence for this is equivocal and, until recently, has been difficult to test at a landscape level. For the first time, we use imaging spectroscopy to investigate the relationship between plant productivity and arboreal mammal species richness and abundance at a landscape scale. LocationA eucalypt forest in New South Wales, Australia. MethodsUsing a common index of plant productivity - normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) - as a proxy for available energy, we test the ability of species-energy theory and optimal foraging theory to explain variations in arboreal marsupial species richness and abundance. We obtained NDVI data from an airborne imaging spectrophotometer. ResultsSpecies richness increased in relation to NDVI among 53 eucalypt forest sites, based on five arboreal marsupial species. The presence and abundance of a eucalypt folivore specialist, Petauroides volans, increased in relation to NDVI. The relative abundance of all arboreal marsupials collectively also increased in relation to NDVI among sites, even with P.volans data excluded. In support of optimal foraging theory, the observed locations of P.volans had a higher NDVI value than the average for sampling transects. In addition, the average NDVI of eucalypt forest remnants was positively related to the overall abundance of P.volans. An important caveat is that NDVI did not explain all the variation in arboreal marsupial populations. Main conclusionsAssuming that NDVI is an appropriate proxy for available energy in a eucalypt forest, our results are consistent with predictions from species-energy and optimal foraging theories. Remotely sensed measures of productivity and forage quality, used in conjunction with other important landscape characteristics, provide a potentially powerful tool to evaluate habitat and biodiversity hotspots at scales relevant to wildlife management and conservation.

The potential for failure is greater at locations where the influence of natural processes is inconsistent with intended project function and performance. We present an approach using practical GIS, hydrologic, hydraulic, and sediment transport analyses to identify locations where specific restoration project types have the greatest likelihood of working as intended because their function and design are matched with flooding and morphologic processes. The key premise is to identify whether a specific river analysis segment (length 1-10 bankfull widths) within a longer reach is geomorphically active or inactive in the context of vertical and lateral stabilities, and hydrologically active for floodplain connectivity. Analyses involve empirical channel geometry relations, aerial photographic time series, LiDAR data, HEC-RAS hydraulic modeling, and a time-integrated sediment transport budget to evaluate trapping efficiency within each segment. The analysis segments are defined by HEC-RAS model cross sections. The results have been used effectively to identify feasible projects in a variety of alluvial gravel bed river reaches with lengths between 11 and 80 km and 2-year flood magnitudes between 350 and 1330 m(3)/s. Projects constructed based on the results have all performed as planned. In addition, the results provide key criteria for formulating erosion and flood management plans.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				AUG	2015	56	2					549	568		10.1007/s00267-015-0518-9								WOS:000357280500019	25910870

The Influence of Land Cover, Vertical Structure, and Socioeconomic Factors on Outdoor Water Use in a Western US City	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												To help inform urban water conservation and planning, we evaluated spatial patterns and correlative relationships among physical land cover properties, socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, and single-family outdoor residential water use in Aurora, Colorado, a rapidly-growing suburb in the semi-arid Colorado Front Range. Using high resolution land cover maps and lidar-derived vertical structural data, we quantified land cover composition and vertical structural characteristics for detached, single-family residential parcels. These data were combined with socioeconomic and demographic datasets from the 2010 US Census and local government agencies and used in Random Forest analyses of outdoor water use estimated from residential water meter records, with separate analyses conducted using parcels and census block groups as sampling units. Conditional variable importance measures from Random Forest analyses and comparisons of the predictive accuracy of models developed using subsets of explanatory variables were used to assess the relative importance of physical and socioeconomic variables in predicting outdoor water use. Models developed using the subset of land cover variables had the highest predictive accuracy, followed by vertical structural variables, and lastly, socioeconomic/demographic variables. At both the parcel and census block group scale, there was significant spatial clustering in outdoor water use as indicated by various spatial statistical analyses. Our approach demonstrates the value of high resolution land cover and structure data for understanding urban water use patterns and can be used for targeting water conservation efforts.																	0920-4741	1573-1650				AUG	2015	29	10					3877	3890		10.1007/s11269-015-1034-7								WOS:000357345300025

Forecasting sagebrush ecosystem components and greater sage-grouse habitat for 2050: Learning from past climate patterns and Landsat imagery to predict the future	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) ecosystems constitute the largest single North American shrub ecosystem and provide vital ecological, hydrological, biological, agricultural, and recreational ecosystem services. Disturbances have altered and reduced this ecosystem historically, but climate change may ultimately represent the greatest future risk. Improved ways to quantify, monitor, and predict climate-driven gradual change in this ecosystem is vital to its future management. We examined the annual change of Daymet precipitation (daily gridded climate data) and five remote sensing ecosystem sagebrush vegetation and soil components (bare ground, herbaceous, litter, sagebrush, and shrub) from 1984 to 2011 in southwestern Wyoming. Bare ground displayed an increasing trend in abundance over time, and herbaceous, litter, shrub, and sagebrush showed a decreasing trend. Total precipitation amounts show a downward trend during the same period. We established statistically significant correlations between each sagebrush component and historical precipitation records using a simple least squares linear regression. Using the historical relationship between sagebrush component abundance and precipitation in a linear model, we forecasted the abundance of the sagebrush components in 2050 using Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) precipitation scenarios A1B and A2. Bare ground was the only component that increased under both future scenarios, with a net increase of 48.98 km(2) (1.1%) across the study area under the A1B scenario and 41.15 km(2) (0.9%) under the A2 scenario. The remaining components decreased under both future scenarios: litter had the highest net reductions with 49.82 km(2) (4.1%) under A1B and 50.8 km(2) (4.2%) under A2, and herbaceous had the smallest net reductions with 39.95 km(2) (3.8%) under A1B and 40.59 km(2) (3.3%) under A2. We applied the 2050 forecast sagebrush component values to contemporary (circa 2006) greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) habitat models to evaluate the effects of potential climate-induced habitat change. Under the 2050 IPCC A1B scenario, 11.6% of currently identified nesting habitat was lost, and 0.002% of new potential habitat was gained, with 4% of summer habitat lost and 0.039% gained. Our results demonstrate the successful ability of remote sensing based sagebrush components, when coupled with precipitation, to forecast future component response using IPCC precipitation scenarios. Our approach also enables future quantification of greater sage-grouse habitat under different precipitation scenarios, and provides additional capability to identify regional precipitation influence on sagebrush component response.

This understanding is especially important in the fire-prone Mediterranean systems of the world. The fire frequency in these systems is sensitive to climate, and recent climate change has resulted in more frequent fires over the last few decades. However, the sensitivity of postfire recovery and biomass/fuel load accumulation to climate is less well understood than fire frequency despite its importance in driving the fire regime. In this study, we develop a hierarchical statistical framework to model postfire ecosystem recovery using satellite-derived observations of vegetation as a function of stand age, topography, and climate. In the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) of South Africa, a fire-prone biodiversity hotspot, we found strong postfire recovery gradients associated with climate resulting in faster recovery in regions with higher soil fertility, minimum July (winter) temperature, and mean January (summer) precipitation. Projections using an ensemble of 11 downscaled Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) general circulation models (GCMs) suggest that warmer winter temperatures in 2080-2100 will encourage faster postfire recovery across the region, which could further increase fire frequency due to faster fuel accumulation. However, some models project decreasing precipitation in the western CFR, which would slow recovery rates there, likely reducing fire frequency through lack of fuel and potentially driving local biome shifts from fynbos shrubland to nonburning semidesert vegetation. This simple yet powerful approach to making inferences from large, remotely sensed datasets has potential for wide application to modeling ecosystem resilience in disturbance-prone ecosystems globally.

Aboveground live carbon stock changes of California wildland ecosystems, 2001-2010	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The balance between ecosystem emissions of carbon to the atmosphere and removals from the atmosphere indicates whether ecosystems are exacerbating or reducing climate change. Forest ecosystems in the State of California, USA, contain carbon that reaches the highest densities (mass per unit area) in the world, but it has been unresolved whether California ecosystems currently comprise a net sink or source of carbon. The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 established greenhouse gas reduction targets for fossil fuel-burning sectors and ecosystems, underscoring the importance of tracking ecosystem carbon. Here, we conduct statewide spatial inventories of the aboveground live carbon stocks of forests and other terrestrial ecosystems of California, excluding agricultural and urban areas. We analyzed biomass data from field measurements of the Forest Inventory and Analysis program, published biomass information and remote sensing data on non-forest vegetation, and spatial distributions of vegetation types, height, and fractional cover derived by the Landfire program from Landsat remote sensing at 30 m spatial resolution. We conducted Monte Carlo analyses of the uncertainty of carbon stock change estimates from errors in tree biomass estimates, remote sensing, and estimates of the carbon fraction of biomass. The carbon stock in aboveground biomass was 850 +/- 230 Tg (mean +/- 95% confidence interval) in 2010. We found a net aboveground live carbon stock change of -69 +/- 15 Tg from 2001 to 2010, a rate of change of -0.8 +/- 0.2%y(-1). Due to slow decay of some dead wood, all of the live carbon stock change does not immediately generate emissions. Wildfires on 6% of the state analysis area produced two-thirds of the live carbon stock loss. This suggests that increased tree densities from a century of fire suppression have allowed the accumulation of fuel for carbon losses in recent wildfires. Remote sensing errors in vegetation classification accounted for most of the uncertainty in the carbon stock change estimates. Improvements are also needed to track spatial patterns of growth and dead wood. Our results establish the beginning of a time series for the state greenhouse gas inventory and provide information on the role of forest conservation and management in California in mitigating global climate change.

Recently products obtained from satellite images have been disseminated, among them, several vegetation indices. EUMETSAT, through the Land -SAF, offers, among other products, the Leaf Area Index (LAI). Daily LAI products have beem acquired in raster format corresponding from 01/01/2010 to 30/12/2010. From a pixel located in the central portion of the Itatiaia National Park, a time series was generated, which was analyzed aiming at assessing the dynamics of leaf area index. The tendency observed in this period indicates that LAI decreased during 2010. It was possible to observe that changes in vegetation have close relationship with changes in rainfall and fires that affect the region. The ARIMA (7 1 0) model was able to describe the behavior of the LAI series, producing white noise and indicating correlations among 1, 6 and 7 days among the past observations. The prediction for future values resulted in an average error of 2.74%, indicating the potential of the model to identify changes in vegetation. Models of ARIMA class, in conjunction with orbital products, stand out as promises for use in the analysis of the vegetation of protected areas.																	0104-7760					JUL-SEP	2015	21	3					511	517		10.1590/01047760201521031823								WOS:000369595700020

Aboveground carbon loss in natural and managed tropical forests from 2000 to 2012	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Tropical forests provide global climate regulation ecosystem services and their clearing is a significant source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and resultant radiative forcing of climate change. However, consensus on pan-tropical forest carbon dynamics is lacking. We present a new estimate that employs recommended good practices to quantify gross tropical forest aboveground carbon (AGC) loss from 2000 to 2012 through the integration of Landsat-derived tree canopy cover, height, intactness and forest cover loss and GLAS-lidar derived forest biomass. An unbiased estimate of forest loss area is produced using a stratified random sample with strata derived from a wall-to-wall 30 m forest cover loss map. Our sample-based results separate the gross loss of forest AGC into losses from natural forests (0.59 PgC yr(-1)) and losses from managed forests (0.43 PgC yr(-1)) including plantations, agroforestry systems and subsistence agriculture. Latin America accounts for 43% of gross AGC loss and 54% of natural forest AGC loss, with Brazil experiencing the highest AGC loss for both categories at national scales. We estimate gross tropical forest AGC loss and natural forest loss to account for 11% and6% of global year 2012 CO2 emissions, respectively. Given recent trends, natural forests will likely constitute an increasingly smaller proportion of tropical forest GHG emissions and of global emissions as fossil fuel consumption increases, with implications for the valuation of co-benefits in tropical forest conservation.

This is mainly applied in areas degraded by uncontrolled human development that favors forest fragmentation and loss of connectivity between different habitats. Making use of remote sensing and geographic information systems, we sought to identify areas to act as biodiversity corridors, allowing gene flow between remnant fragments and areas of permanent preservation. For such purpose, a spatial analysis of the remaining fragments on Sao Gabriel do Oeste, Mato Grosso do Sul, was made, by its form, size and location. The areas for the corridors were identified from the location of fragments with potential, i.e., with proper size and conservation, besides considering the chart of land classes for mechanization and the map of priority areas for conservation from Ministry of Environment [Ministerio do Meio Ambiente], allowing the choice of better areas for biodiversity corridors. It was verified, that geotechnologies are important tools in helping to determine suitable areas for the integrated analysis of the landscape, as in helping on the delimitation of suitable areas for implanting corridors, generating an alternative scenario for environmental recovery, ecological zoning and environmental conservation.																	0100-6762					JUL-AUG	2015	39	4					595	602		10.1590/0100-67622015000400001								WOS:000366100700001						
J	Wang, CS; Sun, GY; Dang, LJ				Wang, Chuansheng; Sun, Guiyan; Dang, Lijuan			Identifying Ecological Red Lines: A Case Study of the Coast in Liaoning Province	SUSTAINABILITY												The global decline in estuarine and coastal ecosystems is affecting critical ecosystem services. The spatial agglomeration of population, industries and resources has led to the emergence of regionally-specific ecological problems. Therefore, identifying ecological red lines, based on specific natural and environmental features, could help to differentiate the economic development and ecological protection directions or potentials of different regions in future. The aim of this case study is to define the ecological red line in the coastal zone of Liaoning Province, China, by evaluating the ecological importance and environmental stress in its marine and terrestrial ecosystems. For this purpose, the ecological importance of this area was first classified into four conservation indices (species, wetland, water and coast and islands) and assigned values of 5, 3 and 1 for indications of high, moderate and minor importance. In the meantime, environmental stress was also classified into four indices (water environment, salinization, soil erosion and erosion of coasts and islands) and assigned values of 5, 3 and 1 for indications of high, moderate and low stress, respectively. Then, based on an overlay analysis and evaluation of the above results, we defined two grades of ecological red line zones. Grade I ecological red line zones contain the areas with critical and diverse ecosystem services, areas of high importance for species conservation and nature reserves, as well as ecologically-vulnerable and sensitive areas. It is important in these areas to maintain the biological diversity and to improve the quality of the ecological environment, which should be strictly protected and explicitly controlled. Grade II ecological red line zones display areas with minimum requirements for maintaining the basic needs of a livable environment and human health, moderate to minor levels of ecological importance and high to moderate levels of environmental stress. To better control and protect such ecological red lines, setting up an ecological inventory through remote sensing satellites and ground-level monitoring and appraising the effectiveness of dynamical protection are highly recommended.																	2071-1050					JUL	2015	7	7					9461	9477		10.3390/su7079461								WOS:000360354500068

In this study, floristic diversity of a remote alpine valley has been studied based on information extracted from remotely sensed satellite data along with field surveys undertaken during 2008-2014. Analysis of vegetation information from satellite data revealed that similar to 75% of the area is covered with natural vegetation which comprises lush green coniferous forests, alpine pastures and alpine scrub lands. With inputs from vegetation information extracted from satellite data, comprehensive field surveys were planned to document the floristic diversity of the region. Analysis of species composition showed a total of 285 plant species, belonging to 191 genera in 60 families. Of these, 250 species are herbs, 14 shrubs, 2 sub-shrubs and 19 trees. The dicotyledons are represented by 240 species, monocotyledons 30, gymnosperms 04, and pteriodophytes 11 species. Asteraceae is the largest family with 35 species. During the present study, 5 species (Corydalis cashmeriana, Hippophae rhamnoides, Primula minutissima, Saussurea sacra and Inula orientalis) have been recorded for the first time from this Himalayan region. The study demonstrates the benefits of geo-informatics in floristic studies, particularly the robustness of remotely sensed data in identifying areas with potentially high species richness, which would be otherwise difficult in a complex mountainous terrain using traditional floristic surveys alone. The present study is expected to provide baseline scientific data for cutting edge studies relating to long term ecological research, bioprospecting, possible impacts of changing climate on vegetation and sustainable use of plant resources in this Himalayan region.

While remote sensing data are adequate to describe these patterns, the often high-dimensional nature of these data poses some analytical challenges, potentially resulting in loss of generality. This may hinder the use of such data for mapping and monitoring beta-diversity patterns. This study presents Sparse Generalised Dissimilarity Modelling (SGDM), a methodological framework designed to improve the use of high-dimensional data to predict community turnover with GDM. SGDM consists of a two-stage approach, by first transforming the environmental data with a sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA), aimed at dealing with high-dimensional data sets, and secondly fitting the transformed data with GDM. The SCCA penalisation parameters are chosen according to a grid search procedure in order to optimise the predictive performance of a GDM fit on the resulting components. The proposed method was illustrated on a case study with a clear environmental gradient of shrub encroachment following cropland abandonment, and subsequent turnover in the bird communities. Bird community data, collected on 115 plots located along the described gradient, were used to fit composition dissimilarity as a function of several remote sensing data sets, including a time series of Landsat data as well as simulated EnMAP hyperspectral data. The proposed approach always outperformed GDM models when fit on high-dimensional data sets. Its usage on low-dimensional data was not consistently advantageous. Models using high-dimensional data, on the other hand, always outperformed those using low-dimensional data, such as single-date multispectral imagery. This approach improved the direct use of high-dimensional remote sensing data, such as time-series or hyperspectral imagery, for community dissimilarity modelling, resulting in better performing models. The good performance of models using high-dimensional data sets further highlights the relevance of dense time series and data coming from new and forthcoming satellite sensors for ecological applications such as mapping species beta diversity.				van der Linden, Sebastian/B-4516-2008; Schwieder, Marcel/B-9071-2016; Geophysical Equipment Facility, NERC/G-5260-2010; Moreira, Francisco/B-2873-2008; Leitao, Pedro/B-7422-2009	van der Linden, Sebastian/0000-0001-6576-8377; Schwieder, Marcel/0000-0003-2103-8828; Moreira, Francisco/0000-0003-4393-8018; Leitao, Pedro/0000-0003-3038-9531; Catry, Ines/0000-0002-5593-5001												2041-210X	2041-2096				JUL	2015	6	7					764	771		10.1111/2041-210X.12378								WOS:000358083200003

The relative value of field survey and remote sensing for biodiversity assessment	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The importance of habitat for biodiversity is well established, but the two most commonly used methods to measure habitat (field survey and remote sensing) have seldom been explicitly compared. We compare high-resolution sample-based field survey (Countryside Survey) with medium-resolution remotely sensed habitat data (the highest resolution of Land Cover Map available) for Great Britain. Variation in abundance of 60 bird species from 335 1km squares was modelled using habitat predictors from the two methods. Model comparisons assessed the explanatory power of (i) field survey vs. remotely sensed data and (ii) coarse information on habitat areas (Broad Habitats) vs. fine-grained information on Landscape Features. Field survey data (combining Broad Habitat and Landscape Feature predictors) explained more variation in bird abundance than remotely sensed data (comprising Broad Habitat predictors only) for 57 species and had significantly higher mean explanatory power, averaged across 60 species models. The relative explanatory power of remote sensing, as a proportion of that provided by field data, was measured at 73%, averaged across 60 species models. Predictions from field survey Broad Habitat data were more accurate than those from either remotely sensed Broad Habitat data or field survey Landscape Feature data, averaged across 60 species models. High-resolution data generate more reliable models of predicted local population responses to land use change than lower resolution remotely sensed data. Collection of field data is typically costly in time, labour and resources, making use of remote sensing more feasible for assessment at larger spatial extents if data of equivalent value are produced, but the cost-benefit threshold between the two is likely to be context specific. However, integration of field survey with remotely sensed data provides accurate predictions of bird distributions, which suggests that both forms of data should be considered for future biodiversity surveys.

ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Species distribution models should identify ecological requirements of species and predict their spatial density. However, data from remote sensing sources are often used alone as predictors in modelling distributions. Such data will only produce accurate models if features that are distinguishable by remote sensing are a good match to the environmental traits that delineate habitat requirements. Both the Goldcrest Regulus regulus and the Firecrest Regulus ignicapilla respond to complex features of habitats that are not described by simple remote sensing data. We tested the usefulness of remote sensing data as a predictor for two Regulus species according to data from 970 study plots sized 1 x 1 km. Predictors were aggregated using the PCAs and related to the Hayne estimator of species density using GAMs. The models based on both remote sensing data and detailed environmental data proved to be better than the model based only on remote sensing data and/or detailed forest structure data. The Goldcrest reached the highest density in areas with a high share of old spruce-dominated forests with a substantial share of the fir, avoiding the pine, and it preferred forests with a low number of tree species. In turn, the Firecrest favoured old forests, dominated by the spruce and the beech, with an admixture of single old fir and larch trees, avoiding the pine, and preferring forests with a high number of tree species. We suggest using not only free data sources, but also more detailed data containing thorough information on forest inventory derived from ground measurements.																	0912-3814	1440-1703				JUL	2015	30	4					625	638		10.1007/s11284-015-1263-5								WOS:000357679000009

Geospatial characterization of deforestation, fragmentation and forest fires in Telangana state, India: conservation perspective	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Conservation of biodiversity has been put to the highest priority throughout the world. The process of identifying threatened ecosystems will search for different drivers related to biodiversity loss. The present study aimed to generate spatial information on deforestation and ecological degradation indicators of fragmentation and forest fires using systematic conceptual approach in Telangana state, India. Identification of ecosystems facing increasing vulnerability can help to safeguard the extinctions of species and useful for conservation planning. The technological advancement of satellite remote sensing and Geographical Information System has increased greatly in assessment and monitoring of ecosystem-level changes. The areas of threat were identified by creating grid cells (5 x 5 km) in Geographical Information System (GIS). Deforestation was assessed using multi-source data of 1930, 1960, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2013. The forest cover of 40,746 km(2), 29,299 km(2), 18,652 km(2), 18,368 km(2), 18,006 km(2), 17,556 km(2) and 17,520 km(2) was estimated during 1930, 1960, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2013, respectively. Historical evaluation of deforestation revealed that major changes had occurred in forests of Telangana and identified 1095 extinct, 397 critically endangered, 523 endangered and 311 vulnerable ecosystem grid cells. The fragmentation analysis has identified 307 ecosystem grid cells under critically endangered status. Forest burnt area information was extracted using AWiFS data of 2005 to 2014. Spatial analysis indicates total fire-affected forest in Telangana as 58.9 % in a decadal period. Conservation status has been recorded depending upon values of threat for each grid, which forms the basis for conservation priority hotspots. Of existing forest, 2.1 % grids had severe ecosystem collapse and had been included under the category of conservation priority hotspot-I, followed by 27.2 % in conservation priority hotspot-II and 51.5 % in conservation priority hotspot-III.

Emerging threats include climate change and its interaction with the spread of pests and diseases. The impact of such threats on the conservation status of trees is poorly understood. Here we highlight the need to conduct a comprehensive conservation assessment of the world's tree species, building on previous assessments undertaken for the IUCN Red List. We suggest that recent developments in plant systematics, online databases, remote sensing data and associated analytical tools offer an unprecedented opportunity to conduct such an assessment. We provide an overview of how a Global Tree Assessment could be achieved in practice, through participative, open-access approaches to data sharing and evaluation.

Population status of the Bornean orang-utan Pongo pygmaeus in a vanishing forest in Indonesia: the former Mega Rice Project	ORYX												As peat-swamp forests in Borneo become progressively more fragmented, the species that inhabit them are increasingly threatened, notably the Endangered Bornean orang-utan Pongo pygmaeus. The area of a failed agricultural project known as the Mega Rice Project in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, is composed of fragments of peat-swamp forest that are reported to contain orang-utans, although no comprehensive survey has previously been conducted. In a portion of this area we identified remaining forest fragments, using satellite imagery, and surveyed line transects for orang-utan sleeping nests to determine the density, abundance and distribution of the species. The total area of peat-swamp forest in the study area is 76,755 ha, 59,948 ha of which comprises patches at least as large as the home range of a female orang-utan (250 ha). We estimate a mean population density of 2.48 +/- SE0.32 individuals km(-2) and a population of 1,700 +/- SE220 or 1,507 +/- SE195 individuals, based on a 25 and 250 ha minimum patch size threshold, respectively. This is c. 40-45% of the original population, and the fragmented population is unlikely to be viable in terms of long-term demographic and genetic stability. To ensure persistence of this population of orang-utans, direct conservation action to connect forest fragments and prevent further loss of peat-swamp forest will be required, including re-establishing the hydrological regime, reforesting barren areas and fighting fires.

Is a three-dimensional (3D) woody vegetation structural classification applied to LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data better than a 2D analysis to investigate change in fine-scale woody vegetation structure over 2yrs in a protected area (PA) and a communal rangeland (CR)? LocationBushbuckridge Municipality and Sabi Sand Wildtuin, NE South Africa. MethodsAirborne LiDAR data were collected over 3300ha in April 2008 and 2010. Individual tree canopies were identified using object-based image analysis and classified into four height classes: 1-3, 3-6, 6-10 and >10m. Four structural metrics were calculated for 0.25-ha grid cells: canopy cover, number of canopy layers present, cohesion and number of height classes present. The relationship between top-of-canopy cover and sub-canopy cover was investigated using regression. Gains, losses and persistence (GLP) of cover at each height class and the four structural metrics were calculated. GLP of clusters of each structural metric (calculated using LISA - Local Indicators of Spatial Association - statistics) were used to assess the changes in clusters of each metric over time. ResultsTop-of-canopy cover was not a good predictor of sub-canopy cover. The number of canopy layers present and cohesion showed gains and losses with persistence in canopy cover over time, necessitating the use of a 3D classification to detect fine-scale changes, especially in structurally heterogeneous savannas. Trees >3m in height showed recruitment and gains up to 2.2 times higher in the CR where they are likely to be protected for cultural reasons, but losses of up to 3.2-fold more in the PA, possibly due to treefall caused by elephant and/or fire. ConclusionLand use has affected sub-canopy structure in the adjacent sites, with the low intensity use CR showing higher structural diversity. A 3D classification approach was successful in detecting fine-scale, short-term changes between land uses, and can thus be used as a monitoring tool for savanna woody vegetation structure.

However, the native biodiversity in these forests is threatened by the presence of invasive species such as Chromolaena odorata (L.) King and Robinson, which thrives in forest canopy gaps. Our study explored the utility of WorldView-2 data, an 8-band high resolution (2 m) imagery for mapping the probability of C. odorata occurrence (presence/absence) in canopy gaps of a subtropical forest patch, the Dukuduku forest, South Africa. An integrated modelling approach involving the WorldView-2 vegetation indices and ancillary environmental data was also assessed. The results showed a higher performance of the environmental data only model (deviance or D (2) = 0.52, p < 0.05, n = 77) when compared to modelling with WorldView-2 vegetation indices such as the enhanced vegetation index, simple ratio indices and red edge normalized difference vegetation index (D (2) = 0.30, p < 0.05, n = 77). The integrated model explained the highest presence/absence variance of C. odorata (D (2) = 0.71, i.e. 71 %). This model was used to derive a probability map indicating the occurrence of invasive species in forest gaps. A 2 x 2 error matrix table and the receiver operating characteristic curve derived from an independent validation dataset (n = 38) were used to assess the model accuracy. Approximately 87 % of canopy gaps containing C. odorata were correctly predicted at probability threshold of 0.3. The derived probability map of C. odorata occurrence could assist management in prioritizing target areas for eradication of the species.

J	Pouteau, R; Meyer, JY; Larrue, S				Pouteau, Robin; Meyer, Jean-Yves; Larrue, Sebastien			Using range filling rather than prevalence of invasive plant species for management prioritisation: the case of Spathodea campanulata in the Society Islands (South Pacific)	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Biological invasion science lacks standardised measures of invasion success that would provide effective prioritisation of invasive species and invaded areas management. Prevalence (area of occupancy) of invasive species is often used as proxy of their success but this metric ignores the extent to which a species fills its potential distribution. This study aims to estimate the performance of invasive tree species by computing the ratio between the compressed canopy area (CCA), assessed through remote sensing, and their potential distribution, estimated using invasive species distribution modelling. This index of 'range filling' (RF) has applicability to a broad set of invasive plant species in any biome. A case study is provided using the invasive African tulip tree Spathodea campanulata (Bignoniaceae) on three small tropical oceanic islands (South Pacific) exhibiting different invasion levels to test for differences between CCA and RF. The results show that the RF of Spathodea campanulata varied within islands depending on elevation but not proportionally to the CCA of the species. Another key result was that the RF of the species and its CCA provided different between-island perspectives on the invasions and lead to distinct ranking among islands to prioritise for management. Therefore, managers should disregard species' prevalence as a measure of success and rather weight it with potential distribution to quantify how an invader is performing in a given environment.

New vegetation type map of India prepared using satellite remote sensing: Comparison with global vegetation maps and utilities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												A seamless vegetation type map of India (scale 1: 50,000) prepared using medium-resolution IRS LISS-III images is presented. The map was created using an on-screen visual interpretation technique and has an accuracy of 90%, as assessed using 15,565 ground control points. India has hitherto been using potential vegetation/forest type map prepared by Champion and Seth in 1968. We characterized and mapped further the vegetation type distribution in the country in terms of occurrence and distribution, area occupancy, percentage of protected area (PA) covered by each vegetation type, range of elevation, mean annual temperature and precipitation over the past 100 years. A remote sensing-amenable hierarchical classification scheme that accommodates natural and semi-natural systems was conceptualized, and the natural vegetation was classified into forests, scrub/shrub lands and grasslands on the basis of extent of vegetation cover. We discuss the distribution and potential utility of the vegetation type map in a broad range of ecological, climatic and conservation applications from global, national and local perspectives. We used 15,565 ground control points to assess the accuracy of products available globally (i.e., GlobCover, Holdridge's life zone map and potential natural vegetation (PNV) maps). Hence we recommend that the map prepared herein be used widely. This vegetation type map is the most comprehensive one developed for India so far. It was prepared using 23.5 m seasonal satellite remote sensing data, field samples and information relating to the biogeography, climate and soil. The digital map is now available through a web portal (http://bis.iirs.govin). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Total Wildlife Reserve of Bontioli (TWRB) in Burkina Faso is one of the country's refuges with high biodiversity. This reserve is seriously threatened by human activities, and little information is available about the on-site causes of degradation extent. This study was carried out to investigate drivers and extent of LDD in the TWRB. Household surveys, focus group discussions and field observations were used to identify socio-economic factors that influence land use and land cover (LULC) changes. The socio-economic data were analyzed using rankings and binary logistic regression techniques. Logistic regression model was used to establish the relationship between socio-economic drivers and land cover change. Remote sensing and GIS techniques were used to analyze land use and LULC changes over 29 years, employing Landsat images of 1984, 2001 and 2013. We performed a supervised classification based on the maximum likelihood algorithm to derive vegetation maps. The results revealed significant (p < 0.05) LULC change from one class of LULC to another. From 1984 to 2001, tree savannas, bare soils and agricultural lands increased by 17.55%, 18.79% and 21778.79%, respectively, while woodland, gallery forest, shrub savannas and water bodies decreased by 22.02%, 5.03%, 40.08% and 31.2%, respectively. From 2001 to 2013, gallery forests decreased by 14.33%, tree savannas by 22.30% and shrub savannas by 5.14%, while agricultural lands increased by 167.87% and woodlands by 3.21%. LDD occurred at a higher rate in areas bordering the reserve compared to the core-protected area and the inaccessible areas. Agricultural expansion and wood cutting activities were the main direct causes of LDD. Extensive land utilization for agriculture is a major threat to the conservation of biodiversity in this reserve. The research highlighted the soundness of GIS and remote sensing practical application to assess vegetation change extent in Burkina Faso. Understanding the signal extent of vegetation change is particularly important to support efforts by policy makers to halt or at least to slow down the deforestation in the country. There is a need to control the immediate causes of LULC dynamics by limiting agricultural land expansion and wood cutting in the study area. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Remote monitoring of defoliation by the beech leaf-mining weevil Rhynchaenus fagi in northern Spain	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forests are among the most widespread and emblematic deciduous forests in Europe, frequently serving as refuge for several endangered species. Populations of the beech leaf-miner weevil Rhynchaenus fagi, a common specific defoliator, usually remain at endemic levels for long periods, but outbreaks occasionally occur under favorable conditions, causing extensive defoliation and forest decline. Monitoring defoliation is highly relevant to integrated beech management, particularly in the beech forests of northern Spain, located in the southernmost range of the Cantabrian Mountains. Monitoring and mapping damage using multispectral satellite remote sensing may be a suitable, cost-effective option in these rugged areas. One hundred eleven defoliation field records from 17 inventory plots over an 8-year period were spectrally related to ten Landsat vegetation indices. A sigmoidal mixed-effects model as a function of vegetation index change for predicting R. fagi defoliation in beech stands was developed based on a recently proposed general Landsat model. The Moisture Stress Index (MSI, Band-5/Band-4) was the best fitted model. The AMSI defoliation model yielded 4.0% RMSE and 3.1% MAE defoliation estimated errors and a significant accuracy of 0.685 R-2 (p < 0.0001) or 0.632 Nagelkerke's R-2. Model was applied to map the spatial temporal pattern of R. fagi defoliation on beech stands, and a trend of defoliation oscillation was observed in the area during the 8 year study. Remote sensing-based model represents a cost-effective tool for health monitoring in large, difficult to access, forested mountain areas, such as those studied. Forest management programs, as those aimed to habitat conservation of southern Cantabrian beech forests, will greatly benefit from remote mapping and the assessment of stand vulnerability to insect damage and other disturbances in current climate warming scenarios.

The pattern of cropland varies among different regions depending on the traditional knowledge of farmers and availability of uncultivated land. Satellite images can be used to map cropland in open areas but have limitations for detecting undergrowth inside forests. Classification results are often biased and need to be supplemented with field observations. Undercover cropland inside forests in the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia was assessed using field observed percentage cover of land use/land cover classes, and topographic and location parameters. The most influential factors were identified using Boosted Regression Trees and used to map undercover cropland area. Elevation, slope, easterly aspect, distance to settlements, and distance to national park were found to be the most influential factors determining undercover cropland area. When there is very high demand for growing food crops, constrained under restricted rights for clearing forest, cultivation could take place within forests as an undercover. Further research on the impact of undercover cropland on ecosystem services and challenges in sustainable management is thus essential.

Estimation of Soil Erosion and Identification of Critical Areas for Soil Conservation Measures using RS and GIS-based Universal Soil Loss Equation	AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												Present study aimed at estimating soil erosion potential and identification of critical areas for soil conservation measures in an ungauged catchment situated in Aravalli hills of Udaipur district, Rajasthan (India). Also, impact of rainfall on soil erosion is evaluated. The soil erosion is estimated for 10 year period (2001-2010) by Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) model using Geographical information system (GIS) and remote sensing techniques for every 12 m x 12 m area. Thematic maps of six USLE model parameters, i.e., rainfall erosivity (R-factor), soil erodibility (K-factor), slope length (L-factor), slope steepness (S-factor), crop and management (C-factor), and support practice (P-factor), were prepared in GIS platform. The R-factor ranged from 1,522.93 to 10,225.88 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1) year(-1) in the years 2006 and 2008, respectively, when the annual rainfall was 984.3 and 572.2 mm, and number of rainy days were 58 and 47, respectively. The K-factor was highest for fine loam soil covering 56 % area, while the lowest value was for coarse loamy sand in 22 % area. The lowest value of the L-factor (0.736) was in accordance with the high slopes nearby catchment boundary; whereas the highest value (0.832) was for almost zero slopes in 34 % area nearby waterbodies. Opposite to the L-factor, the S-factor values were high (>4) for the higher slopes nearby catchment boundary and the lowest values for the zero slopes. The C-factor value in 170.36 km(2) or 48.91 % of the area is 0.1 while the value is zero for waterbodies and builtup lands. The P-factor value in 250.36 km(2) or 71.87 % of the area is 0.8. The mean annual soil erosion in the major portion of the catchment (231.13 km(2) or 66.38 %) exceeds 10 t ha(-1) year(-1) indicating high to very severe soil erosion conditions prevailing in the catchment. It is apparent that vast quantities of the soil are getting eroded from the catchment, and the annual rainfall amount and rainfall intensity have the profound effect on the soil erosion potential. This study emphasizes that USLE model coupled with GIS and remote sensing techniques are promising and cost-effective tools for mapping critical areas of soil erosion in ungauged catchments especially in developing countries.																	2249-720X	2249-7218				JUN	2015	4	2					183	195		10.1007/s40003-015-0157-7								WOS:000366135700009

Holidays in lights: Tracking cultural patterns in demand for energy services	EARTHS FUTURE												Successful climate change mitigation will involve not only technological innovation, but also innovation in how we understand the societal and individual behaviors that shape the demand for energy services. Traditionally, individual energy behaviors have been described as a function of utility optimization and behavioral economics, with price restructuring as the dominant policy lever. Previous research at the macro-level has identified economic activity, power generation and technology, and economic role as significant factors that shape energy use. However, most demand models lack basic contextual information on how dominant social phenomenon, the changing demographics of cities, and the sociocultural setting within which people operate, affect energy decisions and use patterns. Here we use high-quality Suomi-NPP VIIRS nighttime environmental products to: (1) observe aggregate human behavior through variations in energy service demand patterns during the Christmas and New Year's season and the Holy Month of Ramadan and (2) demonstrate that patterns in energy behaviors closely track sociocultural boundaries at the country, city, and district level. These findings indicate that energy decision making and demand is a sociocultural process as well as an economic process, often involving a combination of individual price-based incentives and societal-level factors. While nighttime satellite imagery has been used to map regional energy infrastructure distribution, tracking daily dynamic lighting demand at three major scales of urbanization is novel. This methodology can enrich research on the relative importance of drivers of energy demand and conservation behaviors at fine scales.

Because conventional research methods were not practical for this purpose due to the lack of a geospatial perspective, we attempted to develop a research method integrating visual fish observation with a seabed habitat map and to expand knowledge to a two-dimensional scale. WorldView-2 satellite imagery of Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia obtained in September 2012 was analyzed and classified into four typical substrates: live coral, dead coral, seagrass and sand. Overall classification accuracy of this map was 81.3% and considered precise enough for subsequent analyses. Three sub-areas (CC: continuous coral reef, BC: boundary of coral reef and FC: few live coral zone) around reef slopes were extracted from the map. Visual transect surveys for several fish species were conducted within each sub-area in June 2013. As a result, Mean density (Ind. / 300 m(2)) of Chaetodon octofasciatus, known as an obligate feeder of corals, was significantly higher at BC than at the others (p < 0.05), implying that this species' density is strongly influenced by spatial configuration of its habitat, like the "edge effect." This indicates that future conservation procedures for coral reef fishes should consider not only coral cover but also its spatial configuration. The present study also indicates that the introduction of a geospatial perspective derived from remote sensing has great potential to progress conventional ecological studies on coral reef fishes.																	1738-5261	2005-7172				JUN	2015	50	2					343	352		10.1007/s12601-015-0032-2								WOS:000357691000023

Measuring or monitoring habitat quality requires complex integration of many properties of the ecosystem, where traditional terrestrial data collection methods have proven extremely time-demanding. Remote sensing has known potential to map various ecosystem properties, also allowing rigorous checking of accuracy and supporting standardized processing. Our Special Issue presents examples where remote sensing has been successfully used for habitat mapping, quantification of habitat quality parameters, or multi-parameter modelling of habitat quality itself. New frontiers such as bathymetric scanning, grassland vegetation classification and operational use were explored, various new ecological verification methods were introduced and integration with ongoing habitat conservation schemes was demonstrated. These studies show that remote sensing and Geoinformation Science for habitat quality analysis have evolved from isolated experimental studies to an active field of research with a dedicated community. It is expected that these new methods will substantially contribute to biodiversity conservation worldwide.

To ensure effective monitoring and management of such landscapes, it is necessary to integrate landscape composition and the associated socio-economic processes in the conservation schemes. Artificial Night-Time Light (ANTL) pollution is a recent but striking environmental alteration due to human interventions. It is a major threat for species and communities which co-evolved with invariant natural light patterns over geological times. In spite of its potential key role in re-shaping natural systems, ANTL is seldom considered in macroecology. Remote sensing provides a unique set of tools to integrate ANTL in macroecological studies. In this work, we used remote sensing data of night-time lights along with Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) to study the effects and extent of ANTL in the night-time landscape (nightscape) of two protected areas in Italy. Our results showed that a considerable number of semi-natural vegetated patches suffer from ANTL pollution with varying magnitude. We observed a decline in highly suitable patches for biodiversity while the remaining patches were found concentrated in the innermost part of the parks. By simulating an exponential decrease in ANTL we showed that a moderate reduction in ANTL pollution would result in regaining a substantial amount of highly suitable patches for biodiversity. The decline in homogeneous dark patches in vegetated landscapes has negative impacts on biodiversity as well as on the ecosystem services it provides. Therefore, it is high time that the scientific community and the policy-makers increase their efforts to monitor and mitigate the ecological impacts of ANTL on ecosystems. The integration of light pollution in landscape ecology could combine remote sensing with other aspects of light pollution like indirect propagation and spectral composition. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Prioritization of catchments based on soil erosion using remote sensing and GIS	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Water and soil are the most essential natural resources for socioeconomic development and sustenance of life. A study of soil and water dynamics at a watershed level facilitates a scientific approach towards their conservation and management. Remote sensing and Geographic Information System are tools that help to plan and manage natural resources on watershed basis. Studies were conducted for the formulation of catchment area treatment plan based on watershed prioritization with soil erosion studies using remote sensing techniques, corroborated with Geographic Information System (GIS), secondary data and ground truth information. Estimation of runoff and sediment yield is necessary in prioritization of catchment for the design of soil conservation structures and for identifying the critical erosion-prone areas of a catchment for implementation of best management plan with limited resources. The Universal Soil Loss Equation, Sediment Yield Determination and silt yield index methods are used for runoff and soil loss estimation for prioritization of the catchments. On the basis of soil erosion classes, the watersheds were grouped into very high, high, moderate and low priorities. High-priority watersheds need immediate attention for soil and water conservation, whereas low-priority watershed having good vegetative cover and low silt yield index may not need immediate attention for such treatments.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JUN	2015	187	6							333	10.1007/s10661-015-4545-z								WOS:000355917300020	25952681

Considering the time consumption for conventional geographical surveys for identification of potential sites, a methodology is being developed using the remote sensing and GIS techniques to find the suitable locations for different insitu soil and water conservation interventions. Different thematic layers of slope, soil, rainfall and land use land cover was intersected in ARCGIS and the selected criteria for each intervention was applied for identifying the suitable locations. This methodology was applied for identifying the suitable locations of different insitu soil and water conservation interventions such as contour bunds, semi-circular bunds, small pits, contour bench terraces, contour ridges and stone bunds in Adilabad District of Telangana state. Among the different interventions selected, stone bunds, contour bunds and small pits are more suitable for major portion of the Adilabad District. This methodology deciphers more precise, easier and less time consuming planning technique which has the ability to process districts or even large catchments.

Considerations on capacity building for national forest - assessments in developing countries - with a case study of India	INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW												Large-area forest assessments are attracting increasing attention owing to their role in providing information related to carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation and enhancement of rural livelihoods. The information needs actually hold good for all geographic levels from the local to the global. Forest assessments on national level are of particular interest because countries that wish to engage in the REDD+initiative and to benefit from results-based payments, need to give quantitative evidence of their progresses in enhancing their forest resources. This contribution analyzes the capacity building needs for national forest assessments with a focus on the situation in developing countries, identifies key areas in which national capacity may be developed and makes suggestions for implementation. India's forest assessment systems are used as an example. The National Forest Inventory (NFI) system needs to be institutionalized to ensure a practical way for proficient monitoring and analysis of forest ecosystems. The institutions established to carry out NFI require continued institutional and financial support with qualified and committed scholars and professionals from relevant disciplines, including forest mensuration, forest inventory and remote sensing.

Using lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles to monitor tropical forest recovery	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Large areas of tropical lands are being removed from agriculture and restored to address conservation goals. However, monitoring the ecological value of these efforts at the individual land-owner scale is rare, owing largely to issues of cost and accessibility. Traditional field-based measures for assessing forest recovery and habitat quality can be labour intensive and costly. Here we assess whether remote sensing measurements from lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are a cost-effective substitute for traditional field measures. An inexpensive UAV-based remote sensing methodology, "Ecosynth", was applied to measure forest canopy structure across field plots in a 7-9-yr tropical forest restoration study in southern Costa Rica. Ecosynth methods combine aerial images from consumer-grade digital cameras with computer vision software to generate 3D 'point cloud' models of vegetation at high spatial resolutions. Ecosynth canopy structure measurements were compared to field-based measures and their ability to predict the abundance of frugivorous birds; key seed dispersers that are sensitive to canopy structure. Ecosynth canopy height measurements were highly correlated with field-based measurements (R-2 >= 0.85), a result comparable in precision to LiDAR-based remote sensing measurements. Ecosynth parameters were also strongly correlated with above-ground biomass (R-2 >= 0.81) and percent canopy openness (R-2 = 0.82). Correlations were weaker with proportion-based measures such as canopy roughness (R-2 = 0.53). Several Ecosynth metrics (e.g., canopy openness and height) predicted frugivore presence and abundance at levels of accuracy similar to those of field-based measurements. Ecosynth UAV remote-sensing provides an effective alternate methodology to traditional field-based measures of evaluating forest structure and complexity across landscapes. Furthermore, given the volume of data that can be generated in a single flight plan, as well as the ability to use the technology in remote areas, these methods could expand the scope of studies on forest dynamics and recovery when combined with field-based calibration plots.

One of the crucial steps in evaluating the impact of invasive species is to map changes in their actual and potential distribution and relative abundance across a wide region over an appropriate time span. While direct and indirect remote sensing approaches have long been used to assess the invasion of plant species, the distribution of invasive animals is mainly based on indirect methods that rely on environmental proxies of conditions suitable for colonization by a particular species. The aim of this article is to review recent efforts in the predictive modelling of the spread of both plant and animal invasive species using remote sensing, and to stimulate debate on the potential use of remote sensing in biological invasion monitoring and forecasting. Specifically, the challenges and drawbacks of remote sensing techniques are discussed in relation to: i) developing species distribution models, and ii) studying life cycle changes and phenological variations. Finally, the paper addresses the open challenges and pitfalls of remote sensing for biological invasion studies including sensor characteristics, upscaling and downscaling in species distribution models, and uncertainty of results.

J	Gillespie, TW; Willis, KS; Ostermann-Kelm, S				Gillespie, Thomas W.; Willis, Katherine S.; Ostermann-Kelm, Stacey			Spaceborne remote sensing of the world's protected areas	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												There has been a rapid evolution of satellites, sensors, and techniques to measure, monitor, and manage terrestrial protected areas. There are over 100,000 protected areas around the world and most lack important information on the status and trends of natural resource issues. We review advances and limitations in spaceborne remote sensing that can be applied to all terrestrial protected areas around the world. There have been significant advances in baseline vegetation mapping and land cover classifications by combining field data, data from multiple sensors, and classification techniques. However, global classifications on the extent of non-forest vegetation types (e.g. grasslands and shrublands) are still needed at 30 m pixel resolution. High spatial (< 1 m) and spectral (220 bands) resolution sensors have provided important data on environmental issues (e.g. invasive species, degradation) that are region or site specific. Advances in monitoring protected areas have primarily focused on forest ecosystems and land cover dynamics in and around protected areas using time series data. Landsat imagery can be used to monitor vegetation extent and dynamics at 30 m pixel resolution across the globe, while the MODIS sensors are more appropriate for monthly updates on trends of ecosystem health in protected areas. There has also been an increase in time series remote sensing datasets on anthropogenic impacts, such as light pollution, fire, and land surface temperature, that can be used for all protected areas. Future geographic research should focus on developing global protocols and incorporating near real time and annual metrics that can easily be used by natural resource managers to assess the status and trends of all protected areas.																	0309-1333	1477-0296				JUN	2015	39	3					388	404		10.1177/0309133314561648								WOS:000355265300005

Due to the socio-economic value of the often limited high-potential agricultural land in the country, a reliable determination of encroachment and transformation is necessary for effective monitoring and management of such agro-ecological resources. Using the robust support vector machine classification algorithm, this study adopted multi-temporal, remotely sensed datasets to assess the extent to which the physical development footprint in the uMngeni Local Municipality affected the existing agro-ecological zones from 1993 to 2003 and from 2003 to 2013. The results show a steady increase in built-up areas during the period under investigation.

This is caused mainly by the altitude division and polymorphism of the landscape, climate and soil structure. This study assesses the impacts of tourism on the land cover in the Jeseniky Mountain region by comparing multi-temporal Landsat imageries (1991, 2001 and 2013) to describe the rate and extent of land-cover changes. This was achieved through spectral classification of different land cover classes and by assessing the change in forest; settlements; pasture and agriculture in relation to increasing distances (5, 10 and 15 km) from three tourism sites with the help of ArcGIS software. The results indicate that the area was deforested (11.13%) from 1991 to 2001 than experienced forest regrowth (6.71%) from 2001 to 2013. In the first decade pasture and agriculture areas increased and then in next decade decreased. The influence of tourism facilities on land cover is also variable. Around each of the tourism site sampled, there was a general trend of forest removal decreasing as the distance from each village increased, which indicates tourism does have a negative impact on forests. However there was an opposite trend from 2001 to 2013 that indicates conservation area. The interplay among global (tourism, climate), regional (national policies, large-river management) and local (construction and agriculture, energy and water sources to support the tourism industry) factors drives a distinctive but complex pattern of land-use and land-cover disturbance.

Nowadays, due to industrial, agricultural and anthropogenic activities signs of water pollution in the region have been found. The level of surface water pollution can be determined by traditional methods through observatory stations. However, a traditional approach to determine water contamination is discontinuous, and thereby makes pollution assessment of the entire estuary very difficult. Nowadays, remote sensing technology has been developed and widely applied in many fields, for instance, in monitoring water environments. Remote sensing data combined with information from in-situ observations allow for extraction of polluted components in water and accurate measurements of pollution level in the large regions ensuring objectivity. According to results obtained from Spot-5 imagery of Quang Ninh and Hai Phong, the extracted pollution components, like BOD, COD and TSS can be determined with the root mean square error, the absolute mean error and the absolute mean percentage error (%):+/- 4.37 (mg/l) 3.86 (mg/l), 27%; +/- 55.32 (mg/l), 48.30 (mg/l), 14%; and +/- 32.90 (mg/l), 23.38 (mg/l), 28%; respectively. Obtained outcomes guarantee objectivity in assessing water contaminant levels in the investigated regions and show the advantages of remote sensing applications in Resource and Environmental Monitoring in relation to Water - Air - Land.																	2080-6736	2300-2581				JUN	2015	64	1					29	42		10.1515/geocart-2015-0004								WOS:000217236100003

SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS												Identification and protection of areas that are vulnerable to erosion is essential for the conservation of the sensitive wetlands and estuarine ecosystems along the Xolobeni coastal strip. The forecasting of these erosion susceptible areas requires an understanding of the interrelationships of the critical factors that have influenced erosion potential over time. Vegetation and bare areas are some of the contributing factors that have influenced erosion at Xolobeni. This study used remote sensing as a tool to provide some information on the inter-relationship between vegetated classes and bare areas. Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data derived from multi-temporal Landsat 5 imagery has formed the baseline information for this study. A density slicing approach was adopted to classify the region into four vegetation structure classes of predominant land cover types. Post classification change detection data has provided an understanding of the relative susceptibility of the different vegetated classes to being degraded to bare areas. The results suggest that poorly vegetated regions were most susceptible to further degradation and an elevated susceptibility to erosion. On the other hand, moderately and densely vegetated regions were less susceptible to land degradation. The information can be used to identify measures to mitigate the effects of land degradation in vulnerable areas.

The main objective of this study is to provide an environmental (coastal vegetation and coral reef condition) and socioeconomic (human population condition) baseline data of a poorly documented and weakly managed zone by the use of a set of rapid assessment methodologies, looking to assist the regional efforts to manage these coastal resources. To achieve this goal we used a series of surveying methods including remote sensing, geographic information systems and in situ land/underwater surveys, to allow a broad characterization of the resources' condition in the study zone. Results showed that reef habitat was dominated by macro-algae (61.2 +/- 7.6%), followed by soft coral (gorgonians, 12.4 +/- 4.1%), hard coral (8.2 +/- 5.1%) and sponges (2.5 +/- 1.3%). Zooanthids and tunicates represented less than 1% of the total; coral and macro algae estimates suggest a decline from records of 15 years ago. Highest fish densities were (144 +/- 124 individuals/100 m(2)), while lowest were (83 +/- 25 individuals/100 m(2)). The total average fish density recorded could also be reflecting a decrease trend in the reef community structure. The main economic activities in the area are fishing and land clearing. From December 2003, 22% (corresponding to 44 ha) of the total original vegetation cover in the studied area was deforested. By February 2007, the deforested area increased 4.4 ha more. Should this tendency continue, by 2025 it would only maintain 24% of its total coastal vegetation cover representing a huge habitat loss. The future of economic activities in these areas lie directly on the establishment of appropriate management strategies for the protection and conservation of the renowned biodiversity that this area comprises.

In this respect, two concepts that are strictly related to most of the aspects above are: "precision agriculture" and "precision conservation" and more specifically "precision turfgrass management." Optical sensing has become a crucial part of precision turfgrass management and spectral reflectance in particular has been an active area of research for many years. However, while turfgrass status evaluation by proximity-sensed spectral reflectance appears to be an established and reliable practice, much more could be achieved in terms of monitoring of large turfgrass areas through remote sensing, and in particular through satellite imagery. This paper reports the results of a trial attempting to evaluate the spectral signatures of several turfgrass species and cultivars, for future use in turfgrass satellite monitoring. Our experimental study focused on 20 turfgrass species/varieties including perennial ryegrasses, tall fescues, kentucky bluegrasses, bermudagrass ecotypes, seeded commercial bermudagrasses, vegetatively propagated bermudagrasses, Zoysia japonica and non-japonica zoysiagrasses. Various biological and agronomical parameters were studied and turfgrass spectral reflectance for all entries was gathered. Vegetation indices were calculated by simulating the available wavelengths deriving from World View 2 satellite imagery. Results showed that within the same species selected vegetation indices are often able to discriminate between different varieties that have been established and maintained with identical agronomical practices.

The utilization of timber and non-timber resources by poor rural communities living around protected forest patches produce subtle changes in the forest canopy which can be hardly detected on a timely manner using traditional field surveys. The aims of this study were to assess: (i) the utility of very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery (World View-2, 0.5-2 m spatial resolution) for mapping tree species and canopy gaps in one of the protected subtropical coastal forests in South Africa (the Dukuduku forest patch (ca.3200 ha) located in the province of KwaZulu-Natal) and (ii) the implications of the map products to forest conservation. Three dominant canopy tree species namely, Albizia adianthifolia, Strychnos spp. and Acacia spp., and canopy gap types including bushes (grass/shrubby), bare soil and burnt patches were accurately mapped (overall accuracy = 89.3 +/- 2.1%) using WorldView-2 image and support vector machine classifier. The maps revealed subtle forest disturbances such as bush encroachment and edge effects resulting from forest fragmentation by roads and a power-line. In two stakeholders' workshops organised to assess the implications of the map products to conservation, participants generally agreed amongst others implications that the VHR maps provide valuable information that could be used for implementing and monitoring the effects of rehabilitation measures. The use of VHR imagery is recommended for timely inventorying and monitoring of the small and fragile patches of subtropical forests in Southern Africa. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Polarized reflectance and transmittance properties of windblown sea surfaces	APPLIED OPTICS												Generation of random sea surfaces using wave variance spectra and Fourier transforms is formulated in a way that guarantees conservation of wave energy and fully resolves wave height and slope variances. Monte Carlo polarized ray tracing, which accounts for multiple scattering between light rays and wave facets, is used to compute effective Mueller matrices for reflection and transmission of air- or water-incident polarized radiance. Irradiance reflectances computed using a Rayleigh sky radiance distribution, sea surfaces generated with Cox-Munk statistics, and unpolarized ray tracing differ by 10%-18% compared with values computed using elevation- and slope-resolving surfaces and polarized ray tracing. Radiance reflectance factors, as used to estimate water-leaving radiance from measured upwelling and sky radiances, are shown to depend on sky polarization, and improved values are given.

Using DNA tools and repeat genotyping, we estimated the population sizes from 654 dung samples collected from various areas. Combined with morphological individual identifications from over 6,300 elephant photographs taken in the wild, we estimated that the total Asian elephant population size in China is between 221 and 245. Population genetic structure and diversity were examined using a 556-bp fragment of mitochondrial DNA, and 24 unique haplotypes were detected from DNA analysis of 178 individuals. A phylogenetic analysis revealed two highly divergent clades of Asian elephants, alpha and beta, present in Chinese populations. Four populations (Mengla, Shangyong, Mengyang, and Pu'Er) carried mtDNA from the a clade, and only one population (Nangunhe) carried mtDNA belonging to the a clade. Moreover, high genetic divergence was observed between the Nangunhe population and the other four populations; however, genetic diversity among the five populations was low, possibly due to limited gene flow because of habitat fragmentation. The expansion of rubber plantations, crop cultivation, and villages along rivers and roads had caused extensive degradation of natural forest in these areas. This had resulted in the loss and fragmentation of elephant habitats and had formed artificial barriers that inhibited elephant migration. Using Geographic Information System, Global Positioning System, and Remote Sensing technology, we found that the area occupied by rubber plantations, tea farms, and urban settlements had dramatically increased over the past 40 years, resulting in the loss and fragmentation of elephant habitats and forming artificial barriers that inhibit elephant migration. The restoration of ecological corridors to facilitate gene exchange among isolated elephant populations and the establishment of cross-boundary protected areas between China and Laos to secure their natural habitats are critical for the survival of Asian elephants in this region.																	1932-6203					MAY 19	2015	10	5							e0124834	10.1371/journal.pone.0124834								WOS:000354918600011	25992617

Deforestation of montane cloud forest in the Central Highlands of Guatemala: contributing factors and implications for sustainability in Q'eqchi' communities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY												Cloud forest in the Central Highlands of Guatemala provides important ecosystem services for the Q'eqchi' Maya but has been disappearing at an increasing rate in recent decades. This research documents changes in cloud forest cover, explores some contributing factors to deforestation, and considers forest preservation and food security implications for Q'eqchi' communities. We used a transdisciplinary framework that synthesized remote sensing/GIS analysis of land cover change, focus group dialogs, and surveys. Expansion of subsistence agriculture is a key proximate cause of cloud forest removal, followed by extraction of fuelwood and larger-scale logging operations. Predisposing environmental factors such as rugged topography, steep slopes, and poor soils contribute to low agricultural productivity that contributes to increased conversion of forest to agricultural land. The key underlying driving forces for deforestation locally are population growth and subdivision of land. Population growth is increasing the demand for agricultural land and, as a result, the Q'eqchi' clear the forest to meet the need for increased food production. Furthermore, population growth is driving subdivision of land, decreasing fallow periods, and putting additional strain on poor soils, all of which exacerbate land degradation. Given the increase in population in the region, food production must be improved on existing agricultural land to avoid the need to put more land into production to meet food requirements. Thus, efforts to sustainably increase agricultural productivity are fundamental to efforts to conserve the cloud forest and to safeguard essential ecosystem services.

Bundled Adoption of Precision Agriculture Technologies by Cotton Producers	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS												This research analyzes the adoption patterns among cotton farmers for remote sensing, yield monitors, soil testing, soil electrical conductivity, and other precision agriculture technologies using a Multiple Indicator Multiple Causation regression model. Adoption patterns are analyzed using principle component analysis to determine natural technology groupings. Identified bundles are regressed on farm structure and operator characteristics. The propensity to adopt technology bundles was greater for producers managing relatively larger operations who used a variety of information sources to learn about precision farming, irrigated cotton, practiced crop rotation, and participated in working land conservation programs.																	1068-5502					MAY	2015	40	2					325	345										WOS:000368756100008

Together with standardized ground plots and regular in situ measurements, remote sensing contributes to better understand the diversity of these habitats and their phenology. We used field spectroradiometry to simulate the radiometric signal corresponding to six multispectral satellites: 1) IKONOS, 2) Landsat 5 TM, 3) Landsat 8, 4) Pleiades, 5) Sentinel-2, and 6) WorldView-2. We compared the suitability of each sensor for the estimation of the cover fraction of photosynthetic vegetation (PV) observed for five types of habitats during a vegetation cycle from February to October 2013. We also analyzed the contribution of multiseasonal satellite acquisitions for habitat discrimination. We showed that multivariate regression applied to Worldview-2 reflectance produces the most accurate PV. This was explained by the higher number of spectral bands in the visible domain. Habitat discrimination based on monotemporal acquisitions showed better performances when PV was higher. Sentinel-2 and WorldView-2 outperformed other sensors for each individual date. Multitemporal acquisitions outperformed monotemporal acquisition for habitat discrimination. However, selecting all reflectance data acquired during the season resulted in suboptimal performances compared to more parsimonious combinations. Finally, all of them ranged between 86.6% and 89.2% classification accuracy with multiseasonal acquisitions. New strategies need to be designed to identify individual habitats of particular interest. Defining optimal multiseasonal remote-sensing acquisitions specific to each habitat and appropriate spectral and spatial resolution will contribute to improved discrimination of Mediterranean natural habitats.

J	Amler, E; Schmidt, M; Menz, G				Amler, Esther; Schmidt, Michael; Menz, Gunter			Definitions and Mapping of East African Wetlands: A Review	REMOTE SENSING												Wetlands provide invaluable ecosystem services and contribute significantly to food security around the world. To maintain these functions, wetlands need to be protected from rapid transformation and overuse. Spatially-explicit information is required for sustainable wetland management. Development of wetland maps based on remote sensing requires a clear-cut definition of wetlands. This review was undertaken to improve the understanding of these habitats from a remote sensing perspective and to determine available wetland map layers for the East African countries of Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. This study includes three components: (1) a review of the availability and types of wetland definitions from the scientific literature record (including 245 separate references); (2) a systematic analysis of land use/land cover classifications and the conceptual approaches and spatial coverages of wetland classes for each system; and (3) a depiction of wetland layers and a discussion of their suitability for use in regional inventories. Our literature review shows that a standard definition of wetlands is not in use, and a specific definition of wetlands is not given in more than 40% of the reviewed remote sensing publications. Spatial information on East African wetlands is currently insufficient for use in regional wetland management.																	2072-4292					MAY	2015	7	5					5256	5282		10.3390/rs70505256								WOS:000357596200014

First, a spectral database of various land-cover and land-use information was compiled using multi-year field campaign data and photointerpretation of satellite images. Next, residential areas were extracted from IKONOS-2 and GeoEye-1 images using object oriented feature extraction (OBIA). Then, Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data were used to generate land-cover and land-use maps from 1990 to 2011, and LCLUC maps were developed with decadal intervals and converted to 100 m vector grid cells. Finally, the causal associations between LCLUC were quantified using ordinary least square regression analysis and Moran's I, and a forest disturbance index derived from the time series Landsat data were used to further confirm LCLUC drivers. The results showed that (1) local spatial statistical approaches were most effective at quantifying the drivers of LCLUC, and (2) the combined threats of habitat degradation in and around the reserve and increasing encroachment of invasive plant species lead to the expansion of shrubland and mixed forest within the former primary forest, which was echoed by the forest disturbance index derived from the Landsat data.																	2072-4292					MAY	2015	7	5					6257	6279		10.3390/rs70506257								WOS:000357596900022						
J	Li, RY; Liu, XN; Li, XQ				Li, Runya; Liu, Xiangnan; Li, Xuqing			Estimation of the PM2.5 Pollution Levels in Beijing Based on Nighttime Light Data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescan System	ATMOSPHERE												Nighttime light data record the artificial light on the Earth's surface and can be used to estimate the degree of pollution associated with particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) in the ground-level atmosphere. This study proposes a simple method for monitoring PM2.5 concentrations at night by using nighttime light imagery from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS). This research synthesizes remote sensing and geographic information system techniques and establishes a back propagation neural-network (BP network) model. The BP network model for nighttime light data performed well in estimating the PM2.5 pollution in Beijing. The correlation coefficient between the BP network model predictions and the corrected PM2.5 concentration was 0.975; the root mean square error was 26.26 mu g/m(3), with a corresponding average PM2.5 concentration of 155.07 mu g/m(3); and the average accuracy was 0.796. The accuracy of the results primarily depended on the method of selecting regions in the DMSP nighttime light data. This study provides an opportunity to measure the nighttime environment. Furthermore, these results can assist government agencies in determining particulate matter pollution control areas and developing and implementing environmental conservation planning.																	2073-4433					MAY	2015	6	5					607	622		10.3390/atmos6050607								WOS:000356242100003

Mapping aboveground woody biomass using forest inventory, remote sensing and geostatistical techniques	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Mapping forest biomass is fundamental for estimating CO2 emissions, and planning and monitoring of forests and ecosystem productivity. The present study attempted tomap aboveground woody biomass (AGWB) integrating forest inventory, remote sensing and geostatistical techniques, viz., direct radiometric relationships (DRR), k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) and cokriging (CoK) and to evaluate their accuracy. A part of the Timli Forest Range of Kalsi Soil and Water Conservation Division, Uttarakhand, India was selected for the present study. Stratified random sampling was used to collect biophysical data from 36 sample plots of 0.1 ha (31.62 mx31.62 m) size. Species-specific volumetric equations were used for calculating volume and multiplied by specific gravity to get biomass. Three forest-type density classes, viz. 10-40, 40-70 and >70 % of Shorea robusta forest and four non-forest classes were delineated using on-screen visual interpretation of IRS P6 LISS-III data of December 2012. The volume in different strata of forest-type density ranged from 189.84 to 484.36 m(3) ha(-1). The total growing stock of the forest was found to be 2,024,652.88 m(3). The AGWB ranged from 143 to 421 Mgha(-1). Spectral bands and vegetation indices were used as independent variables and biomass as dependent variable for DRR, k-NN and CoK. After validation and comparison, k-NN method of Mahalanobis distance (root mean square error (RMSE)=42.25 Mgha(-)1) was found to be the best-method followed by fuzzy distance and Euclidean distance with RMSE of 44.23 and 45.13 Mgha(-1) respectively. DRR was found to be the least accurate method with RMSE of 67.17 Mgha(-1). The study highlighted the potential of integrating of forest inventory, remote sensing and geostatistical techniques for forest biomass mapping.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY	2015	187	5							308	10.1007/s10661-015-4551-1								WOS:000355607100052	25930205

As a result Kazakhstan became an important breadbasket of the former Soviet Union. However, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 triggered widespread agricultural abandonment, and much cropland reverted to grasslands. Our goal in this study was to reconstruct and analyze agricultural land-cover change since the eve of the Virgin Lands Campaign, from 1953 to 2010 in Kostanay Province, a region that is representative of Northern Kazakhstan. Further, we assessed the potential of currently idle cropland for re-cultivation. Wereconstructed the cropland extent before and after the Virgin Lands Campaign using archival maps, and we mapped the agricultural land cover in the late Soviet and post-Soviet period using multi-seasonal Landsat TM/ETM+ images from circa 1990, 2000 and 2010. Cropland extent peaked at approximately 3.1 Mha in our study area in 1990, 38% of which had been converted from grasslands from 1954 to 1961. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, 45% of the Soviet croplandwas abandoned and had reverted to grassland by 2000. After 2000, cropland contraction and re-cultivation were balanced. Using spatial logistic regressions we found that cropland expansion during the Virgin Lands Campaign was significantly associated with favorable agro-environmental conditions. In contrast, cropland expansion after the Campaign until 1990, as well as cropland contraction after 1990, occurred mainly in areas that were less favorable for agriculture. Cropland re-cultivation after 2000 was occurring on lands with relatively favorable agro-environmental conditions in comparison to remaining idle croplands, albeit with much lower agro-environmental endowment compared to stable croplands from1990 to 2010. In sum, we found that cropland production potentials of the currently uncultivated areas are much lower than commonly believed, and further cropland expansion is only possible at the expense of marginal lands. Our results suggest if increasing production is a goal, improving crop yields in currently cultivated lands should be a focus, whereas extensive livestock grazing as well as the conservation of non-provisioning ecosystem services and biodiversity should be priority on more marginal lands.

The correlation analysis on the landscape pattern index and hydrological processes in the Yanhe watershed, China	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Yanhe watershed, as a typical and experimental district of Soil and Water Conservation District, has long been plagued by soil erosion due to severe human disturbances. Exploring the relationship between watershed landscape pattern and hydrological processes can find effective ways to solve soil erosion problems. At first, with remote sensing and GIS (Geographic Information System) technology and based on SWAT model, this paper analyzed and simulated ecological hydrological processes in Yanhe watershed. It is on subbasin scale that the runoff and sediment yields were simulated monthly in Yanhe watershed using SWAT model. Secondly, it quantified landscape pattern with landscape indices. The seven landscape indices at the landscape level were selected with principal component factor analysis, including Disjunct Core Area Density (DCAD), Radius of gyration (GYRATE_SD), Patch Cohesion Index (COHESION), Shannon's diversity index (SHEI), Total Core Area (TCA), Perimeter-Area Fractal dimension index (PAFRAC), Interspersion and juxtaposition Index (IJI), etc. Thirdly, a new composite landscape index was constructed on the basis of eco-hydrological processes, which was closely related to soil erosion. The results are as follows: (1) Coupled analysis on the relationship of landscape indices and annual runoff as well as annual sediment yields in each subbasin, the correlation coefficient of seven selected landscape indices and runoff is very small, no passing all significant tests. But the correlation between sediment yields and the indices except for TCA and III is significant, and the absolute value of the correlation coefficient is between 0.3 and 0.5. (2) According to the "source-sink" theory of soil erosion, Slope-HRUs landscape index (SHLI) was built and can reflect the relationship between landscape pattern and soil erosion processes to a certain extent. The coupling relationship between Slope-HRUs landscape index (SHLI) and annual sediment yields in each subbasin is very clear, and correlation coefficient is -0.6, which is significantly negatively correlated.

The objective of this work is to study modifications in the physical properties of soils in the Rio Verde watershed, as a function of the land use time for agriculture, determined from classification of Landsat satellite images between 1980 and 2010. Soil samples were collected at surface (0-20cm) and subsurface (20-40cm) horizons for the different classes of land use time (<10, 10-20, 20-30, and >30years). The following physical properties were measured: bulk density (BD), air permeability (K-a), penetration resistance (PR), microporosity (MI), macroporosity (MA), and total porosity (TP). Results showed a strong expansion with time of agriculture that occupied 353% (1980), 374% (1990), 513% (2000), and 609% (2010) of the watershed area. When properties were compared with those from the reference areas (preserved soils under native vegetation), significant differences were observed for all the physical attributes of soils for a land use time higher than 20years. Overall, BD and PR increased with land use time, and the opposite was verified for K-a, MA, and TP. Some physical properties presented values (e.g., 154gcm(-3) for BD and 0.06cm(3)cm(-3) for MA) close to the critical ones reported to affect crop development, but they were not still impacting on local soybean yield.

The main goals of this research are focused on the monitoring of land cover and mangrove spatial changes particularly for the Mundra forest in the western coast of Gujarat state, India, which is famous for its unique mangrove bio-diversity. The multi-temporal Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) Linear Imaging Self Scanning (LISS)-II (IRS-1B) and III (IRS 136/RESOURCESAT-1) images captured in the year 1994 and 2010 were utilized for the spatio-temporal analysis of the area. The land cover and mangrove density was estimated by a unique hybrid classification which consists of K means unsupervised following maximum likelihood classification (MLC) supervised classification-based approach. The vegetation and non-vegetation layers has been extracted and separated by unsupervised classification technique while the training-based MLC was applied on the separated vegetation and nonvegetation classes to classify them into 11 land use/land cover classes, The climatic variables of the area involves wind, temperature, dew point, precipitation, and mean sea level investigated for the period of 17 years over the site. To understand the driving factors, the anthropogenic variables were also taken into account such as historical population datasets. The overall analysis indicates a significant change in the frequency and magnitude of sea-level rise from 1994 to 2010. The analysis of the meteorological variables indicates a high pressure and changes in mangrove density during the 17 years of time, which reveals that if appropriate actions are not initiated soon, the Mundra mangroves might become the victims of climate change-induced habitat loss. After analyzing all the factors, some recommendations and suggestions are provided for effective mangrove conservation and resilience, which could be used by forest official to protect this precious ecosystem.

The first one deals with the promotion of agricultural productivity since the 1980s; the second, the water conservation measures as a response to the water crisis that peaked in the early 2000s. We had chosen Minqin County in northwestern China, one of the most fragile arid oasis systems in the world, as the study area. We found that the irrigated farmland in up and midstream areas had greatly expanded between the 1980s and the 2000s under the government policy of promoting commodity grain production. As a result, the runoff flowing into Minqin Oasis had reduced 80 % from the 1950s to early 2000s. Irrigated farmland in Minqin Oasis expanded 15.76 % from 1995 to 2000. In the 2000s, because of the changing policy discourse that has shifted from productivity to conservation, a new set of environmentally framed policies has restructured agricultural production in Minqin by 2005. These new policies included establishing a watershed-level water management system, promoting drought resistant crops, introducing water-saving irrigation measures, and forced reduction of irrigated farming acreage. These policies have produced positive results in terms of greater coverage of vegetation, rising ground water table, and reduction of evaporation. Nevertheless, new policies have also brought new challenges to both farmers and policy makers to keep the balance between poverty reduction and environmental sustainability in Minqin Oasis in the historically poor region in China's Northwest.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				MAY	2015	55	5					1036	1051		10.1007/s00267-015-0451-y								WOS:000352645600004	25740224

The specific challenge of this paper is to develop and standardize a methodology from Earth Observation imagery analysis to generate classifications such as Natura 2000 and EUNIS habitat types that coastal managers can use to improve the ability of coupling coastal biogeomorphology knowledge and the final decision within the management process. By using in situ measurements collected with a field spectral radiometer and a sub-pixel analysis of satellite multispectral imagery a classification procedure that can be used in mapping and describing transitional habitats with appropriate resolution and scale of observation is defined.

USING GOOGLE EARTH, A VIRTUAL-GLOBE IMAGING PLATFORM, FOR ECOSYSTEM SERVICES-BASED RIVER ASSESSMENT	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS					3rd Biennial Symposium of the International Society for River Science	AUG 05-09, 2013	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA					A methodology for reach-based river ecosystem service assessment of eight ecosystem functions using remote sensing via Google Earth is presented. The number of publications addressing Google Earth and ecosystem services has grown significantly since 2005, yet this powerful remote sensing platform remains under-used in river science. Theoretical linkages between 18 riverscape fluvial features, attributes and land cover types, observable and measurable on Google Earth, and resultant river ecosystem service delivery are central to the methodology. Using this framework, we build on earlier ecosystem service conceptual models to develop a rules-based scoring approach and apply it to three rivers of differing size and character from source to mouth. The aim was to devise a robust ecosystem service assessment tool applicable to any ecoregion and to rivers of any size, degree of human modification and character. Reach or sector scales are river length dependent. The minimum reach scale recommended is 500m, and a 10km sector length was used on the longest of our three rivers. Two key metrics, the individual ecosystem service score and the total ecosystems service score, are derived at the river reach scale from source to mouth. Scoring is on a 0-3 scale with 0 representing an absent or virtually no ecosystem service value and 3 an optimal or maximum value. Output is best expressed in score per kilometre of river length. The exercise showed the tool to be applicable across two ecoregions and to rivers of varying size, level of human modification and character. While requiring further refinement, the approach shows that ecosystem service assessments based on virtual globes can be universally applied providing valuable information on riverscape ecosystem service delivery.

Segmentation of High Resolution Satellite Image Using S-Transform	RESEARCH JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL SCIENCES												The resolution of remote sensing images increases every day, raising the level of detail and the heterogeneity of the scenes. Most of the existing geographic information systems classification tools (Stock well Transform) have used the same methods for years. With these new high resolution images basic classification methods do not provide satisfactory results. A region-based classification method segmentation is based on and a classification. In this paper, we have proposed an approach for the segmentation of very high resolution (VHR) satellite images using S-Transforms. Satellite images have many applications in meteorology, agriculture, geology, forestry, landscape, biodiversity conservation, regional planning, education, intelligence and warfare. The segmentation uses an S-Transform to divide the image into several homogenous regions. Then follows the region-based classification performed either with the method MCL (Maximum Likelihood classifier). The method was validated and a comparison between pixel-based and region-based classification was performed. This method provides better results comparing to the existing remote sensing classification tools, even if some work should be done to prove its robustness. We also proved that the prior segmentation significantly improves the results of classification, both from the quantitative and qualitative points of view.																	0975-8585					MAY-JUN	2015	6	3					251	259										WOS:000413298700035

To reach this aim a high-level understanding of the distribution and conditions of these habitats is needed. Remote sensing can considerably contribute to habitat mapping and their observation over time. Several European projects and a large number of scientific studies have addressed the issue of mapping and monitoring natural habitats via remote sensing and the deriving of indicators on their conservation status. The multitude of utilized remote sensing sensors and applied methods used in these studies, however, impede a common understanding of what is achievable with current state-of-the-art technologies. The aim of this paper is to provide a synthesis on what is currently feasible in terms of detection and monitoring of natural and semi-natural habitats with remote sensing. To focus this endeavour, we concentrate on those studies aimed at direct mapping of individual habitat types or discriminating between different types of habitats occurring in relatively large, spatially contiguous units. By this we uncover the potential of remote sensing to better understand the distribution of habitats and the assessment of their conservation status in Europe. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The EODHaM approach has adopted the Food and Agriculture Organization Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) taxonomy and translates mapped classes to General Habitat Categories (GHCs) from which Annex I habitats (EU Habitats Directive) can be defined. The EODHaM system uses a combination of pixel and object-based procedures. The 1st and 2nd stages use earth observation (EO) data alone with expert knowledge to generate classes according to the LCCS taxonomy (Levels 1 to 3 and beyond). The 3rd stage translates the final LCCS classes into GHCs from which Annex I habitat type maps are derived. An additional module quantifies changes in the LCCS classes and their components, indices derived from earth observation, object sizes and dimensions and the translated habitat maps (i.e., GHCs or Annex I). Examples are provided of the application of EODHaM system elements to protected sites and their surrounds in Italy, Wales (UK), the Netherlands, Greece, Portugal and India. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Garcia; Klink, Adrian; Pakzad, Kian			Using information layers for mapping grassland habitat distribution at local to regional scales	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												The Natura 2000 network of protected sites is one of the means to enable biodiversity conservation in Europe. EU member states have to undertake surveillance of habitats and species of community interest protected under the Habitat Directive. Remote sensing techniques have been applied successfully to monitor biodiversity aspects according to Natura 2000, but many challenges remain in assessing dynamics and habitat changes outside protected sites. Grasslands are among the most threatened habitats in Europe. In this paper we tested the integration of expert knowledge into different standard classification approaches to map grassland habitats in Schleswig Holstein, Germany. Knowledge about habitat features is represented as raster information layers, and used in subsequent grassland classifications. Overall classification accuracies were highest for the maximum likelihood and support vector machine approaches using RapidEye time series, but results improved for specific grassland classes when information layers were included in the classification process.

Very high resolution Earth observation features for monitoring plant and animal community structure across multiple spatial scales in protected areas	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Monitoring the status and future trends in biodiversity can be prohibitively expensive using ground-based surveys. Consequently, significant effort is being invested in the use of satellite remote sensing to represent aspects of the proximate mechanisms (e.g., resource availability) that can be related to biodiversity surrogates (BS) such as species community descriptors. We explored the potential of very high resolution (VHR) satellite Earth observation (EO) features as proxies for habitat structural attributes that influence spatial variation in habitat quality and biodiversity change. In a semi-natural grassland mosaic of conservation concern in southern Italy, we employed a hierarchical nested sampling strategy to collect field and VHR-EO data across three spatial extent levels (landscape, patch and plot). Species incidence and abundance data were collected at the plot level for plant, insect and bird functional groups. Spectral and textural VHR-EO image features were derived from a Worldview-2 image. Three window sizes (grains) were tested for analysis and computation of textural features, guided by the perception limits of different organisms. The modelled relationships between VHR-EO features and BS responses differed across scales, suggesting that landscape, patch and plot levels are respectively most appropriate when dealing with birds, plants and insects. This research demonstrates the potential of VHR-EO for biodiversity mapping and habitat modelling, and highlights the importance of identifying the appropriate scale of analysis for specific taxonomic groups of interest. Further, textural features are important in the modelling of functional group-specific indices which represent BS in high conservation value habitat types, and provide a more direct link to species interaction networks and ecosystem functioning, than provided by traditional taxonomic diversity indices.

A multi-indicator assessment based on an automated knowledge-driven system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												There is an increasing need of effective monitoring systems for habitat quality assessment. Methods based on remote sensing (RS) features, such as vegetation indices, have been proposed as promising approaches, complementing methods based on categorical data to support decision making. Here, we evaluate the ability of Earth observation (EO) data, based on a new automated, knowledge-driven system, to predict several indicators for oak woodland habitat quality in a Portuguese Natura 2000 site. We collected in-field data on five habitat quality indicators in vegetation plots from woodland habitats of a landscape undergoing agricultural abandonment. Forty-three predictors were calculated, and a multi-model inference framework was applied to evaluate the predictive strength of each data set for the several quality indicators. Three indicators were mainly explained by predictors related to landscape and neighbourhood structure. Overall, competing models based on the products of the automated knowledge-driven system had the best performance to explain quality indicators, compared to models based on manually classified land cover data. The system outputs in terms of both land cover classes and spectral/landscape indices were considered in the study, which highlights the advantages of combining EO data with RS techniques and improved modelling based on sound ecological hypotheses. Our findings strongly suggest that some features of habitat quality, such as structure and habitat composition, can be effectively monitored from EO data combined with in-field campaigns as part of an integrative monitoring framework for habitat status assessment.

In this work we use remote sensing-based biodiversity information and apply semantic formalisation and ontological inference to show improvements in data interoperability/comparability. The proposed methodology includes an observation-based, "bottom-up" engineering approach for remote sensing applications and gives a practical example of semantic mediation of geospatial products. We apply the methodology to three different nomenclatures used for remote sensing-based classification of two heathland nature conservation areas in Belgium and Germany. We analysed sensor nomenclatures with respect to their semantic formalisation and their bio-geographical differences. The results indicate that a hierarchical and transparent nomenclature is far more important for transferability than the sensor or study area. The inclusion of additional information, not necessarily belonging to a vegetation class description, is a key factor for the future success of using semantics for interoperability in remote sensing.

An ontological system based on MODIS images to assess ecosystem functioning of Natura 2000 habitats: A case study for Quercus pyrenaica forests	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												The implementation of the Natura 2000 network requires methods to assess the conservation status of habitats. This paper shows a methodological approach that combines the use of (satellite) Earth observation with ontologies to monitor Natura 2000 habitats and assess their functioning. We have created an ontological system called Savia that can describe both the ecosystem functioning and the behaviour of abiotic factors in a Natura 2000 habitat. This system is able to automatically download images from MODIS products, create indicators and compute temporal trends for them. We have developed an ontology that takes into account the different concepts and relations about indicators and temporal trends, and the spatio-temporal components of the datasets. All the information generated from datasets and MODIS images, is stored into a knowledge base according to the ontology. Users can formulate complex questions using a SPARQL end-point. This system has been tested and validated in a case study that uses Quercus pyrenaica Willd. forests as a target habitat in Sierra Nevada (Spain), a Natura 2000 site. We assess ecosystem functioning using NDVI. The selected abiotic factor is snow cover. Savia provides useful data regarding these two variables and reflects relationships between them.

Wetlands are the primary stopover for many waterbirds and restoration of these wetlands involves both hydrological restoration and water resource management. To protect the stopover sites of Siberian Cranes, we collected Siberian Crane stopover numbers, meteorological and hydrological data, and remote sensing data from 2008 to 2011 in Momoge National Nature Reserve, one of the largest wetlands in northeastern China. A model was developed to estimate the suitability of Siberian Crane stopover sites. According to our results, the most suitable daily water level for Siberian Cranes between 2008 and 2012 occurred in the spring of 2008 and in the Scirpus planiculmis growing season and autumn of 2010. We suggest a season-dependent water management strategy in order to provide suitable conditions at Siberian Crane stopover sites.																	1932-6203					APR 15	2015	10	4							e0122687	10.1371/journal.pone.0122687								WOS:000353015800071	25874552

In this paper, it is described how this technique can be successfully applied for early-warning procedures and detection of ongoing deterioration processes on archeological and cultural heritage sites. An integrated approach of GBInSAR and terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) technologies was performed on Volterra test site (Tuscany, Italy), where a sudden collapse of a 35-m wide section of city walls occurred on January 31, 2014. The installed early-warning monitoring system is capable of an accurate and focused real-time displacement detection of the south-western side of the city including walls, buildings, and monuments, thus allowing prompt interventions for citizens safety and conservation purposes. The effectiveness of this alert technique became evident when the precursors of a second impressive wall collapse were clearly detected. From the beginning of the GBInSAR monitoring, we measured a constant displacement velocity of 0.1 mm/h in correspondence to a 15-m high wall sustaining the Acropolis and lying an underground parking. After a sudden increase of velocity values up to 1.7 mm/h, the local authorities were alerted so that they had time to interdict the area to citizens and to take adequate safety countermeasures two days before the collapse.

Remote sensing of intertidal habitats predicts West Indian topsnail population expansion but reveals scale-dependent bias	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												High-resolution imagery is lacking for much of the West Indies, impeding accurate intertidal habitat assessments and conservation planning. The West Indian topsnail, which inhabits rocky shores, is an important, regional fishery. It was overfished to extinction in Bermuda but reintroduced in 1982. In this study, we estimate potential population size through habitat mapping using high-resolution imagery and ground-based survey data. We also test the effects of image resolution and map scale on intertidal habitat assessments. The coastline of Bermuda was mapped as a linear feature (1:500) using high-resolution imagery. Topsnail population size was predicted using length of preferred habitat and population density. With the comprehensive map as ground-truth, effects of scale were assessed in two ways: supervised classification of low-resolution imagery and progressive map scale coarsening (Douglas-Peuker simplification). Bermuda's coastline is 296 km at this map scale, 50 % of which is rocky shore. Topsnail population could expand significantly if all preferred habitat is occupied. However, image resolution and map scale drastically affect mapping robustness. Unsurprisingly, automated classifiers poorly distinguished narrow intertidal habitats. More disturbingly, coarsening map scale differentially affected habitats. Fine-scale mapping enabled by high-resolution imagery is vital for intertidal conservation planning. Limitations of low-resolution imagery and scale-dependent biases are pertinent beyond intertidal habitats. Numerous predominantly linear habitats may be especially sensitive to sea-level rise and other effects of climate change, so careful consideration of the effects of scale on habitat assessments and the use of high-resolution imagery are strongly recommended.

J	Zhang, BL; Tsunekawa, A; Tsubo, M				Zhang, Baolin; Tsunekawa, Atsushi; Tsubo, Mitsuru			Identification of Dust Hot Spots from Multi-Resolution Remotely Sensed Data in Eastern China and Mongolia	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Aeolian dust from hot spots in eastern China and Mongolia can be carried downwind to provinces in China, neighboring countries, the Pacific islands, and cities far beyond the source region. Although dust sources of huge extent have been identified in several countries, few effective countermeasures are available to combat dust emissions in arid regions. We analyzed Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images (1 km spatial resolution) that captured dust emission and dispersion during 2000-2013 to determine dust sources in eastern China and Mongolia. MODIS level 1B data and the brightness temperature difference (BTD) algorithm provided efficient discrimination of dust in this study. The derived dust information, in conjunction with the MODIS land cover product (1 km spatial resolution) and high-resolution Landsat data (30 m spatial resolution; Landsat 8, Operational Land Imager sensor) were used to identify the locations and specific sources of dust. Dust emissions appear to be sporadic in time and space, controlled by both environmental factors and human activity, although past studies have indicated that many dust emissions are from consistently active hot spots. Analysis of MODIS data indicated that three subregions of the eastern China and Mongolia source region are the dominant sources of dust: Horqin Sandy Land, Otintag Sandy Land, and the southeastern Mongolian Gobi; each of these subregions contains dust emission hot spots. We identified the locations of consistent hot spots and verified that some individual dust emissions originated from those hot spots. Our data also indicated that hot spots in southeastern Mongolia have migrated northward since 2006. Our study showed that hot spots such as dry lakes, river beds, mines, and croplands contribute to dust emissions in the eastern China and Mongolia source region. Dust hot spots coincide with regions of expanding industry in Otintag Sandy Land and in some areas of the Mongolian Gobi and with agricultural areas in Horqin Sandy Land and in some parts of the Mongolian Gobi. In Horqin and Otintag sandy lands, dust sources are associated with ephemeral water bodies. Water conservation can be an important countermeasure for initial dust emissions in the Horqin Sandy Land. In the Otintag Sandy Land, attention should be paid to human activities, for example, minimizing the effects of mining disturbances, improving dust suppression in industrial areas, and controlling water use by industry. In Mongolia, protective farming techniques and water conservation in dust emitting basins, and dust suppression and water resource protection in mining zones, must be considered to combat dust emission. MODIS level 1B data can be used to locate dust hot spots and to identify future sources of dust entrainment. Dust hot spots identified from MODIS level 1B data provide small-scale information about dust emission that can be used to locate pollution hot spots, increase understanding of the global dust cycle, and improve dust modeling.

Precipitation must be held back in reservoirs to provide and regulate sufficient water supply. Balancing the irregular precipitation and increasing water demands generates tremendous pressure on water resources management for the water stored in the Shihmen Reservoir, which is the major unitary water supply system in the Greater Taoyuan Area. Such pressure will be significantly enlarged due to the huge 17 billion USD Taoyuan Aerotropolis Project. In earlier days many small artificial ponds (a common terminology in this article), including irrigation ponds, fishery ponds and others, were built to cope with water shortages in Taoyuan County. These small storage ponds provided a solution that resolved seasonal precipitation shortages. Unfortunately, these ponds have been vanishing one after another one due to regional industrialization and urbanization in recent decades and less than 40% of them still remain today. There is great urgency and importance to investigating the link between vanishing ponds and water resources management. Remote sensing technology was used in this study to monitor the environmental consequences in the Taoyuan area by conducting multi-temporal analysis on the changes in water bodies, i.e., ponds. SPOT satellite images taken in 1993, 2003, and 2010 were utilized to analyze and assess the importance of small-scale ponds as water conservation facilities. It was found that, during the seventeen years from 1993 - 2010, the number of irrigation ponds decreased by 35.94%. These ponds can reduce the burden on the major reservoir and increase the water recycling rate if they are properly conserved. They can also improve rainfall interception and surface detention capabilities, and provide another planning advantage for regional water management.

REMOTE SENSING												In managed landscapes, conservation planning requires effective methods to identify high-biodiversity areas. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of airborne laser scanning (ALS) and forest estimates derived from satellite images extracted at two spatial scales for predicting the stand-scale abundance and species richness of birds and beetles in a managed boreal forest landscape. Multiple regression models based on forest data from a 50-m radius (i.e., corresponding to a homogenous forest stand) had better explanatory power than those based on a 200-m radius (i.e., including also parts of adjacent stands). Bird abundance and species richness were best explained by the ALS variables "maximum vegetation height" and "vegetation cover between 0.5 and 3 m" (both positive). Flying beetle abundance and species richness, as well as epigaeic (i.e., ground-living) beetle richness were best explained by a model including the ALS variable "maximum vegetation height" (positive) and the satellite-derived variable "proportion of pine" (negative). Epigaeic beetle abundance was best explained by "maximum vegetation height" at 50 m (positive) and "stem volume" at 200 m (positive). Our results show that forest estimates derived from satellite images and ALS data provide complementary information for explaining forest biodiversity patterns. We conclude that these types of remote sensing data may provide an efficient tool for conservation planning in managed boreal landscapes.

In this study, based on the data derived from topographic maps and remote sensing images, the temporal and spatial change of river system geomorphology in the Taihu Region over the past 50 years was investigated in conjunction with urbanization. Results demonstrated that the number of river systems decreased drastically, that the morphology of river channels changed into wider and straighter and that the structure of river network tended to simplify in the Taihu Region in recent 50 years. Meanwhile, the changes in river density, the water surface ratio, the river development coefficient, the main river area length ratio and the box dimension in the rapid urbanization period were much greater than those in the slow urbanization period, but the decrease of river sinuosity in the slow urbanization period was more intense. Moreover, the spatial differences of the changes in the river development coefficient were the largest, and the changes in the river indicators in the low-urbanized regions were the most intense. In addition, the changes in the water surface ratio had the closest correlation with urbanization, and the relational degrees between population urbanization and the changes in river systems were the largest. The results can provide a reliable basis to determine reasonable management and conservation strategies of river systems in the Taihu Region.																	2073-4441					APR	2015	7	4					1340	1358		10.3390/w7041340								WOS:000353715100002

Rapid mapping and impact estimation of illegal charcoal production in southern Somalia based on WorldView-1 imagery	ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												Following more than 20 years of civil unrest, environmental information for southern Somalia is scarce. Wood charcoal production and export is a major activity supporting war regimes in this area such as the extreme Islamist group Al-Shabaab. However, little quantitative information exists on the extent of this charcoal production. In this study, we developed a semi-automatic detection method to identify charcoal production sites from very high resolution (0.5 m) satellite imagery. We then applied it to a 4700 km(2) area along the Juba River in southern Somalia using 2011 and 2013 WorldView-1 imagery. Based on the sites detected exclusively for 2013 we estimated an average production of 24,000 tonnes of charcoal and 2.7% tree loss for the two-year interval, using literature- and local-knowledge-based assumptions on likely ranges of kiln and tree parameters. Our large-area assessment helps to better understand the dimension and impact of charcoal production in southern Somalia and reveals a rapid depletion of tree cover. The analysis provides a first step towards the development of a charcoal production monitoring system that could be extended to other parts of the country. (C) 2015 International Energy Initiative.

J	Wu, GP; Liu, YB				Wu, Guiping; Liu, Yuanbo			Capturing variations in inundation with satellite remote sensing in a morphologically complex, large lake	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China, with high morphological complexity from south to north. In recent years, the lake has experienced expansion and shrinkage processes over both short- and long-term scales, resulting in significant hydrological, ecological and economic problems. Exactly how and how rapidly the processes of spatial change have occurred in the lake during the expansion and shrinkage periods is unknown. Such knowledge is of great importance for policymakers as it may help with flood/drought prevention, land use planning and lake ecological conservation. In this study, we investigated the spatial-temporal distribution and changing processes of inundation in Poyang Lake based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Level-1B data from 2000 to 2011. A defined water variation rate (WVR) and inundation frequency (IF) indicator revealed the water surface submersion and exposure processes of lake expansion and shrinkage in different zones which were divided according to the lake's hydrological and topographic features. Regional differences and significant seasonality variability were found in the annual and monthly mean IF. The monthly mean IF increased slowly from north to south during January-August but decreased quickly from south to north during September-December. During the lake expansion period, the lake-type water body zone (Zone II) had the fastest expansion rate, with a mean monthly WVR value of 34.47% in February-March, and was followed by the channel-type water body zone (Zone I) in March-May (22.47%). However, during the lake shrinkage period, rapid shrinkage first appeared around the alluvial delta zones in August-October. The sequence of lake surface shrinkage from August to December is exactly opposite to that of lake expansion from February to July. These complex inundation characteristics and changing process were driven by the high temporal variability of the river flows, the morphological diversity of the benthic landforms and the patterns of water movement. These results provide a foundation for basic hydrological and ecological studies and are valuable for the conservation and management of water resources in Poyang Lake. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Changes in the distribution of 31 land cover classes and their spatial relationships have been assessed using exploratory data analysis. Our results highlight the shift from a spatially-heterogeneous and diversified agro-forest landscape towards a land-use structure polarized in medium-and low-quality areas with homogeneous (natural or urban) uses of land. These transformations may impact negatively the environmental functions and determine ecological fragility on a local scale. Agro-forest landscapes around cities require permanent monitoring and dedicated conservation measures counterbalancing the increased human pressure.

Our goals were to increase conservation practitioners' use of remote sensing to support their work, increase collaboration between the conservation science and remote sensing communities, identify and develop new and innovative uses of remote sensing for advancing conservation science, provide guidance to space agencies on how future satellite missions can support conservation science, and generate support from the public and private sector in the use of remote sensing data to address the 10 conservation questions. We identified a broad initial list of questions on the basis of an email chain-referral survey. We then used a workshop-based iterative and collaborative approach to whittle the list down to these final questions (which represent 10 major themes in conservation): How can global Earth observation data be used to model species distributions and abundances? How can remote sensing improve the understanding of animal movements? How can remotely sensed ecosystem variables be used to understand, monitor, and predict ecosystem response and resilience to multiple stressors? How can remote sensing be used to monitor the effects of climate on ecosystems? How can near real-time ecosystem monitoring catalyze threat reduction, governance and regulation compliance, and resource management decisions? How can remote sensing inform configuration of protected area networks at spatial extents relevant to populations of target species and ecosystem services? How can remote sensing-derived products be used to value and monitor changes in ecosystem services? How can remote sensing be used to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of conservation efforts? How does the expansion and intensification of agriculture and aquaculture alter ecosystems and the services they provide? How can remote sensing be used to determine the degree to which ecosystems are being disturbed or degraded and the effects of these changes on species and ecosystem functions?

Remote sensing variables as predictors of habitat suitability of the viscacha rat (Octomys mimax), a rock-dwelling mammal living in a desert environment	MAMMAL RESEARCH												Identifying high-quality habitats across large areas is a central goal in biodiversity conservation. Remotely sensed data provide the opportunity to study different habitat characteristics (e.g., landscape topography, soil, vegetation cover, climatic factors) that are difficult to identify at high spatial and temporal resolution on the basis of field studies. Our goal was to evaluate the applicability of remotely sensed information as a potential tool for modeling habitat suitability of the viscacha rat (Octomys mimax), a rock-dwelling species that lives in a desert ecosystem. We fitted models considering raw indices (i.e., green indices, Brightness Index (BI) and temperature) and their derived texture measures on locations used by and available for the viscacha rat. The habitat preferences identified in our models are consistent with results of field studies of landscape use by the viscacha rat. Rocky habitats were well differentiated by the second-order contrast of BI, instead of BI only, making an important contribution to the global model by capturing the heterogeneity of the substratum. Furthermore, rocky habitats are able to maintain more vegetation than much of the surrounding desert; hence, their availability might be estimated using SATVI (Soil Adjusted Total Vegetation Index) and its derived texture measures: second-order contrast and entropy. This is the first study that evaluates the usefulness of remotely sensed data for predicting and mapping habitat suitability for a small-bodied rock dwelling species in a desert environment. Our results may contribute to conservation efforts focused on these habitat specialist species by using good predictors of habitat quality.																	2199-2401	2199-241X				APR	2015	60	2					117	126		10.1007/s13364-015-0215-3								WOS:000351153500004

Application of an unmanned aerial vehicle in spatial mapping of terrestrial biology and human disturbance in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, East Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												The McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica are a unique yet threatened polar biome. Cyanobacterial mats form a large part of the standing biomass in the McMurdo Dry Valleys and are therefore an indicator of ecosystem productivity and health. They are, however, patchily distributed, and this has hampered spatial ecology studies due to the logistical challenges of ground-based field sampling. Here, we report the application of remote sensing using a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and GIS spatial mapping to identify cyanobacterial mats, estimate their extent and discriminate between different mat types. Using the Spalding Pond area of Taylor Valley as a test site, we were able to identify mats on soil surfaces within the hyporheic zone, as well as benthic mats below the water surface. The mapping also clearly identified the footprint of campsites and walking trails on soils, and we highlight the potential of this technique in monitoring human impact in this fragile ecosystem.

Constructing a robust, universal method to assess wetland landscape ecological degradation is a critical issue. This study proposes an integrated approach based on a regional habitat succession model to assess wetland landscape ecological degradation. The approach consists of a landscape change monitoring module, a regional habitat succession model, and a quantitative analysis module. The proposed approach is theoretically universal, although the regional habitat succession model is not universal. The approach is implemented and evaluated with Yancheng National Natural Reserve (YNNR) in East China as the study area. Results show that (1) wetland landscape ecological degradation in YNNR exhibits an accelerated degradation rate and an area percentage of 39.39 % for approximately 30 years; (2) the results are similar to those of previous studies and correspond to actual practice; (3) the proposed integrated approach can quantitatively assess the area, rate, and trend of degradation, and determine the dominant degradation processes and their drivers; and (4) the dominant processes and factors established in this study can provide directions for studies on the mechanism of wetland degradation and support the conservation and management of wetlands. Therefore, the proposed method is a promising approach to evaluate the ecological degradation of wetland landscapes.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				APR	2015	35	2					281	289		10.1007/s13157-014-0617-z								WOS:000351532700006						
J	Pham, HT; Miyagawa, S; Kosaka, Y				Pham, Ha T.; Miyagawa, Shuichi; Kosaka, Yasuyuki			Distribution patterns of trees in paddy field landscapes in relation to agro-ecological settings in northeast Thailand	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Deforestation accompanied by the expansion of agricultural land makes tree resources less available in many regions in the tropics, and small-scale farmers often incorporate trees with agricultural lands to meet their demands for food, timber, fuelwood, or fodder. This study analyzed the distribution patterns and management of multiple tree species grown in the rice paddy fields of a forest-depleted region in northeast Thailand - a region whose forestland represents only 16.32% of the total land area. Twenty villages from 11 provinces were selected for the remote sensing analysis of tree density and microhabitat. Interview surveys were conducted among villagers on their tree use and management, and field observations were performed to determine tree species' composition. The average tree-unit density (based on the number of tree crowns, either of a single tree or of cohesive trees, appearing in satellite images) was 6.27 units/ha, and was correlated with both density on the levee (5.30 units/ha on average) and levee length per unit paddy area (475.25 m/ha on average). The levees were more significant as tree habitats in the villages on the floodplain where the early introduction of agricultural machinery and direct seeding reduced the number of trees inside the fields where rice crops are grown. In total, 79 tree species representing 66 genera and 33 families were observed in the paddy fields. Remnant trees from the original forest, mostly Dipterocarpaceae and Fabaceae, have decreased due to cutting for use as timber and fuel. More recently, eucalypt and teak for timber, and mango and tamarind for edible fruits, have been planted on the levees as income sources. Farmers have recognized that while leaf litter fertilizes the soil, excess shading reduces the rice yield. The coppicing of eucalypt and pollarding of Mitragyna diversifolia were conducted for the sustainable harvest of timber and fuelwood, and also to avoid creating excess shade. Paddy rice fields are the monoculture of a staple crop, but they can harbor multiple trees on their levees, which play a counteractive role in forestland decline. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Testing the relevance of binary, mosaic and continuous landscape conceptualisations to reptiles in regenerating dryland landscapes	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Context Fauna distributions are assessed using discrete (binary and mosaic) or continuous conceptualisations of the landscape. The value of the information derived from these analyses depends on the relevance of the landscape representation (or model) used to the landscape and fauna of interest. Discrete representations dominate analyses of landscape context in disturbed and regenerating landscapes; however within-patch variation suggests that continuous representations may help explain the distribution of fauna in such landscapes. Objectives Wetested the relevance of binary, mosaic, and continuous conceptualisations of landscape context to reptiles in regenerating dryland landscapes. Methods For each of thirteen reptile groups, we compared the fit of models consisting of one landscape composition and one landscape heterogeneity variable for each of six landscape representations (29 binary, 29 mosaic, and 29 continuous), at three buffer distances. We used Akaike weights to assess the relative support for each model. Maps were created from Landsat satellite images. Results Reptiles varied in their response to landscape context; however, the binary landscape representation with classes 'intact/disturbed' was best supported overall. Species richness was best described by a binary landscape representation with classes 'wooded/clear', whereas reptile abundance was best described by a mosaic landscape representation with classes defined by vegetation type. Five out of ten reptile species responded strongly to a single landscape representation, with the most relevant representation and conceptualisation varying among species. Conclusions Our findings support the use of multiple landscape conceptualisations and representations during analyses of landscape context for fauna in regenerating landscapes.

Urban green space plays a positive role in water regulation and purification, but this function is often ignored by municipal authorities. Based on remote-sensing image interpretation and practical investigations in Yixing (China), this study evaluated the water regulation and purification functions performed by urban green space, using the modified Soil Conservation Service model, in conjunction with relevant experimental data. The results show that during the period 2007 to 2009, the average volume of rainfall stored by the urban green space in Yixing was 5.3 x 107 m(3) yr(-1), which represented more than 88% of the rainfall received. The average figures for chemical oxygen demand (CODCr), total nitrogen (TN), ammoniacal nitrogen (NH4-N), and total phosphorus (TP) in rainfall that were removed by green space during 2007 to 2009 were 233.6 x 10(3) kg yr(-1), 70.9 x 10(3) kg yr(-1), 12.6 x 10(3) kg yr(-1), and 1.7 x 10(3) kg yr(-1), respectively. Differences were found between the water regulation and purification performed by urban green space inside built-up areas and those performed outside built-up areas, which relate to the importance attached to green space in the two types of area. This research will contribute to an understanding of the role that green space plays in water regulation and purification, and in the scientific management of urban green space.

By taking the situation in 2000 as the base of comparison and using the established grassland vegetation growth model, the monitoring and evaluation of grassland vegetation dynamic variation in the project area from 2000 to 2010 was conducted based on MODIS 16 days NDVI data. The conclusions are as follows: (1) The comparative result of average growth between each year from 2001 to 2010 and the base year was on the good side in general; the grassland growth was good both in the early and later periods of grassland growth peak season than in the first years of the project implementation, indicating that the implementation of the Beijing-Tianjin sandstorm source project has significantly improved the growth conditions of grassland vegetation; (2) With regard to the annual dynamic variation of grassland growth, the area proportions of the grasslands, of which the average grassland growth was on the good side, fluctuated and increased slightly with the time changes in general. The area proportions of the grasslands, of which the average grassland growth was on the bad side, fluctuated and decreased in general. The area proportions of the grasslands with normal growth showed an increasing overall trend; (3) From the regional perceptive on four zones, including the northern arid grassland desertification control zone, Hunshandake sandy land control zone, the farming-pastoral area of desertified land control zone, and the water conservation zone of Yanshan hills and mountains, except that the grassland growth in the farmingpastoral area of desertified land control zone was bad, the average growth of other three zones was good each year from 2001 to 2010 compared with the base year. (4) In respect of space, the regions with big grassland growth variation in the project area were concentrated in the western and eastern sections of the northern arid grassland desertification control zone and the western section of Hunshandake sandy land control zone. The grassland growth variation in the water conservation zone of Yanshan hills and mountains and the farming-pastoral area of desertified land control zone were relatively stable. On one hand, the conclusions of this paper can evaluate the effectiveness of the project control, on the other hand, it can also provide scientific basics to grassland management departments, facilitate the rational utilization of grassland, and preserve the regional ecological balance.

J	Yang, JB; Wang, YC; Guo, L; Xue, DY				Yang, Jingbiao; Wang, Yi Chen; Guo, Luo; Xue, Dayuan			Patterns and Structures of Land Use Change in the Three Rivers Headwaters Region of China	PLOS ONE												Located in Qinghai Province of China, the Three Rivers Headwaters Region is the source region of the Yangtze, Yellow and Lantsang Rivers, and plays an important role in biodiversity conservation and regulating water supply. Despite many efforts on land use change in Qinghai, knowledge of the spatial variation of land use change is still lacking. This study examines the patterns of land use change across various watersheds, prefectures and the temple surroundings. Remote sensing images of 1987, 1997 and 2007 were analyzed to derive land use distributions; patterns and structures of the landscape were then quantified with landscape metrics. The results illustrated that the Yangtze River headwater region had more diverse and more evenly distributed landscape, while the Lantsang and the Yellow headwater regions showed a decline in landscape diversity. Comparison of the land use patterns of four prefectures revealed that Yushu Prefecture experienced an increase in landscape diversity from 1987 to 2007 while the land use patches in Guoluo Prefecture exhibited more aggregated patterns than other prefectures. Analysis of the spatial variations of land use change in the temple surroundings illustrated that 19.7% and 35.9% of the temples in Guoluo and Yushu Prefectures, respectively, encountered land use change for their immediate areas within 2 km. Comparison of the surroundings of temples and human settlements found that land use change was not evenly distributed, and that greater land use change had occurred for the surroundings of human settlements. Such findings provided insights into the spatial variation of land use change in the Three Rivers Headwaters Region.

In tropical island dry landscapes, home range use and movements of non-native feral goats (Capra hircus) are largely unknown, yet this information is important to help guide the conservation and restoration of some of the world's most critically endangered ecosystems. We hypothesized that feral goats would respond to resource pulses in vegetation by traveling to areas of recent green-up. To address this hypothesis, we fitted six male and seven female feral goats with Global Positioning System (GPS) collars equipped with an Argos satellite upload link to examine goat movements in relation to the plant phenology using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Movement patterns of 50% of males and 40% of females suggested conditional movement between non-overlapping home ranges throughout the year. A shift in NDVI values corresponded with movement between primary and secondary ranges of goats that exhibited long-distance movement, suggesting that vegetation phenology as captured by NDVI is a good indicator of the habitat and movement patterns of feral goats in tropical island dry landscapes. In the context of conservation and restoration of tropical island landscapes, the results of our study identify how non-native feral goats use resources across a broad landscape to sustain their populations and facilitate invasion of native plant communities.																	1932-6203					MAR 25	2015	10	3							e0119231	10.1371/journal.pone.0119231								WOS:000351880000023	25807275

Integrated satellite data fusion and mining for monitoring lake water quality status of the Albufera de Valencia in Spain	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Lake eutrophication is a critical issue in the interplay of water supply, environmental management, and ecosystem conservation. Integrated sensing, monitoring, and modeling for a holistic lake water quality assessment with respect to multiple constituents is in acute need. The aim of this paper is to develop an integrated algorithm for data fusion and mining of satellite remote sensing images to generate daily estimates of some water quality parameters of interest, such as chlorophyll a concentrations and water transparency, to be applied for the assessment of the hypertrophic Albufera de Valencia. The Albufera de Valencia is the largest freshwater lake in Spain, which can often present values of chlorophyll a concentration over 200 mg m(-3) and values of transparency (Secchi Disk, SD) as low as 20 cm. Remote sensing data from Moderate Resolution imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhance Thematic Mapper (ETM+) images were fused to carry out an integrative near-real time water quality assessment on a daily basis. Landsat images are useful to study the spatial variability of the water quality parameters, due to its spatial resolution of 30 m, in comparison to the low spatial resolution (250/500 m) of MODIS. While Landsat offers a high spatial resolution, the low temporal resolution of 16 days is a significant drawback to achieve a near real-time monitoring system. This gap may be bridged by using MODIS images that have a high temporal resolution of 1 day, in spite of its low spatial resolution. Synthetic Landsat images were fused for dates with no Landsat overpass over the study area. Finally, with a suite of ground truth data, a few genetic programming (GP) models were derived to estimate the water quality using the fused surface reflectance data as inputs. The GP model for chlorophyll a estimation yielded a R-2 of 0.94, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 8 mg m(-3), and the GP model for water transparency estimation using Secchi disk showed a R-2 of 0.89, with an RMSE = 4 cm. With this effort, the spatiotemporal variations of water transparency and chlorophyll a concentrations may be assessed simultaneously on a daily basis throughout the lake for environmental management.

J	Ran, Q; Li, W; Du, Q; Yang, CH				Ran, Qiong; Li, Wei; Du, Qian; Yang, Chenghai			Hyperspectral image classification for mapping agricultural tillage practices	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												An efficient classification framework for mapping agricultural tillage practice using hyperspectral remote sensing imagery is proposed, which has the potential to be implemented practically to provide rapid, accurate, and objective surveying data for precision agricultural management and appraisal from large-scale remote sensing images. It includes a local region filter [i.e., Gaussian low-pass filter (GLF)] to extract spatial-spectral features, a dimensionality reduction process [i.e., local fisher's discriminate analysis (LFDA)], and the traditional k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier, and is denoted as GLF-LFDA-KNN. Compared to our previously used local average filter and adaptive weighted filter, the GLF also considers spatial features in a small neighborhood, but it emphasizes the central pixel itself and is data-independent; therefore, it can achieve the balance between classification accuracy and computational complexity. The KNN classifier has a lower computational complexity compared to the traditional support vector machine (SVM). After classification separability is enhanced by the GLF and LFDA, the less powerful KNN can outperform SVM and the overall computational cost remains lower. The proposed framework can also outperform the SVM with composite kernel (SVM-CK) that uses spatial-spectral features.

The role of elevation, relative sea-level history and vegetation transition in determining carbon distribution in Spartina alterniflora dominated salt marshes	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Spartina alterniflora salt marshes are among the most productive ecosystems on earth, and represent a substantial global carbon sink. Understanding the spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of both above- and below-ground carbon in these wetland ecosystems is especially important considering their potential in carbon sequestration projects, as well as for conservation efforts in the context of a changing climate and rising sea-level. Through the use of extensive field sampling and remote sensing data (Light Detection and Ranging - LiDAR, and aerial images), we sought to map and explain how vegetation biomass and soil carbon are related to elevation and relative sea-level change in a S. altemiflora dominated salt marsh on Galveston Island, Texas. The specific objectives of this study were to: 1) understand the relationship between elevation and the distribution of salt marsh vegetation percent cover, plant height, plant density, above-and below-ground biomass, and carbon, and 2) evaluate the temporal changes in relative sea-level history, vegetation transitions, and resulting changes in the patterns of soil carbon distribution. Our results indicated a clear zonation of terrain and vegetation characteristics (i.e., height, cover and biomass). In the soil profile, carbon concentrations and bulk densities showed significant and abrupt change at a depth of similar to 10-15 cm. This apparent transition in the soil characteristics coincided temporally with a transformation of the land cover, as driven by a rapid increase in relative sea-level around this time at the sample locations. The amounts of soil carbon stored in recently established S. alterniflora intertidal marshes were significantly lower than those that have remained in situ for a longer period of time. Thus, in order to quantify and predict carbon in coastal wetlands, and also to understand the heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of carbon stocks, it is essential to understand not only the elevation, the relative sea-level rise rate, and the vertical accretion rate - but also the history of land cover change and vegetation transition.

China has taken great efforts in such actions. To understand the ecological transition during 2000-2010 in China, this study analysed trends in vegetation change using remote sensing and linear regression. Climate and socioeconomic factors were included to screen the driving forces for vegetation change using correlation or comparative analyses. Our results indicated that China experienced both vegetation greening (restoration) and browning (degradation) with great spatial heterogeneity. Socioeconomic factors, such as human populations and economic production, were the most significant factors for vegetation change. Nature reserves have contributed slightly to the deceleration of vegetation browning and the promotion of greening; however, a large-scale conservation approach beyond nature reserves was more effective. The effectiveness of the Three-North Shelter Forest Program lay between the two above approaches. The findings of this study highlighted that vegetation trend detection is a practical approach for large-scale ecological transition assessments, which can inform decision-making that promotes vegetation greening via proper socioeconomic development and ecosystem management.

To explore how mammals of extreme elevation respond to glacial recession and past harvest, we combined our fieldwork with remote sensing and used analyses of,60 expeditions from 1850-1925 to represent baseline conditions for wildlife before heavy exploitation on the Tibetan Plateau. Focusing on endangered wild yaks (Bos mutus), we document female changes in habitat use across time whereupon they increasingly relied on steeper post-glacial terrain, and currently have a 20x greater dependence on winter snow patches than males. Our twin findings-that the sexes of a cold-adapted species respond differently to modern climate forcing and long-past exploitation-indicate that effective conservation planning will require knowledge of the interplay between past and future if we will assure persistence of the region's biodiversity.																	2045-2322					MAR 2	2015	5								8676	10.1038/srep08676								WOS:000350300300021	25728642

There are, in particular, large areas within southern Africa savanna ecosystems that lack consistent geospatial data on vegetation morphological properties, which is a prerequisite for biodiversity conservation and sustainable management of ecological resources. Given the challenges involved in distinguishing and mapping savanna vegetation assemblages using remote sensing, the objective of this study was to develop a vegetation morphology map for the largest protected area in Africa, the central Kalahari. Six vegetation morphology classes were developed and sample training/validation pixels were selected for each class by analyzing extensive in situ data on vegetation structural and functional properties, in combination with existing ancillary data and coarse scale land cover products. The classification feature set consisted of annual and intra annual matrices derived from 14 years of satellite-derived vegetation indices images, and final classification was achieved using an ensemble tree based classifier. All vegetation morphology classes were mapped with high accuracy and the overall classification accuracy was 91.9%. Besides filling the geospatial data gap for the central Kalahari area, this vegetation morphology map is expected to serve as a critical input to ecological studies focusing on habitat use by wildlife and the efficacy of game fencing, as well as contributing to sustainable ecosystem management in the central Kalahari.																	2073-445X					MAR	2015	4	1					197	215		10.3390/land4010197								WOS:000365120300009

Analysis of deforestation and protected area effectiveness in Indonesia: A comparison of Bayesian spatial models	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS												Tropical deforestation in Southeast Asia is one of the leading causes of carbon emissions and reductions of biodiversity. Spatially explicit analyses of the dynamics of deforestation in Indonesia are needed to support sustainable land use planning but the value of such analyses has so far been limited by data availability and geographical scope. We use remote sensing maps of land use change from 2000 to 2010 to compare Bayesian computational models: autologistic and von Thunen spatial-autoregressive models. We use the models to analyze deforestation patterns in Indonesia and the effectiveness of protected areas. Cross-validation indicated that models had an accuracy of 70-85%. We find that the spatial pattern of deforestation is explained by transport cost, agricultural rent and history of nearby illegal logging. The effectiveness of protected areas presented mixed results. After controlling for multiple confounders, protected areas of category la, exclusively managed for biodiversity conservation, were shown to be ineffective at slowing down deforestation. Our results suggest that monitoring and prevention of road construction within protected areas, using logging concessions as buffers of protected areas and geographical prioritization of control measures in illegal logging hotspots would be more effective for conservation than reliance on protected areas alone, especially under food price increasing scenarios.

Vessels, submersibles, and a host of unmanned platforms, including satellites, buoys, remotely operated vehicles, and in-water instrument arrays, are providing information that helps us better understand and manage activities that affect the ocean, Great Lakes, and adjacent coasts. Platforms and sensors track animals and ship traffic, send alerts to at-sea operators, map the seabed and its natural and archaeological resources, track spills, sample water, and define ocean soundscapes. Technologies are also employed to support complex diving operations, record marine life, document shipwrecks, log data, produce map products, and broadcast live feeds to the world.

Knowledge of the spatial distribution of this diversity must be gained in order to aid in conservation management. Heterogeneous environmental conditions involve an important number of niches closely related to species richness. Remote sensing information derived from satellite hyperspectral and airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data can be used as proxies to generate a spatial prediction of vascular plant richness. This study aimed to estimate the spatial distribution of plant species richness using remote sensing in the Andes foothills of the Maule Region, Chile. This region has a secondary deciduous forest dominated by Nothofagus obliqua mixed with sclerophyll species. Floristic measurements were performed using a nested plot design with 60 plots of 225 m(2) each. Multiple predictors were evaluated: 30 topographical and vegetation structure indexes from LiDAR data, and 32 spectral indexes and band transformations from the EO1-Hyperion sensor. A random forest algorithm was used to identify relevant variables in richness prediction, and these variables were used in turn to obtain a final multiple linear regression predictive model (Adjusted R-2 = 0.651; RSE = 3.69). An independent validation survey was performed with significant results (Adjusted R-2 = 0.571, RMSE = 5.05). Selected variables were statistically significant: catchment slope, altitude, standard deviation of slope, average slope, Multiresolution Ridge Top Flatness index (MrRTF) and Digital Crown Height Model (DCM). The information provided by LiDAR delivered the best predictors, whereas hyperspectral data were discarded due to their low predictive power.

Global Trends in Exposure to Light Pollution in Natural Terrestrial Ecosystems	REMOTE SENSING												The rapid growth in electric light usage across the globe has led to increasing presence of artificial light in natural and semi-natural ecosystems at night. This occurs both due to direct illumination and skyglow - scattered light in the atmosphere. There is increasing concern about the effects of artificial light on biological processes, biodiversity and the functioning of ecosystems. We combine intercalibrated Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) images of stable night-time lights for the period 1992 to 2012 with a remotely sensed landcover product (GLC2000) to assess recent changes in exposure to artificial light at night in 43 global ecosystem types. We find that Mediterranean-climate ecosystems have experienced the greatest increases in exposure, followed by temperate ecosystems. Boreal, Arctic and montane systems experienced the lowest increases. In tropical and subtropical regions, the greatest increases are in mangroves and subtropical needleleaf and mixed forests, and in arid regions increases are mainly in forest and agricultural areas. The global ecosystems experiencing the greatest increase in exposure to artificial light are already localized and fragmented, and often of particular conservation importance due to high levels of diversity, endemism and rarity. Night time remote sensing can play a key role in identifying the extent to which natural ecosystems are exposed to light pollution.

J	Lui, GV; Coomes, DA				Lui, Gillian V.; Coomes, David A.			A Comparison of Novel Optical Remote Sensing-Based Technologies for Forest-Cover/Change Monitoring	REMOTE SENSING												Remote sensing is gaining considerable traction in forest monitoring efforts, with the Carnegie Landsat Analysis System lite (CLASlite) software package and the Global Forest Change dataset (GFCD) being two of the most recently developed optical remote sensing-based tools for analysing forest cover and change. Due to the relatively nascent state of these technologies, their abilities to classify land cover and monitor forest dynamics have yet to be evaluated against more established approaches. Here, we compared maps of forest cover and change produced by the more traditional supervised classification approach with those produced by CLASlite and the GFCD, working with imagery collected over Sierra Leone, West Africa. CLASlite maps of forest change from 2001-2007 and 2007-2014 exhibited the highest overall accuracies (79.1% and 89.6%, respectively) and, importantly, the greatest capacity to discriminate natural from planted mature forest growth. CLASlite's comparative advantage likely derived from its more robust sub-pixel classification logic and numerous user-defined parameters, which resulted in classified products with greater site relevance than those of the two other classification approaches. In light of today's continuously growing body of analytical toolsets for remotely sensed data, our study importantly elucidates the ways in which methodological processes and limitations inherent in certain classification tools can impact the maps they are capable of producing, and demonstrates the need to understand and weigh such factors before any one tool is selected for a given application.																	2072-4292					MAR	2015	7	3					2781	2807		10.3390/rs70302781								WOS:000353685200022

The information extracted from hyperspectral remote sensing data enables the generation of highly spatially resolved analyses of such species' habitats. In our study we combine information from a species ordination with hyperspectral reflectance signatures to predict occurrence probabilities for Natura 2000 habitat types and their conservation status. We examine how accurate habitat types and habitat threat, expressed by pressure indicators, can be described in an ordination space using spatial correlation functions from the geostatistic approach. We modeled habitat quality assessment parameters using floristic gradients derived by non-metric multidimensional scaling on the basis of 58 field plots. In the resulting ordination space, the variance structure of habitat types and pressure indicators could be explained by 69% up to 95% with fitted variogram models with a correlation to terrestrial mapping of >0.8. Models could be used to predict habitat type probability, habitat transition, and pressure indicators continuously over the whole ordination space. Finally, partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to relate spectral information from AISA DUAL imagery to floristic pattern and related habitat quality. In general, spectral transferability is supported by strong correlation to ordination axes scores (R-2 = 0.79-0.85), whereas second axis of dry heaths (R-2 = 0.13) and first axis for pioneer grasslands (R-2 = 0.49) are more difficult to describe.

However, this is proving to be unfeasible over large areas. The use of remote sensing is increasingly encouraged but covering the full range of ecological variables by such datasets and ensuring compatibility with the traditional assessment methodology has not been achieved yet. We aimed to test Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) as a source for mapping all variables required by the local official conservation status assessment scheme and to develop an automated method that calculates Natura 2000 conservation status at 0.5 m raster resolution for 24 km(2) of Pannonic Salt Steppe habitat (code 1530). We used multi-temporal (summer and winter) ALS point clouds with full-waveform recording and a density of 10 pt/m(2). Some required variables were derived from ALS product rasters; others involved vegetation classification layers calculated by machine learning and fuzzy categorization. Thresholds separating favorable and unfavorable values of each variable required by the national assessment scheme were manually calibrated from 10 plots where field-based assessment was carried out. Rasters representing positive and negative scores for each input variable were integrated in a ruleset that exactly follows the Hungarian Natura 2000 assessment scheme for grasslands. Accuracy of each parameter and the final conservation status score and category was evaluated by 10 independent assessment plots. We conclude that ALS is a suitable data source for Natura 2000 assessments in grasslands, and that the national grassland assessment scheme can successfully be used as a GIS processing model for conservation status, ensuring that the output is directly comparable with traditional field based assessments.

Unique Sequence of Events Triggers Manta Ray Feeding Frenzy in the Southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia	REMOTE SENSING												Manta rays are classified as Vulnerable to Extinction on the IUCN Red List for Threatened Species. In Australia, a key aggregation site for reef manta rays is Lady Elliot Island (LEI) on the Great Barrier Reef, similar to 7 km from the shelf edge. Here, we investigate the environmental processes that triggered the largest manta ray feeding aggregation yet observed in Australia, in early 2013. We use MODIS sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll-a concentration and photic depth data, together with in situ data, to show that anomalous river discharges led to high chlorophyll (anomalies: 10-15 mg center dot m(-3)) and turbid (photic depth anomalies: -15 m) river plumes extending out to LEI, and that these became entrained offshore around the periphery of an active cyclonic eddy. Eddy dynamics led to cold bottom intrusions along the shelf edge (6 degrees C temperature decrease), and at LEI (5 degrees C temperature decrease). Strongest SST gradients (>1 degrees C center dot km(-1)) were at the convergent frontal zone between the shelf and eddy-influenced waters, directly overlying LEI. Here, the front intensified on the spring ebb tide to attract and shape the aggregation pattern of foraging manta rays. Future research could focus on mapping the probability and persistence of these ecologically significant frontal zones via remote sensing to aid the management and conservation of marine species.

Residual dry matter (RDM), the dry grass biomass left on the ground at the end of the grazing season, is a commonly used proxy for rangeland condition in Mediterranean climates. Moderate levels of RDM are correlated with soil stability, forage production, wildlife habitat, and diversity of native plants. Therefore RDM is widely monitored on rangeland conservation properties. Current ground-based methods for RDM monitoring are expensive, are labor intensive, and provide information in the fall, after the effects of grazing have already occurred. In this paper we present a cost-effective, rapid, and robust methodology to monitor and predict RDM using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data. We performed a time series analysis of three MODIS-based vegetation indices (VIs) measured over the period 2000-2012: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR). We examined the correlation between the four VIs and fall RDM measured at The Nature Conservancy's Simon Newman Ranch in central California. We found strong and significant correlations between maximum VI values in late spring and RDM in the fall. Among the VIs, LAI values had the most significant correlation with fall RDM. MODIS-based multivariate models predicted up to 63% of fall RDM. Importantly, maximum and sum VIs values were significantly higher in management units with RDM levels in compliance with RDM conservation easement terms compared with units out of compliance. On the basis of these results, we propose a management model that uses time series analysis of MODIS VIs to predict forage quantities, manage stocking rates, and monitor rangeland easement compliance. This model can be used to improve monitoring of rangeland conservation by providing information on range conditions throughout the year. (C) 2015 Society for Range Management.

These areas have been overlooked in terms of land cover change assessment if compared with efforts in monitoring the Amazon rain forest. For each of the target years (1990, 2000 and 2010) land cover information was obtained through an object-based classification approach for 243 sample units (10 km x 10 km size), using (E)TM Landsat images systematically located at each full degree confluence of latitude and longitude. The images were automatically pre-processed, segmented and labelled according to the following legend: Tree Cover (IC), Tree Cover Mosaic (TCM), Other Wooded Land (OWL), Other Land Cover (OLC) and Water (W). Our results indicate the Cerrado and Caatinga biomes lost (gross loss) respectively 265,595 km(2) and 89,656 km(2) of natural vegetation (TC + OWL) between 1990 and 2010. In the same period, these areas also experienced gain of TC and OWL By 2010, the percentage of natural vegetation cover remaining in the Cerrado was 47% and in the Caatinga 63%. The annual (net) rate of natural vegetation cover loss in the Cerrado slowed down from -0.79% yr(-1) to -0.44% yr(-1) from the 1990s to the 2000s, while in the Caatinga for the same periods the rate increased from -0.19% yr(-1) to -0.44% yr(-1). In summary, these Brazilian biomes experienced both loss and gains of Tree Cover and Other Wooded Land; however a continued net loss of natural vegetation was observed for both biomes between 1990 and 2010. The average annual rate of change in this period was higher in the Cerrado (-0.6% yr(-1)) than in the Caatinga (-0.3% yr(-1)). (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A comparison of traffic estimates of nocturnal flying animals using radar, thermal imaging, and acoustic recording	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												There are several remote-sensing tools readily available for the study of nocturnally flying animals (e.g., migrating birds), each possessing unique measurement biases. We used three tools (weather surveillance radar, thermal infrared camera, and acoustic recorder) to measure temporal and spatial patterns of nocturnal traffic estimates of flying animals during the spring and fall of 2011 and 2012 in Lewes, Delaware, USA. Our objective was to compare measures among different technologies to better understand their animal detection biases. For radar and thermal imaging, the greatest observed traffic rate tended to occur at, or shortly after, evening twilight, whereas for the acoustic recorder, peak bird flight-calling activity was observed just prior to morning twilight. Comparing traffic rates during the night for all seasons, we found that mean nightly correlations between acoustics and the other two tools were weakly correlated (thermal infrared camera and acoustics, r = 0.004 +/- 0.04 SE, n = 100 nights; radar and acoustics, r = 0.14 +/- 0.04 SE, n = 101 nights), but highly variable on an individual nightly basis (range = -0.84 to 0.92, range = -0.73 to 0.94). The mean nightly correlations between traffic rates estimated by radar and by thermal infrared camera during the night were more strongly positively correlated (r = 0.39 +/- 0.04 SE, n = 125 nights), but also were highly variable for individual nights (range = -0.76 to 0.98). Through comparison with radar data among numerous height intervals, we determined that flying animal height above the ground influenced thermal imaging positively and flight call detections negatively. Moreover, thermal imaging detections decreased with the presence of cloud cover and increased with mean ground flight speed of animals, whereas acoustic detections showed no relationship with cloud cover presence but did decrease with increased flight speed. We found sampling methods to be positively correlated when comparing mean nightly traffic rates across nights. The strength of these correlations generally increased throughout the night, peaking 2-3 hours before morning twilight. Given the convergence of measures by different tools at this time, we suggest that researchers consider sampling flight activity in the hours before morning twilight when differences due to detection biases among sampling tools appear to be minimized.

This study discusses the spatio-temporal analysis of forest management activities and land use changes in Yalova Forest Ecosystems, Turkey. We focused on the Yalova City because (a) it is located in a highly urbanized area, northwestern Turkey, (b) forest is a governmental ownership and producing of many non-wood forest product and wildlife species, (c) governmental organizations are encouraged to be decreased clear-cuts to protect forest ecosystems; (d) GIS databases are available in Yalova; (e) Yalova Forestry Administration has a membership of the Mediterranean Model Forest Network in 2011, and (f) many new forest policies will be developed in Turkey after the membership of the model forest . This study used forest management plans of Yalova Forest during 1971-2008 periods and analyzed data in geographic information system (GIS). Results showed that the rate of forest area in the Yalova steadily increased from 53.4 % in 1971 to 61.2 % to 62.5 % between 1994 and 2008 respectively.

Integration of field observation, modeling, and remote sensing are increasingly used to quantify and assess ES at different scales. In this special issue, several comprehensive methodologies and tools are described in the thirteen papers included. The papers are grouped into four categories: modelling and evaluation of carbon and water services of ecosystems, comprehensive analysis and assessment of multiple ESs, integrated ES methodologies for conservation, and development of integrated modeling environments for ESs. We believe that these papers provide both useful methods and tools to simulate and evaluate ESs at different spatial and temporal scales, as well as interesting results from case studies. We also hope that they can provide information for policy makers and managers regarding wiser landscape management and conservation.

Therefore, monitoring and forecasting of land-cover changes are important components for sustainable utilization, conservation, and development of these areas. This research has been conducted on Igneada, a legally protected area on the northwest coast of Turkey, which is famous for its unique, mangrove forests. The main focus of this study was to apply a land use and cover model that could quantitatively and graphically present the changes and its impacts on Igneada landscapes in the future. In this study, a Markov chain-based, stochastic Markov model and cellular automata Markov model were used. These models were calibrated using a time series of developed areas derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery between 1990 and 2010 that also projected future growth to 2030. The results showed that CA Markov yielded reliable information better than St. Markov model. The findings displayed constant but overall slight increase of settlement and forest cover, and slight decrease of agricultural lands. However, even the slightest unsustainable change can put a significant pressure on the sensitive ecosystems of Igneada. Therefore, the management of the protected area should not only focus on the landscape composition but also pay attention to landscape configuration.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				MAR	2015	187	3							59	10.1007/s10661-015-4322-z								WOS:000349434900004	25647805

Extrapolation of in situ data from 1-km squares to adjacent squares using remote sensed imagery and airborne lidar data for the assessment of habitat diversity and extent	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Habitat surveillance and subsequent monitoring at a national level is usually carried out by recording data from in situ sample sites located according to predefined strata. This paper describes the application of remote sensing to the extension of such field data recorded in 1-km squares to adjacent squares, in order to increase sample number without further field visits. Habitats were mapped in eight central squares in northeast Estonia in 2010 using a standardized recording procedure. Around one of the squares, a special study site was established which consisted of the central square and eight surrounding squares. A Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image was used for correlation with in situ data. An airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) vegetation height map was also included in the classification. A series of tests were carried out by including the lidar data and contrasting analytical techniques, which are described in detail in the paper. Training accuracy in the central square varied from 75 to 100 %. In the extrapolation procedure to the surrounding squares, accuracy varied from 53.1 to 63.1 %, which improved by 10 % with the inclusion of lidar data. The reasons for this relatively low classification accuracy were mainly inherent variability in the spectral signatures of habitats but also differences between the dates of imagery acquisition and field sampling. Improvements could therefore be made by better synchronization of the field survey and image acquisition as well as by dividing general habitat categories (GHCs) into units which are more likely to have similar spectral signatures. However, the increase in the number of sample kilometre squares compensates for the loss of accuracy in the measurements of individual squares. The methodology can be applied in other studies as the procedures used are readily available.

Monitoring vegetation change and dynamics on US Army training lands using satellite image time series analysis	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Given the significant land holdings of the U.S. Department of Defense, and the importance of those lands to support a variety of inherently damaging activities, application of sound natural resource conservation principles and proactive monitoring practices are necessary to manage military training lands in a sustainable manner. This study explores a method for, and the utility of, analyzing vegetation condition and trends as sustainability indicators for use by military commanders and land managers, at both the national and local levels, in identifying when and where vegetation-related environmental impacts might exist. The BFAST time series decomposition method was applied to a ten-year MODIS NDVI time series dataset for the Fort Riley military installation and Konza Prairie Biological Station (KPBS) in northeastern Kansas. Imagery selected for time-series analysis were 16-day MODIS NDVI (MOD13Q1 Collection 5) composites capable of characterizing vegetation change induced by human activities and climate variability. Three indicators related to gradual interannual or abrupt intraannual vegetation change for each pixel were calculated from the trend component resulting from the BFAST decomposition. Assessment of gradual interannual NDVI trends showed the majority of Fort Riley experienced browning between 2001 and 2010. This result is supported by validation using high spatial resolution imagery. The observed versus expected frequency of linear trends detected at Fort Riley and KPBS were significantly different and suggest a causal link between military training activities and/or land management practices. While both sites were similar with regards to overall disturbance frequency and the relative spatial extents of monotonic or interrupted trends, vegetation trajectories after disturbance were significantly different. This suggests that the type and magnitude of disturbances characteristic of each location result in distinct post-disturbance vegetation responses. Using a remotely-sensed vegetation index time series with BFAST and the indicators outlined here provides a consistent and relatively rapid assessment of military training lands with applicability outside of grassland biomes. Characterizing overall trends and disturbance responses of vegetation can promote sustainable use of military lands and assist land managers in targeting specific areas for various rehabilitation activities.

J	Wickama, J; Masselink, R; Sterk, G				Wickama, Juma; Masselink, Rens; Sterk, Geert			The effectiveness of soil conservation measures at a landscape scale in the West Usambara highlands, Tanzania	GEODERMA												The adoption of soil and water conservation (SWC) technologies among small holder farmers in the East African highlands is an area which poses many challenges. When adoption occurs across a vast landscape, the locations and effectiveness of the adopted measures are often not adequately known. For this reason, the majority of SWC studies in the highlands of East Africa employed field surveys and experiments to locate and estimate effectiveness of the installed technologies. This approach however has certain limitations when applied at a landscape scale. Potentially, remote sensing techniques could be used for the purpose of locating soil conservation structures, while modeling can help in estimating the effectiveness of the implemented measures. This study therefore employed remote sensing and GIS techniques to 1) to locate SWC structures in two 100 km(2) areas in the West Usambara highlands of Tanzania, and 2) to determine the effectiveness of the implemented measures in reducing soil erosion at a landscape scale. The study was conducted in the west Usambara highlands of north-eastern Tanzania as a paired plot design in which two blocks of 100 km(2) each were studied using pixel (Maximum Likelihood Classification) and object-based image analysis (OBIA) remote sensing techniques to detect land use patterns and adoption of soil conservation technologies. Soil losses were modeled using the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE)-model while effectiveness of the measures was estimated from calculations. Results indicate that there are large differences in the adoption of soil conservation technologies between the two blocks. The study also finds the Maximum Likelihood Classifier to be reliable in generating land use thematic layer maps from which soil conservation measures can be studied with ease in mountainous areas. The OBIA-technique was found to be effective in identifying, classifying and mapping of the adopted SWC technologies. Effectiveness of the installed technologies remained comparable across the blocks but with higher indices for Sunga area. The study concludes that adoption of the SWC technologies in the two blocks is largely influenced by biophysical conditions within and between the two blocks and is not related to the quality of the technologies being implemented in either block.

Biodiversity is depleting very fast due to conversion of forest region into agricultural or other land use. Here comes the role of biodiversity assessment and evaluation of spatial data of species to prioritize the conservation purposes. Traditionally, ground-based plots were used to assess different biodiversity. Later on, remote sensing approaches were also incorporated along with field-based studies to quantify the results accurately. Assessment of biodiversity constitutes estimation of various indices that were obtained using ground-based plot or survey. With the advancement of the remote sensing technology, spatial information about tree species was collected using field sample and satellite data and field sample plots within the Sariska Tiger Reserve. Different diversity indices were calculated like alpha, beta, diversity, and others, i.e., Pilot's index (J), Shannon-Wiener index (SR), Margalef index (E-w), and Whittaker's index (H'). The multistage statistical techniques, which integrate high spatial resolution and spectral characteristics of satellite data (LISS IV), will help in providing precise information about tree species. Regression analysis provides better results to identify forest species among different bands. A positive correlation has been found in the infrared band even negative correlation has been found in other bands. This paper incorporates field-based surveys along with remote sensing technologies using a regression model (r(2) = 0.636) to estimate and recognize different species diversity in Sariska Tiger Reserve.

Towards a general framework for predicting threat status of data-deficient species from phylogenetic, spatial and environmental information	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												In taxon-wide assessments of threat status many species remain not included owing to lack of data. Here, we present a novel spatial-phylogenetic statistical framework that uses a small set of readily available or derivable characteristics, including phylogenetically imputed body mass and remotely sensed human encroachment, to provide initial baseline predictions of threat status for data-deficient species. Applied to assessed mammal species worldwide, the approach effectively identifies threatened species and predicts the geographical variation in threat. For the 483 data-deficient species, the models predict highly elevated threat, with 69% 'at-risk' species in this set, compared with 22% among assessed species. This results in 331 additional potentially threatened mammals, with elevated conservation importance in rodents, bats and shrews, and countries like Colombia, Sulawesi and the Philippines. These findings demonstrate the future potential for combining phylogenies and remotely sensed data with species distributions to identify species and regions of conservation concern.

In this study, we first tested whether life forms are discriminated through leaf level functional traits. We then explored the correlation between leaf-level plant functional traits and spectral reflectance. Location Serra do Cipo National Park, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Methods Six ecophysiological leaf traits were selected to best characterize differences between life forms in the woody plant community of the Cerrado. Results were compared to spectral vegetation indices to determine if plant groups provide means to separate leaf spectral responses. Results Values obtained from leaf traits were similar to results reported from other tropical dry sites. Trees and shrubs significantly differed from lianas in terms of the percentage of leaf water content and Specific Leaf Area. Spectral indices were insufficient to capture the differences of these key traits between groups, though indices were still adequately correlated to overall trait variation. Conclusion The importance of life forms as biochemical and structurally distinctive groups is a significant finding for future remote sensing studies of vegetation, especially in arid and semi-arid environments. The traits we found as indicative of these groups (SLA and water content) are good candidates for spectral characterization. Future studies need to use the full wavelength (400 nm-2500 nm) in order to capture the potential response of these traits. The ecological linkage to water balance and life strategies encourages these traits as starting points for modeling plant communities using hyperspectral remote sensing.

Recent advances in understanding Colombian mangroves	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Throughout the last 15 years, researchers at the National University of Colombia at Medellin have studied Colombian mangroves. Remote sensing, pollen analysis of superficial and deep sediments, Holocene coastal vegetation dynamics, sediment dating using C-14 and Pb-210, sampling in temporary plots, sampling in temporary and permanent plots, and other techniques have been applied to elucidate long- and shortterm mangrove community dynamics. The studied root fouling community is structured by several regulatory mechanisms; habitat heterogeneity increases species richness and abundance. Fringe mangroves were related to Ca concentration in the soil and the increased dominance of Laguncularia racemosa and other nonmangrove tree species, while the riverine mangroves were associated with Mg concentration and the dominance of Rhizophora mangle. The seedling and mangrove tree distributions are determined by a complex gradient of natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Mangrove pollen from surface sediments and the existing vegetation and geomorphology are close interrelated. Plant pollen of mangrove and salt marsh reflects environmental and disturbance conditions, and also reveals forest types. Forest dynamics in both coasts and their sensitivity of to anthropogenic processes are well documented in the Late Quaternary fossil record. Our studies of short and long term allow us to predict the dynamics of mangroves under different scenarios of climate change and anthropogenic stress factors that are operating in Colombian coasts. Future research arises from these results on mangrove forests dynamics, sea-level rise at a fine scale using palynology, conservation biology, and carbon dynamics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The present study is focused on the identification of suitable sites for locating water harvesting structures using morphometric analysis and multi-criteria based decision support system. The Hathmati watershed of river Hathmati at Idar taluka, Sabarkantha district, Gujarat is experiencing excessive runoff and soil erosion due to high intensity rainfall. Earth observation dataset such as Digital Elevation Model and Geographic Information System are used in this study to determine the quantitative description of the basin geometry. Several morphometric parameters such as stream length, elongation ratio, bifurcation ratio, drainage density, stream frequency, texture ratio, form factor, circularity ratio, and compactness coefficient are taken into account for prioritization of Hathmati watershed. The overall analysis reveals that Hathmati comprises of 13 mini-watersheds out of which, the watershed number 2 is of utmost priority because it has the highest degradation possibilities. The final results are used to locate the sites suitable for water harvesting structures using geo-visualization technique. After all the analyses, the best possibilities of check dams in the mini-watersheds that can be used for soil and water conservation in the watershed are presented.

We proposed the first biophysical environmental delineation of the SBS using globally available satellite remote sensing and model-assimilated data to categorize this area into unique and meaningful biophysical classes. Specifically, the SBS was partitioned into eight biophysical classes characterized by similar sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, currents, and salinity patterns. Areas within each class were expected to have similar habitat types and ecosystem functions. Our work supplemented prevailing global marine management schemes by focusing in on a regional scale with finer spatial resolution. It also provided a baseline for academic research, ecological assessments and will facilitate marine spatial planning and conservation activities in the area. In addition, the framework and methods of delineating biophysical environments we presented can be expanded throughout the whole Coral Triangle to support research and conservation activities in this important region.

The methods of studying temporal changes of these landscape qualities are also explored with a short overview of landscape-structure change evaluation and its relevance for functional aspects. As an example of rather thoroughly studied material fluxes the issue of influence of the landscape spatial structure and water quality indicators is described in more detail. A review of available literature shows that whereas the material fluxes have established an almost traditional theme, growing attention is especially paid to energy fluxes studied by means of remote sensing and information flow studies represented by a perspective discipline of landscape genetics. Nevertheless, the challenges for further development lie namely in combined studies of more processes acting in a concrete landscape at one moment; in temporal studies there is a certain lack of long-term datasets exceeding at least some decades, which would be essential to observe landscape processes especially within the context of global climatic changes.

This study uses multitemporal PALSAR L-band radar imagery combined with object-based image analysis, data mining techniques and field data to derive vegetation structure and inundation patterns and characterize major vegetation types in varzea forests of the Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve. Our results show that the combination of vegetation cover and inundation extent information can be a good indicator of the complex gradient of habitats along the floodplain. The intersection between vegetation and flood duration classes showed a wider range of combinations than suggested from field based studies. Chavascal areas-chacaracterized as a dense and species-poor shrub/tree community developing in old depressions, abandoned channels, and shallow lakes-had shorter inundation periods than the usually recognized hydroperiod of 180-240 days of flooding, while low varzea-a diverse community that have fewest and smallest species, and highest individual density and that tolerate 120-180 days of flooding every year-was distributed between flood duration ranges that were higher than reported by the literature. Forest communities growing at sites that were never mapped as flooded could indicate areas that only flood during extreme hydrological events, for short periods of time. Our results emphasize the potential contribution of SAR remote sensing to the monitoring and management of wetland environments, providing not only accurate information on spatial landscape configuration and vegetation distribution, but also important insights on the ecohydrological processes that ultimately determine the distribution of complex floodplain habitat mosaics.

Free and open-access satellite data are key to biodiversity conservation	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Satellite remote sensing is an important tool for monitoring the status of biodiversity and associated environmental parameters, including certain elements of habitats. However, satellite data are currently underused within the biodiversity research and conservation communities. Three factors have significant impact on the utility of remote sensing data for tracking and understanding biodiversity change. They are its continuity, affordability, and access. Data continuity relates to the maintenance of long-term satellite data products. Such products promote knowledge of how biodiversity has changed over time and why. Data affordability arises from the cost of the imagery. New data policies promoting free and open access to government satellite imagery are expanding the use of certain imagery but the number of free and open data sets remains too limited. Data access addresses the ability of conservation biologists and biodiversity researchers to discover, retrieve, manipulate, and extract value from satellite imagery as well as link it with other types of information. Tools are rapidly improving access. Still, more cross-community interactions are necessary to strengthen ties between the biodiversity and remote sensing communities.

Remote sensing change detection for ecological monitoring in United States protected areas	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Remote sensing allows for cost- and time-efficient monitoring of landscapes vital to the conservation of natural resources, ecosystems, and biodiversity. This review synthesizes and recommends best practice change detection methods for land management groups to monitor chief ecological change indicators currently monitored in United States protected areas. The indicators frequently monitored via change detection and reviewed here include: land use/land cover, disturbance, and phenology. Landsat data products are recommended for monitoring land use/land cover and disturbance, due to their continuous data accessibility free of cost since 1972. Data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) are recommended for monitoring changes in phenology due to its 1-2 day return, interval at any given location. Best-practice remote sensing methods are stressed, such as careful validation of results, either by combination of remotely sensed datasets with high resolution imagery or in situ data, in order to increase accuracy and to better align the remotely sensed data to the scale of the on-the-ground processes. Reported results should always be presented with utmost clarity in a manner that is both applicable to managers and understood by the general public. Increased collaborations between ecologists, land managers, conservation groups, and scientists are compulsory for successful integration of remote sensing-based monitoting, which is vital for effective conservation in protected areas. Remote sensing change detection quantifies the effects of humans on a landscape scale without creating further disturbances to ecologically sensitive areas; the results of which can be used for efficient conservation management into the future.

Mangrove shrimp farm mapping and productivity on the Brazilian Amazon coast: Environmental and economic reasons for coastal conservation	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												The present study evaluates the role of marine aquaculture in the conversion of mangrove forests into shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei, Boone, 1931) farms using remote sensing and geographic information system techniques and analyzes the productivity of the installed farms in the mangroves and adjacent coastal plateau. The extension of the shrimp ponds was quantified using satellite image analysis, and the water quality of the shrimp farms was analyzed based on measurements of dissolved oxygen concentration, temperature, pH, and salinity. The productivity of the farms was measured using biometric data. The data were analyzed using ANOVA with Tukey's post-test. The results indicated that shrimp farms cover an area of similar to 0.8 km(2) (approximately 0.4% of Brazilian ponds), of which 29.4% are located within areas of mangroves, and 70.6% are located in the coastal plateau. Saltwater aquaculture contributed to the conversion of 0.53 km(2) of the mangroves into rearing ponds, which represents only 0.007% of the total area of the Amazonian mangroves. The installations in the mangrove presented significantly higher pH, temperature, transparency, and salinity compared with the ponds installed in the coastal plateau, although coastal plateau ponds had higher dissolved oxygen concentrations. Based on these differences, the mean sizes of the shrimp raised in the mangrove and coastal plateau ponds were 5.7 g and 4.3 g, respectively. However, the estimated value of one hectare of mangrove is much higher than its potential value in the production of shrimp. The considerable value of the ecosystem services provided by the mangroves indicates that the production of shrimp in the coastal plateau is relatively less damaging in ecological and economic terms. Thus, we can consider that the production of shrimp in the coastal plateau instead of in mangrove areas is less damaging to the long-term conservation of mangrove forests, which follows the management best practices established by international organizations. The coastal zone is considered a common resource that belongs to all citizens in Iberoamerican countries, and it is defined as a zone of non-building. Therefore, we conclude that mangroves are more valuable intact than converted into aquaculture ponds. Hence, aquaculture activities in the Amazon coastal plain are not sustainable from environmental and socioeconomic perspectives. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Transition from heathland to scrub in south-eastern Tasmania: extent of change since the 1970s, floristic depletion and management implications	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Heathland is a speciose and floriferous vegetation type, defined by its stature (< 2 m) and dominance by scleromorphic shrubs. Heathland has been in decline globally, and much of its loss has been due to less frequent fire, while in some places more frequent fire has resulted in degradation through the loss of obligate seeding species. The aims of the present study were to determine: (1) the extent of the transition from heathland to scrub in south-eastern Tasmania, Australia between c1976 and 2013; (2) the spatial attributes of heathland that are likely to have been the most instrumental in heathland loss; (3) whether the transition to scrub resulted in the loss of local species richness and changed species composition when taking both above ground vegetation and the soil seed bank into account; and (4) the implications of the answers to the first three questions for heathland management. Changes in heathland and scrub extent were mapped from remote sensing imagery and ground truthing. At one locality with floristic data from the heathland of 1976, the scrub that has replaced the heathland was surveyed and soil collected to determine seed banks under heating and non-heating treatments. Approximately one third of the 1976 heathland had become scrub by 2013, mostly around the margins of heathland patches and near built up areas. Twenty-two species present in 1976 were not found in either the scrub or seed bank, with only three species absent from the scrub, but present in the 1976 heath, being found in the seed bank. The species composition of germinates in the unheated treatment was dominated by taxa that colonise mechanically disturbed areas, such as Juncus, while germinates in the heat treated soils were largely scleromorphic heath species. The depletion of species richness by the transition to scrub, and the large extent of its incidence, suggest that a higher frequency of planned fire is needed in south-eastern Tasmania.				iDiv, Deutsches Zentrum/B-5164-2016													0960-3115	1572-9710				FEB	2015	24	2					213	228		10.1007/s10531-014-0803-6								WOS:000348114700001

Coupled analysis on landscape pattern and hydrological processes in Yanhe watershed of China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												As a typical experimental Soil and Water Conservation District, Yanhe watershed has long been plagued by soil erosion due to severe human disturbances. Exerting remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) technology, this paper firstly analyzed and simulated ecological hydrological process in Yanhe watershed based on SWAT model, constructed a comprehensive landscape indices which was closely related to soil erosion, and reflected the coupling relationship between regional landscape pattern change and soil erosion. The results are as follows: (1) Areas of different land use types remained relatively stable from 1990 to 2000 and then changed drastically from 2000 to 2010, which was characterized by lawn expansion and cultivated land shrinkage. (2) In terms of the spatial heterogeneity of hydrological response unit (HRUs), the correlation coefficient of seven selected landscape indices and runoff was very small, and cannot pass all significant testing. But correlation between the indices and sediment yield except for Total Core Area (TCA) and Interspersion and Juxtaposition Index (IJI) was remarkable. (3) According to 'the source-sink' theory of soil erosion, new landscape index slope-HRU landscape index (SHLI) was built, and reflected the relationship between landscape pattern and soil erosion processes to a certain extent. (4) Coupling relationship between SHLI in 2010 and annual sediment was very prominent. In the sub-basin scale, SHLI has obvious regional differentiation from annual sediment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Watson, FGR; Becker, MS; Milanzi, J; Nyirenda, M				Watson, Fred G. R.; Becker, Matthew S.; Milanzi, James; Nyirenda, Moses			Human encroachment into protected area networks in Zambia: implications for large carnivore conservation	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												Large carnivores are declining globally, with strong direct and indirect ecological impacts on protected area networks (PANs). Human encroachment on ecosystems is a global threat for large carnivores, particularly in savanna Africa, where increasing human resource demands continue to degrade the connectivity and viability PANs. Zambia has a regionally significant role in large carnivore conservation, given that it borders eight countries, includes three transfrontier conservation areas (TFCAs), and manages nearly 40 % of its land for wildlife. Deforestation in general and encroachment in particular are recognized problems in Zambian natural resource management. However, specific impacts on PANs are poorly understood owing to a lack of adequate mapping of encroachment, deriving from widespread difficulty in mapping cultivation and clearing in fire-prone savannas, and severe inaccuracy in several previous land cover data sets. Using simple manual interpretation of diverse and carefully chosen remote sensing imagery, we evaluated land use change from 1965 to 2011 in Zambia, primarily in the Luangwa Valley. We found widespread encroachment extending toward national parks from major roads as fast as 2 km/year and averaging 18 hectares per hour of daylight throughout a 159,805 km(2) study area, eliminating designated buffer zones in some areas, decreasing connectivity, and potentially eliminating viable TFCAs. At current rates, Zambia's PANs would be expected to be reduced into small isolated pockets primarily centered on national parks, with substantial human edge effects threatening the viability of wildlife populations in the region, particularly wide-ranging, low density, and threatened large carnivores such as African wild dogs, cheetah, and lion. It is thus critical that encroachment is accurately mapped across the entire region and that land use plans are developed, implemented, revised where necessary, and enforced with strong governmental support, enabling protection of these areas and the communities that depend upon them.																	1436-3798	1436-378X				FEB	2015	15	2					415	429		10.1007/s10113-014-0629-5								WOS:000347705300017

A case study with Great Bustard (Otis tarda)	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												AimSpecies distribution modelling (SDM) allows identification of suitable areas where the species might occur. The Grinnellian approach relates species occurrence to abiotic limiting factors, such as topography and climate, measured at present or averaged over time at large spatial scales, whilst Eltonian approaches relate processes as reproductive rates or species abundance to factors as resource availability or functional traits described at a finer spatio-temporal resolution. In this study, we aimed to compare the performance and reliability achieved by Eltonian and Grinnellian models developed at geographical scale when addressing two questions that may affect species distribution: breeding site selection and historical local extinctions. LocationSpain. MethodsWe used a temporal series (1988-2010) of breeding success data of Great Bustards (Otis tarda) across Spain to create: (1) a yearly series of correlative Eltonian models based on satellite data (1-km pixel Normalized Difference Vegetation Index derived from NOAA-AVHRR) as a proxy for resource availability and (2) a static topo-climatic Grinnellian model. We applied two modelling algorithms (MaxEnt and Bootstrapped Generalized Mixed-Effects Models) calibrated and validated across different distributional ranges to investigate breeding success in abiotically suitable areas and recent extinctions within the accessible range. ResultsEltonian models showed higher performance and reliability than Grinnellian models at geographical scale and allowed for comparisons of breeding habitat suitability through the study period. Then, satellite data were a more successful predictor of the species breeding success than topography and climate. Breeding was possible out of the range currently occupied by the species, but habitat suitability was significantly lower in non-occupied areas, on where local extinctions have occurred in recent historical times. Main conclusionsThis study highlights the advisability of using remote-sensing explanatory variables at high temporal resolution matched with population fitness data in Eltonian approaches to improve the knowledge of the relationship between realized and potential distributions of the species at geographical scale. This is a fundamental question in biogeography and a key issue for designing comprehensive conservation strategies.

Possessing vast amounts of coal deposits, the Waterberg region of the Limpopo Province is set to undergo rapid transformation as new power stations and coal mines are built, expected to exacerbate water shortages. Detailed baseline information to assess future impacts on key plant species is lacking compromising biodiversity conservation efforts in a region where eco - tourism is a major source of livelihood. In this study we evaluated the spatio - temporal distribution plant status during wet and dry seasons using two measures of plant stress namely the midday leaf water potential (LWP), and leaf nitrogen (N) concentrations. At leaf level, spectral indices such as the moisture stress index (MSI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and the water index (WI) predicted more than 70% of LWP variation using leaf reflectance data. At landscape level, red edge based simple ratio indices were selected for mapping leaf water potential and leaf N for wet and dry season using RapidEye data. We conclude that remote sensing images can be applied for the long term vegetation monitoring for future biodiversity conservation efforts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These forests provide important ecosystem goods and services to the region's dense coastal populations and support important functions of the biosphere. Mangroves are under threat from both natural and anthropogenic stressors; however the current status and dynamics of the region's mangroves are poorly understood. We mapped the current extent of mangrove forests in South Asia and identified mangrove forest cover change (gain and loss) from 2000 to 2012 using Landsat satellite data. We also conducted three case studies in Indus Delta (Pakistan), Goa (India), and Sundarbans (Bangladesh and India) to identify rates, patterns, and causes of change in greater spatial and thematic details compared to regional assessment of mangrove forests. Our findings revealed that the areal extent of mangrove forests in South Asia is approximately 1,187,476 ha representing similar to 7% of the global total. Our results showed that from 2000 to 2012, 92,135 ha of mangroves were deforested and 80,461 ha were reforested with a net loss of 11,673 ha. In all three case studies, mangrove areas have remained the same or increased slightly, however, the turnover was greater than the net change. Both, natural and anthropogenic factors are responsible for the change and turnover. The major causes of forest cover change are similar throughout the region; however, specific factors may be dominant in specific areas. Major causes of deforestation in South Asia include (i) conversion to other land use (e.g. conversion to agriculture, shrimp farms, development, and human settlement), (ii) over-harvesting (e.g. grazing, browsing and lopping, and fishing), (iii) pollution, (iv) decline in freshwater availability, (v) floodings, (vi) reduction of silt deposition, (vii) coastal erosion, and (viii) disturbances from tropical cyclones and tsunamis. Our analysis in the region's diverse socio-economic and environmental conditions highlights complex patterns of mangrove distribution and change. Results from this study provide important insight to the conservation and management of the important and threatened South Asian mangrove ecosystem.

J	Garg, JK				Garg, J. K.			Wetland assessment, monitoring and management in India using geospatial techniques	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Satellite remote sensing and GIS have emerged as the most powerful tools for inventorying, monitoring and management of natural resources and environment. In the special context of wetland ecosystems, remotely sensed data from orbital platforms have been extensively used in India for the inventory, monitoring and preparation of action plans for conservation and management. First scientific inventory of wetlands in India was carried out in 1998 by Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad using indigenous IRS (Indian Remote Sensing Satellite) data of 1992-93 timeframe, which stimulated extensive use of geospatial techniques for wetland conservation and management. Subsequently, with advances in GIS, studies were carried out for development of Wetland Information System for a state (West Bengal) and for Loktak lake wetland (a Ramsar site) as a prelude to National Wetland Information System. Research has also been carried out for preparation of action plans especially for Ramsar sites in the country. In a novel research, use of the geospatial technology has also been demonstrated for biodiversity conservation using landscape ecological metrics. A country-wide estimate of emission of methane, a Green House Gas, from wetlands has also been made using MODIS data.

The generation of 3D information with physical and functional characteristics is now possible through the connection of survey data with Historical Building Information Modeling (HBIM). However, few studies have focused on the semantic enrichment process of models based on point clouds, especially on the field of cultural heritage. These singularities make the conversion of point cloud to "as-built" HBIM an expensive process from the mathematical and computational viewpoint. At present, there is no software that guarantees automatic and efficient data conversion in architectural or urban contexts. The ongoing research "Documenting and Visualizing Industrial Heritage" is conducted by the School of Architecture, Tampere University of Technology, Finland based on an Open Notebook Reserarch Model. It is focused on advance the knowledge of digital operating environments for the representation and management of historical buildings and sites. On the one hand, the research is advancing in three-dimensional "as-built" modeling based on remote sensing data, while on the other hand is aiming to incorporate more qualitative information based on concepts of production and management in the Iifecycle of the built environment. The purpose of this presentation is to discuss the different approaches to date on the HBIM generation chain: from 3D point cloud data collection to semantically enriched parametric models.																			978-1-5090-0048-7				2015							207	208										WOS:000386557900046

ESTIMATION OF GRASSLAND USE INTENSITIES BASED ON HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION LAI TIME SERIES	36TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				36th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment	MAY 11-15, 2015	Berlin, GERMANY					The identification and surveillance of agricultural management and the measurement of biophysical canopy parameters in grasslands is relevant for environmental protection as well as for political and economic reasons, as proper grassland management is partly subsidized. An ideal monitoring tool is remote sensing due to its area wide continuous observations. However, due to small-scaled land use patterns in many parts of central Europe, a high spatial resolution is needed. In this study, the feasibility of RapidEye data to derive leaf area index (LAI) time series and to relate them to grassland management practices is assessed. The study area is the catchment of river Ammer in southern Bavaria, where agricultural areas are mainly grasslands. While extensively managed grasslands are maintained with one to two harvests per year and no or little fertilization, intensive cultivation practices compass three to five harvests per year and turnover pasturing. Based on a RapidEye time series from 2011 with spatial resolution of 6.5 meters, LAI is derived using the inverted radiation transfer model PROSAIL. The LAI in this area ranges from 1.5 to 7.5 over the vegetation period and is estimated with an RMSE between 0.7 and 1.1. The derived LAI maps cover 85 % of the study area's grasslands at least seven times. Using statistical metrics of the LAI time series, different grassland management types can be identified: very intensively managed meadows, intensively managed meadows, intensively managed pastures, and extensively managed meadows and moor. However, a precise identification of the mowing dates highly depends on the coincidence with satellite data acquisitions. Further analysis should focus therefor on the selection of the temporal resolution of the time series as well as on the performance of further vegetation parameters and indices compared to LAI.																	2194-9034						2015	47	W3					285	291		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-7-W3-285-2015								WOS:000380531900043

USING ALOS PALSAR AND MODIS IMAGERY	36TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				36th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment	MAY 11-15, 2015	Berlin, GERMANY					Wetlands regulate the flow of water and play a key role in risk management of extreme flooding and drought. In Colombia, wetland conservation has been a priority for the government. However, there is an information gap neither an inventory nor a national baseline map exists. In this paper, we present a method that combines a wetlands thematic map with remote sensing derived data, and hydrometeorological stations data in order to characterize the Colombian wetlands. Following the adopted definition of wetlands, available spatial data on land forms, soils and vegetation was integrated in order to characterize spatially the occurrence of wetlands. This data was then complemented with remote sensing derived data from active and passive sensors. A flood frequency map derived from dense time series analysis of the ALOS PALSAR FBD /FBS data (2007-2010) at 50m resolution was used to analyse the recurrence of flooding. In this map, flooding under the canopy and open water classes could be mapped due to the capabilities of the L-band radar. In addition, MODIS NDVI profiles (2007-2012) were used to characterize temporally water mirrors and vegetation, founding different patterns at basin levels. Moreover, the Colombian main basins were analysed and typified based on hydroperiods, highlighting different hydrological regimes within each basin. The combination of thematic maps, SAR data, optical imagery and hydrological data provided information on the spatial and temporal dynamics of wetlands at regional scales. Our results provide the first validated baseline wetland map for Colombia, this way providing valuable information for ecosystem management.																	2194-9034						2015	47	W3					375	382		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-7-W3-375-2015								WOS:000380531900055

GLOBIL: WWF'S GLOBAL OBSERVATION AND BIODIVERSITY INFORMATION PORTAL	36TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				36th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment	MAY 11-15, 2015	Berlin, GERMANY					Despite ever increasing availability of satellite imagery and spatial data, conservation managers, decision makers and planners are often unable to analyze data without special knowledge or software. WWF is bridging this gap by putting extensive spatial data into an easy to use online mapping environment, to allow visualization, manipulation and analysis of large data sets by any user. Consistent, reliable and repeatable ecosystem monitoring information for priority eco-regions is needed to increase transparency in WWF's global conservation work, to measure conservation impact, and to provide communications with the general public and organization members. Currently, much of this monitoring and evaluation data is isolated, incompatible, or inaccessible and not readily usable or available for those without specialized software or knowledge. Launched in 2013 by WWF Netherlands and WWF Germany, the Global Observation and Biodiversity Information Portal (GLOBIL) is WWF's new platform to unite, centralize, standardize and visualize geo-spatial data and information from more than 150 active GIS users worldwide via cloud-based ArcGIS Online. GLOBIL is increasing transparency, providing baseline data for monitoring and evaluation while communicating impacts and conservation successes to the public. GLOBIL is currently being used in the worldwide marine campaign as an advocacy tool for establishing more marine protected areas, and a monitoring interface to track the progress towards ocean protection goals. In the Kavango-Zambezi (KAZA) Transfrontier Conservation area, local partners are using the platform to monitor land cover changes, barriers to species migrations, potential human-wildlife conflict and local conservation impacts in vast wildlife corridor. In East Africa, an early warning system is providing conservation practitioners with real-time alerts of threats particularly to protected areas and World Heritage Sites by industrial extractive activities. And for globally consistent baseline ecosystem monitoring, MODIS-derived data are being combined with local information to provide visible advocacy for conservation. As GLOBIL is built up through the WWF network, the worldwide organization is able to provide open access to its data on biodiversity and remote sensing, spatial analysis and projects to support goal setting, monitoring and evaluation, and fundraising activities.																	2194-9034						2015	47	W3					511	514		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-7-W3-511-2015								WOS:000380531900074

NEW METHODS IN ACQUISITION, UPDATE AND DISSEMINATION OF NATURE CONSERVATION GEODATA - IMPLEMENTATION OF AN INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK	36TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				36th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment	MAY 11-15, 2015	Berlin, GERMANY					Within the framework of this project methods are being tested and implemented a) to introduce remote sensing based approaches into the existing process of biotope mapping and b) to develop a framework serving the multiple requirements arising from different users' backgrounds and thus the need for comprehensive data interoperability. Therefore state-wide high resolution land cover vector-data have been generated in an automated object oriented workflow based on aerial imagery and a normalised digital surface models. These data have been enriched by an extensive characterisation of the individual objects by e.g. site specific, contextual or spectral parameters utilising multitemporal satellite images, DEM-derivatives and multiple relevant geo-data. Parameters are tested on relevance in regard to the classification process using different data mining approaches and have been used to formalise categories of the European nature information system (EUNIS) in a semantic framework. The Classification will be realised by ontology-based reasoning. Dissemination and storage of data is developed fully INSPIRE-compatible and facilitated via a web portal. Main objectives of the project are a) maximum exploitation of existing "standard" data provided by state authorities, b) combination of these data with satellite imagery (Copernicus), c) create land cover objects and achieve data interoperability through low number of classes but comprehensive characterisation and d) implement algorithms and methods suitable for automated processing on large scales.																	2194-9034						2015	47	W3					707	712		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-7-W3-707-2015								WOS:000380531900105

Meanwhile, the amount of soil erosion is estimated using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) model. Furthermore, the spatial distribution characteristics were also analyzed with the application of GIS in the view of elevation, slope and land use types. The results also showed that the soil erosion modulus was 64.68t/(hm(2) a), which belonged to the grade of intensity erosion, and a erodible area of 1404.279km(2)(61.12% of the whole area). The results also revealed that soil erosion, especially soil erosion with high grade, mostly distributed in the following areas, that is elevation area from 2000 to 2500 meters, slope area from 25 to 45 degree, and unused land. The findings from the study are valuable for the soil erosion control and decision-making for the ErHai Lake Basin.																	2161-024X						2015																		WOS:000381472200039						
S	Yang, C; Wang, JL			IEEE	Yang Chao; Wang Jin-ling			Based on the Support Vector Machine for LUCC Research in Binchuan of Yunnan Province	2015 23RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GEOINFORMATICS	International Conference on Geoinformatics				23rd International Conference on Geoinformatics (Geoinformatics)	JUN 19-21, 2015	China Univ Geosciences, Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA	Int Assoc Chinese Profess Geogr Informat Sci, China Univ Geosciences, Natl Engn ResCtr Geogr Informat Sci, Ind Alliance Technol Innovat Strategy Geog Informat Syst, Chinese Soc Surveying Mapping & Geoinformat, China Assoc Geog Informat Serv, China Informat Assoc, Nat Resources & Geospatial lnformat Comm, Wuhan Zondy Cyber Grp Co Ltd	China Univ Geosciences			Land use and cover change is the focus of environmental change research. We used the support vector machine classification method to extract the years 1995 Landsat TM, 2000 and 2005 LandsatETM+, and 2013 LandsatOLI four remote sensing data's LUCC types and evaluate the accuracy of extraction. Finally, use of land use transfer matrix system quantitatively described, simultaneous analysis of the area of LUCC spatial and temporal dynamic characteristics and the factors of driving force, in order to protect the valuable forest resources and continuing effective use land resources of Binchuan to provide a scientific basis for decision making. The result indicate that: the SVM classification method overall accuracy was 89.23, with a kappa coefficient greater than 0.7. From 1995 to 2013, rural and mining residential land generally increased, except 2000, and reaching the maximum in 2013, which is almost double than in 1995. This permits Binchuan, which for nearly 20 years, has always been committed to the city and rural development. The most obvious conversion land use types were unused land and cultivated land, with cultivated land showing a clear decreasing trend, and majority of conversions were to rural and mining residential land, and unused land mostly converted to grassland and rural and mining residential land. For woodland, it experienced an initial increase, then decrease, and then finally increased procedure. However the increase of woodland area is not large (it remained in stable condition), and this proved Binchuan has an emphasis on the protection of forest resources. The water area from 1995 to 2000 years showed a substantial reduction, but in the subsequent 10 years has rebounded. However water resources is still relatively scarce, suggesting the Government to strengthen the construction of water conservancy facilities and soil and water conservation and related work. The LUCC drivers of Binchuan are complex, but the human factor is the main driving factor, rapid population growth, and high-speed economic development are the fundamental factors that led to the massive building occupants, so there is a large number of rural and mining residential land.																	2161-024X						2015																		WOS:000381472200071

This work focuses on locating populations of an endemic shrub of the Canary Islands that grows in Teide National Park: the Teide broom. The objective is to determine automatically the location of this species in order to facilitate conservation efforts. For this purpose, a methodology is presented based on image analysis by using superpixels as the minimum image processing unit, combined with one-class classification. The proposed scheme has been analyzed by applying it to an area located at the northwest of the Teide National Park where the existence of populations of this shrub was known a priori.

Advances in Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technologies have enabled remote sensing-based studies of vegetation canopies by capturing three-dimensional structures, yielding information not available in two-dimensional images of the landscape provided by traditional multi-spectral remote sensing platforms. However, the large volume data sets produced by airborne LiDAR instruments pose a significant computational challenge, requiring algorithms to identify and analyze patterns of interest buried within LiDAR point clouds in a computationally efficient manner, utilizing state-of-art computing infrastructure. We developed and applied a computationally efficient approach to analyze a large volume of LiDAR data and characterized the vegetation canopy structures for 139,859 hectares (540 sq. miles) in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. This study helps improve our understanding of the distribution of vegetation and animal habitats in this extremely diverse ecosystem.

Using photo-realistic and accurate 3D models, the current conservation state can be shown and preserve for future generations. But despite the large request of 3D models in the CH field, there is no 3D documentation method which can properly satisfy all the areas with their requirements, therefore a fusion methodology (of data and sensors) is normally required and performed. The paper analyzes the fusion concept and levels as well as some merging approaches so far presented in the research community. While the paper will be necessarily incomplete due to space limitations, it will hopefully give an understanding on the actual methods of data fusion and clarify some open research issues.																	2194-9034						2015	45	W7					359	363		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-5-W7-359-2015								WOS:000380437800055

USING REMOTE SENSING TECHNOLOGY ON THE DELIMITATION OF THE CONSERVATION AREA FOR THE JIANAN IRRIGATION SYSTEM CULTURAL LANDSCAPE	25TH INTERNATIONAL CIPA SYMPOSIUM 2015	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				25th International CIPA Symposium	AUG 31-SEP 04, 2015	Taipei, TAIWAN					In recent years the cultural landscape has become an important issue for cultural heritages throughout the world. It represents the "combined works of nature and of man" designated in Article 1 of the World Heritage Convention. When a landscape has a cultural heritage value, important features should be marked and mapped through the delimitation of a conservation area, which may be essential for further conservation work. However, a cultural landscape's spatial area is usually wider than the ordinary architectural type of cultural heritage, since various elements and impact factors, forming the cultural landscape's character, lie within a wide geographic area. It is argued that the conservation of a cultural landscape may be influenced by the delimitation of the conservation area, the corresponding land management measures, the limits and encouragements. The Jianan Irrigation System, an historical cultural landscape in southern Taiwan, was registered as a living cultural heritage site in 2009. However, the system's conservation should not be limited to just only the reservoir or canals, but expanded to irrigated areas where farmland may be the most relevant. Through the analysis process, only approximately 42,000 hectares was defined as a conservation area, but closely related to agricultural plantations and irrigated by the system. This is only half of the 1977 irrigated area due to urban sprawl and continuous industrial expansion.																	2194-9034						2015	45	W7					443	448		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-5-W7-443-2015								WOS:000380437800067

While these sites have a universal cultural value, they do not receive due attention and are vulnerable to destruction. This paper presents an initiative on one of these sites, to establish a methodology for documenting Kurdish rocky monuments: Kal'a Akre, also known as Akre Citadel, is a formidable fortress built on the top of a mountain during the Neo-Late Assyrian period, characterized by a network of caves, tunnels and rooms, all carved out of rock. Continuously inhabited as an administrative and military headquarter until the middle-late Islamic period, it is today the most prominent landmark of the surrounding hill town. Although this site is unique for its highly engineered construction technique, no scholarly studies have been carried out. The established methodology for documenting and assessing rocky monuments identifies physical features, actual condition and accessibility as well as their authenticity and integrity, both at the architectural scale and scale of territory. For documenting Kal'a Akre, the application of Geographical Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing and laser measuring device, together with traditional historic research tools, are utilized. The documentation process includes recording location GPS points for dimensioning the structure and creating a 2D surface and a detailed database, using ArcGIS and high resolution satellite images. This will effectively support the work of heritage conservation professionals and is an indispensable platform for proposing the Akre citadel for the 2016 World Monuments Fund Endangered Site List.																			978-88-6542-416-2				2015	56						1748	1757										WOS:000380548200198

Erosion is defined as the movement of soil by water and wind, and it occurs in Kallar watershed under a wide range of land uses. Erosion by water can be dramatic during storm events, resulting in wash-outs and gullies. It can also be insidious, occurring as sheet and rill erosion during heavy rains. Most of the soil lost by water erosion is by the processes of sheet and rill erosion. Land degradation and subsequent soil erosion and sedimentation play a significant role in impairing water resources within sub watersheds, watersheds and basins. Using conventional methods to assess soil erosion risk is expensive and time consuming. A comprehensive methodology that integrates Remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), coupled with the use of an empirical model (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation-RUSLE) to assess risk, can identify and assess soil erosion potential and estimate the value of soil loss. GIS data layers including, rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodability (K), slope length and steepness (LS), cover management (C) and conservation practice (P) factors were computed to determine their effects on average annual soil loss in the study area. The final map of annual soil erosion shows a maximum soil loss of 398.58 t/h(-1)/y(-1). Based on the result soil erosion was classified in to soil erosion severity map with five classes, very low, low, moderate, high and critical respectively. Further RUSLE factors has been broken into two categories, soil erosion susceptibility (A=RKLS), and soil erosion hazard (A=RKLSCP) have been computed. It is understood that functions of C and P are factors that can be controlled and thus can greatly reduce soil loss through management and conservational measures.

Due to the limitations on the anthropogenic activities that are generally associated with these tools, it is important to determine their efficiency in order to justify and/or modify their operation. This study evaluates the effect of the management of the "El Palmar" state reserve, which was established 23 years ago, by comparing the landscape characteristics of the mangrove forest of the Natural Protected Area (NPA) and the adjacent area that has no historical conservation status. A Geographic Information System (GIS) was used, as well as remote sensing techniques, based on the hierarchical analysis of quantitative characteristics of the habitat, the spectral similarity, contextual edition and the supervised classification of a multispectral Spot 5 image, to compare the area, fragmentation and compactness of ten types of mangrove habitats between the NPA and the adjacent area. The contrasted regions present the same general fragmentation pattern (p>0.05). However, when comparing the types of habitat, significant differences were observed (p<0.05) in the fragmentation, the area and the compactness of certain types of habitat. The observed differences do not indicate a clear effect of the protected area management strategies in the structure of the landscape and are possibly more related to the local conditions, ecological processes, and the natural and/or anthropogenic disturbances.

S	Zhang, LQ; Yuan, L; Huang, HM		Zhang, J		Zhang, Liquan; Yuan, Lin; Huang, Huamei			Coastal Wetlands in the Changjiang Estuary	ECOLOGICAL CONTINUUM FROM THE CHANGJIANG (YANGTZE RIVER) WATERSHEDS TO THE EAST CHINA SEA CONTINENTAL MARGIN	Estuaries of the World											The enormous quantities of sediment produced by the Changjiang (Yangtze River) have created extensive coastal wetlands in the estuarine region, which have been colonized by various types of salt marsh vegetation. As the Changjiang Estuary is located adjacent to the megacity of Shanghai, human activities exert substantial pressures on the coastal wetlands and cause coastal ecosystem degeneration and consequent decreases or loss in ecosystem services. The major stresses from human activities on the coastal wetlands in the Changjiang Estuary include urbanization, reclamation, the introduction of invasive species, overfishing, and environmental pollution. In this chapter, the succession of plant communities in the coastal wetlands of the Changjiang Estuary is described. The spatial and temporal variation of plant communities on salt marshes are analyzed on the basis of remote sensing (RS) and mapping, combined with field inventories of sampling plots. The population expansion of an exotic species, Spartina alterniflora, after its introduction to the coastal wetlands in the Changjiang Estuary in the 1990s, is described and analyzed. The impacts of the invasion of S. alterniflara on benthic communities are examined along intertidal salt marsh gradients, and the invasion history is described. A cellular automaton (CA) model was developed to simulate the expansion of S. alterniflora and to study the interactions between the spatial pattern of expansion and salt marsh vegetation ecosystems. Field experiments and a demonstration project were carried out to control the invasion of S. alterniflora. Finally, this chapter discusses the future development, management, and conservation of coastal wetlands and biodiversity in the Changjiang Estuary.																	2214-1553		978-3-319-16339-0; 978-3-319-16338-3				2015							137	159		10.1007/978-3-319-16339-0_7	10.1007/978-3-319-16339-0							WOS:000373990500009

In 2014, the MPFS reached the end of its 25-yr lifespan, after successfully ushering in significant institutional changes that fundamentally transformed the management of Nepal's forests, mostly through devolving management and benefits from the national level to local communities. Here, we use the 25-yr anniversary of the MPFS to explore forest cover trends in the buffer zone surrounding Chitwan National Park (CNP). Landsat imagery was used for the years 1989, 2005, and 2013 to compute a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to analyze trends in forest cover for 36 buffer zone village development committees (VDCs). The analysis, covering approximately 1,267 km(2), found that since the MPFS was enacted, there was first a continued decrease in forest cover, followed by a significant recovery. These data offer insight into the success of modern community-based forest management policies and supporting institutions, and provide a model for other efforts to conserve forest resources in Nepal and elsewhere.

Many tropical protected areas exist as "islands" surrounded by continuing land use change and development. To understand the interconnections between land cover, biodiversity, and population growth, we use a unique dataset from the Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring (TEAM) Network together with Landsat derived land cover products, population data from the Gridded Population of the World (GPW), and roads data from the Global Roads Open Access Dataset (gROADS). We find significant relationships between road network length and forest loss and between road network length and agricultural development, but no clear links between population growth and land use change. This reaffirms the importance of planning future road extensions to limit their effects on tropical protected areas.																	2153-6996		978-1-4799-7929-5				2015							2560	2563										WOS:000371696702166

As sheep farming becomes less in this region, farmers and ranchers need to focus on sustainable wildlife harvesting as alternative income generation. We developed a methodology for spatially-explicit assessment and mapping of stocking rates based on tradeoffs and synergies between ecosystem services and livestock grazing intensity on rangelands. Forage use for livestock production, carbon sequestration, wildlife conservation and soil erosion are the ecosystem services and disservices evaluated over a gradient of grazing intensity. We show how rangelands stocking rate determination can be converted into a multi-objective optimization problem that can be solved using a Fuzzy Multi-Objective Linear Programing (MOLP).																	2153-6996		978-1-4799-7929-5				2015							3369	3372										WOS:000371696703116

It is not surprising that in the field of medicinal crop production the need of applying precision methods arising, too. The use of this new technique and technology can only be successful if it serves sustainable production and is used for the purpose of ecological conservation. Interestingly enough, this latter area is more advanced in the field of annual and perennial forest herbs as well as in description of interplant competition than in up-to-date (precision) plant production technologies. A number of new methods of how to use remote sensing in ecological research can be learned from medicinal herbs sciences.

This study aimed to assess the potential development of alternative source for biodiesel sector. A case study of three provinces, Krabi, Suratthani, and Nakorn si thammarat, was considered to seek for suitable areas for oil palm expansion based on the land suitability guided by the Good Agriculture Practice (GAP) of the nation. The study emphasized on the AEDP policy implementation for forest conservation and the restriction of expansion only on the pre-existing croplands, mainly the rubber plantation. The results indicated that only the land availability and land suitability in the three provinces would be sufficient for oil palm expansion target as far as any ages of rubber plantation were considered. In fact, only the old plantation with lower production should be deliberated as suitable for land conversion to energy crops. An initial investigation of the possibility of rubber plantation age classification using remote sensing data from THEOS satellite was demonstrated. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The task of the department of soil and water conservation is to monitor the construction and usage of abandoned dreg fields according to the design in the whole process of railway construction. As long linear construction projects, many high-speed railways go through regions of complex terrain, which poses great difficulties to monitoring current status of abandoned dreg fields. With the advantages of low cost, flexible launch and landing, safety, under-cloud-flying, hyperspatial image resolution, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are very suitable for obtaining remote sensing imagery along the railway. One segment of the high-speed railway from Chongqing to Wanzhou and its neighborhood was chosen as the study area to demonstrate key technologies and specific procedures of monitoring abandoned dreg fields using the UAV system. The UAV system and its components are introduced along with the flight trajectories, acquired UAV imagery, and attitude data. Image preprocessing and generation of DEM and DOM are described in detail followed by image-based measurement accuracy assessment and abandoned dreg field status investigation on the resulting DOM and DEM. Results prove the feasibility and effectiveness of applying the fixed wing UAV system to rapidly monitoring the construction and usage of abandoned dreg fields.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0049-2				2015	9808								980808	10.1117/12.2207421								WOS:000369013400007

However, intensification without due attention to ecosystem services and sustainability of soil and water resources has contributed to land and water quality degradation such as soil erosion, decreased soil fertility and quality, salinization and nutrient discharge to surface and ground waters. Land use change from forests to crop lands has altered the vegetation pattern and hydrology of landscapes with increased nutrient discharge from crop lands to riverine environment. Global climate change will increase the amount of water required for agriculture in addition to water needed for additional irrigation development causing water scarcity in many dry, arid and semi-arid regions. The water and nutrient use efficiencies of agricultural production systems are still below 40 % in many regions across the globe. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizer use in agriculture have accelerated the cycling of these nutrients in the landscape and contributed to water quality degradation. Such nutrient pollution has a wide array of consequences including eutrophication of inland waters and marine ecosystems. This chapter reviews major factors and drivers that affect water dynamics and nutrient pollution in agricultural landscapes. Water flux is the main driver of nutrient pollution and is influenced by land use (vegetation), soil physical and chemical characteristics and climate change. Appropriate land and water management practices that include irrigation scheduling and conservation practices are important for improving downstream water quality, quantity and the environmental services provided by the water. This approach can reduce agricultural water use by up to 65 % in arid and semi-arid irrigation areas. While fertilizer N and P for agriculture increased by 10 and 14 % respectively between 2010 and 2015, crop nutrient use efficiencies, of 25-65 % and 10-30 % for N and P respectively, were still low leading to losses of N and P from agricultural landscapes. Fertilizer and manure application together with legumes cropping contributed almost 60 % N and 69 % P to surface water systems from landscapes. Assessment of soil water, crop water and nutrient use, water losses by evapotranspiration (ET) and soil evaporation and their spatial and temporal variations is important for integrating field losses to landscape scale and to help develop management strategies for improving water quality and quantity of the landscape. A number of techniques such as ground based monitoring, remote sensing and isotopic, are available for assessments. This will provide opportunities to identify target areas for changing land use to improve water and nutrient use efficiencies, food security, reduce water quality degradation and enhance eco-system services of agricultural landscapes.																			978-3-319-21629-4; 978-3-319-21628-7				2015	18						145	180		10.1007/978-3-319-21629-4_5	10.1007/978-3-319-21629-4							WOS:000368525600005

However, the conservation and documentation of the cultural heritage is an application field where a highly multi-disciplinary, integrated approach is typically required. In this respect, the fluorescence LIDAR technique can be particularly useful to provide an overall assessment of the whole investigated surface, which can be profitably used to identify those specific areas in which further analytical measurements or sampling for laboratory analysis are needed. This paper presents some representative examples of the research carried out in the frame of the PRIMARTE project, with particular reference to the LIDAR data and their significance in conjunction with the other applied techniques. One of the major objectives of the project, actually, was the development of an integrated methodology for the combined use of data by using diverse techniques: from fluorescence LIDAR remote sensing to UV fluorescence and IR imaging, from IR thermography, georadar, 3D electric tomography to microwave reflectometry, from analytical techniques (FORS, FTIR, GC-MS) to high resolution photo-documentation and historical archive studies. This method was applied to a 'pilot site', a chapel dating back to the fourteenth century, situated at 'Le Campora' site in the vicinity of Florence. All data have been integrated in a multi-medial tool for archiving, management, exploitation and dissemination purposes.

J	Dauwalter, DC; Fesenmyer, KA; Bjork, R				Dauwalter, Daniel C.; Fesenmyer, Kurt A.; Bjork, Robin			Using Aerial Imagery to Characterize Redband Trout Habitat in a Remote Desert Landscape	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Remote sensing products, including aerial imagery, can be used to quantify characteristics of watersheds and stream corridors that often predict the distribution and abundance of aquatic species. We conducted a supervised, object-oriented classification of imagery from the National Agricultural Imagery Program to develop a high-resolution (1-m) land cover data set with four cover classes, emphasizing accurate characterization of woody riparian vegetation along stream corridors in northern Nevada and southwestern Idaho. The overall classification accuracy was 76%, and producer's accuracy (reflecting false positives) and user's accuracy (reflecting false negatives) for the woody vegetation class were 84% and 70%, respectively. Using logistic and quantile regression models in a model-selection framework, we found woody vegetation to be positively associated with the occurrence and density of Redband Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss gairdneri. In addition, occurrence probabilities and densities were highest at mean August stream temperatures (predicted from a stream temperature model) ranging from 13 degrees C to 17 degrees C. When considered together with stream temperature, percent woody vegetation typically predicted Redband Trout occurrence and density better than most field-measured instream and riparian habitat variables in northern Nevada. Our study highlights how free high-resolution imagery can be used to characterize woody riparian vegetation and Redband Trout habitat across a large and remote desert landscape that can be difficult to access for field surveys. It also suggests that imagery from the National Agricultural Imagery Program may have wider application in identifying stream habitat restoration opportunities, where land and water uses have negatively impacted woody riparian vegetation in desert regions of the interior western United States.																	0002-8487	1548-8659					2015	144	6					1322	1339		10.1080/00028487.2015.1088471								WOS:000366973500020						
J	Collins, MB; Mitchard, ETA				Collins, M. B.; Mitchard, E. T. A.			Integrated radar and lidar analysis reveals extensive loss of remaining intact forest on Sumatra 2007-2010	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Forests with high above-ground biomass (AGB), including those growing on peat swamps, have historically not been thought suitable for biomass mapping and change detection using synthetic aperture radar (SAR). However, by integrating L-band (lambda = 0.23 m) SAR from the ALOS and lidar from the ICESat Earth-Observing satellites with 56 field plots, we were able to create a forest biomass and change map for a 10.7 Mha section of eastern Sumatra that still contains high AGB peat swamp forest. Using a time series of SAR data we estimated changes in both forest area and AGB. We estimate that there was 274 +/- 68 Tg AGB remaining in natural forest (>= 20m height) in the study area in 2007, with this stock reducing by approximately 11.4% over the subsequent 3 years. A total of 137.4 kha of the study area was deforested between 2007 and 2010, an average rate of 3.8% yr(-1). The ability to attribute forest loss to different initial biomass values allows for far more effective monitoring and baseline modelling for avoided deforestation projects than traditional, optical-based remote sensing. Furthermore, given SAR's ability to penetrate the smoke and cloud which normally obscure land cover change in this region, SAR-based forest monitoring can be relied on to provide frequent imagery. This study demonstrates that, even at L-band, which typically saturates at medium biomass levels (ca. 150 Mg ha(-1)), in conjunction with lidar data, it is possible to make reliable estimates of not just the area but also the carbon emissions resulting from land use change.

The home range estimation provided in a GIS environment offers a viable method of quantifying habitat use and facilitating a better understanding of species and habitat relationships. This study used remote sensing, GIS and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) application tools as methods to assess the habitat parameters preference of Asian elephant. Satellite images and topographical maps were used for the environmental and topographical habitat parameter generation encompassing land use-land cover (LULC), Normalized Digital Vegetation Index (NDVI), water sources, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), slope and aspect. The kernel home range was determined using elephant distribution data from satellite tracking, which were then analysed using habitat parameters to investigate any possible relationship. Subsequently, the frequency of the utilization distribution of elephants was further analysed using spatial and geostatistical analyses. This was followed by the use of AHP for identifying habitat preference, selection of significant habitat parameters and classification of criterion. The habitats occupied by the elephants showed that the conservation of these animals would require good management practices within and outside of protected areas so as to ensure the level of suitability of the habitat, particularly in translocation areas.																	0128-7702	2231-8534				JAN	2015	23	1					37	50										WOS:000363712500006						
J	Adab, H; Kanniah, KD; Solaimani, K; Sallehuddin, R				Adab, Hamed; Kanniah, Kasturi Devi; Solaimani, Karim; Sallehuddin, Roselina			Modelling static fire hazard in a semi-arid region using frequency analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												Various fire hazard rating systems have been used by many countries at strategic and tactical levels for fire prevention and fire safety programs. Assigning subjective weight to parameters that cause fire hazard has been widely used to model wildland fire hazard. However, these methods are sensitive to experts' judgements because they are independent of any statistical approaches. Therefore, in the present study, we propose a wildland fire hazard method based on frequency analysis (i.e. a probability distribution model) to identify the locations of fire hazard in north-eastern Iran, which has frequent fire. The proposed methodology uses factors that do not change or change very slowly over time to identify static fire hazard areas, such as vegetation moisture, slope, aspect, elevation, distance from roads and proximity to settlements, as essential parameters. Several probability distributions are assigned to each factor to show the possibility of fire using non-linear regressions. The results show that approximately 86% of MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) hot spot data are located truly in the high fire hazard areas as identified in the present study and the most significant contributing factor to fire in Golestan Province, Iran, is elevation. The present study also reveals that approximately 14% of the total study area (`similar to 20368km(2)) has a fire hazard of 66%, which can be considered very high.

Therefore, contemporary planners should consider the negative aspects of industrialization and urbanization on natural environment and should prepare related plans considering these aspects. Some natural resources in the capital of Turkey, Ankara, are also under the threat of industrialization and urbanization. With this respect, Golbasi, Mogan and Eymir Lake environment have legally considered as special environmental protection area since 1991. In this paper, the change of natural resources is examined by means of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) based remote sensing. The change is also examined with the previous and contemporary maps related with the years of 1992 and 2008. In this sense, microzonation map of the area is prepared by means of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The result of this analysis indicates that the most important changes between the years of 1992 and 2008 occurred in the built-up areas. Accordingly, agricultural areas and open spaces also decreased in this period. On the other hand, areas related with industry and storage has been observed as increased in the related years. These results state that the natural environment, especially water resources, are under the threat of industrialization and urbanization although Mogan and Eymir Lakes environment has been set as special environmental protection area.																			978-3-319-09048-1; 978-3-319-09047-4				2015							393	396		10.1007/978-3-319-09048-1_75								WOS:000359015000075

Based on remote sensing data of Landsat TM in 2005 and Landsat OLI in 2013, the effects of LUCC on ecosystem services in ecological preservation development districts (EPDD) of Beijing were analyzed from spatial and temporal perspectives. The results showed that: (1) Regional structure of land use and land cover in EPDD was forest land-farmland-orchard land; Forest land was the major land cover type, while farmland and orchard land dominated land use. From 2005 to 2013, changes in land use and land cover accelerated, and land use intensity was enhanced gradually with the land use degree comprehensive index (La) varied from 229.67 to 233.09. The main characteristics of LUCC were farmland, grassland (decreasing) and construction land, forest land, water body, orchard land (increasing). (2) Between 2005 and 2013, ecosystem services value of EPDD showed a rising trend with the increments of 803.27x10(4) USD from 113535.19x10(4) USD to 114338.46x10(4) USD. Ecosystem services value of farmland, grassland, wetland and unused land decreased since 2005, while orchard land, forest land, water body increased. Service function value of food production, climate regulation and soil conservation decreased with climate regulation having the largest reduction; Service function value of raw materials production, gas regulation, hydrological regulation, waste treatment, biodiversity conservation and leisure entertainment increased, while hydrological regulation had the largest increment. Ecological environment and ecosystem service functions became more symphonious after EPDD foundation.																	2352-538X		978-94-62520-74-5				2015	9						71	75										WOS:000359721400018

However, so far the applications of hyperspectral imaging have been mainly limited to easel paintings or paper-based artifacts. Indeed, specifically designed hyperspectral imagers, are usually used for applications in museum context. These devices work at short-distances from the targets and cover limited size surfaces. Instead, almost still unexplored remain the applications of hyperspectral imaging to the investigations of frescoes and large size mural paintings. For this type of artworks a remote sensing approach, based on sensors capable of acquiring hyperspectral data from distances of the order of tens of meters, is needed. This paper illustrates an application of hyperspectral remote sensing to an important wall-painting by Beato Angelico, located in the San Marco Museum in Florence. Measurements were carried out using a re-adapted version of the Galileo Avionica Multisensor Hyperspectral System (SIM-GA), an avionic hyperspectral imager originally designed for applications from mobile platforms. This system operates in the 400-2500 nm range with over 700 channels, thus guaranteeing acquisition of high resolution hyperspectral data exploitable for materials identification and mapping. In the present application, the SIM-GA device was mounted on a static scanning platform for ground-based applications. The preliminary results obtained on the Angelico's wall-painting are discussed, with highlights on the main technical issues addressed to optimize the SIM-GA system for new applications on cultural assets.

Commiss Remote Sens, Sun Yat-Sen Univ, Univ Swansea, Univ Nebraska, K C Wong Educ Fdn, Nat Sci Fdn				Managing surface water and groundwater as a unified system is important for water resource exploitation and aquatic ecosystem conservation. The unified approach to water management needs accurate characterization of surface water and groundwater interactions. Temperature is a natural tracer for identifying surface water and groundwater interactions, and the use of remote sensing techniques facilitates basin-scale temperature measurement. This study focuses on the Heihe River basin, the second largest inland river basin in the arid and semi-arid northwest of China where surface water and groundwater undergoes dynamic exchanges. The spatially continuous river-surface temperature of the midstream section of the Heihe River was obtained by using an airborne pushbroom hyperspectral thermal sensor system. By using the hot spot analysis toolkit in the ArcGIS software, abnormally cold water zones were identified as indicators of the spatial pattern of groundwater discharge to the river.																	0144-7815		978-1-907161-46-9				2015	368						361	365										WOS:000357968900060

Coffee is particularly important in the Ethiopian highlands, where appropriate climate allows higher productivity and quality. The Ethiopian highlands also host an outstanding biodiversity, being considered one of the world's most important biodiversity hotspots. In this context, conciliating agricultural practices with biodiversity conservation is a priority task for researchers and other stakeholders. However, identifying and mapping understorey coffee plantations in Ethiopian highlands is particularly challenging due to the presence of scattered exotic trees and the characteristics of understorey cultivation. In this research, we mapped potential areas of understorey coffee using predictive modelling and evaluated how projected changes in climate would affect the suitability of coffee production in the study area. Landscape maps, which were mapped using remote-sensing data based on object-based image analysis, remotely sensed spectral vegetation indices, and climatic variables were used to delineate probability maps showing the most likely location of understorey coffee. Normalized difference vegetation index and maximum temperature and precipitation were considered the best predictors for explaining the spatial distribution of understorey coffee. The accuracy of the probability map was validated based on existing understorey coffee areas mapped during field surveys. In addition, we show that potential changes in temperature and precipitation by 2050 are likely to shift suitable areas of understorey coffee to higher altitudes, affecting the landscape changes dynamics in the region.

In the 1980s, mappers transitioned from aerial photography to digital remote sensing, in particular Landsat satellite imagery, which still plays a significant role in forest mapping, but today mappers increasingly rely on Lidar analysis. In California, where forests are complex and difficult to accurately map, numerous remote sensing scientists have pioneered development of methodologies for forest mapping with Lidar. Lidar has been used successfully here in a number of ways: to capture forest structure, to map individual trees in forests and critical wildlife habitat characteristics, to predict forest volume and biomass, to develop inputs for forest fire behavior modeling, and to map forest topography and infrastructure. Lidar can be costly to acquire and difficult to analyze, but as costs decline and new data processing methods are developed, it is likely that forest managers who need detailed information on forest structure across large spatial scales will incorporate Lidar data into their mapping toolkits.																	0008-0845	2160-8091				JAN-MAR	2015	69	1					14	20		10.3733/ca.v069n01p14								WOS:000354027900005

Quantitative Analysis of Catchment Using Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WATER RESOURCES, COASTAL AND OCEAN ENGINEERING (ICWRCOE'15)	Aquatic Procedia				International Conference on Water Resources, Coastal and Ocean Engineering (ICWRCOE)	MAR 11-14, 2015	Natl Inst Technol Karnataka, Mangaluru, INDIA		Natl Inst Technol Karnataka			Watershed management is the process of formulating and carrying out a course of action involving manipulation of natural system of a watershed to achieve specified objectives. This implies the proper use of land and water resources of watershed for optimum production with minimum hazard to natural resources. Remote sensing and GIS techniques have emerged as powerful tools for watershed management programmes. The study area, Harangi Catchment geographically lies between 75(0) 38' E and 75(0) 55' E longitude and 12(0) 24' N and 12(0) 40' N latitude with an area of 417.54 sq km. In the present study an attempt was made to understand the hydrological processes of the catchment at watershed level by deriving the watershed parameters through Remote Sensing, GIS and other data. Based on the drainage pattern and topography, thirteen watersheds were delineated to understand the hydrological process of the catchment at the watershed level. The drainage density of the watersheds varies from 1.36 to 3.42 km/km(2) which indicate that the area is coarse texture. Runoff was estimated using USDA Soil Conservation Services (SCS) Curve Number model. The information such as land use/land cover and hydrological soil group map derived from remotely sensed data were overlayed through ArcGIS software to assign the curve number on polygon wise. Soil erosion was estimated by using Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE). The weighted soil erosion estimated for the catchment was 19 t/ha/year, which is a moderate soil loss and needs conservation measures.

Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) for watershed Prioritization	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WATER RESOURCES, COASTAL AND OCEAN ENGINEERING (ICWRCOE'15)	Aquatic Procedia				International Conference on Water Resources, Coastal and Ocean Engineering (ICWRCOE)	MAR 11-14, 2015	Natl Inst Technol Karnataka, Mangaluru, INDIA		Natl Inst Technol Karnataka			River/stream's catchment area, which is the source of endowment for water resource projects, is generally developed without giving much emphasis on protection against soil's erosion from catchment that results into loss of beneficial storage, breach of banks, loss of nutrients and many other environmental problems. The prioritization of sub-watersheds, which are atmost important in developing catchment area treatment (CAT) plan identification of priority sub-watersheds is utmost important in developing any catchment area treatment plan and watershed management activities can help take necessary precautionary measures a-priori. The paper presents the application of Saaty's AHP based Multi criteria decision analysis (MCDA) in prioritizing of vulnerable area of watershed. The analytical hierarchical process based MCDA is a powerful tool that analyzes problems which depend on a number of spatially distributed complex criteria. In the present case, the Saaty's AHP based MCDA tool has been applied to the Kodar reservoir catchment (in Chhattisgarh state in India) using nine erosion hazard parameters (EHPs), which vary spatially and depend on climate, topography, soil, geomorphology, conservation and management practices. For prioritizing the vulnerable areas, the Kodar catchment has been divided into 67 sub-watersheds and analyzed nine EHPs responsible for soil degradation and soil loss in GIS environment using revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) model (SL), sediment yield (SY), sediment production rate (SPR), sediment transport index (STI), slope (Slp), drainage density (D-d), channel frequency (C-f), form factor (R-f), circulatory ratio (R-c). To prepare EHPs criteria maps, soil and remote sensing data, topographic information and field knowledge have been used. The normalized values of EHPs and the corresponding weights obtained from Saaty's AHP based MCDA tool have been used to prioritize the sub-watersheds. The results showed, soil loss (SL) occupied the maximum weight of 0.33 and the circulatory ratio had minimum weight of 0.02 at 9.3% consistency ratio (within 10% limit). The priorities of sub-watersheds in the Kodar catchment ranged between 0.12 and 0.74. The normalized priority of 0.74 and 0.12 obtained for SW-44 and SW-41 respectively can be considered as the top and minimum prioritized sub-watersheds for soil conservation measures. The analyzed results could help in developing an implementable CAT plan of the Kodar catchment. The paper also demonstrates a procedure of analyzing EHPs and use of those in MCDA for prioritizing soil erosion vulnerable zones/areas. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Prioritization of Intervention Areas using a Morphometric Analysis and Vegetation Index	Tecnologia y Ciencias del Agua												Morphometric characterizations and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) can be used as a strategy for the environmental hydrological restoration of basins, since identifying the interrelation among the area, shape, topography, drainage system and changes in vegetation due to anthropogenic factors enables prioritizing the application of productive-conservation interventions in sub-basins. The purpose of this is to reduce the growth of drainage systems in regions with extreme meteorological events that cause landslides and flooding in lower portions of basins. The study was performed in the Huehuetan River Basin located in the Soconusco region of the state of Chiapas, Mexico. Its objective was to estimate the morphometric parameters (linear and shape) of 16 sub-basins, as well as the NDVI for the years 1993 and 2013, in order to prioritize changes in vegetation cover that affect the degradation of the soil in the sub-basin, for the purpose of hydrological restoration. The methodology enabled defining the order of intervention (water and soil conservation practices and sediment control works) in the sub-basins so as to reduce hydric erosion, the.growth of the drainage system and the transport capacity of surface flow through hillsides and rivers.																	0187-8336	2007-2422				JAN-FEB	2015	6	1					121	137										WOS:000353525600007						
J	Asner, GP				Asner, Gregory P.			ORGANISMIC REMOTE SENSING FOR TROPICAL FOREST ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION	ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN												Tropical forests are vast and scientifically underexplored places. Biotic losses, gains, and reorganization within these systems go undetected due to a lack of access to technologies needed to monitor forest cover, composition, and carbon content. Provision of forest cover-monitoring tools for non-scientists has, thus, become a focus of innovation in the remote-sensing community, while advances in high-resolution forest carbon and biodiversity mapping science has progressed more slowly. This paper focuses on high-resolution remote-sensing developments to measure and monitor tropical forest canopies at the "organismic scale," which is the resolution that resolves individual canopies and species throughout the forest landscape. Emphasis is placed on how forest carbon stocks can be mapped with precision and accuracy comparable to that of field-based estimates. Biodiversity mapping poses the greatest challenge, but recent advances in three-dimensional functional and structural trait imaging can reveal variation in species richness, abundance, and functional diversity over large geographic regions. The pay-off in pursuing these studies will be a vastly improved understanding of tropical biodiversity patterns and their underlying ecological and evolutionary drivers, which will have positive cascading effects on conservation decision-making and resource policy development.																	0026-6493	2162-4372					2015	100	3					127	140		10.3417/2012016								WOS:000351321700001

The annual soil loss of the study area was modelled and mapped by using the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS). Employing the USLE model, precipitation (R), the degree of slope and length of slope (L and S), soil erodibility (K), vegetation cover-land use (C), and soil conservation (P) factors were separately calculated and transformed to raster maps in GIS environment. Then, all produced factor map layers were multiplied each other to develop an annual soil loss raster map. Annual sediment input was calculated by utilizing Roehl sediment delivery ratio and developed annual soil loss raster map. The mean annual soil loss of the study area was determined as 0.037 t.ha(-1) year(-1). Erosion risk classes of the study area were determined according to European Environment Information and Observation Network for Soil (EIO-NET-SOIL) Erosion Map, and summarized as five classes including the 0-0.5, 0.5-1.0, 1.0-2.0, 2.0-5.0 and 5.0-7.1 tha(-1)year(-1) I intervals.

The lower Evros/Meric River, shared by Greece and Turkey, is one of the most heavily militarized river borders in Europe and access to the river corridor is strictly restricted. This 218 kin proposed green-belt conservation area has never been completely surveyed for its riparian biodiversity values. Here we provide an assessment and evidence for green-belt conservation justification for the entire portion of the Greek-Turkish river corridor for the first time. We employ satellite imagery to assess riparian corridor conditions and the distribution of natural habitat refuge environments focusing on riparian woodlands and river islands. The analysis found that nearly half of the area of the riparian green-belt is under cultivation; approximately 22% of the riparian zone is wooded, while some of these woodlands are taken over by artificial poplar plantations. The natural woodland areas are severely fragmented and usually small in extent and width being affected by frequent logging and clearing. The most extensive remaining woodlands are mapped; most of the 12 largest contiguous natural woodland are in the northern half of the river valley. Important natural habitat refuges are the river's islands; 127 such island features are mapped from recent satellite images, and most are heavily wooded, again most are found in the northern half of the river valley. Based on best-available information we interpret these patterns and encourage an international green-belt conservation initiative.

Indices of landscape-scale ecological risks have the potential to influence changes in landscape patterns, the conditions of endangered plants and animals, and influences from nature and humans. Semi-variation function and gravity center models were used to quantify risk area changes. The changes of landscape ecological risk were analyzed for Bayanbulak Wetland from 2000 to 2010. In addition to landscape and species distribution data, GIS technology and remote sensing were used in this study. Results show that landscape structure changed over the 10-year period, with high-cover grassland area decreasing the most. Landscape pattern index types also changed for the study area. The number of landscape-type patches to low-cover grassland decreased, the landscape fragmentation index of dry land and high-cover grassland was reduced, and the interference degree of middle-cover grassland increased over the study period. The index of landscape ecological risk decreased from 2000 to 2010, with the spatial structure changing from a single center concentration to a multi-center distribution. All varying ecological risk regions of gravity centers moved from the northeast to the southwest. The gravity migration of the Level 2 region moved the furthest. Additionally, evidence suggests that various threatening factors reduce the ecological function and systems of wetlands. These include climate change, biological invasion, human activities, and water pollution. This paper assesses the heritage site landscape ecological risk and calculates the gravity center change of the region, which can be formulated to enrich and develop the research of small- and medium-sized wetlands in cold, semi-arid climates.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2015	24	1					269	283		10.15244/pjoes/28685								WOS:000349814500030

Advancing species diversity estimate by remotely sensed proxies: A conceptual review	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Many geospatial tools have been advocated in spatial ecology to estimate biodiversity and its changes over space and time. Such information is essential in designing effective strategies for biodiversity conservation and management. Remote sensing is one of the most powerful approaches to identify biodiversity hotspots and predict changes in species composition in reduced time and costs. This is because, with respect to field-based methods, it allows to derive complete spatial coverages of the Earth surface under study in a short period of time. Furthermore, remote sensing provides repeated coverages of field sites, thus making studies of temporal changes in biodiversity possible. In this paper we discuss, from a conceptual point of view, the potential of remote sensing in estimating biodiversity using various diversity indices, including alpha- and beta-diversity measurements.

The application is focused on the Saskatoon urban environment, a rapidly growing urban municipality in Canada's prairie pothole region. Alternative future LUC was simulated using remote sensing data and city spatial planning documentation using a Markov Chain technique. Two alternatives were developed and compared for LUC change and threats to urban wetland sustainability: a zero alternative that simulated trends in urban development and wetland conservation under a business as usual scenario, in the absence of prescribed planning and zoning actions; and an alternative focused on implementation of current urban development plans, which simulated future LUC to account for prescribed wetland conservation strategies. Results show no improvement in future wetland conditions under the city's planned growth and wetland conservation scenario versus the business as usual scenario. Results also indicate that a blanket wetland conservation strategy for the city may not be sufficient to overcome the historic trend of urban wetland loss; and that spatially distributed conservation rates, based on individual wetland water catchment LUC peculiarities, may be more effective in terms of wetland conservation. The paper also demonstrates the challenges to applied SEA in a rapidly changing urban planning context, where data are often sparse and inconsistent across the urban region, and provides potential solutions through LUC classification and prediction tools to help overcome data limitations to support land use planning decisions for wetland conservation.

Conservation on islands is also often challenged by limited data on the distribution of remaining native habitats and threatened native and endemic species. We combine botanical survey data and habitat mapping through remote sensing and GIS to illustrate how multiple data sources can be used together to provide a synoptic view of the spatial distribution of native, naturalized and invasive alien plant species at an island scale, using the case study of Moorea (French Polynesia), a small (135 km(2)) tropical high volcanic island in the South Pacific. Results reveal that (i) 42 % of the rare and threatened native and endemic plant species are currently found in native habitats representing only 6 % of the island (8 km(2)); (ii) 49 % of these species occupy "hybrid" habitats covering 45 % of the island area (60 km(2)) where native species co-occur with naturalized non-native species; and (iii) 9 % of these species occur in 17 % of the island (23 km(2)) considered "novel" habitats that are highly invaded by alien plants that form dense monotypic stands. We conclude that conservation efforts and priorities should not neglect these novel and hybrid habitats on Moorea where many rare and threatened plants are found. Innovative strategies adapted to current conditions should be emphasized on small islands where conservation resources are often limited.																	0960-3115	1572-9710				JAN	2015	24	1					83	101		10.1007/s10531-014-0791-6								WOS:000348114100006

Distribution of Mangrove Habitats of Grenada and the Grenadines	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Mangroves of Grenada and the Grenadines represent significant habitat within the regional context of the Eastern Caribbean. Losses of mangroves through storms, development, and climate change have negative impacts on critical ecosystem services. Estimates of mangrove area exist in the literature but do not fully reflect current conditions, effects of disturbance, and results of recovery; they also do not differentiate these areas by community types. Advances in imagery and remote sensing approaches allow higher-resolution resource mapping. We used remote sensing, image interpretation, and field verification techniques to provide current estimates of the extent and distribution of mangroves. Our results provide the greatest areal total of mangroves to date. Despite loss of mangroves in the recent past, we accounted for approximately 15% more hectares than estimated in the 1990s and 28% more than predicted by hypothetical models for 2005. The discrepancies between prior and current mapped areas are likely due to differences in mapping precision and incomplete surveys that omitted the smaller Grenadine islands but also reflect actual increases in cover from natural recovery and recruitment following historic storm events. Basin mangroves represented the greatest area, while riverine and scrub contributed the least. Fringe mangroves were moderately abundant but were composed of small, isolated patches with high vulnerability to coastal storms and limited opportunity for inland retreat. Documenting the presence and distribution of mangroves, and specifically mangrove community types, will be of value to conservation, restoration, and management planning in light of predicted sea level rise and climate change effects.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JAN	2015	31	1					155	162		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-13-00187.1								WOS:000347868900015

Remotely sensed information was combined with on-board observer's data and published information to investigate the role of distinctive oceanographic features in relation to the life cycle of the Patagonian red shrimp (Pleoticus muelleri), main target of the industrial fleet in SJG. Three frontal systems North, South and Outer SJG-are characterized. The North and South SJG fronts are associated with shrimp reproductive aggregations during late spring and summer. While both function as spawning/nursery grounds, they differ from each other in many respects. The thermohaline South SJG front has its maximum expression during the winter, reflecting the influence of the low-salinity Magellanic Plume, while the thermal North SJG front develops during spring and summer as the water column becomes stratified in the central basin of the gulf. Wind-related downwelling inshore of the front prevails in the North SJG, and upwelling in the South SJG frontal area. Chlorophyll a is concentrated near the thermocline on the stratified side of the North SJG, and for that reason, it is not detected by remote sensors during the spring bloom and the summer but becomes apparent offshore from the location of the front when the thermocline deepens during the fall (May). In the South SJG front, ChI-a concentration is apparent inshore from the front all year-round, related in part to upwelling-mediated resuspension. The northern end of the outer front coincides in time and space with a recurrent non-reproductive aggregation of red shrimp between November and January and is presumably related to foraging. It is argued that keeping the North and South SJG frontal systems off-limits to fishing is a central precautionary requisite for the sustainability of the shrimp fishery. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Eco-certification and coffee cultivation enhance tree cover and forest connectivity in the Colombian coffee landscapes	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												Eco-certification of agricultural commodities offers an appealing option to promote more sustainable practices among smallholders, increase agricultural value, and lift farmers out of poverty through better market access. This study evaluates whether coffee cultivation is associated with changes in forest cover and forest fragmentation and whether the Rainforest Alliance eco-certification program has led to enhanced tree cover and greater landscape connectivity in the Colombian eastern Andes. Based on satellite imagery, geo-referenced coffee parcels and a pair-case comparison, we show that coffee-growing regions have larger areas in forest, larger forest patches, and better connectivity among patches than non-coffee areas. These differences, however, do not seem to be accentuated over time, except for dense forest cover in the coffee-growing region. The latter has increased since the introduction of a certification program that requires protection of forest remnants and riparian vegetation. Moreover, certified farms in the study area have increased the amount of tree cover on their plots significantly more than non-certified ones. Our study design, therefore, detects additionality in the impact of certification on tree cover increase: in a region with overall increase in tree cover, certified farms contributed significantly more to that trend than non-certified farms. This study presents the first evaluation of the impacts of certification in cultivated landscapes at the ecosystem level, detectable by Earth observation satellites.

Common policy recommendations suggest expanding the production of export crops, by making use of marginal or unused land. Considerable potentials for such an expansion are assumed. Taking Tanzania as a case study, the evidence for such types of land is assessed by using a broad range of statistics. We will argue firstly, that the terms marginal and unused land serve as a manipulative terminology for the benefit of attempts to commercially valorize and commodify African landscapes, from biofuel to large-scale food production and tourism. However, they relate to different rationalities of domination. Unused land refers to a state-bureaucratic narrative, which excludes user groups deemed irrelevant for national development, while marginal land refers to a capitalist-economic narrative that excludes what is not profitable. Secondly, the terms are analyzed as categories central for state simplification of social relations attached to land. Modelling of these land use categories based on remote sensing is an attempt to compensate weak state capacities to enhance the legibility of the landscape by constructing it as a landscape of commercial value.

Impacts of urbanization on flooding of a coastal urban catchment: a case study of Mumbai City, India	NATURAL HAZARDS												Land use-land cover (LULC) change in space and time is the main cause behind the changing hydrological processes, ecosystem and environment in urban catchments. In the present study, the main focus was on evaluation of spatial and temporal variation of land use and land cover change in a major coastal urban catchment of Mumbai City, India, called Mithi River catchment. The LULC is derived from the topographic map surveyed in the year 1966 and satellite image for the year 2009. The analysis from toposheet and remote sensing data showed that there is a rise in the built-up area of Mithi River catchment, Mumbai by 59.66 % between 1966 and 2009. It also showed adverse human-induced influences on the Mithi River course and its catchment. Flood hydrographs for different land use conditions were derived by using Soil Conservation Service-Curve Number hydrological model and kinematic wave model, for routing available within the HEC-HMS software. Flood plain maps as well as flood hazard maps for the different land use scenarios have been developed by integrating the models HEC-HMS and HEC-RAS with HEC-GeoHMS and HEC-GeoRAS as well as with GIS and remote sensing. Results obtained from the present study revealed marginal increases in the runoff peak discharges and volumes within the catchment. Even though the runoff change is marginal, combined with tidal influence, it may cause major flooding problem. The integrated modeling approach has been found to be very effective for flood estimation, flood plain and flood hazard mapping. The flood plain and flood hazard maps derived can be used as effective tool to minimize the damages within the flood-prone areas of the river basin for the Mumbai City.

Low-cost Bathymetric Survey for Marine Protected Areas: coral reefs and coastal islands	2015 IEEE/OES ACOUSTICS IN UNDERWATER GEOSCIENCES SYMPOSIUM					IEEE/OES Acoustics in Underwater Geosciences Symposium (RIO Acoustics)	JUL 29-31, 2015	Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL	IEEE OES				Bathymetry surveys are the first step for every conservation effort on Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Maps depicting depth and bottom geomorphology are used to generate hillshades, that later become basemaps for other themes, such as fish distribution, bottom types, and water quality. Bathymetry map availability is limited or non-existent at the scales that are necessary for MPA management plans. Survey costs by traditional sounding methods or new technologies, such as LIDAR, are prohibitive for most MPA budgets. Remote Sensing bathymetry is yet unreliable, except for crystal clear waters. A low-cost technique, based on commercially available GPS-echosounder units was applied to obtain detailed bathymetry of two MPAs in coastal Brazil: at the Parque Municipal Marinho da Coroa Alta ((PMMCA), located in the coastal reefs of Santa Cruz de Cabralia, State of Bahia, and Monumento Natural das Ilhas Cagarras ((MNIC), off Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro. Equipment consisted of a Simrad NSS-7 chartplotter mounted permanently on Iamany, a 7 m-long, fiberglass-hull, twin-engine boat for PMMCA, and a Garmin GPSMap 521 chartplotter mounted on Cacao, an inflatable, 6 m-long, single-engine boat hired for MNIC. Survey frequencies for the echosounders were set at 50 kHz. Cross-shelf, East-West lines spaced 100m apart with readings every second ((1-3 m, depending on boat speed) were obtained for PMMCA over 30 days of 4-6 hours of navigation around the highest tide ((ranging from 1.3 to 2.0 m above mean sea-level). At MNIC, radial lines surrounding each of the islands were placed 50 m apart at their outer limits, and readings were obtained every 10 seconds (similar to 10 m) in 7 days of 3-4 hours of navigation around the highest tides ((ranging from 0.8 to 1.2 m above mean sea-level). In the shallow coral reefs of Bahia, 62 km(2) were surveyed, with depths varying from 0 to 20m, while at the sandy bottom around the granite-gneiss islands of Rio de Janeiro, 6 km2 were surveyed, with depths varying from 0 to 40m. Data in the echosounders proprietary format, were saved on Micro-SD or SD memory cards, converted to XYZ format (.csv) and migrated to GIS, where a linear tide correction was applied. Interpolation methods such as Radial Basis Functions and ANUDEM generated maps with 10 m pixels for PMMCA ((presented at 1: 10.000 and 1: 25.000) and 5 m pixels for MNIC ((presented at 1: 3.000 and 1: 10.000). Average survey costs are estimated at R$500-650/day or R$1.000/km(2) (similar to US$ 250/day or similar to US$ 400/km(2)), depending on boat ownership vs. rental cost. This represents less than 1/10 of the official traditional survey costs, and even less when compared to LIDAR bathymetry. Precision obtained is an order of magnitude higher than previously available, and enough for environmental assessment for conservation management of the MPAs involved. Surveys were conducted at PMMCA under the auspices of Projeto Coral Vivo and at MNIC under Projeto Ilhas do Rio, both Petrobras Ambiental programmes.																			978-1-4673-7019-6				2015																		WOS:000412164600027						
J	Ordway, EM				Ordway, Elsa M.			Political shifts and changing forests: Effects of armed conflict on forest conservation in Rwanda	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Most armed conflicts in recent history occurred in biodiversity hotspots. Yet, studies examining impacts of warfare on forests yield contradictory results. This study provides a theoretical framework articulating different hypothetical relationships between conflict and forest transitions. Landsat TM and ETM+ data were analyzed to examine forest transitions in Rwanda during conflict and post conflict periods. Net trends showed little difference between periods, with a rate of 1.6% annual gain during conflict years, and 2.5% following the conflict. Closer inspection revealed spatially concentrated forest loss during conflict years; 96% occurred in protected areas with the most loss in Gishwati Forest Reserve at a rate of -6.1%. Trends were explored with spatially explicit conflict data that distinguished armed conflict activity from conflict induced settlements. Impacts of conflict on forests in Rwanda appear to be influenced by natural resource use near settlements. Massive migrations of people into settlements during the conflict, who had previously been scattered across the landscape, resulted in a redistribution of pressures. Reduced pressure elsewhere supports this inference. Results underscore the vulnerability of protected areas and the spatial dynamics of forest resource dependence during conflicts. This work demonstrates the value of distinguishing conflict activities to assess their varied environmental effects. (C) 2015 The Author.

The main goal of this study was to contribute to conservation of 12 threatened species of amphibians at a cloud forest site in northwestern Ecuador, by identifying and proposing protection of critical areas. We used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing techniques to quantify land cover changes over 35 years and outline important areas for amphibian conservation. We performed a supervised classification of an IKONOS satellite image from 2011 and two aerial photographs from 1977 and 2000. The 2011 IKONOS satellite image classification was used to delineate areas important for conservation of threatened amphibians within a 200 m buffer around rivers and streams. The overall classification accuracy of the three images was >= 80%. Forest cover was reduced by 17% during the last 34 years. However, only 50% of the study area retained the initial (1977) forest cover, as land was cleared for farming and eventually reforested. Finally, using the 2011 IKONOS satellite image, we delineated areas of potential conservation interest that would benefit the long term survival of threatened amphibian species at the Ecuadorian cloud forest site studied.

Geospatial Analysis of Fragmentation and its Effects on Biodiversity: A Case Study of Reserve Forest	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS & STATISTICS												Fragmentation has many consequences on conservation, one of which is the loss of biological diversity. Remote sensing satellites and integration with Geographic Information Systems have provided a better understanding of natural resources and environmental dynamics. The present study focus on the use of geospatial methods to assess the level of fragmentation and its effects on biodiversity conservation in the Shasha forest reserve. The use of FRAGSTAT analysis technique incorporated with the classification of Landsat TM and ETM+ satellite data spanning a period of 14 years from 1986 to 2010 was used to quantify ecological metrics of fragmentation in the study area. The results showed increased settlement 24% (1986-2010) whilst agricultural/farmland uses increased by 38% (1986-2002) and dropped by 16% from 2002-2010. According to respondents who constituted inhabitants of the reserve, this was largely attributed to: human activities such as logging, farming, and settlement. Ecological metrics at landscape level (example, number of patches, Shannon and cohesion Indices) showed that fragmentation (Number of patches) strengthened (1986-2010 by over 57.7%). At class level, dense forest had fragmentation rate of over 59.7% between 1986-2010 while agricultural/Farmland had its peak of fragmentation in 1986-2002 by over 22.3% which later weakened by 13.8% in 2010 The increase in the magnitude of fragmentation in the study area has influenced the dynamics of species and materials in the landscape in such a way that it will have negative implication for biodiversity, climate, ecotourism, if nothing is done to reverse the trend.																	0973-1385						2015	36	1					28	43										WOS:000209993900003

The city is unusual in also having a major protected area located at its periphery, which creates a significant challenge for conservation. Bannerghatta National Park and its surrounding landscape, situated south of Bangalore, have experienced significant land-use and land-cover changes over the last two decades. This analysis combines discrete and continuous approaches of satellite remote-sensingbased change detection using multitemporal Landsat and IRS LISS III imagery to analyze the rate and extent of spatiotemporal changes in and around the Bannerghatta National Park between 1973, 1992 and 2007. Most of the native forest cover loss and decrease in forest density has taken place outside the park, or at the edge of the park, and relates to increased agriculture, suburban development, grazing and illegal logging. However, forest cover inside the park has been maintained, counter to the dominant global theme of deforestation as a consequence of urbanization. Overall, despite the decrease in native forest cover the landscape has experienced a net increase in tree cover or reforestation, which can be attributed to an increase in tree plantations outside the Bannerghatta National Park.

Opportunities for the application of advanced remotely-sensed data in ecological studies of terrestrial animal movement	MOVEMENT ECOLOGY												Animal movement patterns in space and time are a central aspect of animal ecology. Remotely-sensed environmental indices can play a key role in understanding movement patterns by providing contiguous, relatively fine-scale data that link animal movements to their environment. Still, implementation of newly available remotely-sensed data is often delayed in studies of animal movement, calling for a better flow of information to researchers less familiar with remotely-sensed data applications. Here, we reviewed the application of remotely-sensed environmental indices to infer movement patterns of animals in terrestrial systems in studies published between 2002 and 2013. Next, we introduced newly available remotely-sensed products, and discussed their opportunities for animal movement studies. Studies of coarse-scale movement mostly relied on satellite data representing plant phenology or climate and weather. Studies of small-scale movement frequently used land cover data based on Landsat imagery or aerial photographs. Greater documentation of the type and resolution of remotely-sensed products in ecological movement studies would enhance their usefulness. Recent advancements in remote sensing technology improve assessments of temporal dynamics of landscapes and the three-dimensional structures of habitats, enabling near real-time environmental assessment. Online movement databases that now integrate remotely-sensed data facilitate access to remotely-sensed products for movement ecologists. We recommend that animal movement studies incorporate remotely-sensed products that provide time series of environmental response variables. This would facilitate wildlife management and conservation efforts, as well as the predictive ability of movement analyses. Closer collaboration between ecologists and remote sensing experts could considerably alleviate the implementation gap. Ecologists should not expect that indices derived from remotely-sensed data will be directly analogous to field-collected data and need to critically consider which remotely-sensed product is best suited for a given analysis.																	2051-3933						2015	3								8	10.1186/s40462-015-0036-7								WOS:000215741800008	25941571

Foraging ecology of three sympatric ungulate species - Behavioural and resource maps indicate differences between chamois, ibex and red deer	MOVEMENT ECOLOGY												Background: The spatial distribution of forage resources is a major driver of animal movement patterns. Understanding where animals forage is important for the conservation of multi-species communities, since interspecific competition can emerge if different species use the same depletable resources. However, determining forage resources in a spatially continuous fashion in alpine grasslands at high spatial resolution was challenging up to now, because terrain heterogeneity causes vegetation characteristics to vary at small spatial scales, and methods for detection of behavioural phases in animal movement patterns were not widely available. We delineated areas coupled to the foraging behaviour of three sympatric ungulate species (chamois, ibex, red deer) using Time Local Convex Hull (T-LoCoH), a non-parametric utilisation distribution method incorporating spatial and temporal autocorrelation structure of GPS data. We used resource maps of plant biomass and plant nitrogen content derived from high-resolution airborne imaging spectroscopy data, and multinomial logistic regression to compare the foraging areas of the three ungulate species. Results: We found significant differences in plant biomass and plant nitrogen content between the core foraging areas of chamois, ibex and red deer. Core foraging areas of chamois were characterised by low plant biomass and low to medium plant nitrogen content. Core foraging areas of ibex were, in contrast, characterised by high plant nitrogen content, but varied in plant biomass, and core foraging areas of red deer had high plant biomass, but varied in plant nitrogen content. Conclusions: Previous studies carried out in the same study area found no difference in forage consumed by chamois, ibex and red deer. Methodologically, those studies were based on micro-histological analysis of plant fragments identifying them to plant family or functional type level. However, vegetation properties such as productivity (biomass) or plant nutrient content can vary within vegetation communities, especially in highly heterogeneous landscapes. Thus, the combination of high spatial resolution resource maps with a utilisation distribution method allowing to generate behavioural maps (T-LoCoH) provides new insights into the foraging ecology of the three sympatric species, important for their conservation and to monitor expected future changes.

J	Miller, BW				Miller, Brian W.			USING GEOSPATIAL ANALYSIS TO ASSESS THE INFLUENCE OF LAND-USE CHANGE AND CONSERVATION ON PASTORALIST ACCESS TO DROUGHT RESOURCES	NOMADIC PEOPLES												Drought resource areas (DRAs) maintain natural-resource availability during periods of low rainfall, and are critical for sustaining wildlife, livestock and human communities. This study analysed remote sensing data at two spatial scales in order to assess the distribution of DRAs relative to landuse changes and conservation efforts in East Africa. Results suggest that cultivation has exerted an especially strong influence on rangeland DRA availability across the Kenya/ Tanzania border region, but conservation areas also contained a disproportionate area of DRAs. For a local scale within the region (the Simanjiro Plains and Tarangire National Park), DRAs were more evenly distributed across land-use zones, but available sites were generally on steeper slopes. Overall, the area of DRAs that were not cultivated or conserved was relatively small, accounting for about two per cent of the landscape. The area of DRAs available to pastoralist households is likely even smaller, considering that there are a variety of other factors affecting resource access (e. g. risks of livestock disease and conflict, forage quality, resource management institutions). These findings highlight the scarcity and significance of available DRAs within this iconic landscape.

B	Li, Z		Mynett, A		Li, Zhang			Study on the Impounding Situation of the Key Dams in the Middle Reaches of the Yellow River	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 36TH IAHR WORLD CONGRESS: DELTAS OF THE FUTURE AND WHAT HAPPENS UPSTREAM					36th IAHR World Congress	JUN 28-JUL 03, 2015	Delft, NETHERLANDS	Int Assoc Hydro Environm Engn & Res, Boskalis, Van Oord, UNESCO IHE, Delft Univ Technol, Deltares, Minist Infrastructure & Environm, Rijkswaterstaat, Royal HaskoningDHV, ARCADIS, WItteveen Bos, AANDERAA, Prince Sultan Bin Abulaziz Int Prize Water				The Yellow River is the second longest river in China, as well as the important water source for the northwest and north China. But in recent years, the amount of sediment and runoff of Yellow River basin has showed a sharp reduction, which may be caused by following factors: various water conservation projects, water-and-soil conservation project, surface water consumption, over-exploitation of groundwater, utilization of rainwater, vegetation construction, coal mining exploitation, climate change and so on. The Yellow River flows through the Loess Plateau with serious soil erosion, and the warping dam is an important water-and-soil conservation measure. In the middle reaches of the Yellow River a large number of warping dams were bulit, among which 5800 odd key dams (main and bigger warping dam) are included. Moreover, these key dams have the function of storing water before they're full of silt. Therefore, the number, location and impounding characteristics of the key dams undoubtedly have an influence on the runoff of the Yellow River. By means of design data query, site investigation and measurement, as well as remote sensing inquiry on Google Earth platform, this paper discusses the conception and operating mode of the key dams, and researches the impounding characteristics of all the 4798 key dams located above Tongguan station, a hydrological station located in the middle reaches of the Yellow River. The research indicates that there are 875 impounding key dams in this area, which accounts for 18.65% of all the key dams. The ratio varies in different tributaries because of the different regional situation and local social development. A few key dams beyond their design deposition life still store water all year round. These data will provide a basis for further research on the water evaporation of Yellow River and its influence on the runoff decrease of the river.																			978-90-824846-0-1				2015							3809	3813										WOS:000398996203106

Mapping of coastal aquifer vulnerable zone in the south west coast of Kanyakumari, South India, using GIS-based DRASTIC model	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The south west coast of Kanyakumari district in Tamil Nadu, India, is significantly affected by seawater intrusion and diffusion of pollutants into the aquifers due to unregulated beach placer mining and other anthropogenic activities. The present study investigates the vulnerability of the coastal aquifers using Geographic Information System (GIS)-based DRASTIC model. The seven DRASTIC parameters have been analyzed using the statistical equation of this model to demarcate the vulnerable zones for aquifer contamination. The vulnerability index map is prepared from the weighted spatial parameters, and an accounting of total index value ranged from 85 to 213. Based on the categorization of vulnerability classes, the high vulnerable zones are found near the beach placer mining areas between Manavalakurichi and Kodimanal coastal stretches. The aquifers associated with settlements and agricultural lands in the middle-eastern part have experienced high vulnerability due to contaminated water bodies. Similarly, the coastal areas of Thengapattinam and Manakudi estuary and around the South Tamaraikulam have also been falling under high vulnerability condition due to backwater and saltpan. In general, the nearshore region except the placer mining zone and the backwater has a moderately vulnerable condition, and the vulnerability index values range from 149 to180. Significantly, the northern and northeastern uplands and some parts of deposition zones in the middle-south coast have been identified as low to no vulnerable conditions. They are structurally controlled by various geological features such as charnockite, garnet biotite gneiss and granites, and sand dunes, respectively. The aquifer vulnerability assessment has been cross-verified by geochemical indicators such as total dissolved solids (TDS), Cl-, HCO3-, and Cl-/HCO3- ratio. The high ranges of TDS (1,842-3,736 mg/l) and Cl-(1,412-2,112 mg/l) values are well correlated with the observed high vulnerable zones in the study area. The Cl-/HCO3- ratio (7.13 to 12.18) of the high vulnerable zone obviously indicates deterioration of the aquifer contamination. Sensitivity analysis has also been performed to evaluate sensitivity of the individual DRASTIC parameters to aquifer vulnerability. This reveals the net recharge rate and groundwater table depth are becoming more sensitive to aquifer contamination. It is realized that the GIS is an effective platform for aquifer vulnerability mapping with reliable accuracy, and hence, the study is more useful for sustainable water resource management and the aquifer conservation.

Ecologists have long used field inventory plots as the main tool for understanding forest structure and biomass at landscape-to-regional scales, under the implicit assumption that these plots accurately represent their surrounding landscape. However, no study has used continuous, high-spatial-resolution data to test whether field plots meet this assumption in tropical forests. Using airborne LiDAR (light detection and ranging) acquired over three regions in Peru, we assessed how representative a typical set of field plots are relative to their surrounding host landscapes. We uncovered substantial mean biases (9-98%) in forest canopy structure (height, gaps, and layers) and aboveground biomass in both lowland Amazonian and montane Andean landscapes. Moreover, simulations reveal that an impractical number of 1-ha field plots (from 10 to more than 100 per landscape) are needed to develop accurate estimates of aboveground biomass at landscape scales. These biases should temper the use of plots for extrapolations of forest dynamics to larger scales, and they demonstrate the need for a fundamental shift to high-resolution active remote sensing techniques as a primary sampling tool in tropical forest biomass studies. The potential decrease in the bias and uncertainty of remotely sensed estimates of forest structure and biomass is a vital step toward successful tropical forest conservation and climate-change mitigation policy.

MODISTools - downloading and processing MODIS remotely sensed data in R	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Remotely sensed data - available at medium to high resolution across global spatial and temporal scales - are a valuable resource for ecologists. In particular, products from NASA's MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), providing twice-daily global coverage, have been widely used for ecological applications. We present MODISTools, an R package designed to improve the accessing, downloading, and processing of remotely sensed MODIS data. MODISTools automates the process of data downloading and processing from any number of locations, time periods, and MODIS products. This automation reduces the risk of human error, and the researcher effort required compared to manual per-location downloads. The package will be particularly useful for ecological studies that include multiple sites, such as meta-analyses, observation networks, and globally distributed experiments. We give examples of the simple, reproducible workflow that MODISTools provides and of the checks that are carried out in the process. The end product is in a format that is amenable to statistical modeling. We analyzed the relationship between species richness across multiple higher taxa observed at 526 sites in temperate forests and vegetation indices, measures of aboveground net primary productivity. We downloaded MODIS derived vegetation index time series for each location where the species richness had been sampled, and summarized the data into three measures: maximum time-series value, temporal mean, and temporal variability. On average, species richness covaried positively with our vegetation index measures. Different higher taxa show different positive relationships with vegetation indices. Models had high R-2 values, suggesting higher taxon identity and a gradient of vegetation index together explain most of the variation in species richness in our data. MODISTools can be used on Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms, and is available from CRAN and GitHub ().

This paper presents a multidisciplinary approach used to assess historical land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes and their impacts on the environment in southeast Mato Grosso State, a region where the Cerrado has been intensively converted into agricultural lands. The methodology encompassed three main stages: (1) quantifying LULC changes using remote sensing data, (2) assessing LULC change impacts on vulnerable lands (e.g. erosion prone areas and wetlands), and (3) summarizing preceding information into key environmental indicators, assessed within the Pressure-State-Response framework (PSR) of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The results indicated a drastic landscape transformation in the selected area, which evolved from predominantly vegetated to a consolidated agricultural region. Crops expanded at high rates from 1985 to 1995, occupying the majority of the lands suited for agriculture. In the following decade, crops continued to expand and encroached into fragile environments (e.g. wetlands and more erodible soils). As a result, from 1985 to 2005, the area lost approximately 42% of its natural vegetation and erosion risks increased significantly. Our integration of land-use change information with intrinsic environmental vulnerabilities allowed a deeper understanding of LULC changes consequences and provided environmental indicators. This offered a synoptic view of how LULC changes occurred and how they affected the environment at a landscape scale. Furthermore, the assessment of the indicators using the PSR framework, helped to clarify cause-effect relationships thus furnishing key information of value to decision-makers and future comparisons with other areas.

Within recent decades, populations of this aquatic species have been heavily depleted and severely fragmented owing to habitat alteration and destruction by drainage and hydroelectricity dam constructions. Continuing habitat loss and fragmentation are considered the main drivers for the population decline of R. euphraticus.Intraspecific genetic variability was investigated using two mitochondrial gene fragments for 31 specimens covering most of the distributional range of the species. Habitat suitability models were computed using a combination of bioclimatic and remote sensing variables as environmental predictors to assess habitat suitability, habitat fragmentation and coverage by designated protected areas across the range of R. euphraticus.Beyond single substitutions in two sequences, no significant genetic variation could be detected in R. euphraticus. Models show habitat suitability to be high throughout the range of the species, although only a fraction is currently covered by reserves. Habitat suitability and coverage of reserves is highly variable among countries. South-western Iran appears to be of major importance for future conservation strategies. Suitability models are in concordance with the habitat selection patterns of R. euphraticusThe existing reserve system is considered insufficient and has to be significantly improved in order to sustain viable populations of R. euphraticus. To counter continuing fragmentation and alteration by dam construction, future conservation measures should focus on highlighted priority areas.

The afforestation of abandoned or degraded land is a practical approach to restore regional ecological functions and to sequester atmospheric carbon to help mitigate the global imbalance of atmospheric carbon associated with climate change. Large gaps, however, remain in understanding the dynamics of afforested tree communities. In this study, the effect of topographical relief and soil properties on growth performance of planted trees has been assessed. Above ground dry biomass (AGB(dry)) accumulation was estimated to evaluate the performance of afforested tree communities on formerly abandoned pastures at the Reserva Ecologica de Guapiacu, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The study revealed large discrepancies in AGBdry and respective organic carbon accumulationThe afforested tree community located on the sloped terrain stored only half the carbon (21.70 +/- 7.3 Mgha(-1)) that the planted trees on the flat terrain stored. (46.67 +/- 8.7 Mgha(-1)). Our results suggest that differences in tree growth performance are complex, depending largely on topography and related soil conditions. These circumstances should be considered to prevent misleading carbon sink estimates when developing regional strategies for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) that promote afforestation activities.

The Phragmites wetlands are extensively managed to maximize the production of reed biomass for the paper industry. Based on satellite remote sensing we estimated that the total area of the Phragmites wetlands has decreased from 857 km(2) in 2003 to 786 km(2) in 2009 to accommodate oil field infrastructure and societal developments. However, at the same time the production of Phragmites biomass used for the production of reed pulp has increased to 400,000 metric tons per year. This paper describes the great efforts that have been made to increase the Phragmites yields for the paper industry, including (1) diversion of freshwater from rivers to the Phragmites fields, (2) management of the water table, (3) harvesting and burning for pest control, and (4) seawater irrigation to rehabilitate Phragmites fields infested with weeds. The paper industry has facilitated the conservation of the Phragmites wetlands and their associated ecosystem services. Besides being a source for fiber, the wetlands provide important habitat for wildlife, sequester carbon, and create job opportunities and economic income for the local people. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The distribution and amount of carbon in the largest peatland complex in Amazonia	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Peatlands in Amazonian Peru are known to store large quantities of carbon, but there is high uncertainty in the spatial extent and total carbon stocks of these ecosystems. Here, we use a multi-sensor (Landsat, ALOS PALSAR and SRTM) remote sensing approach, together with field data including 24 forest census plots and 218 peat thickness measurements, to map the distribution of peatland vegetation types and calculate the combined above-and below-ground carbon stock of peatland ecosystems in the Pastaza-Maranon foreland basin in Peru. We find that peatlands cover 35 600 +/- 2133 km(2) and contain 3.14 (0.44-8.15) Pg C. Variation in peat thickness and bulk density are the most important sources of uncertainty in these values. One particular ecosystem type, peatland pole forest, is found to be the most carbon-dense ecosystem yet identified in Amazonia (1391 +/- 710 Mg C ha(-1)). The novel approach of combining optical and radar remote sensing with above-and below-ground carbon inventories is recommended for developing regional carbon estimates for tropical peatlands globally. Finally, we suggest that Amazonian peatlands should be a priority for research and conservation before the developing regional infrastructure causes an acceleration in the exploitation and degradation of these ecosystems.				icmol, icmol/I-5784-2015; Honorio Coronado, Euridice/K-3412-2015	Honorio Coronado, Euridice/0000-0003-2314-590X; Mitchard, Edward/0000-0002-5690-4055												1748-9326					DEC	2014	9	12							124017	10.1088/1748-9326/9/12/124017								WOS:000347454800018

Worldwide declines in the distribution and abundance of seagrasses and increased threats to coastal ecosystems from climate change have prompted a need to acquire baseline data for monitoring and protecting these important habitats. We assessed the distribution and abundance of eelgrass (Zostera marina) along nearly 1200 km of shoreline on the lower Alaska Peninsula, a region of expansive eelgrass meadows whose status and trends are poorly understood. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a multi-scale approach by using Landsat satellite imagery to map the total areal extent of eelgrass while integrating field survey data to improve map accuracy and describe the physical and biological condition of the meadows. Innovative use of proven methods and processing tools was used to address challenges inherent to remote sensing in high latitude, coastal environments. Eelgrass was estimated to cover similar to 31,000 ha, 91% of submerged aquatic vegetation on the lower Alaska Peninsula, nearly doubling the known spatial extent of eelgrass in the region. Mapping accuracy was 80%-90% for eelgrass distribution at locations containing adequate field survey data for error analysis.																	2072-4292					DEC	2014	6	12					12447	12477		10.3390/rs61212447								WOS:000346795300035

On the Front Line: frontal zones as priority at-sea conservation areas for mobile marine vertebrates	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												<list list-type="1" id="jpe12330-list-0001"> Identifying priority areas for marine vertebrate conservation is complex because species of conservation concern are highly mobile, inhabit dynamic habitats and are difficult to monitor. Many marine vertebrates are known to associate with oceanographic fronts - physical interfaces at the transition between water masses - for foraging and migration, making them important candidate sites for conservation. Here, we review associations between marine vertebrates and fronts and how they vary with scale, regional oceanography and foraging ecology. Accessibility, spatiotemporal predictability and relative productivity of front-associated foraging habitats are key aspects of their ecological importance. Predictable mesoscale (10s-100skm) regions of persistent frontal activity (frontal zones') are particularly significant. Frontal zones are hotspots of overlap between critical habitat and spatially explicit anthropogenic threats, such as the concentration of fisheries activity. As such, they represent tractable conservation units, in which to target measures for threat mitigation. Front mapping via Earth observation (EO) remote sensing facilitates identification and monitoring of these hotspots of vulnerability. Seasonal or climatological products can locate biophysical hotspots, while near-real-time front mapping augments the suite of tools supporting spatially dynamic ocean management.Synthesis and applications. Frontal zones are ecologically important for mobile marine vertebrates. We surmise that relative accessibility, predictability and productivity are key biophysical characteristics of ecologically significant frontal zones in contrasting oceanographic regions. Persistent frontal zones are potential priority conservation areas for multiple marine vertebrate taxa and are easily identifiable through front mapping via EO remote sensing. These insights are useful for marine spatial planning and marine biodiversity conservation, both within Exclusive Economic Zones and in the open oceans.

Land use is the results of various socioeconomic activities taking place at various urban and regional setups. In this paper, landscape dynamic characteristics are investigated by using remote sensing and geographic information system in mountainous watershed of Abha, Saudi Arabia. Land use classes were mapped and assessed from a time series of maps of year 2000-2010. The LULC transformations were also analyzed according to elevation and slope. Assessment of the data shows that LULC had undergone substantial changes in this semi-arid mountainous watershed from 2000 to 2010. During this period, the sparse vegetation and water bodies decreased from 48.47 to 39.31 km(2) and 0.30 to 0.11 km(2), respectively, whereas build-up area increased from 17.02 to 36.36 km(2). The area under water bodies has reduced due to construction activities, disturbance in drainage network, and sedimentation in the watershed. The areas having high altitudes were exposed to changes in landscape characteristic. In the regions having lower altitude (1,950-2,350), an agricultural land has decreased, whereas build-up land has increased. As a result of rough structure, only small flat areas, located in this sections and valley channels, may be used as build-up land. Slope gradient had also an influence on the distribution of LULC. The assessment of land use and land cover type distribution by slope category provided the baseline for the implementation of the nationwide land conservation policy of conversion of agricultural land to forestland in order to control high soil erosion risk. The changes in land use and land cover in the studied watershed were mainly controlled by human factors (land management, construction, and population pressure) rather than natural factors.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				DEC	2014	72	12			SI		4973	4984		10.1007/s12665-014-3408-1								WOS:000345407000021

We reviewed research published from 2007 to 2014 that incorporated very high-resolution satellite imagery to assess distribution, abundance, and effects of climate and other anthropogenic changes on populations of predators in polar regions. Very high-resolution imagery has been used to study 7 species of polar animals in 13 papers, many of which provide methods through which further research can be conducted. Use of very high-resolution imagery in the Southern Ocean can provide a broader understanding of climate and anthropogenic forces on populations and inform management and conservation recommendations. We recommend that conservation biologists continue to integrate high-resolution remote sensing into broad-scale biodiversity and population studies in remote areas, where it can provide much needed detail. Aplicaciones de Imagenes de Muy Alta Resolucion en el Estudio y Conservacion de Grandes Depredadores en el Oceano Antartico Resumen El Oceano Antartico es uno de los ecosistemas con rapidos cambios en el planeta debido a los efectos del cambio climatico y la pesca comercial de peces y kril ecologicamente importantes. Ya que se espera que la perdida de hielo este acompanada por declinaciones de depredadores de peces y kril, desacoplar los efectos de los cambios climaticos y antropogenicos de estas poblaciones de depredadores es crucial para el manejo basado en ecosistemas del Oceano Antartico. Revisamos investigaciones publicadas desde 2007 hasta 2014, las cuales incorporaron imagenes satelitales de muy alta resolucion para evaluar la distribucion, abundancia y efectos del clima y otros cambios antropogenicos sobre las poblaciones de depredadores en las regiones polares. Las imagenes de muy alta resolucion se han utilizado para estudiar siete especies de animales polares en 13 articulos, muchos de los cuales proporcionan metodos mediante los cuales se pueden llevar a cabo mas investigaciones. El uso de imagenes de muy alta resolucion en el Oceano Antartico puede proporcionar un entendimiento mas amplio de las fuerzas climaticas y antropogenicas que actuan sobre las poblaciones e informar a las recomendaciones de manejo y conservacion. Recomendamos que los biologos de la conservacion integren sensores remotos de alta resolucion en los estudios poblacionales y de biodiversidad a gran escala en areas remotas, donde puede proporcionar detalles muy necesitados.																	0888-8892	1523-1739				DEC	2014	28	6					1731	1735		10.1111/cobi.12367								WOS:000344794200030	25103277					
J	Malik, MI; Bhat, MS				Malik, Mohammad Imran; Bhat, M. Sultan			Integrated Approach for Prioritizing Watersheds for Management: A Study of Lidder Catchment of Kashmir Himalayas	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The Himalayan watersheds are susceptible to various forms of degradation due to their sensitive and fragile ecological disposition coupled with increasing anthropogenic disturbances. Owing to the paucity of appropriate technology and financial resources, the prioritization of watersheds has become an inevitable process for effective planning and management of natural resources. Lidder catchment constitutes a segment of the western Himalayas with an area of 1,159.38 km(2). The study is based on integrated analysis of remote sensing, geographic information system, field study, and socioeconomic data. Multicriteria evaluation of geophysical, land-use and land-cover (LULC) change, and socioeconomic indicators is carried out to prioritize watersheds for natural resource conservation and management. Knowledge-based weights and ranks are normalized, and weighted linear combination technique is adopted to determine final priority value. The watersheds are classified into four priority zones (very high priority, high priority, medium priority, and low priority) on the basis of quartiles of the priority value, thus indicating their ecological status in terms of degradation caused by anthropogenic disturbances. The correlation between priority ranks of individual indicators and integrated indicators is drawn. The results reveal that socioeconomic indicators are the most important drivers of LULC change and environmental degradation in the catchment. Moreover, the magnitude and intensity of anthropogenic impact is not uniform in different watersheds of Lidder catchment. Therefore, any conservation and management strategy must be formulated on the basis of watershed prioritization.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				DEC	2014	54	6					1267	1287		10.1007/s00267-014-0361-4								WOS:000345099900003	25267521

The vulnerability of groundwater can be tested by using the DRASTIC model for the pollutants. The groundwater susceptibility to pollution in the various areas is mapped through DRASTIC model. However, the effects of pollution types and its characteristics are not considered, as this model is used without any modifications. This technique must be standardized for usage in the various aquifers and specific pollution types. The rates of DRASTIC parameters are corrected to obtain the potential for a more accurate analysis of the vulnerability pollution. The relationships between the parameters are identified with respect to the nitrate concentration in the groundwater by calculating the new rates. The methodology was applied to the selected area situated in the south eastern region of Iran at Kerman plain. Twenty-seven different locations were selected to test and analyse the nitrate concentration in the water from underground wells. The pollution in the aquifer was associated and correlated with the DRASTIC index by using the measured nitrate concentrations. The relationship between the index and the measured pollution in the Kerman plain was determined by applying the Wilcoxon rank-sum nonparametric statistical tests and the rates were calculated. It was found specifically in the agricultural areas that the modified DRASTIC model performed more efficiently than the traditional method for nonpoint source pollution, as indicated by the results. After modifications, the regression coefficients revealed that the relationship between the vulnerability index and the nitrate concentration was 77 %, while it was 37 % before the modifications were used. These statistics show that the modified DRASTIC performed far more efficiently than the original version.

Prasada			Geospatial assessment and monitoring of historical forest cover changes (1920-2012) in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, Western Ghats, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Deforestation in the biosphere reserves, which are key Protected Areas has negative impacts on biodiversity, climate, carbon fluxes and livelihoods. Comprehensive study of deforestation in biosphere reserves is required to assess the impact of the management effectiveness. This article assesses the changes in forest cover in various zones and protected areas of Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, the first declared biosphere reserve in India which forms part of Western Ghats-a global biodiversity hotspot. In this study, we have mapped the forests from earliest available topographical maps and multi-temporal satellite data spanning from 1920's to 2012 period. Mapping of spatial extent of forest cover, vegetation types and land cover was carried out using visual interpretation technique. A grid cell of 1 km x 1 km was generated for time series change analysis to understand the patterns in spatial distribution of forest cover (1920-1973-1989-1999-2006-2012). The total forest area of biosphere reserve was found to be 5,806.5 km(2) (93.8 % of total geographical area) in 1920. Overall loss of forest cover was estimated as 1,423.6 km(2) (24.5 % of the total forest) with reference to 1920. Among the six Protected Areas, annual deforestation rate of > 0.5 was found in Wayanad wildlife sanctuary during 1920-1973. The deforestation in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve is mainly attributed to conversion of forests to plantations and agriculture along with submergence due to construction of dams during 1920 to 1989. Grid wise analysis indicates that 851 grids have undergone large-scale negative changes of > 75 ha of forest loss during 1920-1973 while, only 15 grids have shown > 75 ha loss during 1973-1989. Annual net rate of deforestation for the period of 1920 to 1973 was calculated as 0.5 followed by 0.1 for 1973 to 1989. Our analysis shows that there was large-scale deforestation before the declaration of area as biosphere reserve in 1986; however, the deforestation has drastically reduced after the declaration due to high degree of protection, thus indicating the secure future of reserve in the long term under the current forest management practices. The present work will stand as the most up-to-date assessment on the forest cover of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve with immediate applications in monitoring and management of forest biodiversity.

J	Guneralp, I; Filippi, AM; Randall, J				Gueneralp, Inci; Filippi, Anthony M.; Randall, Jarom			Estimation of floodplain aboveground biomass using multispectral remote sensing and nonparametric modeling	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Floodplain forests serve a critical function in the global carbon cycle because floodplains constitute an important carbon sink compared with other terrestrial ecosystems. Forests on dynamic floodplain landscapes, such as those created by river meandering processes, are characterized by uneven-aged trees and exhibit high spatial variability, reflecting the influence of interacting fluvial, hydrological, and ecological processes. Detailed and accurate mapping of aboveground biomass (AGB) on floodplain landscapes characterized by uneven-aged forests is critical for improving estimates of floodplain-forest carbon pools, which is useful for greenhouse gas (GHG) life cycle assessment. It would also help improve our process understanding of biomorphodynamics of river-floodplain systems, as well as planning and monitoring of conservation, restoration, and management of riverine ecosystems. Using stochastic gradient boosting (SGB), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and Cubist, we remotely estimate AGB of a bottom-land hardwood forest on a meander bend of a dynamic lowland river. As predictors, we use 30-m and 10-m multispectral image bands (Landsat 7 ETM+ and SPOT 5, respectively) and ancillary data. Our findings show that SGB and MARS significantly outperform Cubist, which is used for U.S. national-scale forest biomass mapping. Across all data-experiments and algorithms, at 10-m spatial resolution, SGB yields the best estimates (RMSE = 22.49 tonnes/ha; coefficient of determination (R-2)=0.96) when geomorphometric data are also included. On the other hand, at 30-m spatial resolution, MARS yields the best estimates (RMSE= 29.2 tonnes/ha; R-2 = 0.94) when image-derived data are also included. By enabling more accurate AGB mapping of floodplains characterized by uneven-aged forests, SGB and MARS provide an avenue for improving operational estimates of AGB and carbon at local, regional/continental, and global scales.

Limiting the necessary ground reference to a small sample of target habitats would greatly reduce and therefore support the field mapping effort. We thus aim to answer in this study the question: can semi-automated remote sensing methods help to map such patches without the need of ground references from sites not relevant for nature conservation? Approaches able to fulfill this task may help to improve the efficiency of large scale mapping and monitoring programs such as requested for the European Habitat Directive. In the present study, we used the maximum-entropy based classification approach Maxent to map four habitat types across a patchy landscape of 1000 km(2) near Munich, Germany. This task was conducted using the low number of 125 ground reference points only along with easily available multi-seasonal RapidEye satellite imagery. Encountered problems include the non-stationarity of habitat reflectance due to different phenological development across space, continuous transitions between the habitats and the need for improved methods for detailed validation. The result of the tested approach is a habitat map with an overall accuracy of 70%. The rather simple and affordable approach can thus be recommended for a first survey of previously unmapped areas, as a tool for identifying potential gaps in existing habitat inventories and as a first check for changes in the distribution of habitats.

Thus, an adequate inventory of existing tree cover is essential for conservation purposes. We combined ground samples and Quickbird imagery for mapping the canopy cover in a portion of unmanaged Quercus brantii stands. Orthorectified Quickbird imagery was preprocessed to derive a set of features to enhance the vegetation signal by minimizing solar irradiance effects. A recursive feature elimination was conducted to screen the predictor feature space. The random forest (RF) and support vector machines (SVMs) were applied for modeling. The input datasets were composed of four sets of predictors including the full set of predictors, the four original Quickbird bands, selected vegetation indices, and the soil line-based vegetation indices. The highest r(2) and lowest relative root mean square error (RMSE) were observed in modeling with total indices and the full data set in both modeling methods. Regardless of the input dataset used, the RF models outperformed the SVM by returning higher r(2) and lower relative RMSEs. It can be concluded that applying these methods and vegetation indices can provide useful information for the retrieval of canopy cover in mountainous, semiarid stands which is crucial for conservation practices in such areas.

Previous studies simulated degradation of temporally fixed networks but few quantified the change in network connectivity from disintegration of key features that undergo naturally occurring spatiotemporal dynamics. This is particularly of concern for aquatic systems, which typically show high natural spatiotemporal variability. Here we focused on the Swan Coastal Plain, a bioregion that encompasses a global biodiversity hotspot in Australia with over 1500 water bodies of high biodiversity. Using graph theory, we conducted a temporal analysis of water body connectivity over 13 years of variable climate. We derived large networks of surface water bodies using Landsat data (1999-2011). We generated an ensemble of 278 potential networks at three dispersal distances approximating the maximum dispersal distance of different water dependent organisms. We assessed network connectivity through several network topology metrics and quantified the resilience of the network topology during wet and dry phases. We identified 'stepping stone' water bodies across time and compared our networks with theoretical network models with known properties. Results showed a highly dynamic seasonal pattern of variability in network topology metrics. A decline in connectivity over the 13 years was noted with potential negative consequences for species with limited dispersal capacity. The networks described here resemble theoretical scale-free models, also known as 'rich get richer' algorithm. The 'stepping stone' water bodies are located in the area around the Peel-Harvey Estuary, a Ramsar listed site, and some are located in a national park. Our results describe a powerful approach that can be implemented when assessing the connectivity for a particular organism with known dispersal distance. The approach of identifying the surface water bodies that act as 'stepping stone' over time may help prioritize surface water bodies that are essential for maintaining regional scale connectivity.

Ecological and conservation research has provided a strong scientific background on identifying ecological health indicators and correspondingly making effective conservation plans. At the same time, ecologists have asserted a strong need for spatially explicit and temporally effective ecosystem health assessments based on remote sensing data. Currently, remote sensing of ecosystem health is only based on one ecosystem attribute: vigor, organization, or resilience. However, an effective ecosystem health assessment should be a comprehensive and dynamic measurement of the three attributes. This paper reviews opportunities of remote sensing, including optical, radar, and LiDAR, for directly estimating indicators of the three ecosystem attributes, discusses the main challenges to develop a remote sensing-based spatially-explicit comprehensive ecosystem health system, and provides some future perspectives. The main challenges to develop a remote sensing-based spatially-explicit comprehensive ecosystem health system are: (1) scale issue; (2) transportability issue; (3) data availability; and (4) uncertainties in health indicators estimated from remote sensing data. However, the Radarsat-2 constellation, upcoming new optical sensors on Worldview-3 and Sentinel-2 satellites, and improved technologies for the acquisition and processing of hyperspectral, multi-angle optical, radar, and LiDAR data and multi-sensoral data fusion may partly address the current challenges.

Quantifying Ancient Maya Land Use Legacy Effects on Contemporary Rainforest Canopy Structure	REMOTE SENSING												Human land use legacies have significant and long-lasting ecological impacts across landscapes. Investigating ancient (>400 years) legacy effects can be problematic due to the difficulty in detecting specific, historic land uses, especially those hidden beneath dense canopies. Caracol, the largest (similar to 200 km(2)) Maya archaeological site in Belize, was abandoned ca. A.D. 900, leaving behind myriad structures, causeways, and an extensive network of agricultural terraces that persist beneath the architecturally complex tropical forest canopy. Airborne LiDAR enables the detection of these below-canopy archaeological features while simultaneously providing a detailed record of the aboveground 3-dimensional canopy organization, which is indicative of a forest's ecological function. Here, this remote sensing technology is used to determine the effects of ancient land use legacies on contemporary forest structure. Canopy morphology was assessed by extracting LiDAR point clouds (0.25 ha plots) from LiDAR-identified terraced (n = 150) and non-terraced (n = 150) areas on low (0 degrees-10 degrees), medium (10 degrees-20 degrees), and high (>20 degrees) slopes. We calculated the average canopy height, canopy openness, and vertical diversity from the LiDAR returns, with topographic features (i.e., slope, elevation, and aspect) as covariates. Using a PerMANOVA procedure, we determined that forests growing on agricultural terraces exhibited significantly different canopy structure from those growing on non-terraced land. Terraces appear to mediate the effect of slope, resulting in less structural variation between slope and non-sloped land and yielding taller, more closed, more vertically diverse forests. These human land uses abandoned >1000 years ago continue to impact contemporary tropical rainforests having implications related to arboreal habitat and carbon storage.																	2072-4292					NOV	2014	6	11					10716	10732		10.3390/rs61110716								WOS:000345530700022

UAVs offer the potential to collect detailed spatial information in real time at relatively low cost and are being used increasingly in conservation and ecological research. Within infectious disease epidemiology and public health research, UAVs can provide spatially and temporally accurate data critical to understanding the linkages between disease transmission and environmental factors. Using UAVs avoids many of the limitations associated with satellite data (e.g., long repeat times, cloud contamination, low spatial resolution). However, the practicalities of using UAVs for field research limit their use to specific applications and settings. UAVs fill a niche but do not replace existing remote-sensing methods.

SPATIAL VARIABILITY IN SPAWNING HABITAT SELECTION BY CHINOOK SALMON (ONCORHYNCHUS TSHAWYTSCHA) IN A WILDERNESS RIVER	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) survival during early life stages depends largely on spawning habitat selection by adults, which has been linked to biophysical stream variables (e.g. stream flow, velocity and substrate composition) as well as hyporheic exchange associated with riffle/pool and run/pool transitions. To examine how physical habitat variables influenced spawning habitat choice in one central Idaho (USA) wilderness stream, we used remote sensing techniques to classify and quantify the total amount of each aquatic habitat type present to assess how habitat quantity changed as stream order increased. Additionally, we measured physical habitat variables at each redd throughout the entire stream length for one spawning season to assess whether Chinook salmon selected for the same habitat parameters at varying spatial scales. Run, riffle and pool habitat types contributed similar proportions to the total area in both the upper and lower basins. However, transitional zones' (i.e. pool-riffle and pool-run transitions) accounted for 16% of the total area in the upper basin and only 4% in the lower. Redds were built in multiple habitat types in each of the three primary spawning locations, but transitional zones were chosen most frequently only in the upper basin. Significant differences in habitat variables were seen between spawning groups, with stream wetted width and velocity accounting for the majority of the variation. The techniques described here could be used to locate features that serve as indicators of potential spawning habitat, although caution should be exercised when extrapolating spawning habitat needs over large spatial extents.

Predicting the distribution of deep-sea vulnerable marine ecosystems using high-resolution data: Considerations and novel approaches	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Little is known about species distribution patterns in deep-sea environments, primarily because sampling surveys in the high seas are expensive and time consuming. The increasing need to manage and protect vulnerable marine ecosystems, such as cold-water corals, has motivated the use of predictive modelling tools, which produce continuous maps of potential species or habitat distribution from limited point observations and full coverage environmental data. Rapid advances in acoustic remote sensing, oceanographic modelling and sampling technology now provide high quality datasets, facilitating model development with high spatial detail. This paper provides a short overview of existing methodologies for predicting deep-sea benthic species distribution, and illustrates emerging issues related to spatial and thematic data resolution, and the use of transect-derived species distribution data. In order to enhance the ecological relevance and reliability of deep-sea species distribution models, novel techniques are presented based on a case study predicting the distribution of the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa in three carbonate mound provinces in Irish waters. Specifically, the study evaluates (1) the capacity of newly developed high-resolution (250 m grid cell size) hydrodynamic variables to explain local scale cold-water coral distribution patterns, (2) the potential value of species occurrence proportion data to maintain semi-quantitative information of coral prevalence (i.e. coverage) and sampling effort per grid cell within the response variable, and (3) mixed effect modelling to deal with spatially grouped transect data. The study shows that predictive models using vertical and horizontal flow parameters perform significantly better than models based on terrain parameters only. Semiquantitative proportion data may decrease model uncertainty and increase model reliability, and provide a fruitful avenue of research for analysing large quantities of video data in a detailed yet time-efficient manner. The study concludes with an outlook of how species distribution models could improve our understanding of vulnerable marine ecosystem functioning and processes in the deep sea. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

K.; Tipdecho, Taravudh			Ecosystem evaluation (1989-2012) of Ramsar wetland Deepor Beel using satellite-derived indices	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The unprecedented urban growth especially in developing countries has laid immense pressure on wetlands, finally threatening their existence altogether. A long-term monitoring of wetland ecosystems is the basis of planning conservation measures for a sustainable development. Deepor Beel, a Ramsar wetland and major storm water basin of the River Brahmaputra in the northeastern region of India, needs particular attention due to its constant degradation over the past decades. A rule-based classification algorithm was developed using Landsat (2011)-derived indices, namely Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalised Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Normalised Difference Pond Index (NDPI), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and field data as ancillary information. Field data, ALOS AVNIR and Google Earth images were used for accuracy assessment. A fuzzy accuracy assessment of the classified data sets showed an overall accuracy of 82 % for MAX criteria and 90 % for RIGHT criteria. The rules were used to classify major wetland cover types during low water season (January) in 1989, 2001 and 2012. The statistical analysis of the classified wetland showed heavy manifestation in aquatic vegetation and other features indicating severe eutrophication over the past 23 years. This degradation was closely related to major contributing anthropogenic factors, such as a railway line construction, growing croplands, waste disposal and illegal human settlements in the wetland catchment. In addition, the landscape development index (LDI) indicated a rapid increase in the impact of the surrounding land use on the wetland from 1989 to 2012. The techniques and results from this study may prove useful for top-down landscape analyses of this and other freshwater wetlands.

Research into the development and causes of landscape fragmentation in wetlands is urgently needed for effective monitoring and protection of wetlands. We use a combination of techniques including remote sensing, a landscape index model, and redundancy analysis to analyze landscape fragmentation and its driving forces in the middle reaches of the Heihe River from both temporal and spatial perspectives. A new mathematic morphological method that enhances the credibility of landscape fragmentation analysis without changing the original pixel size of the interpreted data is proposed for the calculation of landscape indices. The combination of this new mathematic morphological method and traditional landscape pattern indices enhances the evaluation strategy for landscape fragmentation. Our results demonstrate that the fragmentation processes that affect the wetland landscape of the study area are primarily represented as the shrinking of core wetland area and decrease in mean size of wetland patches. Our results also show an increase in the fragmentation index (FS) of the landscape in recent decades. The impacts of natural factors on wetland landscape fragmentation processes are typically reflected in changes in climate and hydrology. In the study area, temperature, which is more important than precipitation in driving wetland landscape fragmentation processes, cannot be omitted. In addition, our analysis proves that unnecessary human activity is a major threat for sustainable development and maintenance of wetlands. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We developed a new approach applying innovative methods of hyperspectral remote sensing to bridge the existing gap between remote sensing technology and the demands of the nature conservation community. Remote sensing has already proven to be a valuable monitoring instrument. However, the approaches lack the consideration of the demands of applied nature conservation which includes the legal demands of the EU Habitat Directive. Following the idea of the Vital Signs Monitoring in the USA, we identified a subset of the highest priority monitoring indicators for our study area. We analyzed continuous spectral response curves and tested the measurability of N=19 indicators on the basis of complexity levels aggregated from extensive vegetation assemblages. The spectral differentiability for the floristic as well as faunistic indicators revealed values up to 100% accuracy. We point out difficulties when it comes to distinguishing faunistic habitat requirements of several species adapted to dry open landscapes, which in this case results in OVERALL ACCURACY of 67, 87-95, and 35% in the error matrix. In summary, we provide an applicable and feasible method to facilitating monitoring military areas by hyperspectral remote sensing in the following. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Remote sensing and conservation of isolated indigenous villages in Amazonia	ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE												The vast forests on the border between Brazil and Peru harbour a number of indigenous groups that have limited contact with the outside world. Accurate estimates of population sizes and village areas are essential to begin assessing the immediate conservation needs of such isolated groups. In contrast to overflights and encounters on the ground, remote sensing with satellite imagery offers a safe, inexpensive, non-invasive and systematic approach to provide demographic and land-use information for isolated peoples. Satellite imagery can also be used to understand the growth of isolated villages over time. There are five isolated villages in the headwaters of the Envira River confirmed by overflights that are visible with recent satellite imagery further confirming their locations and allowing measurement of their cleared gardens, village areas and thatch roofed houses. These isolated villages appear to have population densities that are an order of magnitude higher than averages for other Brazilian indigenous villages. Here, we report on initial results of a remote surveillance programme designed to monitor movements and assess the demographic health of isolated peoples as a means to better mitigate against external threats to their long-term survival.																	2054-5703					NOV	2014	1	3							140246	10.1098/rsos.140246								WOS:000209732000011	26064561

Remotely sensed data with very high spatial resolution are currently used to study vegetation, but most satellite sensors are limited to four spectral bands, which is insufficient to identify some natural vegetation formations. The study objectives are to discriminate natural vegetation and identify natural vegetation formations using a Worldview-2 satellite image. The classification of the Worldview-2 image and ancillary thematic data was performed using a hybrid pixel-based and object-oriented approach. A hierarchical scheme using three levels was implemented, from land cover at a field scale to vegetation formation. This method was applied on a 48 km(2) site located on the French Atlantic coast which includes a classified NATURA 2000 dune and marsh system. The classification accuracy was very high, the Kappa index varying between 0.90 and 0.74 at land cover and vegetation formation levels respectively. These results show that Wordlview-2 images are suitable to identify natural vegetation. Vegetation maps derived from Worldview-2 images are more detailed than existing, ones. They provide a useful medium for environmental management of vulnerable areas. The approach used to map natural vegetation is reproducible for a wider application by environmental managers.

J	Godar, J; Gardner, TA; Tizado, EJ; Pacheco, P				Godar, Javier; Gardner, Toby A.; Tizado, E. Jorge; Pacheco, Pablo			Actor-specific contributions to the deforestation slowdown in the Brazilian Amazon	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Annual deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon fell by 77% between 2004 and 2011, yet have stabilized since 2009 at 5,0007,000 km(2). We provide the first submunicipality assessment, to our knowledge, of actor-specific contributions to the deforestation slowdown by linking agricultural census and remote-sensing data on deforestation and forest degradation. Almost half (36,158 km(2)) of the deforestation between 2004 and 2011 occurred in areas dominated by larger properties (> 500 ha), whereas only 12% (9,720 km(2)) occurred in areas dominated by smallholder properties (< 100 ha). In addition, forests in areas dominated by smallholders tend to be less fragmented and less degraded. However, although annual deforestation rates fell during this period by 68-85% for all actors, the contribution of the largest landholders (> 2,500 ha) to annual deforestation decreased over time (63% decrease between 2005 and 2011), whereas that of smallholders went up by a similar amount (69%) during the same period. In addition, the deforestation share attributable to remote areas increased by 88% between 2009 and 2011. These observations are consistent across the Brazilian Amazon, regardless of geographical differences in actor dominance or socioenvironmental context. Our findings suggest that deforestation policies to date, which have been particularly focused on command and control measures on larger properties in deforestation hotspots, may be increasingly limited in their effectiveness and fail to address all actors equally. Further reductions in deforestation are likely to be increasingly costly and require actor-tailored approaches, including better monitoring to detect small-scale deforestation and a shift toward more incentive-based conservation policies.

J	Hou, W; Walz, U				Hou, Wei; Walz, Ulrich			Extraction of small biotopes and ecotones from multi-temporal RapidEye data and a high-resolution normalized digital surface model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The conservation of habitats and habitat complexes in diverse landscapes is increasingly recognized as a crucial factor in sustaining biodiversity and ecosystems. For the successful management of landscapes, habitat monitoring is necessary, but often small biotopes, e.g. scattered trees, copses, tree rows, hedges, and the transition zones between ecosystems, are ignored. This is important as such small biotopes are recognized as keystone elements in landscape structure for habitat networks. Furthermore, the transition zones between different habitats, often called ecotones, are dynamic and play several functional roles in landscape ecology. This article presents an approach for the extraction of small biotopes and ecotones combining object-based and pixel-based image analysis. Both high-resolution digital elevation data from airborne laser scanning and multi-temporal RapidEye remote-sensing data were used to automatically detect landscape elements and landscape patterns. First, multi-temporal RapidEye images were used to classify the main land-use classes using object-based image analysis. In the second step, a high-resolution digital surface model was integrated with the main classes, and small biotopes and ecotones were delineated by means of pixel-based image analysis. Classification accuracy for main land-use classes is above 92%, and a visual assessment using aerial image and onsite investigation show that the identification results for small biotopes well match reality. The results show the effectiveness of the classification strategy developed and the potential for incorporating the detailed surface mapping in heterogeneous vegetated areas.
