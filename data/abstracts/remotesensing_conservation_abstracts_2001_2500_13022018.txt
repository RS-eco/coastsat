J	Lee, TM; Yeh, HC				Lee, Tsai-Ming; Yeh, Hui-Chung			Applying remote sensing techniques to monitor shifting wetland vegetation: A case study of Danshui River estuary mangrove communities, Taiwan	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The purpose of this study is to apply different remote sensing techniques to monitor shifting mangrove vegetation in the Danshui River estuary in Taipei, Taiwan, in order to evaluate a long-term wetland conservation strategy compromising between comprehensive wetland ecosystem management and urban development. In the Danshui estuary, mangrove dominated by Kandelia candel is the major vegetation, and a large area of marsh with freshwater grasses has been protected in three reserves along the river shore. This study applied satellite imagery from different remote sensors of various resolutions for spectral analysis in order to compare shifting wetland vegetation communities at different times. A two-stage analytical process was used for extracting vegetation area and types. In the first-stage, a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was adopted to analyze SPOT, Landsat, and QuickBird imagery to obtain the spatial distribution of vegetation covers. In the second stage, a maximum likelihood classification (MLC) program was used to classify mangrove and non-mangrove areas. The results indicated that the spatial distribution of mangroves expanded 15.18 and 40 ha in two monitoring sites in 10 years, demonstrating the success of establishing reserves for protecting mangrove habitats. The analytical results also indicated that satellite imagery can easily discern the difference in characteristics between imagery of mangrove and other vegetation types, and that the logistical disadvantages of monitoring long-term vegetation community changes as well as evaluating an inaccessible area may be overcome by applying remote sensing techniques.

J	Bahadur, KCK				Bahadur, K. C. Krishna			Mapping soil erosion susceptibility using remote sensing and GIS: a case of the Upper Nam Wa Watershed, Nan Province, Thailand	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												Land degradation is still a very common problem in the mountains of Asia because of inappropriate land use practice in steep topography. Many studies have been carried out to map shifting cultivation and areas susceptible to soil erosion. Mostly, estimated soil loss is taken as the basis to classify the level of soil loss susceptibility of area. Factors that influence soil erosion are: rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, slope length and steepness, crop management and conservation practices. Thus the reliability of estimated soil loss is based on how accurately the different factors were estimated or prepared. As each and every small pixel of our earth surface is different from one area to another, the manner in which the study area was discretized into smaller homogenous sizes and how the most accurate and efficient technique were adopted to estimate the soil loss are very important. The purpose of this study is to produce erosion susceptibility maps for an area that has suffered because of shifting cultivation located in the mountainous regions of Northern Thailand. For this purpose, an integrated approach using RS and GIS-based methods is proposed. Data from the Upper Nam Wa Watershed, a mountainous area of the Northern Thailand were used. An Earth Resources Data Analysis System (ERDAS) imagine image processor has been used for the digital analysis of satellite data and topographical analysis of the contour data for deriving the land use/land cover and the topographical data of the watershed, respectively. ARCInfo and ARCView have been used for carrying out geographical data analysis. The watershed was discretized into hydrologically, topographically, and geographically homogeneous grid cells to capture the watershed heterogeneity. The soil erosion in each cell was calculated using the universal soil loss equation (USLE) by carefully determining its various parameters and classifying the watershed into different levels of soil erosion severity. Results show that during the time of this study most of the areas under shifting cultivation fell in the highest severity class of susceptibility.

Mapping Grazing-Induced Degradation in a Semi-Arid Environment: A Rapid and Cost Effective Approach for Assessment and Monitoring	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Improved techniques for measuring and monitoring the state of biodiversity are required for reporting on national obligations to international and regional conservation institutions. Measuring the extent of grazing-related degradation in semi-arid ecosystems has proved difficult. Here we present an accurate and cost-effective method for doing this, and apply it in a South African semi-arid region that forms part of a globally significant biodiversity hotspot. We grouped structurally and functionally similar vegetation units, which were expert-mapped at the 1:50,000 scale, into four habitat types, and developed habitat-specific degradation models. We quantified degradation into three categories, using differences between dry and wet season values of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the three succulent karoo habitats, and the difference between maximum and mean NDVI values for the subtropical thicket habitat. Field evaluation revealed an accuracy of 86%. Overall, degradation was high: 24% of the study area was modeled as severely degraded, and only 9% as intact. Levels of degradation were highest for bottomland habitats that were most exposed to grazing impacts. In sharp contrast to our methods, a widely used, broad-scale and snapshot assessment of land cover in South Africa was only 33% accurate, and it considerably underestimated the extent of severely degraded habitat in the study area. While our approach requires a multidisciplinary team, and in particular expert knowledge on the characteristics and spatial delimitation of vegetation types, it is repeatable, rapid, and relatively inexpensive. Consequently, it holds great promise for monitoring and evaluation programs in semi-arid ecosystems, in Africa, and beyond.

However, coasts, with their fertile soil and unique flora and fauna, need to be protected. In order for the use of such areas to be planned in a sustainable way by local authorities, there is a need for detailed data about these regions. In this study, the changes in land use of the area between Topburnu and U double dagger burun Musa Bey Harbour on the Ce angstrom me peninsula, which is to the immediate west of Turkey's third largest city &Aumlaut degrees zmir, from 1976 up to the present day, were investigated. In the study, using aerial photographs taken in 1976, 1995 and 2000 and an IKONOS satellite image from the year 2007, the natural and cultural characteristics of the region and changes in the coastline were determined spatially. Using aerial photographs from 1976, 1995 and 2000 and an IKONOS satellite image from the year 2007, together with "1/25,000 scale Conservation-Oriented Development Plans" prepared in 1979, 1990 and 2000 by the committee for the Preservation of Natural and Cultural Entities attached to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of the Turkish Republic, the natural and cultural characteristics of the region and the land use changes and their connection with conservation rulings were determined spatially. In this study, spatial changes in land use over the years were compared with changing conservation rulings over the years and the emerging results have brought a new perspective to the subject in contrast to other similar studies.																	0167-6369					APR	2009	151	1-4					457	476		10.1007/s10661-008-0289-3								WOS:000263832800044	18484188

A strong climatic contrast is imposed by the mountains - Cerrado phyto-physiognomies predominate in the low lands to the west and eastern mountainsides sustain fragments of Atlantic forest, which was previously continuous all around the valley of the Doce river, with white cecropias (Cecropia hololeuca), jussara palm (Euterpe edulis), and indaias (Attalea oleifera). Even without species that are typical of the Cerrado, official maps consider these mountainsides as open savannas, a mistake that was possibly due either to the difficulty to discern, on satellite images, different kinds of open vegetation on sandy soils, to the degradation of forests, or to the scale employed in biome delimitation. Based on old and recent scientific testimonies, field mapping of the distribution of arborous species mentioned above, which are indicative of the Atlantic Forest and easy to visualize and on the contiguity of forests and the positioning of seasonal fronts, we have re-delimited the Atlantic Forest biome in the area at 1:1.00,000 scale, adding 49,856ha (Serra do Cipo National Park: area of 8,067ha; Morro da Pedreira EPA, which surrounds it: area of 41,789ha), still under great deforestation pressure, recommending that it is included in actions and plans directed to the Atlantic Forest and subsidizing the zoning and management of the two PAS. Viewing rupestrine fields, which are already considered an autonomous phytocoenosis, as inserted between two rich and dynamic biomes also helps understanding its evolution.																	1679-0073					APR	2009	7	1					146	165										WOS:000274068500003

Evaluating AISA plus Hyperspectral Imagery for Mapping Black Mangrove along the South Texas Gulf Coast	PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING												Mangrove wetlands are economically and ecologically important ecosystems and accurate assessment of these wetlands with remote sensing can assist in their management and conservation. This study was conducted to evaluate airborne ATSA+ hyperspectral imagery and image transformation and classification techniques for mapping black mangrove populations on the south Texas Gulf coast. AISA+ hyperspectral imagery was acquired from two study sites, and both minimum noise fraction (MNF) and inverse MNF transforms were performed. Four classification methods, including minimum distance, Mahalanobis distance, maximum likelihood, and spectral angle mapper (SAM), were applied to the noise-reduced hyperspectral imagery and to the band-reduced MNF imagery for distinguishing black mangrove from associated plant species and other cover types, Accuracy assessment showed that overall accuracy varied from 84 percent to 95 percent for site 1 and from 69 percent to 91 percent for site 2 among the eight classifications for each site. The MNF images provided similar or better classification results compared with the hyperspectral images among the four classifiers. Kappa analysis showed that there were no significant differences among the four classifiers with the MNF imagery, though maximum likelihood provided excellent overall and class accuracies for both sites. Producer's and user's accuracies for black mangrove were 91 percent and 94 percent, respectively, for site 1 and both 91 percent for site 2 based on maximum likelihood applied to the MNF imagery. These results indicate that airborne hyperspectral imagery combined with image transformation and classification techniques can be a useful tool for monitoring and mapping black mangrove distributions in coastal environments.																	0099-1112					APR	2009	75	4					425	435		10.14358/PERS.75.4.425								WOS:000264992100009						
J	Helmuth, B				Helmuth, Brian			From cells to coastlines: how can we use physiology to forecast the impacts of climate change?	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												The interdisciplinary fields of conservation physiology, macrophysiology, and mechanistic ecological forecasting have recently emerged as means of integrating detailed physiological responses to the broader questions of ecological and evolutionary responses to global climate change. Bridging the gap between large-scale records of weather and climate (as measured by remote sensing platforms, buoys and ground-based weather stations) and the physical world as experienced by organisms (niche-level measurements) requires a mechanistic understanding of how 'environmental signals' (parameters such as air, surface and water temperature, food availability, water flow) are translated into signals at the scale of the organism or cell (e. g. body temperature, food capture, hydrodynamic force, aerobic capacity). Predicting the impacts of how changing environments affect populations and ecosystems further mandates an understanding of how organisms 'filter' these signals via their physiological response (e. g. whether they respond to high or low frequencies, whether there is a time lag in response, etc.) and must be placed within the context of adult movement and the dispersal of larvae and gametes. Recent studies have shown that patterns of physiological stress in nature are far more complex in space and time than previously assumed and challenge the long-held paradigm that patterns of biogeographic distribution can be based on simple environmental gradients. An integrative, systems-based approach can provide an understanding of the roles of environmental and physiological variability in driving ecological responses and can offer considerable insight and predictive capacity to researchers, resource managers and policy makers involved in planning for the current and future effects of climate change.

Ecology, Economics, and Equity of the Pastoral Systems in the Khangchendzonga National Park, Sikkim Himalaya, India	AMBIO												The Khangchendzonga National Park is a part of the eastern Himalaya global biodiversity hotspot and is located in the Sikkim state of India. Increasing livestock populations coupled with the government policy to ban grazing and its selective implementation resulted in conflict. Hence we undertook this multidisciplinary study involving consultations with traditional resource users, field surveys, and remote sensing. We found that in the greater Himalayan part, over the past 6 decades sheep have been increasingly replaced by yaks (and their crossbreeds), who descend only up to the multilayered temperate and subalpine forests during winter. These forests have been extensively manipulated by the yak herders to increase the fodder availability. In terms of economics and equity in benefit sharing, we found that a few yak herders earn high incomes by maintaining large herds while the sheep and pack animal herders earn subsistence level incomes from small herds. We propose a reduction in yak (and their female crossbreed) numbers with adequate alternative livelihood support for the herders.																	0044-7447					MAR	2009	38	2					95	100		10.1579/0044-7447-38.2.95								WOS:000264443200006	19431939

Despite their biodiversity value, many IBAs are threatened by habitat degradation and a high proportion lack legal protection. We integrate an inventory of these IBAs with remote sensing data to identify patterns that could be used to assess priorities for monitoring and conservation. Land cover composition in IBAs differed significantly from that in buffer zones of the same area immediately Surrounding them and was significantly more homogeneous. Agriculture and deforestation were the most prevalent threats to IBAs, particularly in IBAs containing a high proportion of dense forest or shrub. Human population density within IBAs was no lower than that immediately outside IBAs, and was around three times higher than the average for sub-Saharan Africa. However, projected human population growth was lower than the average for sub-Saharan Africa, with the projected increase greatest in IBAs with a high proportional cover of dense forest and mosaic woodland and lowest in IBAs with a higher grassland component. Fifty seven percent of IBAs fell within or overlapped Protected Areas, though this percentage differed between different categories of IBA. IBAs that were included within Protected Areas supported a greater number of globally threatened bird species and contained proportionally more dense forest, woodland and shrub than IBAs falling outside Protected Areas. IBAs outside Protected Areas contained a high proportion of mosaic woodland and open water, suggesting that Such habitats are under-protected in Africa. We suggest that because the most prevalent threats to IBAs involve changes in land cover that could be detected from satellites, remote sensing could play an important role in the monitoring of African IBAs. This would permit monitoring of a wider range of sites than is possible solely by conventional, ground-based approaches.																	0959-2709	1474-0001				MAR	2009	19	1					49	61		10.1017/S0959270908007697								WOS:000264692000005

Rapid change of land use has occurred in the red soil hilly region of southeast China in the past three decades due to rural land reform, population pressure and rapid economic growth. In this paper, land use change and its impacts on environmental quality of Xianning County were investigated using technologies of remote sensing (RS), geographic information systems (GIS), and spatial principal components analysis (SPCA). It was indicated that the area of paddy field and upland decline rapidly while the area of woodland, horticulture farm and residential land increased sharply between 1978 and 2002. The driving forces probably were land use policy of the State government, structural adjustment of agricultural sectors and implementation of environmental conservation measures. Based on the assessment of environmental implications of land use practices, the environmental quality of some land use types (i.e. Woodland, sparse woodland, and paddy field) tended to improve, while horticulture farms, water body, and residential land showed a deterioration trend of environmental quality during 1978-2002. Perhaps the most significant finding of this study is that environment appears a negative tendency in the study area from 1991 to 2002, because little attention has been paid to the status and management of agricultural lands, which account for a substantial proportion of total land area. Therefore, for further improving environment in red soil hilly region in China, urgent action is required to improve the advisory services support to farmers on new tillage practices, soil and water conservation practices, raising the efficiency of fertilizer and manure use.

Due to their high ecological value, monitoring of arid regions is necessary and modern vegetation studies can help in the conservation and management of these areas. The use of remote sensing for mapping of desert vegetation is difficult due to mixing of the spectral reflectance of bright desert soils with the weak spectral response of sparse vegetation. We studied the vegetation types in the semiarid to arid region of Mond Protected Area, south-west Iran, based on unsupervised classification of the Spot XS bands and then produced updated maps. Sixteen map units covering 12 vegetation types were recognized in the area based on both field works and satellite mapping. Halocnemum strobilaceum and Suaeda fruticosa vegetation types were the dominant types and Ephedra foliata, Salicornia europaea-Suaeda heterophylla vegetation types were the smallest. Vegetation coverage decreased sharply with the increase in salinity towards the coastal areas of the Persian Gulf. The highest vegetation coverage belonged to the riparian vegetation along the Mond River, which represents the northern boundary of the protected area. The location of vegetation types was studied on the separate soil and habitat diversity maps of the study area, which helped in final refinements of the vegetation map produced.

Yet the rates and spatial patterns of post-socialist land use change remain largely unclear. We used Landsat TM/ETM+ images to classify land cover maps and assess landscape pattern changes from 1990 to 2005 in Arge angstrom County, Southern Romania. Cropland abandonment was the most widespread change (21.1% abandonment rate), likely due to declining returns from farming, tenure insecurity, and demographic developments during transition. Forest cover and forest fragmentation remained remarkably stable during transition, despite widespread ownership transfers. Cropland abandonment provides opportunities for increased carbon sequestration, but threatens cultural landscapes and biodiversity. Continued monitoring is important for assessing whether abandoned croplands will eventually reforest or be put back into production and to better understand the consequences of post-socialist land use change for ecosystems and biodiversity.

A LINEAR PHOTOGRAMMETRIC METHOD FOR MEASURING EROSION IN AGRICULTURAL FIELDS	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												Erosion is defined as the displacement of solid particles originating from soil, rock, and sediments by forces of wind, water, and ice. Erosion affects soil microtopography and surface roughness, leading to clogging of surface drainage systems, flooding, and destruction of the tipper part of the soil structure cross-section, and cause damages to cultivated land. Therefore, monitoring changes in the amount and rate of soil erosion is important for agricultural planning as well as for planning the use of different soil conservation systems. This article describes a scheme combining terrestrial photogrammetry and image analysis for measuring erosion amounts and estimating the change in volume of raised beds resulting front irrigation or rainstorms in cultivated fields. The method was validated on ridged and furrowed potato fields on sandy and loam soils (Typic Rhodoxeralfs) in the coastal plain of Israel. Unlike existing methods that are labor intensive and error prone, the approach described here enables a high-level of automation and accuracy while making use of low-cost digital cameras. Emphasis is placed on parameters for robustness of the model and on linear methods that do not require approximate parameters for the photogrammetric solution, thus enabling the use of consumer cameras. Experiments show that accurate results can be achieved in estimating volume and erosion. The accuracy of the measurements is of 0.007 m(3) per 1000 m(2).																	0001-2351					MAR-APR	2009	52	2					437	445										WOS:000265736400012

A hydrological numerical simulation contributes to an understanding of the relationship between flood control policy and inundation areas. The numerical simulation consists of a dynamic wave model in channels and a non-Uniform flow model in inundation areas, which estimate the temporal and spatial dynamic distributions of water depth. In economics, an overlapping generations model expresses the economy's growth process considering flood magnitude and flood protection. This economic model is composed of industrial and agricultural production functions which are affected by flood control policies. The hydrological and economic models are verified by remote sensing images and data from the economic development of Thailand, respectively. Combining these two models, we call identify the area to protect and accept floods for regional development. Wide areas along the rivers should be flooded due to the benefits from fertilization for inundation agriculture in Cambodia. The conservation area should be about 2000 km(2), and the spatial distribution of flooding should be identified. In the beginning of an economic growth period, there is little difference in the production of all inundation area in the range of 0-2000 km(2). As the inundation area becomes larger, the production rate is larger in the stable growth period. This study explains that inundation agriculture should be maintained in riverside areas which supply much of the agricultural production in Cambodia.

Assessment of ecosystem services and the factors that threaten them is an important first step to support watershed management. This, however, requires detailed information that is often missing in mountainous regions. To overcome this, in this paper, we adopt a decision tree approach to assess protection, biodiversity, and production services in two mountainous watersheds (Fengqing and Xiaojie) of the Lancang River Basin. Decision tree rules were built on the basis of field surveys, available references, ecosystem maps derived from remote sensing, expert knowledge, basic topographic information, and community interviews. Decision tree results showed that forest cover and agro-forestry practices contribute greatly to improved ecosystem functioning in the Fengqing Catchment compared to the Xiaojie Catchment. The results were consistent with field observations. The decision tree method proved to be a suitable and flexible tool for the rapid assessment of watershed ecosystem services, for highlighting those areas that need more in-depth research, and for guiding watershed and ecosystem management.

Habitat suitability, threats and conservation of isolated populations of the smooth snake (Coronella austriaca) in the southern Iberian Peninsula	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												During the Pleistocene, climatic fluctuations due to glacial and interglacial periods greatly modified the distribution of boreal organisms. One direct effect of these distribution shifts is that, along the southern edge of the range of some boreal species, populations persist only in isolated patches of suitable habitats, surrounded by less suitable areas. Isolated populations in marginal habitat are vulnerable to several threats, including climate change, anthropogenic threats, and stochastic events. We developed habitat-suitability models using Ecological Niche Factor Analysis for populations of the smooth snake, Coronella austriaca, at the southernmost limit of the species range. These models were based on historical and current records of occurrence, coupled with remote sensing data including elevation, slope, and climatic variables. Our results indicated that C. austriaca in the Iberian Peninsula occurred in areas associated with high slope and precipitation, low temperatures, and low variation in seasonal temperature and precipitation compared to areas of non-occurrence. At a broad scale, the areas classified as highly suitable for the species in the southern Iberian Peninsula were small and fragmented. At a local scale, extensive field work demonstrated that C. austriaca occurs in low densities in these areas. In addition, we detected several human-induced threats like habitat loss, favoured by temperature increase and rainfall reduction. Several life-history traits, such as dietary specialization and low frequency reproduction, also may contribute to the vulnerability of these populations to local extinctions. Although the most suitable southernmost areas are included in protected reserves, specific guidelines for management are needed to assess conservation needs. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Forest Dynamics in the Eastern Ghats of Tamil Nadu, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The primary deciduous forests in the Eastern Ghats (EG) of Tamil Nadu (TN) India have undergone many changes owing to various need-based forest managements, such as timber extraction for industry, railway sleepers, charcoal, and forest clearance for hydroelectric projects and agriculture, during preindependence and postindependence periods (i.e., from 1800 to 1980). The enactment of a forest conservation act during the 1980s changed the perception of forest managers from utilization to conservation. This study was taken up to assess the forests dynamics in the EG of TN spatially between 1990 and 2003 and nonspatially between 1900 and the 1980s. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Indian Remote Sensing satellite (IRS) 1D Linear Imaging and Self Scanning (LISS III) data were used to assess forests during 1990 and 2003, respectively. Field floristic survey and secondary data (such as published literature, floras, books, and forest working plans) were used to assess the forest dynamics in terms of forest type and species composition among the preindependence period, the postindependence period, and the present (i.e., before and after 1980). The satellite data analysis revealed a considerable amount of changes in all forest types during the 13 years. The comparison of species composition and forest types between the past and present revealed that need-based forest management along with anthropogenic activity have altered the primary deciduous forest in to secondary and postextraction secondary forests such as southern thorn and southern thorn scrub forests in the middle [400-900 mabove mean sea level (MSL)] and lower slopes (<400 m MSL). However, the evergreen forests present at the upper slope (>900 m MSL) and plateau seemed not to be much affected by the forest management. The changes estimated by the satellite data processing in the major forest types such as evergreen, deciduous, southern thorn, and southern thorn scrub are really alarming because these changes have occurred after the implementation of a forest conservation act. The dependence of local people on forests for various purposes in this region is also considerably high, which might be a key factor for the changes in the forests. The results of this study not only provide an outlook on the present status of the forests and the change trends but also provide the basis for further studies on forests in the EG of TN.

Soil degradation as a reason for inadequate human nutrition	FOOD SECURITY												Soil degradation affects human nutrition and health through its adverse impacts on quantity and quality of food production. Decline in crops' yields and agronomic production exacerbate food-insecurity that currently affects 854 million people globally, and low concentration of protein and micronutrients (e. g., Zn, Fe, Se, B, I) aggravate malnutrition and hidden hunger that affects 3.7 billion people, especially children. Soil degradation reduces crop yields by increasing susceptibility to drought stress and elemental imbalance. Strategies include: improving water productivity, enhancing soil fertility and micronutrient availability, adopting no-till farming and conservation agriculture and adapting to climate change. There are also new innovations such as using remote sensing of plant nutritional stresses for targeted interventions, applying zeolites and nanoenhanced fertilizers and delivery systems, improving biological nitrogen fixation and mycorrhizal inoculation, conserving and recycling (e. g., waste water) water using drip/sub-drip irrigation etc. Judiciously managed and properly restored, world soils have the capacity to grow adequate and nutritious food for present and future populations.

Soil erosion prediction using MMF model on highly dissected hilly terrain of Ekiti environs in southwestern Nigeria	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL SCIENCES												Assessment of soil erosion risk is important to formulate effective soil conservation plans for sustainable development. Information from remote sensing techniques can help decision makers prepare resource map accurately in less time and cost. GIS assists in linking those maps with other information related to geographic location and helps modeling, analyzing and solving complex problems. The objective of this study was to assess the potential of Morgan, Morgan and Finney (MMF) Model (Morgan et al., 1984) in predicting soil erosion in an agrarian Ekiti environment with highly dissected hilly and rolling terrain in southwestern Nigeria. Soil loss prediction by MMF approach involve factor maps from kinetic energy of rainfall, topsoil rooting depth, percentage rainfall contributing to permanent interception and stream flow, crop cover management factor, ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration, soil moisture storage capacity. These were used to generate output maps like volume of overland flow, rate of soil detachment by raindrop impact and transport capacity of overland flow. Annual soil loss estimation was calculated by comparing two maps of soil detachment rate and transport capacity and taking the minimum value from them. Results showed that MMF model could predict erosion risks effectively in the highly dissected hilly and rolling landscape of Ekiti environ. Erosion was low in the area in spite of the landscape. The highest soil loss was 1.275 kgm(-2) yr(-1) from rock hill with slope greater than 15%. The lowest was 0.942 kgm(-2) yr(-1) at low lands covered with riparian forest. The average estimated annual soil loss of the study area was 1.112 kgm(-2), which is less than tolerable standard of 1 kg 1233 m(-2) yr(-1). The MMF model shows that the current land-use/cover in Ekiti environs is sustainable because erosion risk is below the critical level.																	1992-1950					FEB	2009	4	2					53	57										WOS:000266168900002

The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of IWSM and determine the land use and cover dynamics that it has induced. The change in land use and cover was assessed by integrating remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS). Two sets of aerial photographs (taken in 1965 and 1994 at scale of 1:50,000) and Landsat ETM+ image (taken in 2000 with 30 m resolution) were used to produce the land use/land cover map and assess land use change. The results reveal significant modification and conversion of land use and cover of the watershed over the last four decades (1965-2005). A significant portion of the watershed was continuously under intensively cultivated (tainted) land. The area under irrigation increased from 7 ha to 222.4 ha post-intervention. The area under dense forest increased from 32.4 ha to 98 ha. The study further shows that IWSM decreased soil erosion. increased soil moisture, reduced sedimentation and run off, set the scene for a number of positive knock-on effects Such as stabilization of gullies and river banks, rehabilitation of degraded lands. IWSM also resulted in increased recharge in the subsurface water. This study reconfirms the importance of IWSM as a key to improve the land cover of watersheds, as a contribution to poverty alleviation and sustainable livelihood. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Better identification of the stands could improve both their conservation and management. A new approach is proposed here for locating the mature herb-rich forest stands using airborne laser scanner (ALS) data and logistic regression, or the k-NN classifier. We show that ALS technology is capable of distinguishing the ecologically important herb-rich forests from those growing on less fertile site types, mainly on the basis of unique but quantifiable crown structure and vertical profile that characterise forests on high fertility sites. The study site, Koli National Park is located on the border of the southern and middle boreal vegetation zones in Finland, and includes 63 herb-rich forest stands of varying sizes. The model and test data comprised 274 forest stands belonging to five forest site types varying from very fertile to poor. The best overall classification accuracy achieved with the k-NN method was 88.9%, the herb-rich forests being classified correctly in 65.0% of cases and the other forest site types in 95.7%. The best overall classification accuracy achieved with logistic regression was 85.6%, being 55.0% for the herb-rich forests and 94.3% for the other forest site types. Both methods demonstrated promising potential for separating herb-rich forests from other forest site types, although slightly better results were obtained with the non-parametric k-NN method, which was capable of utilising a higher number of explanatory variables. It is concluded that ALS-based data analysis techniques are applicable to the detection of mature boreal herb-rich forests in large-scale forest inventories. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J	Graf, RF; Mathys, L; Bollmann, K				Graf, Roland F.; Mathys, Lukas; Bollmann, Kurt			Habitat assessment for forest dwelling species using LiDAR remote sensing: Capercaillie in the Alps	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Large-scale information on habitat suitability is indispensable for planning management actions to further endangered species with large-spatial requirements. So far, remote sensing based habitat variables mostly included environmental and land cover data derived from passive sensors, but lacked information on vegetation structure. This is a serious constraint for the management of endangered species with specific structural requirements. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR),in contrast to passive remote sensing techniques, may bridge this gap in structural information at the landscape scale. We investigated the potential of LiDAR data to quantify habitat suitability for capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), an endangered forest grouse in Central Europe, in a forest reserve of 17.7 km(2). We used continuous variables of horizontal and vertical stand structure from first and last pulse LiDAR data and presence-absence information from field work to model habitat suitability with generalized linear models (GLM). The two final habitat suitability models explained the observed presence-absence pattern moderately well (AUC of 0.71 and 0.77) with horizontal structure explaining better than vertical structure. Relative tree canopy cover was the most important variable with intermediate values indicating highest habitat suitability. As such, LiDAR allowed us to translate the results from habitat modeling at the landscape scale to effective management recommendations at the local scale at a level of detail that hitherto was unavailable for large areas. LiDAR thus enabled us to integrate individual habitat preferences at the scale of entire populations and thus offers great potential for effective habitat monitoring and management of endangered species.

Almost no information is available on the spatial-temporal changes of grasslands in this area. In this study, grassland cover change, agricultural reclamation and salinized wasteland expansion were investigated during the past five decades. Grassland fragmentation was studied based on four landscape metrics. The grassland cover change was detected from a time series of topographic maps from 1954, satellite images of Landsat TM in 1986, 1995, and 2000 using remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS). In addition, the land use changes were analyzed using a transition matrix of land use types, while the driving forces were explored according to climatic changes and socioeconomic developments. The results indicated a significant decrease in grassland area. Of the 1418 945 ha of native grassland in 1954, approximately 64% was removed by 2000, while the number of patches (NP) increased from 865 to 2035 and the mean patch size (MPS) decreased from 1640 ha to 252 ha. During the whole study period, the average annual decrease rate of grassland was 34 894 ha/year. Cropland and salinized wasteland were the two main land use types into which grassland converted. During the past decades, obvious climatic changes occurred, which supplied a favorable potential environment for agricultural development but damaged grassland productivity. On the other hand, population, GDP and livestock number increased significantly as grassland quality decreased. According to the results, the shrinkage and fragmentation of grasslands may well be explained by socioeconomic development and aided by changing climatic conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Biogeographical patterns derived from remote sensing variables: the amphibians and reptiles of the Iberian Peninsula	AMPHIBIA-REPTILIA												The biogeographic patterns in species density of herptiles were analysed in the Iberian Peninsula. Geoclimatic regions were identified using a PCA. Individual habitat suitability (HS) models for 23 amphibians and 35 reptiles at 10 x 10 km scale were calculated with ENFA, using 12 environmental factors established with Remote Sensing (RS) techniques. The species presence proportion in each geoclimatic region was calculated through a cross-tabulation between each potential occurrence model and the geoclimatic regions. Species chorotypes were determined through Hierarchical Cluster Analysis using Jaccard's index as association measure and by the analysis of marginality and tolerance factors from individual HS models. Predicted species density maps were calculated for each geoclimatic region. Probable under-sampled areas were estimated through differences between the predicted species density maps and observed (Gap analysis). The selected PCA components divided the Iberian Peninsula in two major geoclimatic regions largely corresponding to the Atlantic and Mediterranean climates. The Jaccard's index clustered herptiles in two main taxonomic groups, with distribution similar to the Atlantic and Mediterranean geoclimatic regions (7 amphibian + 13 reptile species in three Atlantic subgroups and 16 amphibian + 22 reptile species in four Mediterranean subgroups). Marginality and tolerance factor scores identified species groups of herptile specialists and generalists. The highest observed and predicted species density areas were broadly located in identical regions. Predicted gaps are located in north-western, north-east and central Iberia. RS is a useful tool for biogeographical studies, as it provides consistent environmental data from large areas with high accuracy.

However, the trends of the two methods differ in direction and quantity. For this study, a historical and a recent remote sensing-derived map were homogenized to reduce misleading changes and to assess spatial aggregation errors. This was carried out by means of a data integration procedure based on landscape metrics, allowing cartographic and census trends to be compared. Discrepancies between data were thus highlighted, both in absolute surface value and in evolution. The methodology presented, and the results obtained, Could be employed to evaluate and improve LUCC analyses aimed at assessing landscape identity, both in the case of analyses based only on LU census data, or of those based only on LC cartographic data.

Evaluation of NRCS curve number and MODIS time-series proxies for antecedent moisture condition	CIVIL ENGINEERING AND ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS												Soil moisture plays a vital role in a watershed's hydrologic response to a precipitation event. Soil moisture condition antecedent to an event in empirical runoff estimation models, such as the 5-day antecedent moisture model for natural resources conservation service (NRCS) curve number (CN) method, is generalised and spatially inexplicit. This study assesses the potential to parameterise a statistical streamflow estimation model utilising next generation weather radar (NEXRAD) precipitation records and time-series biophysical proxies for soil moisture from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board Terra satellite. This study is conducted on a 1420km2 rural watershed in the Guadalupe River basin of southcentral Texas, a basin prone to catastrophic flooding from convective precipitation events. A least squares regression model, accounting for 83% of the variance of observed streamflow for calendar year 2004, was developed based on radar precipitation estimates, land surface temperature, and a vegetation index, on an 8-day interval. Estimated 8-day mean streamflows from the remote sensing model represented an improvement over CN modelled streamflows, developed with the standard and a continuum-based 5-day antecedent moisture condition model. Assessment of remotely sensed proxies of soil moisture has potential for complementing traditional CN method and for estimating streamflow in watersheds for which the CN or other empirical methods are limited by data constraints.

Pros and cons of using seabirds as ecological indicators	CLIMATE RESEARCH												Climate change and overfishing are increasingly causing unanticipated changes in marine ecosystems (e.g. shifts in species dominance). In order to understand and anticipate these changes, there is a crucial need for indicators that summarise large quantities of information into a few relevant and accessible signals. Seabirds have been suggested as good candidates for ecological indicators of the marine environment; however, few studies have critically evaluated their value as such. We review the role of seabirds as ecological indicators, and discuss their limitations and drawbacks, as compared to other types of indicators. In addition, we highlight the statistical consequences of inverse inference when using seabird data as indicators. We discuss the use of integrated indices and the use of seabirds as autonomous samplers of the marine environment. Finally, we highlight the necessary steps preceding the use of seabirds as indicators. We conclude that, in order to use seabird time series properly, the use of recent advances both in statistics and in remote sensing is a way to move forward. This, along with the assessment of their usefulness, should enable us to use seabird indicators appropriately for managing urgent conservation problems.

J	Coops, NC; Wulder, MA; Iwanicka, D				Coops, Nicholas C.; Wulder, Michael A.; Iwanicka, Donald			An environmental domain classification of Canada using earth observation data for biodiversity assessment	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Broad ecosystem based classifications are increasingly applied as a context to consider, understand, and manage biodiversity. The need for more spatially explicit, repeatable, transferable, transparent, and defensible environmental regionalization has become apparent. increased computing power, sophisticated analysis software, and the availability of spatially explicit descriptions of the environment, principally derived from Earth observation data, have facilitated the development of statistical ecosystem regionalizations. These regionalizations are desired to produce environmentally unique ecoregions to provide the basis for stratification for ongoing biodiversity monitoring efforts. Using a suite of indicators of the physical environment, available energy such as vegetation production, and habitat suitability all derived from remote sensing technology at 1 km spatial resolution, we undertook an environmental regionalization using a two-stage multivariate classification of terrestrial Canada. A relatively large number of classes were initially derived (100) and a hierarchical clustering approach was then applied to derive a 40 level classification. These clusters where then used to assess which clusters were the most dissimilar to the majority thus providing indication of the most unique environmental domains across Canada. Secondly, a 14 class stratification was then produced to emulate the current ecozone stratification commonly used in Canada. Results indicated that a number of unique clusters exits across Canada, specifically the forest/urban-industrial/cropland mosaic in the southern portion of Ontario, the mixed wood forests in south-central Ontario and western Quebec, the foothills of south western Alberta, regions of the southern Arctic and the northern Boreal shield (particularly the areas south of Hudson Bay and Labrador). A resemblance between the 14 class stratification and the ecozone classification for Canada is evident; locations of within and between ecozone heterogeneity are also indicated. A critical key benefit of utilising ecoregions quantitatively using key indicators, such as those derived from remote sensing observations, is the capacity to establish, and quantify, how well particular networks of sites, or plot locations, represent the overall environment. As such, the incorporation of these types of methods, and remotely derived indicators, into biodiversity assessment is an important area of ongoing research. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In intensive market-oriented pastoral systems, the partial substitution of rangeland forage production by external feed increases the influence of commodity prices in stockbreeders' decisions, which become increasingly decoupled from environmental constraints. In Mediterranean countries of the European Union (EU), Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) subsidies also influence agricultural practices, potentially increasing environmental impacts. By modeling subsidy allocation to sheep and goat breeders in Crete, we showed that livestock subsidies for Less Favoured Areas (LFA) stimulated flock growth up to a point. By linking interviews of farmers to remote-sensing data in four village communities in central Crete, we tested statistically alternative hypotheses explaining the links between CAP subsidies, livestock-husbandry practices, and land degradation at the farm level. The flock growth stimulated by livestock subsidies was accompanied by the intensification of herd management, and decreasing yields and profits, with no statistical association to vegetation degradation. Farms with larger flocks became more sensitive to market fluctuations.					Hostert, Patrick/0000-0002-5730-5484												1708-3087						2009	14	2							41									WOS:000278707200014						
J	Vadjunec, JM; Rocheleau, D				Vadjunec, Jacqueline M.; Rocheleau, Dianne			Beyond Forest Cover: Land Use and Biodiversity in Rubber Trail Forests of the Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY												Among the strategies to promote sustainable tropical forest development around the world, the Federal Extractive Reserve System of Brazil is widely cited as an exemplary model. It is designed to protect rubber tapper communities, their forests, and their livelihoods while preventing deforestation and conserving biodiversity. In response to changing markets and policies, rubber tappers in the Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve have recently diversified production to include market agriculture and cattle production, precipitating deforestation in the reserve, with the implication of increased ecological degradation compared to the extraction of nontimber forest products (NTFPs). Our remote sensing and forest inventory analyses yield different insights about the environmental consequences of distinct land-use mixes in two extractive communities, one of which emphasizes cattle and the other, NTFPs. Remote sensing results show a predictably greater impact on forest cover in the cattle-oriented community. This preliminary study is based on nested household-and community-level forest inventory and biodiversity analyses in two communities. Surprisingly, we found higher tree biodiversity in the rubber trail forests of the cattle-oriented community, and significantly lower tree species richness, tree density, total basal area, and number of trees of commercial size in the same land-use unit in the NTFP-focused community. Land-use surveys indicate lower levels of game consumption and hunting in the cattle-oriented community, and strong support for the development of sustainable timber extraction in both communities. The distinct type and degree of forest impact in the two communities exposes the problem of single-impact assessment as the sole means of performance and categorical land-use prohibitions as an effective mode of regulation in conservation areas.																	1708-3087						2009	14	2							29									WOS:000278707200007

Evaluation of effective management plan for an agricultural watershed using AVSWAT model, remote sensing and GIS	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												In the present investigation, an effort has been made to identify the critical sub-watersheds for the development of best management plan for a small watershed of Eastern India using a hydrological model, namely, AVSWAT2000. A total of 180 combinations of various management treatments including crops (rice, maize ground nut and soybean), tillage (zero, conservation, field cultivator, mould board plough and conventional practices) and fertilizer levels (existing half of recommended and recommended) have been evaluated. The investigation reveled that rice cannot be replaced by other crops such as groundnut, maize, mungbean, sorghum and soybean since comparatively these crops resulted in higher sediment yield. The tillage practices with disk plough have been found to have more impact on sediment yield and nutrient losses than conventional tillage practices for the existing level of fertilizer. Sediment yield decreased in the case of zero tillage, conservation tillage, field cultivator, moldboard plough, and conservation tillage as compare to conventional tillage. Lowest NO(3)-N loss was observed in zero tillage in all the fertilizer treatments, whereas field cultivator, moldboard plough and disk plough resulted in increase of NO(3)-N loss. As compared to conventional tillage, the losses of soluble phosphorus were increased in moldboard plough. The losses of organic nitrogen were also increased as fertilizer dose increased. After zero tillage the conservation tillage preformed better in all the fertilizer treatments as per loss of organic nitrogen and organic phosphorus is concerned. It can be concluded that the sediment yield was found to be the highest in the case of disk plough followed by moldboard plough, field cultivator, conventional tillage, field cultivator and least in zero tillage practices. The nutrient losses were found to be in different order with tillage practices, resulted highest in disk plough tillage practices. In view of sediment yield and nutrient losses, the conservation tillage practice was found to be the best as the sediment yield is less than the average soil loss whereas nutrient loss is within the permissible limit.

For these purposes, the analysis of functional attributes of ecosystems (i.e., different aspects of the exchange of matter and energy) has advantages over the traditional use of structural attributes, like a quicker response to disturbances and the fact that they are easily monitored through remote sensing. In this study, we described the spatiotemporal patterns of different aspects of the ecosystem functioning of the Spanish national parks and their response to environmental changes between 1982 and 2006. To do so, we used the NOAA/AVHRR-GIMMS dataset of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a linear estimator of the fraction of photosynthetic active radiation intercepted by vegetation, which is the main control of carbon gains. Nearly all parks have significantly changed during the last 25 years: The radiation interception has increased, the contrast between the growing and nongrowing seasons has diminished, and the dates of maximum and minimum interception have advanced. Some parks concentrated more changes than others and the degree of change varied depending on their different environmental conditions, management, and conservation histories. Our approach identified reference conditions and temporal changes for different aspects of ecosystem functioning, which can be used for management purposes of protected areas in response to global changes.

J	Dengiz, O; Baskan, O				Dengiz, Orhan; Baskan, Oguz			Land quality assessment and sustainable land use in Salt Lake (Tuz Golu) specially protected area	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Land quality assessment is of great important for decisions on sustainable land uses and the conservation of ecosystems of high biodiversity value. The main objective of this study was to determine properties of land quality of specially protected area of the Salt Lake using CORINE land quality assessment methodology and to propose a revision for this model. In addition to field study and laboratory analysis, digital soil map, digital elevation model, satellite image and climatic data were used and analyzed with remote sensing and geographic information systems techniques to generate actual land quality map and to form database for study area. Results show that 42.1% of the study area has high quality, 28.7% was classified as moderate quality and 4.0% was determined as low quality. On the other hand, some places classified as moderate quality, were not accurately classified. These places should be low land quality due to content of high salt concentration. Therefore, to resolve this insufficient situation, some soil parameters such as chemical properties should be collaborated with this model. In this case, moderate land quality level of the study area decreased from 28.7 to 12.3%, whereas 4.0% of low quality land of the study area increased to 20.8%. In addition, this research was also carried out to provide guidance for planner or decision makers about specially protected area of the Salt Lake.																	0167-6369					JAN	2009	148	1-4					233	243		10.1007/s10661-008-0154-4								WOS:000261581800021	18214696					
J	Karaburun, A				Karaburun, Ahmet			ESTIMATING POTENTIAL EROSION RISKS IN CORLU USING THE GIS-BASED RUSLE METHOD	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												Soil erosion is among the most significant modern problems affecting nearly all humanity with economic, environmental, and social consequences. Due to its destructive power, a variety of strategies are being developed and applied in order to reduce soil loss worldwide. Estimating soil loss and identifying potential risk areas against erosion play a crucial role in the overall prevention of erosion. The present study was aimed at estimating long-term soil loss and identifying potential risk areas against erosion in Corlu, located west of Istanbul, Turkey, by using the Geographical Information Systems (GIS)-based Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) method. Within the RUSLE method, the R factor was calculated by using long-term monthly rainfall data. K factors were obtained from the Water and Soil Research Institute. The LS factor was computed using a 5-m digital elevation model. The C factor was obtained from literature values based on results from the supervised classification of Landsat 5 TM satellite images with 30-m resolution. The P factor was set to 1. Based on the results of our study, erosion does not constitute a major risk in 80% of the study area. However, approximately 13% of the study area, located in the southern part of the study, is subject to high erosion risk. The study also revealed that erosion risk increases in vertisol soil groups, which are located on steep slopes (5 >= LS >= 30) in the southern parts of the study area. As such, sustainable conservation plans should be developed and implemented in order to preserve soil in the southern part of the study area where agriculture is the main land-use type.																	1018-4619						2009	18	9A					1692	1700										WOS:000270702400004						
J	Gibbes, C; Southworth, J; Keys, E				Gibbes, Cerian; Southworth, Jane; Keys, Eric			Wetland conservation: Change and fragmentation in Trinidad's protected areas	GEOFORUM												Conservation efforts often neglect the importance of monitoring of protected areas, which is key to adaptively managing dynamic landscapes. In many developing countries, like Trinidad, protected areas are set aside as a result of an agreement with an international conservation organization, often resulting in inadequate planning and monitoring of the protected area. Monitoring of protected areas allows for an examination of the conservation scheme implemented and enables improved conservation decisions to be made. The research presented provides an example of the use of technology in monitoring conservation strategies in two protected wetlands, Caroni and Nariva, in Trinidad. Remote sensing and fragmentation analyses are used to quantify land cover change within these two protected wetlands. Results show that the classification of Caroni immediately identifies a shift towards anthropogenic land cover types, suggesting an increase in human activity within the park, This finding is further supported by the continuous measures used, such as decreases in mean NDVI and greenness values suggesting a decrease in the amount or health of the vegetation. While the classification of Nariva suggests a return to natural land covers, the continuous measures of land cover change indicate the opposite. Land cover change analyses are limited in Trinidad and in the Caribbean in general, partly due to satellite data availability, thus this research presents remote sensing and landscape fragmentation analyses as new tools for monitoring land cover change and conservation effectiveness in Trinidad.

Investigation of the direct runoff generation mechanism for the analysis of the SCS-CN method applicability to a partial area experimental watershed	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) method is widely used for predicting direct runoff volume for a given rainfall event. The applicability of the SCS-CN method and the direct runoff generation mechanism were thoroughly analysed in a Mediterranean experimental watershed in Greece. The region is characterized by a Mediterranean semi-arid climate. A detailed land cover and soil survey using remote sensing and GIS techniques, showed that the watershed is dominated by coarse soils with high hydraulic conductivities, whereas a smaller part is covered with medium textured soils and impervious surfaces. The analysis indicated that the SCS-CN method fails to predict runoff for the storm events studied, and that there is a strong correlation between the CN values obtained from measured runoff and the rainfall depth. The hypothesis that this correlation could be attributed to the existence of an impermeable part in a very permeable watershed was examined in depth, by developing a numerical simulation water flow model for predicting surface runoff generated from each of the three soil types of the watershed. Numerical runs were performed using the HYDRUS-1D code. The results support the validity of this hypothesis for most of the events examined where the linear runoff formula provides better results than the SCS-CN method. The runoff coefficient of this formula can be taken equal to the percentage of the impervious area. However, the linear formula should be applied with caution in case of extreme events with very high rainfall intensities. In this case, the medium textured soils may significantly contribute to the total runoff and the linear formula may significantly underestimate the runoff produced.

J	Bareth, G				Bareth, G.			GIS- and RS-based spatial decision support: structure of a spatial environmental information system (SEIS)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH												The development of spatial decision support for environmental resource management, e. g. forest and agroecosystem management, biodiversity conservation, or hydrological planning, started in the 1980s and was the focus of many research groups in the 1990s. The combined availability of spatial data and communication, computing, positioning, geographic information system (GIS)- and remote sensing (RS)-technologies has been responsible for the implementation of complex SDSS since the late 1990s. The regional GIS-based modelling of environmental resources, and therefore ecosystems in general, requires setting-up an extensive geo and model database. Spatial data on topography, soil, climate, land use, hydrology, flora, fauna and anthropogenic activities have to be available. Therefore, GIS- and RS-technologies are of central importance for spatial data handling and analysis. In this context, the structure of spatial environmental information systems (SEIS) is introduced. In SEIS, the input data for environmental resource management are organised in at least seven sub-information systems: base geodata information system (BGDIS), climate information system (CIS), soil information system (SIS), land use information system (LUIS), hydrological information system (HIS), spatial/temporal biodiversity information system (STBIS), forest/agricultural management information system (FAMIS). The major tasks of a SEIS are to (i) provide environmental resource information on a regional level, (ii) analyse the impact of anthropogenic activities and (iii) simulate scenarios of different impacts.

Buffering functions of mangroves in the 2004 tsunami	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH												The complex nature of coastal ecosystems and their protection require a deeper understanding of land cover change and dynamics. Although a number of ecological studies have been conducted to realise this important objective, little information is available regarding the quantification of this land cover change. The role of mangroves as living barriers was under appreciated prior to the 2004 tsunami event. In this paper, we investigate the buffering functions of mangroves in the 2004 tsunami by employing the methodology developed in our companion paper. We focus more on mangrove distribution patterns in different buffer zones before and after the 2004 tsunami. The presence of mangroves before and after the event was statistically significant for the North (chi(2) = 154.08, p <= 0.001) and Upper South (chi(2) = 62.25, p <= 0.001). We observed positive linear relationships suggesting a loss of mangrove resulted into a gain of barren and sand land cover as a result of a devastating impact from the 2004 tsunami event. There are pockets of inland tsunami inundations and penetrations in the North and Upper-South in part owing to the river mouth profiles and dense mangrove trees. Although the North and Upper South Regions of the study area with large mangrove forest areas suffered slight damages, these regions put up a strong buffer against the tsunami suggesting that mangrove forests play a significant role in shoreline protection.																	1753-8947						2009	2	3					257	274		10.1080/17538940902870668								WOS:000270090300004

Discrimination of dominant forest types for Matschie's tree kangaroo conservation in Papua New Guinea using high-resolution remote sensing data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Matschie's tree kangaroos (Dendrolagus matschiei) are arboreal marsupials endemic to the Huon Peninsula in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Primarily because of an increase in hunting pressure and loss of habitat from agricultural expansion, D. matschiei is currently listed as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. This paper reports the results of our study to compare the capabilities of Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT)-4 multispectral image data at discriminating dominant forest types at a remote research location in PNG. Nearest-neighbour vegetation plots were established from July to August 2004 to obtain detailed information about the vegetative communities and guide class assignments. Forests were separated into four distinct habitat types with Dacrydium nidulum dominant forests being the most widespread and the most accurately classified. The comparative results indicated that Landsat-7 and Spot-4 had similar classification accuracies but the results were low because of the complex structure and heterogeneity of the forest communities and the limited spatial/spectral resolutions of the satellite data sources. This research provides an improved result compared to past research and provides detailed information towards the future conservation of Matschie's tree kangaroo habitat in PNG.																	0143-1161						2009	30	2					405	422	PII 906000055	10.1080/01431160802311125								WOS:000261189500009

Check-dams (also known as silt trappers) have been demonstrated to be an effective soil and water conservation measure in the region and a traditional workflow for check-dam planning and engineering is time-consuming and cannot meet the requirement of efficiently locating optimal check-dam sites. Fine resolution satellite imagery and analysis can play a key role in screening and determining special river bed segments that can be candidates for check-dam sites. In this research, HongShiMao watershed of the Loess Plateau was selected as our case study area. Based on a detailed analysis of spectral characteristics of a fused SPOT-5 imagery for dominant land covers and geomorphological features of a constructed digital elevation model, the river bed of key channels within the watershed was automatically identified. Then we selected four check-dam sites on the river bed and four orientations of a check-dam site to explore locational and directional profiles. Such profile information is most useful for locating optimal check-dam sites in a cost-effective manner and reducing associated expenditures surrounding check-dam constructions. This remote sensing application demonstrates the latest spatial information technologies such as fine resolution satellite imagery and 3D geospatial visualisation hold promises for changing traditional workflows and advancing scientific decision making of environmental conservation projects.				shi, Zhou/A-2283-2015	shi, Zhou/0000-0003-3914-5402												0143-1161						2009	30	8					1853	1865	PII 910862968	10.1080/01431160802508977								WOS:000265646100001

Radiometric surface temperature calibration effects on satellite based evapotranspiration estimation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Agriculture on the Texas High Plains (THP) uses approximately 89% of groundwater withdrawals from the Ogallala Aquifer, leading to steady decline in water table levels. Therefore, efficient water management is essential for sustaining agricultural production in the THP. Accurate evapotranspiration (ET) maps provide critical information on actual spatio-temporal crop water use. METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Resolution using Internalized Calibration) is a remote sensing based energy balance method that uses radiometric surface temperature (T(s)) for mapping ET. However, T(s) calibration effects on satellite based ET estimation are less known. Further, METRIC has never been applied for the advective conditions of the semi-arid THP. In this study, METRIC was applied and predicted ET was compared with measured values from five monolithic weighing lysimeters at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Research Laboratory in Bushland, Texas, USA. Three different levels of calibration were applied on a Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper's thermal image acquired on 23 July 2006 to derive T(s). Application of METRIC on a MODTRAN calibrated image improved the accuracy of distributed ET prediction. In addition, ET estimates were further improved when a THP-specific model was used for estimating leaf area index. Results indicated that METRIC performed well with ET mean bias error +/- root mean square error of 0.4 +/- 0.7 mm d(-1).																	0143-1161						2009	30	9					2337	2354		10.1080/01431160802549393								WOS:000266917400011

In this study, our analysis maps and characterizes the wall-to-wall forest change patterns in Mississippi over the time period 1987-2005, by interpreting 132 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) or Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) scenes using a vegetation change tracker (VCT) model. Our analysis revealed that a gradual decelerating forest fragmentation during the time period 1987-1993 gave way to an accelerating fragmentation during the period 1994-2005. This unique trend in forest fragmentation was a consequence of forest logging, regeneration practices and natural disturbance regimes. In addition, for the most part of the 1990s and between 2000 and 2005, Mississippi lost about 2% of its forest on an annual basis, but many of the losses were offset by forest regeneration from previous disturbances. Forest spatial change information derived from this analysis has provided valuable insights regarding regional forest management practices and socioeconomic impacts, which will be beneficial for land managers to develop ecologically sustainable forest management strategies and biodiversity conservation practices.

Forests in the coastal zone of Lebanon are witnessing major changes mainly because of chaotic urbanisation. The study area at the coastal zone of Lebanon has 96% of its forest cover under oak coppice. The aim of this study is to investigate the applicability of landscape indices on oak forests especially their ability to detect changes between 1965 and 2003. It uses forest canopy closure as another indicator of forest destruction. The 1965 forest map was first checked for its accuracy before being used to extract patch delineations and canopy closures. Landcover types for 2003 were obtained by classifying a SPOT 5 satellite image. FRAGSTATS software was utilised on the 1965 map on a patch basis to calculate patch shapes and sizes. These indices and canopy closures data were investigated for correlation purposes with patterns of forest loss. The edge distances between forest patches in 1965 and new forest patches in 2003 were computed to analyze regeneration processes. Results show that although older forest patches have shown a 48% loss in area, total forest area reached 83%. Abandoned agricultural lands have become new forest. Smaller forest patches (40 ha) showed greater losses than large ones. Small and open forest patches recorded greater loss than large and dense patches. Shape indices show no correlation with forest loss. Clearance for agriculture covered 30% of the pre-existing forests, while urban developments accounted for just 4% of forest loss. This research highlights the great need for comprehensive studies of forests using landscape analyses. Such analyses help managers develop practical and relevant conservation measures.																	0142-6397						2009	34	1					105	124	PII 908218394	10.1080/01426390802591569								WOS:000262859300006

Combining vessel-based surveys and tracking data to identify key marine areas for seabirds	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												An understanding of the distribution and habitat associations of far-ranging marine predators is being increasingly applied to protect these species from anthropogenic threats at sea (e.g. oil spills and fisheries bycatch). Within this framework, this research on Cory's shearwater Calonectris diomedea integrates vessel-based survey and tracking data to provide 2 distinct, yet complementary, perspectives of the habitats of this species in the western Mediterranean during incubation in June and chick rearing in August of 2007. We used a hierarchical modelling approach to (1) delineate the foraging habitat of the species using vessel-based surveys and (2) identify its feeding habitat based on tracking data within the Information-Theoretic framework. Our habitat modelling analyses suggest that shearwaters respond to complex bio-physical coupling, illustrated by their association with frontal features and elevated ocean productivity. Our models yielded moderate predictions of Cory's shearwater habitats within 2 distinct spatial scales. At the mesoscale, the foraging range of the species comprised the continental and insular shelf-slope waters of the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands, between the Gulf of Lions to the north and Cape Palos to the south. At the coarse scale, the tracking data highlighted important feeding areas within this larger foraging range: 3 continental shelf-slope 'hotspots'-(1) Gulf of Lions, (2) Cape Creus-Barcelona-Ebro Delta and (3) Cape La Nao-Cape Palos; from north to south-as well as the insular shelf-slope areas around the Balearic Islands. These results match previous observations of the foraging range and feeding patterns of the species, and are consistent with the interpretation of the regional oceanography. This study highlights how the integration of tracking and vessel-based survey data can provide a wider understanding of the predictability of aggregation (i.e. hotspots) and the key oceanographic habitats of far-ranging seabirds at multiple spatial scales. Thus, complementary data integration is a step forward in conservation studies of far-ranging marine top predators.

Rugosity-based regional modeling of hard-bottom habitat	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Systematic conservation planning is most often directed at the representation and protection of marine biodiversity. However, direct observation and sampling of marine biodiversity is extremely time consuming and expensive. Due to these constraints, marine conservation planners have sought proxies for marine biodiversity to use in their models, Hard-bottom habitats support high levels of biodiversity and are frequently used as a surrogate for it in marine spatial planning. Rugosity (i.e. the roughness of the seafloor) is an indicator of hard-bottom habitat. In the present study, we expand on previous analyses of the relationship between rugosity and hard-bottom and create the first data-driven regional rugosity model to predict hard-bottom habitat. We used logistic regression to create an empirical model and compare it to other pre-formulated definitions of rugosity with receiver operator characteristic curves. Our model performed better than all other models and was able to correctly predict the presence or absence of hard-bottom habitat with similar to 70 % accuracy. This model offers a fast and inexpensive alternative to more traditional survey methods, and should be of value to regional conservation planners and fisheries managers as an initial predictor of hard-bottom habitat. By testing this model with low-resolution (90 m) bathymetry data, we demonstrate that this type of information may be used in marine conservation plans in regions such as developing countries, where high-resolution data is not currently available. Further, our model offers a proxy for marine habitat diversity in non-coastal areas, an under-represented sector in marine conservation planning.

This quest implies that fish-habitat relationships are characterized across different spatial scales. Remote sensing allows now for a routine description of habitats from global-regional to detailed reef scales, thus theoretically offering access to hierarchical spatial analysis at multiple scales. To judge the progress in using remotely sensed habitat variables for reef fish study, existing peer-reviewed papers on the subject are reviewed. We tabulated the significant fish-habitat relationships given the different study sites, fish and habitat variables, statistical analysis, sampling efforts and scales. Studies generally do not corroborate each other. Instead, the exercise provides a diversity of thematic results from which lessons remain equivocal. It is thus justified to recommend more systematic and hierarchical remote-sensing based research in the future. We advocate the use of remote-sensing early in the design of the fish study, as part of a coherent conceptual scheme spanning all spatial scales. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The model operates by discretizing surfaces and volumes into patches and voxels and establishing the radiative transfer relationship between every pair of elements. In a plane-parallel configuration results for directional radiance agree closely with the numerical integration invariant imbedded method.

Generating vegetation leaf area index earth system data record from multiple sensors. Part 1: Theory	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The generation of multi-decade long Earth System Data Records (ESDRs) of Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation absorbed by vegetation (FPAR) from remote sensing measurements of multiple sensors is key to monitoring long-term changes in vegetation due to natural and anthropogenic influences. Challenges in developing such ESDRs include problems in remote sensing science (modeling of variability in global vegetation, scaling, atmospheric correction) and sensor hardware (differences in spatial resolution, spectral bands, calibration, and information content). In this paper, we develop a physically based approach for deriving LAI and FPAR products from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data that are of comparable quality to the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI and FPAR products, thus realizing the objective of producing a long (multi-decadal) time series of these products. The approach is based on the radiative transfer theory of canopy spectral invariants which facilitates parameterization of the canopy spectral bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF). The methodology permits decoupling of the structural and radiometric components and obeys the energy conservation law. The approach is applicable to any optical sensor, however, it requires selection of sensor-specific values of configurable parameters, namely, the single scattering albedo and data uncertainty. According to the theory of spectral invariants, the single scattering albedo is a function of the spatial scale, and thus, accounts for the variation in BRF with sensor spatial resolution. Likewise, the single scattering albedo accounts for the variation in spectral BRF with sensor bandwidths. The second adjustable parameter is data uncertainty. which accounts for varying information content of the remote sensing measurements, i.e., Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI, low information content), vs. spectral BRF (higher information content). Implementation of this approach indicates good consistency in LAI values retrieved from NDVI (AVHRR-mode) and spectral BRF (MODIS-mode). Specific details of the implementation and evaluation of the derived products are detailed in the second part of this two-paper series. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Predicting the spatio-temporal variation of run-off generation in India using remotely sensed input and Soil Conservation Service curve number model	CURRENT SCIENCE												The Soil Conservation Service curve number (SCS CN) model has been used in the GIS environment to compute run-off at spatio-temporal scales using remote sensing-derived rainfall for 2004 and climatic normal (1951-80) rainfall data. The SCS CN model takes into account land use/land cover, antecedent soil moisture condition and hydrological soil groups. Temporal 10-day composite Normalized Difference Vegetation Index images of SPOT-VGT sensor, and daily remote sensing-derived rainfall data at 10 km resolution from the NOAA Climate Prediction Centre have been used to generate the land cover and antecedent moisture condition (degree of saturation) respectively. Hydrological soil groups were prepared using the soil texture and their infiltration and drainage characteristics. Run-off coefficient maps were generated using the CN-based rainfall excess run-off. Wetland rice-growing areas of West Bengal, India were used to calculate threshold run-off coefficient (0.2) to identify run-off potential areas for major river basins of India during the monsoon season (June to September). There was a large difference in the spatial pattern of run-off estimated for the year 2004 compared to using normal climatic rainfall data. Area estimates for run-off potential were also found to vary significantly for the climatic normal and in-season (2004) data. The spatial variability showed high run-off potential in the western India river basins like Mahi, Luni, rivers of Saurashtra and Sabarmati in 2004. Run-off potential areas over India have been found to increase abruptly from June (158,700 km(2)) to July (712,300 km(2)), and decrease from August (633,400 km(2)) to September (142,000 km(2)) during 2004.																	0011-3891					DEC 10	2008	95	11					1580	1587										WOS:000262370700028

We identified 21,937 ha of remnant vegetation composed of 1,348 fragments. Fragments separated by up to 200 m were grouped into "clusters" of fragments in accordance with the maximum observed open distance crossed by A. pigra. A total of 11% or 84 of the 772 clusters identified through remote sensing were selected at random, and for these we determined the vegetation type, canopy height, area, and distance to the closest human settlement. In these same 84 clusters, which included a total area of 9,817 ha, from October to June of 2006 we located a total of 1,064 black howler monkeys, including 228 troops and 49 solitary monkeys. A. pigra was found in 62 (74.7%) of all clusters visited, with a cumulative area of 6,032 ha. Troops varied in size from 2 to 15 individuals (average 6.0 +/- 2.9 ind/troop). Adults were 67% (n =716) of detected individuals, whereas juveniles were 20.5% (n = 218) and infants were 12.5% (n = 133). We found black howlers to occur at an ecological density of 10.8 ind/km(2) which is low in comparison with A. pigra in other fragmented and conserved sites. We found a statistically significant relationship between the area of clusters and the abundance of howler monkeys (r(2) = 0.2, F = 10.47, gl = 3, P = 0.002). In addition, the probability of finding A. pigra was greater in secondary vegetation, riparian vegetation, tropical dry forest, undisturbed tropical oak forest, and palm forest (F = 12, gl = 3, P < 0.0001), as compared with disturbed tropical oak forest. Our results provide data on the distribution, abundance, and population structure of black howler monkeys in a fragmented landscape in the southeast of Mexico. These data are a necessary prerequisite for conservation planning for this species. Am. J. Primatol. 70:1-169-1.176, 2008. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Location: Iberian National Parks of Spain. Methods: We used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from global inventory modeling and mapping studies (GIMMS) advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) dataset to monitor surface vegetation. NDVI is a surrogate for the photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation This functional attribute has a short-time response to disturbances. is connected to ecosystem services and can be monitored through remote sensing. First, we provide a baseline description of the NDVI dynamics in the parks and analysed its temporal trends (1981-2003). Then. we evaluated the relationships of the seasonal dynamics and interannual trends with the climate conditions, vegetation types and conservation histories of the parks. Results: The parks showed two patterns of NDVI dynamics corresponding to Mediterranean and Eurosiberian regions. Most parks showed areas with positive NDVI trends that tended to have higher proportions of Mediterranean coniferous and mixed forests. oro-Mediterranean scrublands, healthlands. maquis and garrigues. Negative trends were scarce and associated with marshes and Alpine coniferous forests. The lack of a common response in all parks was related to their different environmental conditions. management. and conservation histories. Conclusions: National parks are changing in the short term but not uniformly. This Study represents a basis for the incorporation of functional attributes of ecosystems in the management and monitoring of protected areas in the face of global change.

Here we describe current practices in habitat monitoring based on 150 schemes in Europe. Most schemes were initiated after 1990 in response to EU nature directives or habitat management/restoration actions, with funding mostly from European or national sources. Schemes usually monitor both the spatial distribution and the quality of the habitats, and they frequently collect data on environmental parameters and potential causes of changes. Many schemes are local or regional rather than national or international in scope, and sampling effort varies greatly across spatial and temporal scales. Experimental design is used in half of the schemes, however, data are rarely analysed by advanced statistics. Most schemes require two months or less per year in manpower and are typically run by professionals rather than by volunteers. Estimated salaries plus equipment costs average 650,000 Euro per year per scheme, and add up to 80 million Euros annually. Costs are particularly high for schemes based on European or international law and for schemes funded by European or national sources. Costs are also high in schemes in which sampling sites are selected subjectively rather than based on sampling theory, and in schemes that do not use field mapping or remote sensing to document spatial variation in habitats. Our survey demonstrates promising developments in European habitat monitoring but also underlines the need for better spatial coverage, documentation of spatial variaton, improved sampling design and advanced data analysis. Such improvements are essential if we are to judge progress towards the 2010 biodiversity targets.

Parallel to this growth, it is increasingly important to address biodiversity changes on large spatial (e.g. continental) and temporal (e.g. decade-long) scales, which requires the integration of currently ongoing monitoring efforts. Here we review habitat monitoring and develop a framework for integrating data or activities across habitat monitoring schemes. We first identify three basic properties of monitoring activities: spatial aspect (explicitly spatial vs. non-spatial), documentation of spatial variation (field mapping vs. remote sensing) and coverage of habitats (all habitats or specific habitats in an area), and six classes of monitoring schemes based on these properties. Then we explore tasks essential for integrating schemes both within and across the major classes. Finally, we evaluate the need and potential for integration of currently existing schemes by drawing on data collected on European habitat monitoring in the EuMon project. Our results suggest a dire need for integration if we are to measure biodiversity changes across large spatial and temporal scales regarding the 2010 target and beyond. We also make recommendations for an integrated pan-European habitat monitoring scheme. Such a scheme should be based on remote sensing to record changes in land cover and habitat types over large scales, with complementary field mapping using unified methodology to provide ground truthing and to monitor small-scale changes, at least in habitat types of conservation importance.

Predictive mapping of floristic site conditions across mire habitats: Evaluating data requirements	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY					International Conference on Monitoring the Effectiveness of Nature Conservation	SEP 03-06, 2007	Birmensdorf, SWITZERLAND	Swiss Fed Inst Forest, Snow & Landscape Res				As conservation of sensitive habitats is a high priority issue in European environmental policy, there is considerable interest in mapping and monitoring specific habitats of high conservation value. In this study, we discuss the potential of the Swiss mire monitoring program to monitor small area habitats in sufficient detail. The monitoring scheme combines nationwide probability sampling and predictive habitat mapping based on a field data sample. Thus, it is designed to identify spatio-temporal changes at the stand level and to derive hard statistics for the sub-national level. For feasibility reasons, the thematic focus is on semi-quantitative mean indicator values derived from vegetation records. These measures provide robust estimates of essential floristic site conditions. Regression models based on CIR aerial photographs are applied to continuously map respective measures across the sample mires. The present study explores the required investment of data for model-based mapping. Exemplary mapping results are presented and validated within a reference mire. Repeated tests show that about one hundred field records are needed to guarantee optimal prediction accuracy and reliable error estimates for all target variables. The corresponding 95% error quantiles in a test data set are below 0.7. To evaluate the benefit of high resolution orthophotos (30 cm resolution), the model prediction is compared with results obtained from coarsened images. Although the original CIR images produce the best model performance, the models based on resolutions comparable to modern satellite images still show considerable potential to assess larger areas where the use of digital aerial photographs is limited. The resulting spatially-explicit in-depth information can resolve the common thematic limitations of stand-alone remote sensing applications in conservation monitoring. As the method is applicable consistently across a range of habitat types, we argue that it has the potential to become a standard method for operational monitoring of priority habitats in European nature conservation.

Approaches to utilising QuickBird data for the monitoring of NATURA 2000 habitats	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY					International Conference on Monitoring the Effectiveness of Nature Conservation	SEP 03-06, 2007	Birmensdorf, SWITZERLAND	Swiss Fed Inst Forest, Snow & Landscape Res				The implementation of standardised methods for the monitoring of NATURA 2000 sites in Europe is still a key topic in environmental research. Effective, economically priced and, as far as possible, automated applications are required. Rapidly developing sensor technology together with advanced image processing methods offer new possibilities for application of remote sensing data to NATURA 2000 monitoring. The studies presented here combine commonly available GIS data, such as Biotope Type Maps or Forestry Site Maps with remote sensing classifications of the very high spatial resolution (VHSR) QuickBird sensor. Two knowledge-based approaches under inclusion of a priori object-based information are utilised to detect the extent of habitats as well as their quality according to the German NATURA 2000 mapping guidelines. While one method used a segmentation of forested sites in Bavaria (southern Germany), the second technique applied available objects to classify heathland habitats in the Brandenburg Region (northern Germany). The results were subsequently compared, in close cooperation with local environmental authorities, with habitats mapped terrestrially for NATURA 2000 management plans. These results indicate that different remote sensing methods can be a valuable support for terrestrial mapping. Woodland habitats can be detected and specific NATURA 2000 quality parameters (e. g., percentage of natural forest types) are recognisable. In the case of heath-dominated sites, terrestrial mapping can even be replaced by remote sensing of certain habitat types for which it is also possible to obtain adequate measures of quality. Having evaluated the quality of forest and heathland NATURA 2000 habitats, two general challenges when implementing the guideline regionally could be indicated. Firstly, the very general scope of the Habitats Directive contradicts to specific local protection purposes. Secondly, the protection aims given for NATURA 2000 areas are very static. The Directive could be improved by adapting existing management and conservation strategies to pro-actively respond on likely anthropogenic influences.

MODELING HABITAT SUITABILITY FOR GREATER RHEAS BASED ON SATELLITE IMAGE TEXTURE	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Many wild species are affected by human activities occurring at broad spatial scales. For instance, in South America, habitat loss threatens Greater Rhea (Rhea americana) populations, making it important to model and map their habitat to better target conservation efforts. Spatially explicit habitat modeling is a powerful approach to understand and predict species occurrence and abundance. One problem with this approach is that commonly used land cover classifications do not capture the variability within a given land cover class that might constitute important habitat attribute information. Texture measures derived from remote sensing images quantify the variability in habitat features among and within habitat types; hence they are potentially a powerful tool to assess species - habitat relationships. Our goal was to explore the utility of texture measures for habitat modeling and to develop a habitat suitability map for Greater Rheas at the home range level in grasslands of Argentina. Greater Rhea group size obtained from aerial surveys was regressed against distance to roads, houses, and water, and land cover class abundance (dicotyledons, crops, grassland, forest, and bare soil), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and selected first-and second-order texture measures derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. Among univariate models, Rhea group size was most strongly positively correlated with texture variables derived from near infrared reflectance measurement (TM band 4). The best multiple regression models explained 78% of the variability in Greater Rhea group size. Our results suggest that texture variables captured habitat heterogeneity that the conventional land cover classification did not detect. We used Greater Rhea group size as an indicator of habitat suitability; we categorized model output into different habitat quality classes. Only 16% of the study area represented high-quality habitat for Greater Rheas (group size >= 15). Our results stress the potential of image texture to capture within-habitat variability in habitat assessments, and the necessity to preserve the remaining natural habitat for Greater Rheas.

This paper introduces a new approach for mapping large intact forest landscapes (IFL), defined as an unbroken expanse of natural ecosystems within areas of current forest extent, without signs of significant human activity, and having an area of at least 500 km(2). We have created a global IFL map using existing fine-scale maps and a global coverage of high spatial resolution satellite imagery. We estimate the global area of IFL within the current extent of forest ecosystems ( forest zone) to be 13.1 million km(2) or 23.5% of the forest zone. The vast majority of IFL are found in two biomes: Dense Tropical and Subtropical Forests (45.3%) and Boreal Forests (43.8%). The lowest proportion of IFL is found in Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests. The IFL exist in 66 of the 149 countries that together make up the forest zone. Three of them-Canada, Russia, and Brazil-contain 63.8% of the total IFL area. Of the world's IFL area, 18.9% has some form of protection, but only 9.7% is strictly protected, i.e., belongs to IUCN protected areas categories I-III. The world IFL map presented here is intended to underpin the development of a general strategy for nature conservation at the global and regional scales. It also defines a baseline for monitoring deforestation and forest degradation that is well suited for use with operational and cost-effective satellite data. All project results and IFL maps are available on a dedicated web site (http://www.intactforests.org).																	1708-3087					DEC	2008	13	2							51									WOS:000262291600035

Tropical dry forests in Venezuela: assessing status, threats and future prospects	ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION												Tropical dry forests may be among the world's most threatened ecosystems, but few studies have objectively quantified their status and threats. This study analysed Venezuelan dry forests at multiple scales, assessing status, present threats and the policy context shaping their future. Historical and current dry forest cover at both national and local scales were contrasted, and a set of quantitative risk assessment criteria applied. While dry forests were vulnerable nationally, in northern-central locations they were endangered. Clearing for cattle ranching and for intensive and subsistence agriculture were the principal factors driving dry forest loss at the national scale, while at a local level, urbanization and fire seemed to be the primary threats. The analysis emphasized the separation of risk assessment from the very different task of establishing conservation priorities; high risk areas may not necessarily be the highest priority for investment, and policy makers may become explicitly aware of the spatial scale at which their policies are implemented, as well as how these policies may affect or be affected by the status of ecosystems beyond their area of influence. The main challenge to future dry forest conservation is a paucity of explicit policies for management and use. However, scientifically-based management can support positive dry forest policies in many ways, including identifying locations and protocols for ecological restoration, maintaining seed banks, quantifying baseline conditions, and monitoring genetic diversity and other indicators.

Baniwa indigenous communities in Rio Icana, upper Rio Negro, Brazil. Six campinarana vegetation types, recognized and named by a consensus of Baniwa indigenous informants according to salient indicator species, were studied in 15 widely distributed plots. Floristic composition (using Baniwa plant nomenclature only, after frustrated attempts to obtain botanical collection permits), quantitative measures of forest structure and GPS waypoints of the 4-ha composite plot contours were registered, permitting their location on Landsat satellite images. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination was carried out using pc-ord software. The NMDS ordinations of the plot data revealed a clear gradient of floristic composition that was highly correlated with three quantitative measures of forest structure: basal area, canopy height and satellite reflectance. Baniwa-defined forest types are excellent predictors of habitat diversity along the structural gradient comprising distinctive white-sand campinarana vegetation types. Indigenous ecological knowledge, as revealed by satellite imagery and floristic analyses, proves to be a powerful and efficient shortcut to assessing habitat diversity, promoting dialogue between scientific and indigenous worldviews, and promoting joint study and conservation of biodiversity.

Use of simple remote sensing tools to expedite surveys for rare tiger beetles (Insecta : Coleoptera : Cicindelidae)	JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION												Tiger beetles (Insecta: Coleoptera: Cicindelidae) often occupy small patches of suitable habitat in otherwise unsuitable landscapes. Such patches are easily overlooked, which may lead to underestimates of both the number of occurrences and the overall population size. In this study, simple World Wide Web-based tools (Google Earth and Microsoft Terraserver) were used to search high-resolution satellite imagery for patches of suitable habitat for globally and regionally rare tiger beetles on a 3,278 ha wildlife refuge in Maryland, USA. This tract is largely forested but contains scattered small open areas of sand and clay soils that are potential habitat for tiger beetles of conservation concern. Visual inspection of remotely sensed imagery resulted in the identification of 19 potential habitat patches, 15 of which yielded tiger beetle populations when surveyed on the ground. The number of species of tiger beetles recorded from this tract was increased from 3 to 8 and two new sites were discovered for the state sensitive species Cicindela scutellaris rugifrons Dejean. In addition, a small population of C. splendida Hentz was discovered, a species last reported from Maryland in 1948. The technique described here shows great promise for locating small patches of potential tiger beetle habitat in otherwise unsuitable landscapes.																	1366-638X					DEC	2008	12	6					689	693		10.1007/s10841-007-9113-6								WOS:000259671900011

This research deals with how to use Geographic Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing, and, more specifically, structural classification techniques and decision-tree modeling to map erosion risks and design priority management planning over a representative region of Lebanon. The structural classification organization and analysis of spatial structures (OASIS) of Landsat TM satellite imagery (30 m) was used to define landscapes that prevail in this area and their boundaries. depending on their spectral appearance. The landscape map produced was overlaid sequentially with thematic erosion factorial maps (i.e., slope gradient, drainage density, rainfall quantity, vegetal cover, soil infiltration, soil erodibility, rock infiltration and rock movement). The overlay was visual and conditional using three visual interpretation rules (dominance, unimodality and scarcity conservation), and landscape properties were produced. Rills and gullies were measured in the field, and a decision-tree regression model was developed on the landscapes to statistically explain gully occurrence. This model explained 88% of the variability in field gully measurements. The erosion risk map produced corresponds well to field observations (accuracy of 82%). The landscapes were prioritized according to anti-erosive remedial measures: preventive (Pre), protective (Pro), and restorative (Res). This approach seems useful in Lebanon, but can also serve in other countries with similar geo-environmental conditions or those lacking detailed geospatial data. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Application of Remote Sensing Technology for Impact Assessment of Watershed Development Programme	PHOTONIRVACHAK-JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												The current study was taken up to investigate the utility of remote sensing and GIS tools for evaluation of Integrated Wasteland Development Programme (IWDP) implemented during 1997-2001 in Katangidda Nala watershed, Chincholi taluk, Gulbarga district, Karnataka. The study was carried out using IRS 1C, LISS III data of December 11, 1997 (pre-treatment) and November 15, 2002 (post-treatment) covering the watershed to assess the changes in land use/land cover and biomass that have changed over a period of five years (1997-2002). The images were classified into different land use/land cover categories using supervised classification by maximum likelihood algorithm. They were also classified into different biomass levels using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) approach. The results indicated that the area under agriculture crops and forest land were increased by 671 ha (5.7%) and 1,414 ha (11.94%) respectively. This is due to the fact that parts of wastelands and fallow lands were brought into cultivation. This increase in the area may be attributed to better utilization of surface and ground waters, adoption of soil and water conservation practices and changes in cropping pattern. The area under waste lands and fallow lands decreased by 1,667 ha (14.07%) and 467 ha (3.94%), respectively. The vegetation vigour of the area was classified into three classes using NDVI. Substantial increase in the area under high and low biomass levels was observed (502 ha and 19 ha respectively). The benefit-cost analysis indicates that the use of remote sensing and GIS was 2.2 times cheaper than the conventional methods. Thus, the repetitive coverage of the satellite data provides an excellent opportunity to monitor the land resources and evaluate the land cover changes through comparison of images for the watershed at different periods.																	0255-660X					DEC	2008	36	4					375	386										WOS:000207489100007

The river basin was divided into 200x200 m grid cells. The Arc Info 7.2 GIS software and RS (ERDAS IMAGINE 8.4 image processing software) provided spatial input data and the USLE was used to predict the spatial distribution of the average annual soil loss on grid basis. The average rainfall erositivity factor (R) for Dikrong river basin was found to be 1,894.6 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1) year(-1). The soil erodibility factor (K) with a magnitude of 0.055 t ha h ha(-1) MJ(-1) mm(-1) is the highest, with 0.039 t ha h ha(-1) MJ(-1) mm(-1) is the least for the watershed. The highest and lowest value of slope length factor (LS) is 53.5 and 5.39 respectively for the watershed. The highest and lowest values of crop management factor (C) were found out to be 0.004 and 1.0 respectively for the watershed. The highest and lowest value of conservation factor (P) were found to be 1 and 0.28 respectively for the watershed. The average annual soil loss of the Dikrong river basin is 51 t ha(-1) year(-1). About 25.61% of the watershed area is found out to be under slight erosion class. Areas covered by moderate, high, very high, severe and very severe erosion potential zones are 26.51%, 17.87%, 13.74%, 2.39% and 13.88% respectively. Therefore, these areas need immediate attention from soil conservation point of view.

J	Hu, HB; Liu, WJ; Cao, M				Hu, Huabin; Liu, Wenjun; Cao, Min			Impact of land use and land cover changes on ecosystem services in Menglun, Xishuangbanna, Southwest China	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Changing the landscape has serious environmental impacts affecting the ecosystem services, particularly in the tropics. In this paper, we report changes in ecosystem services in relation to land use and land cover over an 18-year period (1988-2006) in the Menglun Township, Xishuangbanna, Southwest China. We used Landsat TM/ETM and Quickbird data sets to estimate changes in ten land use and land cover categories, and generalized value coefficients to estimate changes in the ecosystem services provided by each land category. The results showed that over the 18-year period, the land use and land cover in the study area experienced significant changes. Rubber plantations increased from 12.10% of total land cover to 45.63%, while forested area and swidden field decreased from 48.73 and 13.14 to 27.57 and 0.46%, respectively. During this period, the estimated value of ecosystem services dropped by US $11.427 million (similar to 27.73%). Further analysis showed that there were significant changes in ecological functions such as nutrient cycling, erosion control, climate regulation and water treatment as well as recreation; the obvious increase in the ecological function is provision of raw material (natural rubber). Our findings conclude that an abrupt shift in land use from ecologically important tropical forests and traditionally managed swidden fields to large-scale rubber plantations result in a great loss of ecosystem services in this area. Further, the study suggests that provision of alternative economic opportunities would help in maintaining ecosystem services and for an appropriate compensation mechanisms need to be established based on rigorous valuation.

Using Finnish National Forest Inventory information and remote sensing data, we determined a habitat quality index and economic value for each site in Satakunta region in Finland. Moreover, we defined several sets of potential conservation targets using alternative criteria for the habitat quality index developed for the Finnish case study. These figures were used in the site selection model in order to maximize the sum of habitat index of selected areas under a given budget constraint. We found that the production possibility frontier for the outputs of timber and biodiversity is only slightly concave when using the given threshold values. Thus, the optimal combination of the outputs is sensitive to the relative values of these goods. Our results suggest that an integrated approach in forest conservation could provide to environmental managers considerable cost savings compared with current management practices. Environmental managers could also reduce conservation costs by loosening the criteria for potential conservation targets. This would not lower considerably the quality of conserved forests.

Firstly, land use types were divided into 6 classes (farmland, mountain, forestland, water body, urban land and unused land) according to national classification standard of land use, comprehensible ability of TM image and purpose of this study. Secondly, following the theory of landscape ecology analysis, 11 typical landscape indices were abstracted to evaluate the environmental effects and spatial feature changes of land use. Research results indicated that land use has grown more and more diversified and unbalanced, human activities have disturbed the landscape more seriously. Finally, transfer matrix of Markov was applied to forecast change process of land use in the future different periods, and then potential land use changes were also simulated from 2010 to 2050. Results showed that conversion tendency for all types of land use in Kitakyushu into urban construction land were enhanced. The study was anticipated to help local authorities better understand and address a complex land use system, and develop improved land use management strategies that could better balance urban expansion and ecological conservation.																	1009-637X					NOV	2008	18	4					455	468		10.1007/s11442-008-0455-0								WOS:000260427700006

Water quality and conservation practice effects in the Choptank River watershed	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												The Choptank River is an estuary, tributary of the Chesapeake Bay, and an eco-system in decline due partly to excessive nutrient and sediment loads from agriculture. The Conservation Effects Assessment Project for the Choptank River watershed was established to evaluate the effectiveness of conservation practices oil water quality, within this watershed. Several measurement frame works are being used to assess conservation practices. Nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and herbicides (atrazine and metolachlor) are monitored within 1.5 small. agricultural subwatersheds and periodically in the lower portions of the river estuary Initial results indicate that land use within these subwatersheds is a major determinant Of nutrient concentration in streams. In addition, the (18)O isotope signature of nitrate was used to provide a landscape assessment of denitrification processes in the presence of the variable land use. Herbicide concentrations were not correlated to land use, suggesting that herbicide delivery to the streams is influenced by other factors and/or processes. Remote sensing technologies have been used to scale point measurements of best management practice effectiveness from field to subwatershed and watershed scales. Optical satellite (SPOT-5) data and ground-level measurements have been shown to be effective for monitoring nutrient uptake by winter cover crops in fields with a wide range of management practices. Synthetic Aperture Radar (RADARSAT-1) data have been shown to detect and to characterize accurately the hydrology (hydroperiod) of forested wetlands at landscape and watershed scales.

LAND-USE AND COVER CHANGES (1988-2002) AROUND BUDONGO FOREST RESERVE, NW UGANDA: IMPLICATIONS FOR FOREST AND WOODLAND SUSTAINABILITY	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Land-use and cover changes around Budongo Forest Reserve (BFR) were analysed from multi-temporal LandSat images (1988 and 2002) and associated field-based studies in 2003-2004. Three major land-use and cover classes: forest/woodland, sugarcane plantations and grassland/shifting-cultivation/settlements were clearly discriminated. The area under sugarcane cultivation increased over 17-fold. from 690 ha in 1988 to 12729 ha in 2002, with a concomitant loss of about 4680 ha (8.2 per cent) of forest/woodland, mainly on the Southern boundary of BFR. Land-use and cover changes were a result of (a) agricultural expansion, (b) increasing human population, exacerbated by large influxes of refugees, (c) conflicts of interest and political interference in the management of BFR and (d) unclear land tenure. Agriculture is the main land-use practice and source of income to local people, with commercial sugarcane and tobacco as the primary cash crops. Individual smallholder sugarcane plantations covered distances ranging from 30 to 1440 in along the BFR edge, with no buffer zone, resulting in direct conflicts between farmers and forest wild animals. There is an ever-increasing need for more land for agricultural expansion, resulting in continued loss of forest/woodland on private/communal lands and encroachment into BFR. This unsustainable agricultural expansion and the local people's perception of BFR as an obstacle to agriculture. threatens the conservation of its threatened wild plants (e.g. Raphia farinifera) and the endangered chimpanzees. Therefore, their sustainable management for both development and conservation will require strong and incorruptible institutions that will seek a balance between resource exploitation and conservation.

Temporal monitoring is necessary for the conservation and usage planning of water resources, and to make informed decisions. Seyfe Lake and its environs in Turkey is one of, the most important water basins in the world because it is a node on bird migration paths between Europe, Asia and Africa. for this reason, the International Council of Bird Preservation (ICBP) has registered 27 of the bird species living, at Seyfe Lake on the conservation list. In this work, the temporal changes in the water surface area of Seyfe Lake and its environs, which are important for ecological, historical and tourism reasons, are investigated. The change of water surface in the lake is examined over a 26 year period using satellite images taken between 1975 and 2001. Landsat images from years 1975, 1987 and 2001 are used. The change is tracked from the images using an unsupervised classification method. A decrease of slightly more than 33% was observed in the water surface area this 26 year period. The temporal change indicated by the images was compared with the related meteorological data between 1975 and 2001. Over this time period, climate conditions (rainfall, temperature and evaporation) in the study area have been changed by approximately 21%. These changes could have affected the Lake surface area, but also could external human interference around the Lake. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Monitoring of forest landscape spatial structures has been recommended to detect degenerative trends in forest conditions. GIS and remote sensing play an important role in the generation of such data to identify degraded and deforested areas as well as potential areas for conservation. In this study we analyzed forest degradation and deforestation trends in Chitwan district in Nepal, which contains key habitat elements for wildlife in the region. An artificial neural network was used to predict forest canopy density in five classes using Landsat images of the year 2001. Forest canopy density was predicted with 82% overall accuracy. Except riverine forest, forest area of all other forest types was reduced. Terai Shorea robusta forest, which has high commercial value, showed a loss of 23% between 1976 and 1989 and an overall loss of 15% forest covers between the year 1976 and 2001. Deforestation and forest degradation disproportionately reduced the sizes of the different forest types, a finding that has important management implications. The maps presented in this article could be useful to prioritize limited resources for conservation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This paper combined land suitability modeling with remote sensing (RS), landscape ecological analysis and geographic information system (GIS) to develop a spatial analyzing system for urban expansion land management. The spatial analyzing system incorporates the use of a multi-criteria mechanism in GIS for the suitability evaluation of urban expansion land. Grey relational analysis (GRA) was combined with analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to address the uncertainties during the process of evaluation. This approach was applied to explicitly identify constraints and opportunities for future land conservation and development in Changsha City, China.

The design of regional networks of marine reserves is concerned with the problem of where to place the marine protected areas and how to spatially configure them. Quantitative methods for doing this provide important decision support tools for marine managers, The central problem is to balance the costs and benefits of the reserve network, whilst satisfying conservation objectives (hence solving a constrained optimization problem). Current optimization algorithms for reserve design are widely used, but none allow for the systematic incorporation of data uncertainty and its effect on the reserve design solutions. The central purpose of this study is to provide a framework for incorporating uncertain ecological input data into algorithms for designing networks of marine reserves. In order to do this, a simplified version of the marine reserve design optimization problem is considered. A Metropolis-Hastings random search procedure is introduced to systematically sample the model solution space and converge on an optimal reserve design. Incorporation of the uncertain input data builds on this process and relies on a parametric bootstrapping procedure. This allows for the solution (i.e, the marine reserve design) to be expressed as the probability of any planning unit being included in the marine reserve network. Spatial plots of this acceptance probability are easily interpretable for decision making under uncertainty. The bootstrapping methodology is also readily adapted to existing comprehensive reserve design algorithms. Here, a preliminary application of the algorithm is made to the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (in the Caribbean Sea) based on satellite-derived and mapped conservation features (from Landsat).

Explanatory variables were selected by multiple logistic regression, among several physiographic and oceanographic parameters. Depth, chlorophyll (Chl a) concentration, and sea surface temperature (SST) were selected for characterizing fin whale presence. Remote sensing imagery (Chl a and SST) was used at an 8-d resolution to capture short-term environmental variability. With the selection of a presence/absence threshold by the receiver operating characteristic curve, a correct classification of 70% (49% for presence, 85% for absence) was achieved for the initial dataset. Model reliability was also tested on an independent dataset, collected in the northwestern Basin; a correct classification of 71% (41% for presence prediction, 86% for absence prediction) was obtained. This study contributes to an understanding of where fin whales might concentrate to feed in summer. Weekly predictions of their distribution represent a valuable conservation tool in a marine protected area, for example to prevent collisions with ships.

Modelling the occurrence of threatened plant species in taiga landscapes: methodological and ecological perspectives	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Understanding the spatial patterns of species distribution and predicting the occurrence of high biological diversity and rare species are central themes in biogeography and environmental conservation. The aim of this study was to model and scrutinize the relative contributions of climate, topography, geology and land-cover factors to the distributions of threatened vascular plant species in taiga landscapes in northern Finland. Location North-east Finland, northern Europe. Methods The study was performed using a data set of 28 plant species and environmental variables at a 25-ha resolution. Four different stepwise selection algorithms [Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), adaptive backfitting, cross selection] with generalized additive models (GAMs) were fitted to identify the main environmental correlates for species occurrences. The accuracies of the distribution models were evaluated using fourfold cross-validation based on the area under the curve (AUC) derived from receiver operating characteristic plots. The GAMs were tentatively extrapolated to the whole study area and species occurrence probability maps were produced using GIS techniques. The effect of spatial autocorrelation on the modelling results was also tested by including autocovariate terms in the GAMs. Results According to the AUC values, the model performance varied from fair to excellent. The AIC algorithm provided the highest mean performance (mean AUC = 0.889), whereas the lowest mean AUC (0.851) was obtained from BIC. Most of the variation in the distribution of threatened plant species was related to growing degree days, temperature of the coldest month, water balance, cover of mire and mean elevation. In general, climate was the most powerful explanatory variable group, followed by land cover, topography and geology. Inclusion of the autocovariate only slightly improved the performance of the models and had a minor effect on the importance of the environmental variables. Main conclusions The results confirm that the landscape-scale distribution patterns of plant species can be modelled well on the basis of environmental parameters. A spatial grid system with several environmental variables derived from remote sensing and GIS data was found to produce useful data sets, which can be employed when predicting species distribution patterns over extensive areas. Landscape-scale maps showing the predicted occurrences of individual or multiple threatened plant species may provide a useful basis for focusing field surveys and allocating conservation efforts.

Previous studies of Cerrado land-use and land-cover (LULC) change imply spatial homogeneity, report widely varying rates of land conversion, use ambiguous LULC categories, and generally do not attempt to validate results. This study addresses this gap in the literature by analyzing moderate-resolution, multi-spectral satellite remote sensing data from 1986 to 2002 in two regions with identical underlying drivers. Unsupervised classification by the ISODATA algorithm indicates that Cerrado was converted to agro-pastoral land covers in 31% (3646km(2)) of the study region in western Bahia and 24% (3011 km(2)) of the eastern Mato Grosso study region, while nearly 40% (4688 km(2) and 5217 km(2), respectively) of each study region remained unchanged. Although aggregate land change is similar, large and contiguous fragments persist in western Bahia, while smaller fragments remain in eastern Mato Grosso. These findings are considered in the current context of Cerrado land-use policy, which is dominated by the conservation set-aside and command-control policy models. The spatial characteristics of Cerrado remnants create considerable obstacles to implement the models; an alternative approach, informed by countryside biogeography, may encourage collaboration between state officials and farmer-landowners toward conservation land-use policies.

Mapping and exploring the distribution of the Vulnerable grey-winged cotinga Tijuca condita	ORYX												The grey-winged cotinga Tijuca condita was first described in 1980 from an old specimen, misidentified as a congener. Field observations came later, from two remote, high-elevation forests in the Mountains of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Both involved only a few pairs of birds at best, making this species one of the least known in the world. Accurately defining the locations this species inhabits is an obvious prerequisite for designing conservation strategies to protect it. Using remotely sensed data on elevation and forest cover we mapped this species' habitat and predicted six more sites where it may occur. Field Surveys confirmed two of them, doubling the known range of the species. The two easternmost predicted sites did not contain the species but these areas have less annual rainfall than other sites, which may explain the absences. This research serves as an important guide to conservation actions, for it uncovered biological, important areas for this species that had been previously overlooked. It has also measured the remaining habitat of the species so that any future losses can be detected.

Analysis of forest cover changes and its causes are the most challenging areas of landscape ecology, especially due to the absence of temporal ground data and comparable space platform based data. Comparing remotely sensed data from three different sources with sensors having different spatial and spectral resolution presented a technical challenge. Quantitative change analysis over a long period provided a valuable insight into forest cover dynamics in this area. Time-series maps were combined within a geographical information system (GIS) with biotic and abiotic factors for modelling its future change. The land-cover change has been modelled using GEOMOD and predicted for year 2020 using the current disturbance scenario. Comparison of the forest change maps over the 31-year period shows that evergreen forest being degraded (16%) primarily in the form of selective logging and clear felling to raise plantations of coffee, tea and cardamom. The natural disturbances such as forest fire, wildlife grazing, invasions after clearance and soil erosion induced by anthropogenic pressure over the decades are the reasons of forest cover change in KMTR. The study demonstrates the role of remote sensing and GIS in monitoring of large-coverage of forest area continuously for a given region over time more precisely and in cost-effective manner which will be ideal for conservation planning and prioritization.

J	Sletto, B				Sletto, Bjorn			The Knowledge that Counts: Institutional Identities, Policy Science, and the Conflict Over Fire Management in the Gran Sabana, Venezuela	WORLD DEVELOPMENT												The cultures of environmental planning agencies shape institutional identities and management interventions. Central to such institutional cultures is knowledge production. which is shaped by political-economic processes, dominant narratives and institutional desires to produce "conservation" landscapes. Through knowledge production. certain scientific knowledge and data are appropriated, while others are excluded. In the case of fire management in the Gran Sabana, Venezuela, a project of policy science draws oil selected scientific knowledge and emphasizes remote sensing and quantitative analysis at the expense of indigenous knowledge and prescriptive burning practices. This policy science emerges from an institutional culture that favors fire suppression as a means to recreate it desired, imaginary forest. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The Simulation results appeal-acceptable compared to observations especially for not very dense planophile vegetation. However, for erectophile dense crops (e.g. corn) the simulations appear less accurate. This inadequacy is due to the assumption that the Multiple scattered fluxes are isotropically distributed. The SAIL parameters are interpretable at the level of elementary layer components. Now, the adding method (initially proposed by Van de Hulst) provides a good framework to model the radiative transfer inside a vegetation layer, but its parameter estimation lies on very simple geometric modeling of the canopy. In this paper, we first propose an adaptation of the Adding method using the SAIL model canopy representation in the turbid case: it is called AddingS model. Such an approach allows to overcome the isotropy assumption. Second, AddingS is extended to the Discrete case: defining the AddingSDmodel. It allows to take into account the multi hot spot effect. Moreover, the AddingS and AddingSD models allow to check the energy conservation in respectively turbid and discrete cases. Finally, in order to keep reasonable time performance, a fast computation method was developed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

An assessment of the use of remote sensing to map habitat features important to sustaining lamprey populations	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. This study describes the use of colour aerial photography and Airborne Thematic Mapper (ATM) multispectral imagery (420-1050 nm) to map gravel-bed river habitats important to Sustaining river lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis)-an aquatic species with high conservation interest in Europe. The accuracy of the remote sensing approach wits assessed by comparing the Output from automated mapping of physical habitat features using image analysis and GIS and habitat maps derived from field Survey. 2. Unsupervised classification of the aerial photography and ATM imagery mapped hydraulic habitat such as pools and riffles with overall accuracies of 57% and 65.5%, respectively. Submerged sand and silt deposits, which are important to river lamprey ammocoetes could not be identified on the imagery by simple unsupervised or Supervised classification. They Could be mapped indirectly, however, by association between their presence and morphological attributes such as backwaters and embayments in the bank profile detectable on the imagery. Remotely determining the likely presence and location of lamprey ammocoete habitat can be useful in planning detailed electrofishing campaigns to estimate lamprey densities, to assess conservation status and any change over time, and to determine the need for restoration strategies. 3. The results suggest that on rivers wider than 20m without a continuous wooded riparian fringe, and where there is good quality imagery, it is possible to automate mapping of physical habitat features; important to many river species with high nature conservation interest. As a result organizations charged with monitoring and conserving river species should consider investing in airborne imagery covering river sytems of high conservation value.

In this paper, based on the remote sensing geo-information data of land use and soil classification all obtained from Landsat images in 1996 and 1997 and conventional data of hydrology and meteorology, the SCS model was investigated for simulating the surface runoff for single rainstorm in Wangdonggou watershed, a typical small watershed in the Loess Plateau, located in Changwu County of Shaanxi Province of China. Wangdonggou watershed was compartmentalized into 28 sub-units according to natural draining division, and the table of curve number (CN) values fitting for Wangdonggou watershed was also presented. During the flood period from 1996 to 1997, the hydrograph of calculated runoff process using the SCS model and the hydrograph of observed runoff process coincided very well in height as well as shape, and the model was of high precision above 75%. It is indicated that the SCS model is legitimate and can be successfully used to simulate the runoff generation and the runoff process of typical small watershed based on the remote sensing geo-information in the Loess Plateau.																	1002-0063					SEP	2008	18	3					235	241		10.1007/s11769-008-0235-x								WOS:000259040900005

Automatic habitat classification methods based on satellite images: A practical assessment in the NW Iberia coastal mountains	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Although remote sensing is increasingly in use for habitat mapping, traditional image classification methods tend to suffer shortcomings due to non-normality of spectral signatures, as well as overlapping and heterogeneity in radiometric responses of natural and semi natural vegetation. Methods using non-parametric classifiers and object-oriented analysis have been suggested as possible solutions for overcoming these limitations. In this paper, we aimed at evaluating the performance of some of these techniques for the European Natura 2000 network of protected areas habitats mapping. For this purpose, we tested different methods of supervised image classification in the Northern Mountains of Galicia, Spain, an area included in the Natura 2000 network, which is characterized by a highly heterogeneous landscape. Methods involved the use of maximum likelihood and nearest neighbour decision rules in per-pixel and per-object classification analyses on Landsat TM imagery. Per-object classifications were completed using the segment mean and segment means plus standard deviation feature spaces. The results showed the existence of significant differences in the accuracies for the different methodologies, their strengths and weaknesses and identified the most adequate approach for habitat mapping. Analyses pointed out that significant improvements in accuracy were achieved only under certain combinations of per-object analysis, non-parametric classifiers and high dimensionality feature space.

This makes it vital to regularly assess protected areas to confirm the efficacy of measures that protect that area from clearing. Satellite remote sensing offers a systematic and objective means for detecting bind monitoring deforestation. This paper examines a spectral change approach to detect deforestation using pattern decomposition (PD) coefficients from multitemporal Landsat data. Our results show that the PD coefficients for soil and vegetation can be used to detect deforestation using change vector analysis (CVA). CVA analysis demonstrates that deforestation in the Kinabalu area, Sabah, Malaysia has significantly slowed from 1.22% in period 1 (1973 and 1991) to 0.1% in period 2 (1991 and 1996). A comparison of deforestation both inside and outside Kinabalu Park has highlighted the effectiveness of the park in protecting the tropical forest against clearing. However, the park is still facing pressure from the area immediately surrounding the park (the 1 km buffer zone) where the deforestation rate has remained unchanged. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

No water is officially allotted to support the natural ecosystems in the delta of the river in Mexico. However, precipitation is inherently variable in this watershed. and from 1981-2004, 15% of the mean annual flow of the Lower Colorado River has entered the riparian corridor below the last diversion point Cor water in Mexico. These flows include flood releases from US darns and Much smaller administrative spins released back to the river from irrigators in the US and Mexico. These flows have germinated new cohorts of native cottonwood and willow trees and have established an active aquatic ecosystem in the riparian corridor in Mexico. We used ground and remote-sensing methods to determine the composition and fractional cover of the vegetation in the riparian corridor, its annual water consumption. and the Sources of water that support the ecosystem. The study covered the period 2000-2004, a flood year followed by 4 dry years. The riparian corridor Occupies 30,000 hit between flood control levees in Mexico. Annual evapotranspiration (ET), estimated by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) satellite imagery calibrated against moisture flux tower data. was about 1.1 m yr(-1) and was fairly constant throughout the study period despite a paucity of surface flows 2001-2004. Total ET averaged 3.4 x 10(8) m(3) yr(-1), about 15% of Colorado River water entering Mexico from the US Surface flows Could have played only a small part in supporting these high ET losses. We conclude that the riparian ET is Supported mainly by the shallow regional aquifer, derived from agricultural return flows, that approaches the Surface in the riparian zone. Nevertheless, surface flows are important in germinating cohorts of native Lices. in washing salts from the soil and aquifer. and in providing aquatic habitat. thereby enriching the habitat value of the riparian corridor for birds and other wildlife. Conservation and water management strategies to enhance the delta habitats are discussed in light of the findings. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Campbell			Methods for estimating the amount of vernal pool habitat in the northeastern United States	WETLANDS												The loss of small, seasonal wetlands is a major concern for a variety of state, local, and federal organizations in the northeastern U.S. Identifying and estimating the number of vernal pools within a given region is critical to developing long-term conservation and management strategies for these unique habitats and their faunal communities. We use three probabilistic sampling methods (simple random sampling, adaptive cluster sampling, and the dual frame method) to estimate the number of vernal pools on protected, forested lands. Overall, these methods yielded similar values of vernal pool abundance for each study area, and suggest that photographic interpretation alone may grossly underestimate the number of vernal pools in forested habitats. We compare the relative efficiency of each method and discuss ways of improving precision. Acknowledging that the objectives of a study or monitoring program ultimately determine which sampling designs are most appropriate, we recommend that some type of probabilistic sampling method be applied. We view the dual-frame method as an especially useful way of combining incomplete remote sensing methods, such as aerial photograph interpretation, with a probabilistic sample of the entire area of interest to provide more robust estimates of the number of vernal pools and a more representative sample of existing vernal pool habitats.

J	Ober, HK; Hayes, JP				Ober, Holly K.; Hayes, John P.			Influence of forest riparian vegetation on abundance and biomass of nocturnal flying insects	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Despite widespread recognition of linkages between vegetation and insects, understanding of the ecological mechanisms underlying these relationships is limited. Better comprehension of relationships linking abundance and biomass of insects to vegetation would increase accuracy of predictions of the effects of forest management activities on insect communities. This knowledge could also be pivotal to understanding predator-prey dynamics linked to insect populations. We sampled nocturnal flying insects and measured vegetation characteristics in 34 stream reaches in conifer-dominated forests of the Oregon Coast Range in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. We considered five a priori hypotheses (resource quality, resource diversity, resource abundance, resource concentration, and stream cover hypotheses) that could explain mechanisms underlying associations between riparian vegetation and nocturnal flying insects, and used an information-theoretic approach to determine the relative strength of evidence for each. The resource quality hypothesis, which predicts that abundance and biomass of insects increases with cover of deciduous vegetation, explained substantial variation for nearly every order of insect investigated, whereas the remaining hypotheses explained relatively little. Abundance and biomass of insects had stronger associations with characteristics of canopy trees than with characteristics of shrub or understory trees, suggesting that deciduous trees are an important habitat element for nocturnal flying insects in these areas. Resource managers planning riparian vegetation management in conifer-dominated forests should be aware that manipulation of the cover of deciduous trees in riparian areas could have a large impact on these insects and their vertebrate predators. By providing information on forest canopy composition, remote sensing may offer a low-cost tool for identifying areas with high abundance and biomass of insects during conservation planning.

Modelling habitat preferences for fin whales and striped dolphins in the Pelagos Sanctuary (Western Mediterranean Sea) with physiographic and remote sensing variables	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												One of the needs of the Pelagos Sanctuary for the Conservation of Mediterranean Marine Mammals is information on critical habitats for cetaceans. This study modelled habitat use and preferences of fin whales and striped dolphins (the two most abundant species in the area) with the aim of providing this information, using sighting data collected between 1993 and 1999. The study area was divided into a 21 latitude by 21 longitude grid. The explanatory variables considered in the models were physiographic variables (mean, range and standard deviation of depth and slope, and distance from the nearest coastline) and remotely-sensed data (Sea Surface Temperature and Chlorophyll-a concentration). The former were calculated for each cell using GIS tools, while the latter were obtained from AVHRR and SeaWiFS sensors. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with multidimensional smoothers were used to model the distribution of fin whales and striped dolphins in relation to these variables, and Classification And Regression Trees were used for habitat characterization and predictive models. The GAMs were coupled with Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) to account for temporal autocorrelation in the errors and to help ensure model selection was reliable; the QIC statistic was used alongside GEE-based p-values. Bathymetric features were the most valuable predictors in the Pelagos Sanctuary area for both species. Sea Surface Temperature values were indicators of striped dolphin and fin whale presence, with both species showing a tendency to prefer colder waters (21-24 degrees C). Chl-a levels were selected by the GAM models only for striped dolphins, and with large associated uncertainty; this may be related to the relatively brief period examined (only 2 years) and/or to any functional relationship operating at a different geographical or temporal scale. The boosted classification trees however indicated an importance of Chl-a for both species. The techniques applied to this dataset proved to be valuable tools to describe habitat use and preferences of cetaceans, and the use of the remotely-sensed data can substantially improve the predictions. The results of this study will be used for assessing critical habitats within the Pelagos Sanctuary and will provide information for conservation and management in the Sanctuary.

Regional-scale seagrass habitat mapping in the Wider Caribbean region using Landsat sensors: Applications to conservation and ecology	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Seagrass meadows occupy a large proportion of the world's coastal oceans and are some of the most productive systems on Earth. Direct and indirect human-derived impacts have led to significant seagrass declines worldwide and the alteration of services linked to their biodiversity. Effective conservation and the provision of sustainable recovery goals for ecologically significant species are limited by the absence of reliable information on seagrass extent. This is especially true for the Wider Caribbean region (WCR) where many conservation initiatives are under way, but are impaired by the lack Of accurate baseline habitat maps. To assist with such a fundamental conservation need using high-resolution remote sensing data, both environmental and methodological challenges need to be tackled. First, the diversity of environments, the heterogeneity of habitats, and the vast extent of the targeted region mean that local expertise and field data of adequate quality and resolution are seldom available. Second, large-scale high-resolution mapping requires several hundred Landsat 5 and 7 images, which poses substantial processing problems. The main goal of this study was to test the feasibility of achieving Landsat-based large-scale seagrass mapping with limited ground-truth data and acceptable accuracies. We used the following combination of methods to map seagrass throughout the WCR: geomorphological segmentation, contextual editing, and supervised classifications. A total of 40 Landsat scenes (path-row) were processed. Three major classes were derived ('dense seagrass', 'medium-sparse seagrass', and a generic 'other' class). Products' accuracies were assessed against (i) selected in situ data; (ii) patterns detectable with very high-resolution IKONOS images; and (iii) published habitat maps with documented accuracies. Despite variable overall classification accuracies (46-88%), following their critical evaluation, the resulting thematic maps were deemed acceptable to (i) regionally Provide an adequate baseline for further large-scale conservation programs and research actions; and (ii) regionally re-assess carrying capacity estimates for green turtles. They certainly represent a drastic improvement relative to current regional databases. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Honne			Prioritization of sub-watersheds for sustainable development and management of natural resources: An integrated approach using remote sensing, GIS and socio-economic data	CURRENT SCIENCE												The study area is one of the watersheds of North Pennar basin, covering an area of 570 km(2) and lies between latitude 13 degrees 55'-14 degrees 17'N and longitude 77 degrees 05'-77 degrees 25'E in Pavagada area, Tumkur District, Karnataka and a small portion in Ananthpur District, Andhra Pradesh, India, forming a part of the hardrock terrain. The drainage network shows dendritic to sub-dendritic pattern and is non-perennial in nature. Poor soil cover, sparse vegetation, erratic rainfall and lack of soil moisture characterize the area for most part of the year. Recurring drought coupled with increase in groundwater exploitation results in decline the groundwater level. The entire study area has been further divided into nine sub-watersheds, namely Byadanur, Devadabetta, Talamaradahalli, Gowdatimmanahalli, Naliganahalli, Nagalamadike, Maddalenahalli, Paluvalli tank and Dalavayihalli, ranging in geographical area from 49 to 75 km(2). It has been taken up for prioritization based on available natural resources derived from satellite images and socio-economic conditions, including drainage density, slope, water yield capacity, ground-water prospects, soil, wasteland, irrigated area, forest cover and data on agricultural labourers, SC/ST population and rainfall. On the basis of priority and weightage assigned to each thematic map, the sub-watersheds have been grouped into three categories: high, medium and low priority. The prioritization results reveal that Nagalamadike, Maddalenahalli and Dalavayihalli sub-watersheds rank highest on the basis of weightage and are considered as high priority. These sub-watersheds may be taken up with development and management plans to conserve natural resources on sustainable basis with immediate effect, which will ultimately lead to soil and water conservation.																	0011-3891					AUG 10	2008	95	3					345	354										WOS:000258594600027

A comparative analysis of spatial, temporal, and ecological characteristics of forest fires in seasonally dry tropical ecosystems in the Western Ghats, India	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The Western Ghats in India is one of the 25 global hotspots of biodiversity, and it is the hotspot with the highest human density. This study considers variations in the regional fire regime that are related to vegetation type and past human disturbances in a landscape. Using a combination of remote sensing data and GIS techniques, burnt areas were delineated in three different vegetation types and various metrics of fire size were estimated. Belt transects were enumerated to assess the vegetation characteristics and fire effects in the landscape. Temporal trends suggest increasingly short fire-return intervals in the landscape. In the tropical dry deciduous forest, the mean fire-return interval is 6 years, in the tropical dry thorn forest mean fire-return interval is 10 years, and in the tropical moist deciduous forest mean fire-return interval is 20 years. Tropical dry deciduous forests burned more frequently and had the largest number of fires in any given year as well as the single largest fire (9900 ha). Seventy percent, 56%, and 30% of the tropical moist deciduous forests, tropical dry thorn forests, and tropical dry deciduous forests, respectively have not burned during the 7-year period of study. The model of fire-return interval as a function of distance from park boundary explained 63% of the spatial variation of fire-return interval in the landscape. Forest fires had significant impacts on species diversity and regeneration in the tropical dry deciduous forests. Species diversity declined by 50% and 60% in the moderate and high frequency classes, respectively compared to the low fire frequency class. Sapling density declined by ca. 30% in both moderate and high frequency classes compared to low frequency class. In tropical moist deciduous ecosystems, there were substantial declines in species diversity, tree density, seedling and sapling densities in burned forests compared to the unburned forests. In contrast forest fires in tropical dry thorn forests had a marginal positive effect on ecosystem diversity, structure, and regeneration. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The new management philosophy has four important pillars; integration of biodiversity conservation into forest management process, characterization and accommodation of multiple forest values, effective participation of stakeholders and the use of advanced information technologies and management science techniques. These components comprise a sound framework of a forest management planning system in Turkey as the ownership, land use policy, social structure and forest ecosystems are unique to the country. Among few implementation sites, some experiences from the case study area of Yanlizcam planning unit were documented to realize the performance of the concept. The liaison between the government institutions and major stakeholders is found necessary, and the effective use of geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) have been realized critically important to better communicate among stakeholders and generate precise database and the plan. The case study indicated that structured participation is an effective communication tool and has a better possibly to promote multiple use forest management rather than using participation as solo information gathering process. Primary challenges relate to the effectiveness of national conservation program, availability of coherent biodiversity data and adequacy of institutional capacity that involve awareness, training and common understanding of biodiversity and protected area concept; coordination among the related institutions and stakeholders, and willingness and enthusiasm of authorities to accept and implement the concept.

Modelling species richness and life form composition in Sahelian Burkina Faso with remote sensing data	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Species distribution modelling is an important tool in planning conservation strategies, in predicting effects of environmental change and in delineating patterns of species diversity. Until now, the majority of studies dealing with predicted species distributions were conducted at regional scales by using climatic and biomass parameters with low spatial resolution as environmental variables. On the contrary, informed decision-making regarding conservation priorities mainly takes place on a local scale. We used the genetic algorithm for rule-set production (GARP), environmental layers (derivates of high-resolution LANDSAT ETM + satellite images) and 13,380 geo-referenced records from collection and releve data to model distributions of vascular plant species in the Sahelian zone of Burkina Faso. For each species, records were divided randomly in a training dataset for model generation and a test dataset to evaluate the modelled distribution maps. Single distributions of 138 highly accurately modelled species were summed up for life forms and total species richness. Highest values of species richness are found in the NW of the study area. The pattern of vascular plant diversity appears to be closely linked to sandy soils and to water availability: watercourses, tiger bush vegetation and dune ridges are more diverse than pediplain. Chamaephytes show a more pronounced preference of dunes over pediplain than other life forms, while geophyte diversity is highest near watercourses. Hemicryptophyte diversity is most evenly distributed. Therophyte diversity is closest to all vascular plant diversity. Phanerophyte diversity is highest in tiger bush vegetation and close to watercourses. Our approach holds a wide application potential to model species distributions and diversity where environmental data are scarce. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Situational waste in landscape watering: Residential and business water use in an urban Utah community	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Landscape water conservation is an important issue for municipalities throughout the Western United States, and especially in Utah as rapid growth strains existing water supplies. We conducted interdisciplinary research in Layton, Utah, that aimed at understanding patterns of landscape water use among households and businesses. The research project involved three basic tasks. First, a landscape "water budget" was developed by producing a calibrated and classified mosaic of landscape type and area from airborne multispectral digital imagery, integrating this information with Layton City parcel boundary data to determine landscape vegetated areas per lot, and estimating irrigation needs derived from reference evapotranspiration (ETo) obtained using weather data for the Salt Lake City metropolitan region. Second, utilizing Layton water billing data, water use for each household and business was identified and categorized as "conserving," "acceptable" or "wasteful" by determining how much the water applied varied from actual landscape plant need. Third, surveys were administered to a random stratified sample of households and businesses in the study area to investigate various factors that were hypothesized to be predictive of wasteful watering practices. This paper primarily focuses on analysis of the household and business survey data, which explores factors affecting urban landscape water use from a human behavioral perspective. We found that the most significant factors predicting actual water use were the type of irrigation system and whether the location was a household or business. Attitudinal and motivational characteristics were not consistently associated with water use. We found that wasteful watering is the result of many factors embedded in the complex context of urban landscapes. This implies that water conservation programs should identify potential wasteful users through analyses of water billing data and direct water conservation measures at these users by focusing on site-specific evaluations and recommendations. Water audits or water checks are one such tool that some communities have employed to help people understand and assess the quantity of water needed by and applied to their landscapes. This approach provides an opportunity to evaluate situational constraints at particular locations and design appropriate strategies for reducing water waste.

Satellite imageries of 1977, 1998 and 2006 were analysed to detect the change in habitat types with the help of remote sensing and geographic information system tools. Results indicate landscape-level changes in the vegetation and overall habitat quality within the Park. There is a substantial increase in savannah grassland (74.6%) accompanied by decline in alluvial grasslands (46.8%) from 1977 to 2006. A total of 20.47 km(2) has also been encroached during this period. Water sources in the Park have declined and there has been a significant shift towards a drier and woodland type of vegetation. These land-use changes were a result of non-implementation of habitat management/manipulation activities that are a prerequisite for supporting viable populations of specific endangered animal species in a given Protected Area. In this communication, we recommend a set of habitat Management activities for restoration of key habitats in Manas.																	0011-3891					JUL 25	2008	95	2					223	227										WOS:000258370300025

A forest map of 1965 and satellite images of Landsat TM (1987) and Spot 5 (2003) were used. Forest area has reduced by 7%, having low annual deforestation rate (< 1%). Oak, cedar and cypress forests increased from 13% to 15%, 0.8% to 1% and 0% to 0.1% respectively; while pine and juniper forests decreased from 1 % to 0.8% and 12% to 3% respectively. Grassland covered 20% of the original forest area followed by agriculture and urban. Forest patches were investigated in each 100 m distance from the edge of the old forests. Regenerated oaks were found within the first 100 m. Pine and cedar forests appeared at the 400 m distance. Urban settlements showed 4 m yr(-1) moving progress toward forest patches. Landscape indices demonstrated increase in the number of forest patches (from 169 to 432) and in the mean proximity index (from 78.29 to 225.15) and decrease in mean patch area (from 219 to 70 ha) and largest patch index (from 15.45 to 10.32). The observed trends revealed major deforestation and fragmentation in 1965-1987, followed by a lesser deforestation tendency in 1987-2003. Each forest type behaves differently to deforestation and therefore requires special management practices. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Forest fragmentation and edge effects from deforestation and selective logging in the Brazilian Amazon	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Forest fragmentation results from deforestation and disturbance, with subsequent edge effects extending deep into remaining forest areas. No study has quantified the effects of both deforestation and selective logging, separately and combined, on forest fragmentation and edge effects over large regions. The main objectives of this study were to: (1) quantify the rates and extent of forest fragmentation from deforestation and logging within the Brazilian Amazon, and (2) contextualize the spatio-temporal dynamics of this forest fragmentation through a literature review of potential ecological repercussions of edge creation. Using GIS and remote sensing, we quantified forest fragmentation defined as both increases in the forest edge-to-area ratio and number of forest fragments - and edge-effected forest occurring from these activities across more than 1.1 million km(2) of the Brazilian Amazon from 1999 to 2002. Annually, deforestation and logging generated similar to 32,000 and 38,000 km of new forest edge while increasing the edge-to-area ratio of remaining forest by 0.14 and 0.15, respectively. Combined deforestation and logging increased the edge-to-area ratio of remaining forest by 65% over our study period, while generating 5539 and 3383 new forest fragments, respectively. Although we found that 90% of individual forest fragments were smaller than 4 km(2), we also found that 50% of the remaining intact forests were located in contiguous forest areas greater than 35,000 km(2). We then conducted a literature review documenting 146 edge effects and found that these penetrated to a median distance of 100 m, a distance encompassing 6.4% of all remaining forests in our study region in the year 2002, while 53% of forests were located within two km of an edge. Annually deforestation and logging increased the proportion of edge-forest by 0.8% and 3.1%, respectively. As a result of both activities, the total proportion of edge-forest increased by 2.6% per year, while the proportion within 100-m increased by 0.5%. Over our study period, deforestation resulted in an additional similar to 3000 km(2) of edge-forest, whereas logging generated similar to 20,000 km(2), as it extended deep into intact forest areas. These results show the large extent and rapid expansion of previously unquantified soft-edges throughout the Amazon and highlight the need for greater research into their ecological impacts.

Flying high - assessing the use of the aerosphere by bats	INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY					Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Integrative-and-Comparative-Biology	JAN 02-06, 2008	San Antonio, TX	Soc Integrat & Comparat Biol				Bats feature prominently among organisms that occupy the aerosphere as they extensively use this environment for foraging, but also for dispersal, migration, and behavioral interactions. Differential use of the aerosphere is an important factor structuring bat assemblages, with species exhibiting distinct morphological, physiological, and sensory adaptations to different habitat types. This necessitates comprehensive sampling methodologies such as combined ground-level and canopy-level mist netting as well as acoustic monitoring to assess the presence, diversity, and activity of different functional groups of species adequately. Recent technological advances in acoustic detection and in methods of analysis, coupled with the expansion of libraries of echolocation calls for species identification, now allow for the reliable quantification of species numbers and activity of the scarcely known group of aerial insectivorous bats, particularly in species-rich tropical assemblages. We provide a brief, exemplary overview of recent studies on bats conducted in Panama to demonstrate the necessity of comprehensive sampling methods and application of new technologies in order to adequately depict assemblage composition and responses of bats to structural changes in habitats induced by fragmentation. In addition to acoustic methods, miniaturization of radio transmitters has provided new insights into the patterns of spatial use of the aerosphere by bats and has identified species-specific differences in mobility as one of the important traits that determines bats' reactions to anthropogenic alterations of the landscape. Following the goals of the symposium on aeroecology, we propose new avenues of research for probing the aerosphere. We discuss how integration of a diverse array of remote sensing tools with data on species distribution and species traits, such as mobility and edge-sensitivity, might provide novel opportunities for the development, and application of conservation-oriented monitoring systems.

Predicting species distributions across the Amazonian and Andean regions using remote sensing data	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim We explore the utility of newly available optical and microwave remote sensing data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and QuikSCAT (QSCAT) instruments for species distribution modelling at regional to continental scales. Using eight Neotropical species from three taxonomic groups, we assess the extent to which remote sensing data can improve predictions of their geographic distributions. For two bird species, we investigate the specific contributions of different types of remote sensing variables to the predictions and model accuracy at the regional scale, where the benefits of the MODIS and QSCAT satellite data are expected to be most significant. Location South America, with a focus on the tropical and subtropical Andes and the Amazon Basin. Methods Potential geographic distributions of eight species, namely two birds, two mammals and four trees, were modelled with the MAXENT algorithm at 1-km resolution over the South American continent using climatic and remote sensing data separately and combined. For each species and model scenario, we assess model performance by testing the agreement between observed and simulated distributions across all thresholds and, in the case of the two focal bird species, at selected thresholds. Results Quantitative performance tests showed that models built with remote sensing and climatic layers in isolation performed well in predicting species distributions, suggesting that each of these data sets contains useful information. However, predictions created with a combination of remote sensing and climatic layers generally resulted in the best model performance across the three taxonomic groups. In Ecuador, the inclusion of remote sensing data was critical in resolving the known geographically isolated populations of the two focal bird species along the steep Amazonian-Andean elevational gradients. Within remote sensing subsets, microwave-based data were more important than optical data in the predictions of the two bird species. Main conclusions Our results suggest that the newly available remote sensing data (MODIS and QSCAT) have considerable utility in modelling the contemporary geographical distributions of species at both regional and continental scales and in predicting range shifts as a result of large-scale land-use change.

Pervasive wetland flooding in the glacial drift prairie of North Dakota (USA)	NATURAL HAZARDS												This article describes a unique flood hazard, produced by the dramatic expansion of wetlands in Nelson County, located within the North American Prairie Pothole Region of North Dakota, USA. There has been an unprecedented increase in the number, average size, and permanence of prairie wetlands, and a significant increase in the size of a closed lake (Stump Lake) due to a decade-long wet spell that began in 1993 following a prolonged drying trend. Base-line land cover information from the 1992 USGS National Land Cover Characterization dataset, and a Landsat TM scene acquired 9 July 2001 are used to assess the growth of the closed lake and wetland pond surface areas, and to analyze the type and area of various land cover classes inundated between 1992 and 2001. The open water profile in Nelson County changed from one marked by relatively comparable coverage of closed lake and wetland pond areas in 1992, to one in which wetland open water accounted for the vast majority of total open water in 2001. The bulk of the wetland pond area expansion occurred by displacing existing wetland vegetation and agricultural cropland. Producers responded to the flood hazard by filing Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) claims and enrolling cropland in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), a federal land retirement program. Land taken out of agricultural production has had an enormous impact upon the agricultural sector that forms the economic base of the rural economy. In 2001 the land taken out of production due to CRP enrollment and preventive planting claims represented nearly 42% of Nelson County's 205.2 K ha base agricultural land. The patterns obtained from this detailed study of Nelson County are likely to be the representative of the more publicized flood disaster occurring within the Devils Lake Basin of North Dakota.																	0921-030X					JUL	2008	46	1					73	88		10.1007/s11069-007-9182-6								WOS:000256091300005

Habitat suitability assessment for the endangered Nilgiri Laughingthrush: A multiple logistic regression approach	CURRENT SCIENCE												Application of remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) tools has assumed an increasingly important role in conservation biology and wildlife management by providing means for modelling potential distributions of species and their habitats, unlike the conventional ground surveys. We present here a predictive model of habitat suitability for the Nilgiri Laughingthrush, Garrulax cachinnans based on a synergistic use of field surveys and digitally processed satellite imagery combined with features mapped using GIS data layers. Collateral data were created in a GIS framework based on ground surveys comprising layers such as land-use, measures of proximity to likely features of disturbance and a digital terrain model. Multiple binomial logistic regression approach was used for modelling, and the model performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. About 320 km(2), 25.12% of the area of the Nilgiris considered for modelling was predicted to be suitable for the Nilgiri Laughingthrush. The area under the ROC curve was found to be 0.984 +/- 0.003 (R(2): 0.93 at P < 0.0001), implying, a highly effective model. The assessed suitable habitat was highly fragmented and comprised of 1352 patches (natural as well as man-made) distributed all over the study area. The smallest suitable patch identified by the model was 400 m(2) and the largest patch 17.65 km(2). Also, ca. 92% of all patches were smaller than 0.5 km(2). We presume that some suitable habitat patches may be unoccupied due to strong fidelity of the species to shola (montane wet temperate forest) patches, low colonization rates, or large inter-fragment distances. Also, larger fragments might serve as source or 'exporters' of surplus individuals to maintain sink populations throughout the rest of the range. We discuss the implication of habitat fragmentation and narrow geographical range and anthropogenic pressure for the conservation of the Nilgiri Laughingthrush.

J	Maiorano, L; Falcucci, A; Boitani, L				Maiorano, Luigi; Falcucci, Alessandra; Boitani, Luigi			Size-dependent resistance of protected areas to land-use change	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												One of the major threats facing protected areas (PAs) is land-use change and habitat loss. We assessed the impact of land-use change on PAs. The majority of parks have been effective at protecting the ecosystems within their borders, even in areas with significant land-use pressures. More in particular, the capacity of PAs to slow down habitat degradation and to favour habitat restoration is clearly related to their size, with smaller areas that on average follow the dominant land-use change pattern into which they are embedded. Our results suggest that small parks are not going to be viable in the long term if they are considered as islands surrounded by a 'human-dominated ocean'. However, small PAs are, in many cases, the only option available, implying that we need to devote much more attention to the non-protected matrix in which PAs must survive.

Ground Control Points were collected from the field using Geographic Positioning System in which half of them were used for classification and the remaining for accuracy assessment. The image was classified into four dominant land use/cover types that represent the major habitats of the study site. Image classification was done using pixel-based supervised classification with the Maximum Likelihood Classification algorithm. The accuracy of classification was evaluated using error matrix and Kappa statistics. Finally, we found an overall classification accuracy of 80% and this implies that ASTER imagery can be used as a good source of data in mapping biodiversity at habitat scale in data scarce drylands of northern Ethiopia.																	0141-6707					JUN	2008	46			1			19	23		10.1111/j.1365-2028.2008.00925.x								WOS:000256627600004

Mapping of the spatial distribution of benthic habitats in the Gulf of Batabano using Landsat-7 images	CIENCIAS MARINAS												The spatial distribution of benthic habitats in the Gulf of Batabano obtained by remote sensing, using five images from the Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite sensor, is reported for the first time. The map covers a total underwater area of 21,305 km(2) and is presented at the 1:250,000 scale. Five benthic habitats were identified within this area and located using the supervised classification technique: medium- to high-density seagrass, low-density seagrass, sand with scarce vegetation, mud with scarce vegetation, and rock. Seagrass covers 64.85% (13,818 km(2)) of the total area, while 35.15% (7,487 km(2)) corresponds to the remaining benthic habitats with or without scarce vegetation. Both the underwater vegetation (seagrass and macro seaweed) and the substratum types were considered. Results were confirmed by in situ measurements obtained from three research cruises between 2003 and 2005. This map represents an important characterization of the Cuban platform waters in order to better understand these ecosystems, and can be used in future change detection analyses to monitor the health of benthic habitats in the Gulf of Batabano.

Rajeshwar			Landscape Analysis in Fambong Lho Wildlife Sanctuary, East district, Sikkim, India using Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques	PHOTONIRVACHAK-JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												The high biological diversity and rich genetic forest resources of the state of Sikkim are to be conserved due to their sensitiveness to environmental degradation through continued human interference. The conservation of bioprospecting zones in natural forests as well as in protected areas is considered important for up keeping genetic resources and their germplasm. Keeping this in view, 'Fambong Lho' wildlife sanctuary in East district, Sikkim, has been selected to characterize different communities in the dominant vegetation type of Tropical Broad Leaved Hill Forest and to assess biodiversity controls in respect of different topographical features, such as altitude, slope, and aspects and use these inputs for prioritizing the protected area into different Bioprospective zones for conservation and planning. An altitude above 2000 m, having a slope in the range of 1-5 percent facing south east aspect are the ideal environmental conditions conducive to have high species richness. The analysis of fragmentation indicates that the forests are under stress along the fringes as they are closely associated with the habitations. The biological richness is recorded reasonably within the limits in the core area of the park but further prioritizing of such areas for conservation is necessary in view of impending danger of frequent interaction of human habitation with in the sanctuary for forest resources.																	0255-660X					JUN	2008	36	2					203	216										WOS:000264821500010

Airborne laser scanning-based prediction of coarse woody debris volumes in a conservation area	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The importance of dead wood (coarse woody debris, CWD) for biodiversity in boreal forests is high that is mainly due to its role in nutrient cycling and species habitation. Recognition of its importance in storing carbon has also raised an interest in developing new methods for assessing the quantity and quality of CWD. Since the traditional measuring techniques are often expensive to apply for the estimation of volume characteristics in the field, more attention is currently being paid to remote-sensing techniques that could provide lower cost data for forest inventories over large areas. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of airborne laser scanner (ALS) data for estimating downed and standing dead wood volumes. The analysis was based on field measurements from 33 sample plots which were evaluated against the ALS-derived height-intensity metrics obtained from the Koli National Park in eastern Finland. The accuracy of the ALS data proved adequate for predicting the downed dead wood volume (RMSE 51.6%), whereas the standing dead wood volume estimates were somewhat poorer (RMSE 78.8%). The ALS-based volume estimates for downed dead wood were found to be substantially more accurate than the estimates based on field-measured characteristics of living trees. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Flint			Remote sensing of native and invasive species in Hawaiian forests	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Detection and mapping of invasive species is an important component of conservation and management efforts in Hawai'i, but the spectral separability of native, introduced, and invasive species has not been established. We used high spatial resolution airborne imaging spectroscopy to analyze the canopy hyperspectral reflectance properties of 37 distinct species or phenotypes, 7 common native and 24 introduced tree species, the latter group containing 12 highly invasive species. Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) reflectance and derivative-reflectance signatures of Hawaiian native trees were generically unique from those of introduced trees. Nitrogen-fixing trees were also spectrally unique from other groups of non-fixing trees. There were subtle but significant differences in the spectral properties of highly invasive tree species in comparison to introduced species that do not proliferate across Hawaiian ecosystems. The observed differences in canopy spectral signatures were linked to relative differences in measured leaf pigment (chlorophyll, carotenoids), nutrient (N, P), and structural (specific leaf area; SLA) properties, as well as to canopy leaf area index. These leaf and canopy properties contributed variably to the spectral separability of the trees, with wavelength-specific reflectance and absorption features that overlapped, but which were unique from one another. A combination of canopy reflectance from 1125-2500 nm associated with leaf and canopy water content, along with pigment-related absorption features (reflectance derivatives) in the 400-700 nm range, was best for delineating native, introduced, and invasive species. There was no single spectral region that always defined the separability of the species groups, and thus the full-range (400-2500 nm) spectrum was highly advantageous in differentiating these groups. These results provide a basis for more detailed studies of invasive species in Hawai'i, along with more explicit treatment of the biochemical properties of the canopies and their prediction using imaging spectroscopy.

Flint			Invasive species detection in Hawaiian rainforests using airborne imaging spectroscopy and LiDAR	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Remote sensing of invasive species is a critical component of conservation and management efforts, but reliable methods for the detection of invaders have not been widely established. In Hawaiian forests, we recently found that invasive trees often have hyperspectral signatures unique from that of native trees, but mapping based on spectral reflectance properties alone is confounded by issues of canopy senescence and mortality, intra- and inter-canopy gaps and shadowing, and terrain variability. We deployed a new hybrid airborne system combining the Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO) small-footprint light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system with the Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) to map the three-dimensional spectral and structural properties of Hawaiian forests. The CAO-AVIRIS systems and data were fully integrated using in-flight and post-flight fusion techniques, facilitating an analysis of forest canopy properties to determine the presence and abundance of three highly invasive tree species in Hawaiian rainforests. The LiDAR sub-system was used to model forest canopy height and top-of-canopy surfaces; these structural data allowed for automated masking of forest gaps, intra- and inter-canopy shadows, and minimum vegetation height in the AVIRIS images. The remaining sunlit canopy spectra were analyzed using spatially-constrained spectral mixture analysis. The results of the combined LiDAR-spectroscopic analysis highlighted the location and fractional abundance of each invasive tree species throughout the rainforest sites. Field validation studies demonstrated <6.8% and <18.6% error rates in the detection of invasive tree species at similar to 7 m(2) and similar to 2 m(2) minimum canopy cover thresholds. Our results show that full integration of imaging spectroscopy and LiDAR measurements provides enormous flexibility and analytical potential for studies of terrestrial ecosystems and the species contained within them.

Modeling distribution of Amazonian tree species and diversity using remote sensing measurements	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The availability of a wide range of satellite measurements of environmental variables at different spatial and temporal resolutions, together with an increasing number of digitized and georeferenced species occurrences, has created the opportunity to model and monitor species geographic distribution and richness at regional to continental scales. In this paper, we examine the application of recently developed global data products from satellite observations in modeling the potential distribution of tree species and diversity in the Amazon basin. We use data from satellite sensors, including MODIS, QSCAT, SRTM, and TRMM, to develop different environmental variables related to vegetation, landscape, and climate. These variables are used in a maximum entropy method (Maxent) to model the geographical distribution of five commercial trees and to classify the patterns of tree alpha-diversity in the Amazon basin. Maxent simulations are analyzed using binomial tests of omission rates and the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves to examine the model performance, the accuracy of geographic distributions, and the significance of environmental variables for discriminating suitable habitats. To evaluate the importance of satellite data, we used the Maxent jackknife test to quantify the training gains from data layers and to compare the results with model simulations using climate-only data. For all species and tree alpha-diversity, modeled distributions are in agreement with historical data and field observations. The results compare with climate-derived patterns, but provide better spatial resolution and detailed information on the habitat characteristics. Among satellite data products, QSCAT backscatter, representing canopy moisture and roughness, and MODIS leaf area index (LAI) are the most important variables in almost all cases. Model simulations suggest that climate and remote sensing results are complementary and that the best distribution patterns can be achieved when the two data sets are combined. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

As a result, methods are required that assess the effect of management activities on the biodiversity of floodplain ecosystems. In this paper, we show that dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) in combination with regional scale derived remote sensing products can be adopted to assess both current and future ecosystem development and biodiversity status of a complex floodplain ecosystem in the Netherlands. The dynamic vegetation model SMART2-SUMO2 in combination with the nature valuation model NTM3 predicting potential floristic diversity was applied to simulate the biodiversity status of the Millingerwaard floodplain along the river Rhine in the Netherlands. Estimates of net primary production (NPP) derived from airborne HyMap imaging spectrometer data were used for validation of the simulated NPP by the DVM at the time of data acquisition in 2004. Imaging spectrometer derived NPP was in good agreement with the SMART2-SUMO2 modeled results. The NTM3 derived nature valuation in 2004 expressed as plant diversity for the floodplain was high and well in agreement with field observations. In a next step, the DVM was re-initialized using imaging spectrometer derived NPP in 2004 and a forecast of plant diversity and biomass development in 2050 was made. A comparison was performed for three pre-defined floodplain management scenarios using a data-assimilation based approach as well as one without. Significant differences in biomass development can be observed between the scenarios. Predicted plant diversity for individual ecosystems in 2050 shows increased variability for forest ecosystems compared to grass ecosystems. This shows that floodplain management should take advantage of spatiotemporal dynamics of the floodplain as a basis for fostering the development of increased biodiversity. The results of this study demonstrate that imaging spectrometer derived products can be used for validation and initialization of DVMs. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

With the development of geospatial information technology, including remote sensing, these models are now applied to an ever-increasing number of species, particularly those located in areas in which it is logistically difficult to collect habitat data in the field. Many habitat studies have used data acquired by multi-spectral sensor systems such as the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), due mostly to their availability and relatively high spatial resolution (30 m/pixel). The use of data collected by other sensor systems with lower spatial resolutions but high frequency of acquisitions has largely been neglected, due to the perception that such low spatial resolution data are too coarse for habitat mapping. In this study we compare two models using data from different satellite sensor systems for mapping the spatial distribution of giant panda habitat in Wolong Nature Reserve, China. The first one is a four-category scheme model based on combining forest cover (derived from a digital land cover classification of Landsat TM imagery acquired in June, 200 1) with information on elevation and slope (derived from a digital elevation model obtained from topographic maps of the study area). The second model is based on the Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) of a time series of weekly composites of WDRVI (Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index) images derived from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer - 250 m/pixel) for 2001. A series of field plots was established in the reserve during the summer-autumn months of 2001-2003. The locations of the plots with panda feces were used to calibrate the ENFA model and to validate the results of both models. Results showed that the model using the seasonal variability of MODIS-WDRVI had a similar prediction success to that using Landsat TM and digital elevation model data, albeit having a coarser spatial resolution. This suggests that the phenological characterization of the land surface provides an appropriate environmental predictor for giant panda habitat mapping. Therefore, the information contained in remotely sensed data acquired with low spatial resolution but high frequency of acquisitions has considerable potential for mapping the habitat distribution of wildlife species.

J	Stickler, CM; Southworth, J				Stickler, Claudia M.; Southworth, Jane			Application of multi-scale spatial and spectral analysis for predicting primate occurrence and habitat associations in Kibale National Park, Uganda	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Remote sensing has made important contributions to biodiversity conservation planning through the measurement of deforestation rates, habitat fragmentation, habitat degradation, and isolation of protected areas in human altered landscapes. Progress in using remote sensing together with field data for the development of robust habitat suitability models has been more modest. In this paper, we present a habitat suitability model developed by relating field data on habitat characteristics and habitat selection of a medium-sized primate (redtail monkey, Cercopithecus ascanius) with a small home range (in contrast to many studies that focus on large-bodied, wide-ranging animals) to satellite-derived data, for predicting animal occurrence. We examined the relative performance of two high-resolution satellite sensors (2.5 m resolution Quickbird and 30 m resolution Landsat ETM+) in capturing patterns of habitat selection by redtail monkeys in Kibale National Park. Overall, our analyses suggest that a model combining data from both the Quickbird and ETM+ sensors predicts monkey presence-absence best, and that, individually, ETM+ data are better predictors than Quickbird data. Moreover, model fit was best at larger scales (ETM+ 120 m, 150 m and 240 m pixels). These results have important implications for future habitat modeling, biodiversity analyses and conservation studies given Landsat's temporal and spatial resolutions, long history of use, relatively well-developed methods for processing and analysis, and relatively low cost in comparison with many higher resolution sensors.

We investigated the degree to which floristically and structurally defined Costa Rican lowland rain forest types can be accurately discriminated by a non-parametric k nearest neighbors (k-nn) classifier or linear discriminant analysis. Pixel values of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation model extracted from segments or from 5 x 5 pixel windows were employed in the classifications. 104 field plots were classified into three floristic and one structural type of forest (regrowth forest). Three floristically defined forest types were formed through clustering the old-growth forest plots (n=52) by their species specific importance values. An error assessment of the image classification was conducted via cross-validation and error matrices, and overall percent accuracy and Kappa scores were used as measures of accuracy. Image classification of the four forest types did not adequately distinguish two old-growth forest classes, so they were merged into a single forest class. The resulting three forest classes were most accurately classified by the k-nn classifier using segmented image data (overall accuracy 91 %). The second best method, with respect to accuracy, was the k-nn with 5 x 5 pixel windows data (89% accuracy), followed by the canonical discriminant analysis using the 5 x 5 pixel window data (86%) and the segment data (82%). We conclude the k-nn classifier can accurately distinguish floristically and structurally different rain forest types. The classification accuracies were higher for the k-nn classifier than for the canonical discriminant analysis, but the differences in Kappa scores were not statistically significant. The segmentation did not increase classification accuracy in this study. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this study, we compared ape densities and habitats in the Lokoue study area in Odzala National Park and the Goualougo Triangle in Nouabale-Ndoki National Park in northern Republic of Congo. Both of these sites have long been considered strongholds for the conservation of chimpanzees and gorillas, but supposedly differ in vegetative composition and relative ape abundance. We compared habitats between these sites using conventional ground surveys and classified Landsat-7 ETM+ satellite images. We present density estimates via both standing-crop and marked-nest methods for the first time for sympatric apes of the Congo Basin. The marked-nest method was effective in depicting chimpanzee densities, but underestimated gorilla densities at both sites. Marked-nest surveys also revealed a dramatic decline in the ape population of Lokou6 which coincided with a local Ebola epidemic. Normal baseline fluctuations in ape nest encounter rates during the repeated passages of marked-nest surveys were clearly distinguishable from a 80% decline in ape nest encounter rates at Lokou6. Our results showed that ape densities, habitat composition, and population dynamics differed between these populations in northern Congo. We emphasize the importance of intensifying monitoring efforts and further refinement of ape survey methods, as our results indicated that even the largest remaining ape populations in intact and protected forests are susceptible to sudden and dramatic declines.

The Greater Madidi Landscape ranges over an elevational gradient from < 200 m in the Amazon basin to 6000 m in the high Andes, contains more than ten major ecosystem types, and several protected areas and sustainable use zones. In this study, Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite images collected over the study area at the beginning of the 1990s and then the 2000s were classified according to broad land cover types. Below elevations of 3000 m, the landscape experienced equal rates of deforestation and secondary forest increases of approximately 0.63 percent annually, resulting in no significant net change. Below elevations of 1000 M, however, we found an annual net loss in forest cover of 0.11 percent. Across the landscape, land cover change was most likely to occur near areas previously deforested, near roads and population centers, and at low elevations. We found net deforestation rates to be inversely related to strength of natural resource protection laws in protected areas and other jurisdictions. Results suggest little net change for the landscape as a whole, but that local scale changes may be significant, particularly near roads. Management policies favorable for biodiversiry conservation in this landscape should limit the building of new roads and immigration to biologically sensitive areas and continue to support protected areas, which are achieving a positive result for forest conservation.

The birds come to Eighty-Mile Beach's tidal mudflats to feed on benthic organisms during their nonbreeding period prior to embarking on a 10,000-15,000-km migration to their breeding grounds in the Arctic. To better understand migratory birds' preferences for areas on the beach, satellite imagery was used to predict grain size and benthic invertebrate distributions. These data were statistically compared with data collected in the field to determine the accuracy of the predictions. Relationships were apparent between compared data, especially in respect to the actual benthic invertebrate distribution. Finally, feeding areas for different bird species were mapped according to where their favored foods would be found.

Satellite mapping of conservation tillage adoption in the Little River experimental watershed, Georgia	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Conservation tillage is a commonly adopted best management practice for improving soil quality and reducing erosion. However, there are currently no methods in place to monitor conservation tillage adoption at the watershed scale. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of Landsat TM data as a tool to depict conservation tillage in a small Coastal Plain watershed. Satellite imagery was used to calculate four commonly used indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Crop Residue Cover Index, Normalized Difference Tillage Index, and the Simple Tillage Index. Ground truth data consisted of a windshield survey, assigning each site a tillage regime (conventional or conservation tillage) at 138 locations throughout the watershed and surrounding areas. A logistical regression approach was used on two subsets of the data set (n = 20 or n = 44) to determine the influence of the number of ground control points on the success of modeling the occurrence of conservation tillage. The most accurate model was re-applied to the satellite image and evaluated using an independent sample of 94 survey sites. Results indicate that the normalized difference tillage and simple tillage indices performed best, with an overall accuracy of 71% and 78% for models developed using n = 20 and n = 44 sample locations, respectively. Errors were typically in the form of commission. Results are encouraging and suggest that currently available satellite imagery can be used for rapid assessment of conservation tillage adoption using minimal a priori information.

In this study, we aim at providing ecologically relevant information on characteristics of temporary and permanent isolated open water wetlands, obtained by standard techniques and relatively cheap imagery. The number, surface area, nearest distance, and dynamics of isolated temporary and permanent wetlands were determined for the Western Cape, South Africa. Open water bodies (wetlands) were mapped from seven Landsat images (acquired during 1987 - 2002) using supervised maximum likelihood classification. The number of wetlands fluctuated over time. Most wetlands were detected in the winter of 2000 and 2002, probably related to road constructions. Imagery acquired in summer contained fewer wetlands than in winter. Most wetlands identified from Landsat images were smaller than one hectare. The average distance to the nearest wetland was larger in summer. In comparison to temporary wetlands, fewer, but larger permanent wetlands were detected. In addition, classification of non-vegetated wetlands on an Envisat ASAR radar image (acquired in June 2005) was evaluated. The number of detected small wetlands was lower for radar imagery than optical imagery (acquired in June 2002), probably because of deterioration of the spatial information content due the extensive pre-processing requirements of the radar image. Both optical and radar classifications allow to assess wetland characteristics that potentially influence plant and animal metacommunity structure. Envisat imagery, however, was less suitable than Landsat imagery for the extraction of detailed ecological information, as only large wetlands can be detected. This study has indicated that ecologically relevant data can be generated for the larger wetlands through relatively cheap imagery and standard techniques, despite the relatively low resolution of Landsat and Envisat imagery. For the characterisation of very small wetlands, high spatial resolution optical or radar images are needed. This study exemplifies the benefits of integrating remote sensing and ecology and hence stimulates interdisciplinary research of isolated wetlands.

A velocity projection framework for inferring shallow water currents from surface tracer fields	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												To the extent that sea surface temperature and colors can be considered passive tracers, their motions can be tracked to estimate the current velocities, or a conservation equation can be invoked to relate their temporal variations to the velocities. We investigate the latter, the so-called tracer inversion problem, with a particular focus on (1) the conditions under which the problem can be rendered over-determined for least squares solutions, (2) the possibility of using the tracer conservation equation within the "velocity projection" framework to estimate subsurface current profiles in shallow coastal waters, and (3) the accuracy of the tracer inversion calculation in terms of the data resolution and noise. The velocity projection framework refers to relating surface motion, either measured directly or made visible by tracers, to the subsurface current motion through the equations of motion. The accuracy of the tracer inversion calculation is quantified in terms of the spatial and temporal resolution of the tracer distribution. In the presence of irreducible tracer noise, the accuracy of the inversion rapidly degrades, and it is shown that the inversion with velocity projection can help improve accuracy. The tracer inversion method developed in this study is applied to the satellite sea surface temperature data, and the velocity result is compared to the velocity measurements made with the shore-based HF Coastal Current Radar. The potential of improving the velocity estimation with the present approach is indicated.

J	Morales, RM; Miura, T; Idol, T				Morales, Rodolfo Martinez; Miura, Tomoaki; Idol, Travis			An assessment of Hawaiian dry forest condition with fine resolution remote sensing	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Remote sensing offers the potential to spatially map forest cover quickly and reliably for inventory purposes. We developed a new image analysis approach using an integrated methodology of "object-based" image classification techniques and field-based measurements to quantify forest cover in a degraded dry forest ecosystem on the leeward side of the Island of Hawaii. This new approach explicitly recognized the transitional areas between tree crowns and tree shades (tree shadows) as a unique class and fully utilized them for the quantification of canopy cover. object-oriented classification of Ikonos-2 satellite images allowed delineation of tree shades and crowns and the transitional areas between them from objects with similar reflectance and size that were surrounding the trees. These included patches of fountain (Pennisetum setaceum) and kikuyu (Pennisetum clandestinum) grass, lava outcrops and lava-grass mixtures. Crown-shade transitions were clearly differentiated in spite of their wide range of spectral values and reflectance similarities with areas of lava-grass mixture. Segments representing tree shades and dark lava outcrops were also classified into their respective classes even if they were contiguous. The image estimates of canopy cover using the tree shade plus transition classes were linearly related with field estimates of canopy cover (R-2 = 0.86 and slope = 0.976). Based on this relationship, dry forest cover throughout the 2627-ha area was estimated at 7.7 +/- 1.9%. An immediate application of this new approach is to select and delineate areas with higher canopy cover in order to concentrate ecological restoration and conservation efforts.

J	Baguinon, NT				Baguinon, Nestor T.			Biogeography and tropical terrestrial ecosystem health	ASIA LIFE SCIENCES												Ecosystem health was discussed within the context of biogeography. The recorded number of animal and plant species can be ideal as standard for species completeness, hence ecosystem health. However, the idea is not practical. Small mobile organisms are difficult to account, unlike trees. Trees are obvious to monitor ecosystem health. The decrease of tree species number as a function of shrinking area due to deforestation is consistent with MacArthur and Wilson's Island Biogeography Theory (IBT). Natural ecosystems are alienated into agroecosystems, a relationship described as P (the natural ecosystem) = 1 - Q (agroecosystem). Q expands at the expense of P and this results in forest fragmentation, irreversible destruction of habitats and extinction of species. Their ratio, P/Q is a yardstick to ecosystem health, including interconnectivity of natural ecosystems at various spatial and temporal scales. The regions Greater Mindanao, Samar-Leyte and the Central Cordillera Highlands had their tree flora data based. Attributes such as elevation preferences and habitat were selected. Habitats ranged from primary forest to open grassland areas and seashores. Elevation ranged from seashore to several zones beyond sea level. Recorded tree species show that for all regions, primary forest dwelling species are a, risk to extirpation or extinction. Philippine forest cover sharply declined from 1900 to 1999. Forest decline was overlaid with a topographic and a mining risk assessment map. Results show climax tree species are at high risk. to extinction in Mindanao, Samar-Leyte and Cordillera. Remote sensing with ground truth inventory of tree species are activities that should measure ecosystem health. The discrepancy between actual and recorded tree species should measure ecosystem health deterioration. Presence of logging, swidden farming and mining are stress factors that enhance extinction of tree species and should include as criteria to poor ecosystem health. Said ecosystem stressors can be further exacerbated by anthropogenic climate change. Bioinvasion is another ernerging threat. Social criteria are as important but have only been here enumerated.																	0117-3375					APR 15	2008				2			77	101										WOS:000255387200008

Bryan			Integrating waveform lidar with hyperspectral imagery for inventory of a northern temperate forest	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												It has been suggested that attempts to use remote sensing to map the spatial and structural patterns of individual tree species abundances in heterogeneous forests, such as those found in northeastern North America, may benefit from the integration of hyperspectral or multi-spectral information with other active sensor data such as lidar. Towards this end, we describe the integrated and individual capabilities of waveform lidar and hyperspectral data to estimate three common forest measurements - basal area (BA), above-ground biomass (AGBM) and quadratic mean stem diameter (QMSD) - in a northern temperate mixed conifer and deciduous forest. The use of this data to discriminate distribution and abundance patterns of five common and often, dominant tree species was also explored. Waveform lidar imagery was acquired in July 2003 over the 1000 ha. Bartlett Experimental Forest (BEF) in central New Hampshire (USA) using NASA's airborne Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS). High spectral resolution imagery was likewise acquired in August 2003 using NASA's Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). Field data (2001-2003) from over 400 US Forest Service Northern Research Station (USFS NRS) plots were used to determine actual site conditions. Results suggest that the integrated data sets of hyperspectral and waveform lidar provide improved outcomes over use of either data set alone in evaluating common forest metrics. Across all forest conditions, 8-9% more of the variation in AGBM, BA, and QMSD was explained by use of the integrated sensor data in comparison to either AVIRIS or LVIS metrics applied singly, with estimated error 5-8% lower for these variables. Notably, in an analysis using integrated data limited to unmanaged forest tracts, AGBM coefficients of determination improved by 25% or more, while corresponding error levels decreased by over 25%. When data were restricted based on the presence of individual tree species within plots, AVIRIS data alone best predicted species-specific patterns of abundance as determined by species fraction of biomass. Nonetheless, use of LVIS and AVIRIS data - in tandem - produced complementary maps of estimated abundance and structure for individual tree species, providing a promising adjunct to traditional forest inventory and conservation biology planning efforts.

Geospatial estimation of soil moisture in rain-fed paddy fields using SCS-CN-based model	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Paddy fields are characterized by standing water and saturation condition during the entire crop growth period. However, in sub-humid and semi-arid areas, scarce rainfall and intermittent dry spells often cause soil moisture depletion resulting in unsaturated condition in the fields. These distinctive characteristics of the paddy fields have significant influence on the runoff generation and soil moisture retention characteristics of the watershed. In this study, the objective is to extend the application of the Soil Conservation Services Curve Number (SCS-CN)-based models for the geospatial and temporal simulation of soil moisture to paddy field-dominated agricultural watersheds in the water scarce areas. Different SCS-CN-based models, integrated with the soil moisture balance equation, are used to estimate the surface runoff and soil moisture content wherein, the spatial variation in the soil hydraulic characteristics is used to calculate the geospatial variation in soil moisture content. Physical significance of the terms initial abstraction (I-a) and potential maximum retention (S) in these models and their influence on the estimation of runoff and soil moisture are analysed in detail. A new SCS-CN-based model for soil moisture simulation (SCS-CN-SMS), to improve the soil moisture estimation, is proposed in this paper. The proposed model is built up on the soil moisture balance equation to account for the effect of ponding condition and soil moisture variation between the dry and saturation condition. The method is tested with 3 years observed surface runoff data and crop production statistics from a part of the Gandeshwari sub-watershed in West Bengal, India. The entire study area is divided into cells of 20 m x 20 m. Various components of the soil moisture balance equation are estimated for each cell as a function of the soil moisture content. Remote Sensing Technique and Geographic Information System (GIS) are used to extract and integrate the spatially distributed land use and soil characteristics. The Hortonion overland flow concept adopted in the SCS-CN method is used to estimate the soil hydraulic characteristics of each cell in which the curve number is used to infer the spatial variation of the land use and soil characteristics. Even though the original SCS-CN method and the existing modified versions are efficient for runoff estimation, these models are found to be inappropriate for the estimation of soil moisture distribution. On the other hand, the proposed SCS-CN-SMS model gives better results for both runoff and soil moisture simulation and is, therefore, more suitable for the hydrological modeling of paddy field-dominated agricultural watersheds.

Estimating the population size of an endangered shorebird, the Madagascar plover, using a habitat suitability model	ANIMAL CONSERVATION												The Madagascar plover Charadrius thoracicus is a shorebird endemic to western Madagascar, currently classified as globally vulnerable. It is restricted to specialized wetland habitats that are increasingly threatened by humans. To inform future conservation measures for this poorly known species, we develop a predictive habitat suitability map and use this map to estimate the size of the Madagascar plover population. We integrate spatially referenced presence-only observations of Madagascar plovers with Landsat data, elevation data and measures of distance to settlements and the coast to produce a habitat suitability model using ecological niche factor analysis. Validation of this model using a receiver operating characteristic plot suggests that it is at least 84% accurate in predicting suitable sites. We then use our estimate of total area of suitable habitat above a critical suitability threshold and data on Madagascar plover density in suitable sites to estimate the total population size to derive a total population estimate of 3100 +/- 396 standard error individuals. Finally, we explore the conservation applications of our model.

However, its usefulness may depend on the species, habitat Studied, spatial resolution and extent. We used a high spatial and spectral remote sensing image to locate and delineate small amphibian breeding sites in a Mediterranean ecosystem (Donana National Park). We also evaluated its usefulness in detecting habitat heterogeneity (number and evenness of different radiometric zones) within ponds and its relationship to amphibian species richness. Furthermore, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) were used to evaluate the usefulness of high-resolution remote-sensing data to model amphibian distribution at species level (presence/absence data), both when used alone or as a complement to field data. Amphibian species richness correlated positively with habitat heterogeneity when we discriminated a low number of potential different zones within ponds (four vs nine). For most species, remote-sensing data improved on amphibian distribution models built from field data but were of limited utility when used alone. In consequence, although remote-sensing data could be used for the preliminary identification of ponds supporting high species richness, we recommend initial assessment of its utility for identifying species-specific breeding sites before conducting survey programmes based on it.

Spatial match-mismatch in the Benguela upwelling zone: should we expect chlorophyll and sea-surface temperature to predict marine predator distributions?	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Remote-sensing measurements of marine primary productivity are widely used to predict the distribution and movements of marine top predators, despite the fact that predators do not feed directly on phytoplankton but several trophic levels higher up the food chain. 2. To test for potential links between primary productivity and top-predator feeding hotspots, we assessed spatial match-mismatch across four trophic levels of the Benguela upwelling zone (south-east Atlantic). The food chain studied consisted of phytoplankton, zooplankton (copepods), pelagic fish (anchovies and sardines) and two top predators (Cape gannets Morus capensis and human fisheries). 3. Remote-sensing data of sea-surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll_a concentration were used as indices of phytoplankton abundance throughout the study area. Copepod biomass and pelagic fish density were determined during at-sea surveys in the South African section of the Benguela using net tows and hydro-acoustics, respectively. Seabird (Cape gannet) home ranges and foraging zones were assessed from two Namibian breeding colonies (Mercury and Ichaboe) and two South African colonies (Lambert's Bay and Malgas) using global positioning system (GPS) tracking. Industrial fishing for anchovies and sardines was investigated using South African landing statistics and logbooks. 4. Our spatial analyses revealed a strong match of seabird at-sea habitat and zones of high primary productivity throughout the southern Benguela. Conversely, there was a marked spatial mismatch between copepods and pelagic fish, as well as between pelagic fish, seabirds and human fisheries: copepods were present in the southern Benguela but pelagic fish usually feeding upon them were located further east (Indian Ocean), outside of the Benguela sensu stricto. Consequently, the majority of these pelagic fish were out of reach for seabirds and fisheries confined to the southern Benguela. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates the impact of an ecosystem shift across one of the world's most productive marine ecosystems and highlights the limitations of using remote-sensed patterns of primary productivity to interpret the foraging behaviour of marine top predators. These findings underline the importance of a better knowledge of food web spatial dynamics to support ecosystem-based fisheries management and the conservation of marine top predators.

Biogeographers have a long-standing interest in measuring patterns of species occurrence and distributional movements and an interest in modelling species distributions and patterns of diversity. Much progress has been made in identifying plant species from space using high-resolution satellites (QuickBird, IKONOS), while the measurement of species movements has become commonplace with the ARGOS satellite tracking system which has been used to track the movements of thousands of individual animals. There have been significant advances in land-cover classifications by combining data from multi-passive and active sensors, and new classification techniques. Species distribution modelling has been growing at a striking rate and the incorporation of spaceborne data on climate, topography, land cover, and vegetation structure has great potential to improve models. There have been significant advances in modelling species richness, alpha diversity, and beta diversity using multisensors to quantify land-cover classifications and landscape metrics, measures of productivity, and measures of heterogeneity. Remote sensing of nature reserves can provide natural resources managers with near real-time data within and around reserves that can be used to support conservation efforts anywhere in the world. Future research should focus on incorporating recent spaceborne sensors, more extensive integration of available spaceborne imagery, and the collection and dissemination of high-quality field data. This will improve our understanding of the distribution of life on earth.

J	Lee, SW; Ellis, CD; Kweon, BS; Hong, SK				Lee, Sang-Woo; Ellis, Christopher D.; Kweon, Byoung-Suk; Hong, Sung-Kwon			Relationship between landscape structure and neighborhood satisfaction in urbanized areas	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Humans are an integral part of landscapes in landscape ecology. Theories and models of human-environment relationships suggest that human perception is essential to understand the interlocking relationship between humans and landscapes. This is particularly evident in urbanized areas. In the theories and models in landscape ecology suggesting close relationships between humans and landscapes, human perception of landscape structure hypothetically links ecosystems with many human responses and activities, including land-use decisions, landscape planning, landscape management, and preferences. Here, we attempted to understand the relationship between landscape structure and neighborhood satisfaction, which is a perceptual construct of residents. Neighborhood satisfaction was measured using a mail-out survey to single-family households in the city of College Station, TX, and landscape structures for respondents were also measured at a micro-neighborhood scale with a radius of 750 ft (229 m), an intermediate-neighborhood scale with a radius of 1500 ft (457 m), and a macro-neighborhood scale with a radius of 3000 ft (914 m). To measure the landscape structures around respondents' home, we used IKONOS multispectral images with 4 m resolution and panchromatic images with 1 m resolution. We delineated the landscape structure using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) method. The neighborhood satisfaction of residents was associated with selected landscape structure indices. Specifically, it was more likely to be high when tree patches in neighborhood environments were less fragmented, less isolated, and well connected. Variety in the size and shape of tree patches also showed a positive relationship with neighborhood satisfaction. Interestingly, these relationships became stronger as the neighborhood scale increased. Under a hypothetical framework with theories and models in landscape ecology, landscape preference and neighborhood satisfaction, results of the present study provide insights into planning and management strategies for residential environments enhancing both neighborhood satisfaction of residents and ecological functions.

J	Huang, HM; Zhang, LQ; Guan, YJ; Wang, DH				Huang, Hua-Mei; Zhang, Li-Quan; Guan, Yu-Juan; Wang, Dong-Hui			A cellular automata model for population expansion of Spartina alterniflora at Jiuduansha Shoals, Shanghai, China	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Biological invasion has received considerable attention recently because of increasing impacts on local ecosystems. Expansion of Spartina alterniflora, a non-native species, on the intertidal mudflats of Jiuduansha Shoals at the Yangtze River Estuary is a prime example of a spatially-structured invasion in a relatively simple habitat, for which strategic control efforts can be modeled and applied. Here, we developed a Cellular Automata (CA) model, in conjunction with Remote Sensing and Geographical Information Systems, to simulate the expanding process of S. alterniflora for a period of 8 years after being introduced to the new shoals, and to study the interactions between spatial pattern and ecosystem processes for the saltmarsh vegetation. The results showed that the CA model could simulate the population dynamics of S. alterniflora and Phragmites australis on the Jiuduansha Shoals successfully. The results strongly support the hypothesis of space pre-emption as well as range expansion with simple advancing wave fronts for these two species. In the Yangtze River Estuary, the native species P. australis shares the same niche with the exotic species S. alterniflora. However, the range expansion rate of P. australis was much slower than that of S. alterniflora. With the accretion of the Jiuduansha Shoals due to the large quantity of sediments deposited by the Yangtze River, a rapid range expansion of S. alterniflora is predicted to last for a long period into future. This study indicated the potential for this approach to provide valuable insights into population and community ecology of invasive species, which could be very important for wetland biodiversity conservation and resource management in the Yangtze River Estuary and other such impacted areas.

Invasive plants transform the three-dimensional structure of rain forests	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Biological invasions contribute to global environmental change, but the dynamics and consequences of most invasions are difficult to assess at regional scales. We deployed an airborne remote sensing system that mapped the location and impacts of five highly invasive plant species across 221,875 ha of Hawaiian ecosystems, identifying four distinct ways that these species transform the three-dimensional (3D) structure of native rain forests. In lowland to montane forests, three invasive tree species replace native midcanopy and understory plants, whereas one understory invader excludes native species at the ground level. A fifth invasive nitrogen-fixing tree, in combination with a midcanopy alien tree, replaces native plants at all canopy levels in lowland forests. We conclude that this diverse array of alien plant species, each representing a different growth form or functional type, is changing the fundamental 3D structure of native Hawaiian rain forests. Our work also demonstrates how an airborne mapping strategy can identify and track the spread of certain invasive plant species, determine ecological consequences of their proliferation, and provide detailed geographic information to conservation and management efforts.

J	Prates-Clark, CD; Saatchi, SS; Agosti, D				Prates-Clark, Cassia Da Conceicao; Saatchi, Sassan S.; Agosti, Donat			Predicting geographical distribution models of high-value timber trees in the Amazon Basin using remotely sensed data	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Species distribution models were developed for three high economic value timber trees (Calophyllum brasiliensis, Carapa quianensis and Virola surinamensis) that are heavily harvested in the Amazon Basin. A combination of habitat measurements extracted from remote sensing data (MODIS, QSCAT and SRTM) and bioclimatic surfaces was examined to ascertain the most influential factors determining the occurrence of these tree species. The prediction of species' occurrence rates was tested separately for each species distribution model and the results were examined for their ability to accurately map the spatial distribution of these tree species. By evaluating the omission and commission rates we concluded that species distribution models based on remote sensing data contributed significantly in quantifying environmental properties used to summarize the ecological niche of each tree species. Specific vegetation characteristics (such as percentage of tree cover, vegetation moisture and roughness, annual NDVI and mean LAI during the dry LAI) showed the dependence of these species' occurrence in more densely vegetated forests. Areas with high leaf area (even during the dry months) and areas with high vegetation moisture were predicted as potential species habitat for C. brasiliensis. The density vegetation during the dry season and vegetation phenology were strongly correlated with climate differences, such as variations in air temperature and precipitation seasonality for V surinamensis. Lower elevation areas with more exuberant vegetation and a high greenness index were among the most important factors accounting for the geographical distribution of C. guianensis. Species distribution models are increasingly important in many fields of research and conservation. The potential of remotely sensed data to monitor environmental changes in tropical areas, along with the understanding of ecosystem function, are both critical for conservation of biodiversity and the long-term process of sustaining ecosystems.

This paper proposes a new approach to predicting probability models of Javan Hawk-Eagle (JHE) distribution using the application of logistic regression (LR) and autologistic regression (ALR) coupled with RAMAS GIS, and creating pseudo-absence data using a normalized difference vegetation index from remote sensing data. Habitat requirements of 11 nest-sites in Gunung Gede-Pangrango National Park (TNGP) and its surrounding areas were analyzed and quantified, and the model was validated in southern parts of West Java. The final LR model was used as the starting point for fitting ALR models that account for spatial autocorrelation through the addition of an autocovariate variable using several different neighborhood sizes ranging from 450 m (15 x 15 moving window size, or equal to 20.25 ha) to 1500 m (50 x 50 moving window size, or equal to 225 ha) using 300 m interval. The best model was the ALR model with a 1500 m autocovariate that agreed with the distance between nests in TNGP and the mean home range size in Java. This model showed a significant increase in overall accuracy and successfully removed misclassified pixels. Based on our results, we recommend five strategies for the management and conservation of JHE habitat, including integrated conservation management and increased regulation of wildlife reserves.

Lidar: shedding new light on habitat characterization and modeling	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT												Ecologists need data on animal-habitat associations in terrestrial and aquatic environments to design and implement effective conservation strategies. Habitat characteristics used in. models typically incorporate (1) field data of limited spatial extent and/or (2) remote sensing data that do not characterize the vertical habitat structure. Remote sensing tools that directly characterize three-dimensional (3-D) habitat structure and that provide data relevant to organism-habitat interactions across a hierarchy of scales promise to improve our understanding of animal-habitat relationships. Laser altimetry, commonly called light detection and ranging (lidar), is a source of geospatial data that can provide fine-grained information about the 3-D structure of ecosystems across broad spatial extents. In this review, we present a brief overview of lidar technology, discuss recent applications of lidar data in investigations of animal-habitat relationships, and propose future applications of this technology to issues of broad species-management and conservation interest.

Estimating regional changes in soil carbon with high spatial resolution	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												To manage lands locally for C sequestration and for emissions reductions, it is useful to have a system that can monitor and predict changes in soil C and greenhouse gas emissions with high spatial resolution. We are developing a C accounting framework that can estimate C dynamics and net emissions associated with changes in land management. One component of this framework integrates field measurements, inventory data, and remote sensing products to estimate changes in soil C and to estimate where these changes are likely to occur at a subcounty (30- by 30-m) resolution. We applied this framework component to a midwestern region of the United States that consists of 679 counties approximately centered around Iowa. We estimated the 1990 baseline soil C to a maximum depth of 3 m for this region to be 4117 Tg. Cumulative soil C accumulation of 70.3 Tg was estimated for this region between 1991 and 2000, of which 33.8 Tg is due to changes in tillage intensity. Without accounting for soil C loss following changes to more intensive tillage practices, our estimate increases to 45.0 Tg C. This difference indicates that on-site permanence of soil C associated with a change to less intensive tillage practices is approximately 75% if no additional economic incentives are provided for soil C sequestration practices. This C accounting framework offers a method to integrate inventory and remote sensing data on an annual basis and to transparently, account for alternating annual trends in land management and associated C stocks and fluxes.

J	Jacquin, A; Misakova, L; Gay, M				Jacquin, Anne; Misakova, Lucie; Gay, Michel			A hybrid object-based classification approach for mapping urban sprawl in periurban environment	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												With the projected global increase of urbanization, pressure on land availability for urban use will increase. In areas where urbanization is not controlled, the concentration of human presence in residential and industrial settings may lead to an alteration of ecosystems patterns and processes. More specifically, urban growth points to an increasing need to continuously assess the urban flood hazard from the urban planning, water resource management and ecosystem management perspectives. The general impacts of urbanization on hydrologic processes and flood behaviour were widely studied and remote sensing has been demonstrated as an essential tool in any environmental and socioeconomic studies of urban areas. But, there is still a need to propose an operational method to map urban objects in complex landscape mainly characterized by different types of urbanization. According to these elements, the scope of the study is defined by three main objectives: to assess which data are most appropriate for a given unit of analysis (e.g. catchment vs. county level); to assess the ability of an object-based approach to classify urban objects (e.g. houses, farms, buildings) at multiple spatial scales; to propose an operational methodology for mapping urban sprawl. In order to validate the argument discussed above, and to test the efficiency of the suggested methodology, a case study of the Touch River catchment in southwest Toulouse (France) has been carried out. Urban objects were extracted at regional and local scales from two SPOT-5 images at 5 m and 10 in spatial resolution using an object-based classification method. Results were validated using ground data. The quality of the urban objects classification decreased within the density of urbanization. Only in areas characterized by spread urbanization, post-treatments are required. Nevertheless, the comparison of the results with an urban database realized using a Computer Assisted Photo-Interpretation method shows a better capacity to delineate urban extent at regional scale and to quantify urban objects at local scale. Information on internal distinction within the urban matrix is not provided. Findings of this study can be used for different applications: to produce detailed map required for the production of hazard assessment maps; to produce input data for hydrological models; to form policies on land-use planning and balanced urbanization by the city development, planning and conservation authorities and flood control agencies.

Birds as agents of seed dispersal in a human-dominated landscape in southern Costa Rica	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Birds play vital roles as seed dispersers helping to maintain and restore plant communities. With restoration increasingly key to global conservation, it is important to understand the landscape attributes and bird community characteristics that most influence avian seed dispersal in human-altered landscapes. We examined bird community structure and seed-dispersal patterns in agricultural countryside in Costa Rica that is typical of much of the Neotropics. Contrary to expectations, bird abundance, not richness, best predicted the richness of bird-dispersed seeds. Neither forest patch size or proximity, nor total tree cover, influenced seed dispersal. The richness and abundance of dispersed seeds, however, was strongly correlated with "wetness," a remotely-sensed metric of vegetation, at several scales. These results suggest that in this human-dominated tropical region: (1) bird abundance, not species richness or size, may drive seed dispersal, and (2) remote-sensing combined with field verification can detect landscape elements that are helpful for maintaining the option of bird-mediated reforestation.

A socioeconomic survey was carried out to select locations for implementing 2 land management packages with the full participation of farmers. The first package included cultivation of wheat landraces in a high-rainfall site (Ajloun), while the second included community-based rangeland rehabilitation and management, including fodder shrub plantations in water harvesting structures in the low-rainfall rangeland areas (Jiza). Results showed that the average grain and straw yield of wheat landraces was significantly higher than that of the improved cultivars, which could lead to high and diverse farm income. In the low-rainfall site, fodder shrubs increased the overall land productivity and aided in improving the cover of native vegetation. After 2 years of protection, dry matter production (620 kg/ha) in the community-protected location was significantly higher than that at an experimental station (465 kg/ha). Findings from both packages indicated the possibility of improving the suitability of both mountainous areas for rainfed cultivation while conserving agrobiodiversity. Development of the and areas as open ranges could be enhanced by the introduction of suitable cultivation practices (contour furrows in this study), with a view to improving productivity and rehabilitating the native vegetation.																	0276-4741					FEB	2008	28	1					49	57		10.1659/mrd.0863								WOS:000253364700010						
J	Tefera, B; Sterk, G				Tefera, Bezuayehu; Sterk, Geert			Hydropower-induced land use change in Fincha'a watershed, western Ethiopia: Analysis and impacts	MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT												The present article analyzes the land use dynamics caused by hydropower dam construction in 1973 in the Fincha'a watershed (1318 km(2)), a tributary of the Blue Nile. Aerial photos (1957 and 1980) and an ASTER satellite image of 2001 were used to make 3 land use maps of the watershed using a geographic information system (GIS). The 239-km(2) water reservoir inundated 100 km(2) of grazing land, 120 km(2) of swamp, 18 km(2) of cropland, and 1.2 km(2) of forestland. In 2001, cropland covered 77% of the land potentially available for community use, indicating that there is hardly any free land available for expansion to accommodate new farmers. Relocated communities operate on relatively small parcels of land situated either on steep slopes or in flood-prone areas. Consequently, they exhaustively utilize the trees available on their holdings, and convert grassland and bushland to cropland, without applying sufficient soil conservation measures. Farmers resettled at or near bodies of water and swamps, however, are affected by seasonal fluctuations of water levels that very often inundate croplands, grazing land, and homes. The demand for cropland and grazing land is increasing as reservoir and swamp areas expand and new families are created. Soil erosion in steep areas can no longer be reduced in the traditional farming system. These enforced land use changes, combined with a lack of appropriate land management practices, may increase erosion and reservoir sedimentation. This could affect food security and electric power production in the near future.																	0276-4741					FEB	2008	28	1					72	80		10.1659/mrd.0811								WOS:000253364700013

Linking remote sensing and ecological vegetation communities: A multivariate approach	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												In spite of few attempts for mapping land-cover types in Pakistan, remotely sensed data has not been used widely; and its potential is not being explored for providing information on mapping vegetation cover in general and ecological communities in particular. The present study was undertaken in the Lohibehr scrub forest in the Foothills of Himalaya, northeast of Pakistan. The objective of the study was ot find out the relationship between remote sensing data and vegetation communities of ecological importance using multivariate techniques Such as TWO WAY INDICATOR SPECIES ANALYSIS (TWINSPAN), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Correspondence Canonical Analysis (CCA). Floristic data were compiled for vegetation types and Digital number (DN) values were extracted from SPOT XS image for visible and near infrared bands (NIR). Classification and ordination methods were used for the classification of floristic data and to describe the relationships between floristic species composition and DN values. Ordination analyses indicated positive correlation between floristic species composition and DN values along the first ordination axis, with the NIR. The ordination methods proved effective in summarizing basic, general structure of the plant community types and to some extent indicated correspondence with their spectral signatures. The results highlighted the potential of remote sensing data in providing information on different plant community types that could be used in planning, management and conservation of subtropical forest.

Relationship between soil erosion and distance to roadways in undeveloped areas of China	CATENA												The presence and condition of roadways control the utilization of natural resources, which are associated with direct and indirect impacts on soil erosion in undeveloped countries. This paper addresses the relationship between soil erosion and distance to roadways in Xingguo County, an undeveloped area in Jiangxi Province of South China, for four time periods, 1958, 1975, 1982, and 2000. Soil erosion maps for each time period were interpreted using remote sensing and GIS technology for buffer zones four kilometers wide, subdivided into eight strips, each 0.5 kilometers wide, which were located alongside various types of road classes, namely trunk, town, village, and unpaved. The distribution patterns of various types of erosion were identified by GIS overlay of buffer strips and soil erosion maps. Results demonstrate that soil erosion cases found in buffer zones along both sides of trunk and town roads are the most severe, and areas with severe erosion decrease as distance from the strip to the road increases. However, moderate and slight erosion cases only have a minor relationship to the strip to road distance. There are more severe erosion cases than moderate and light erosion cases alongside village and unpaved roads, but the total area is not distinctly different from moderate and slight erosion cases, and severe erosion cases tend to decrease with an increase in the strip to road distance. Also, areas with severe erosion differentiated by time periods in the strips alongside roadways of all classes, except trunk roads, rank from highest to lowest as follows: 1975, 1958, 1982, and 2000. Notably, severe erosion areas in 1975, 1958 and 1982 are all quite extensive. Soil erosion alongside roadways of various classes is impacted jointly by historical policy, distance to roadways, and landscape. In undeveloped countries and areas, much more attention should be paid to the impacts of road construction, specifically soil erosion associated with road edge construction, and relevant measures for forest resource conservation should be formulated before initiating road construction projects.

Advances in precision conservation	ADVANCES IN AGRONOMY, VOL 98	Advances in Agronomy											Population growth is expected to increase, and the world population is projected to reach 10 billion by 2050, which decreases the per capita arable land. More intensive agricultural production will have to meet the increasing food demands for this increasing population, especially because of an increasing demand for land area to be used for biofuels. These increases in intensive production agriculture will have to be accomplished amid the expected environmental changes attributed to Global Warming. During the next four decades, soil and water conservation scientists will encounter some of their greatest challenges to maintain sustainability of agricultural systems stressed by increasing food and biofuels demands and Global Warming. We propose that Precision Conservation will be needed to support parallel increases in soil and water conservation practices that will contribute to sustainability of these very intensively-managed systems while contributing to a parallel increase in conservation of natural areas. The original definition of Precision Conservation is technologically based, requiring the integration of a set of spatial technologies such as global positioning systems (GPS), remote sensing (RS), and geographic information systems (GIS) and the ability to analyze spatial relationships within and among mapped data according to three broad categories: surface modeling, spatial data mining, and map analysis. In this paper, we are refining the definition as follows: Precision Conservation is technologically based, requiring the integration of one or more spatial technologies such as GPS, RS, and GIS and the ability to analyze spatial relationships within and among mapped data according to three broad categories: surface modeling, spatial data mining, and map analysis. We propose that Precision Conservation will be a key science that will contribute to the sustainability of intensive agricultural systems by helping us to analyze spatial and temporal relationships for a better understanding of agricultural and natural systems. These technologies will help us to connect the flows across the landscape, better enabling us to evaluate how we can implement the best viable management and conservation practices across intensive agricultural systems and natural areas to improve soil and water conservation.																	0065-2113		978-0-12-374355-8				2008	98						1	44		10.1016/S0065-2113(08)00201-0								WOS:000257315100001

Soil biogenic emissions of nitric oxide from a semi-arid savanna in South Africa	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Soils of arid and semi-arid ecosystems are important biogenic sources of atmospheric nitric oxide (NO), however, there is still a shortage of measurements from these systems. Here we present the results of a laboratory study of the biogenic emission of NO from four different landscape positions of the Kruger National Park (KNP), a large conservation area in a semi-arid region of South Africa. Results show that the highest net potential NO fluxes come from the low lying (footslope) landscape regions, which have the largest nitrogen stocks and highest rates of nitrogen input into the soil. Net potential NO fluxes from midslope and crest regions were considerably lower. The maximum release of NO occurred at fairly low soil moisture contents of 10%-20% water filled pore space. Using soil moisture and temperature data obtained in situ at the Kruger National Park flux tower site, net potential NO fluxes obtained in the laboratory were converted to field fluxes for each of the four landscape positions for the period 2003 to 2005. The highest field NO flux is from footslope positions, during each of these years and emissions ranged from 1.5-8.5 kg ha a (in terms of mass of nitrogen). Remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems techniques were used to up-scale field NO fluxes on a regional basis indicating that the highest emissions occurred from the midslope positions, due to their large geographical extent in the considered research area. Emissions for the KNP Skukuza land type (56 000 ha) ranged from 20 x 10(3) kg in 2004 to 34 x 10(3) kg in 2003. The importance of landscape characteristics in the determination of regional biogenic NO soil emission is emphasized.

David; Mayaux, Philippe			Using remote sensing to inform conservation status assessment: Estimates of recent deforestation rates on New Britain and the impacts upon endemic birds	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Remote sensing is increasingly used by policy-makers and conservationists to identify conservation priorities and changes in land cover. This is particularly important in the biodiverse tropics, where there are often few field data. Conservation action is often directed towards areas containing globally threatened species, but there have been few attempts to improve assessments of species' extinction risk through remote sensing. Here, in a novel approach we use deforestation estimates, measured through satellite imagery, to assess the conservation status of an entire endemic avifauna, based on IUCN Red List criteria. The island of New Britain, east of New Guinea, is of very high global conservation importance, and home to 37 endemic or restricted-range bird species. Analysis suggests 12% of forest cover was lost between 1989 and 2000, including over 20% of forest under 100 m altitude, with substantial areas cleared for commercial oil palm plantations. Application of the IUCN Red List criteria to these new data on area of remaining forest and rates of deforestation indicates that many species are more threatened than previously realised, with the total number of threatened or near threatened species increasing from 12 to 21. Thus, this study highlights the urgency of establishing and effectively managing protected areas in suitable lowland forests of New Britain. More broadly, it demonstrates another potential of remote sensing to assist strategic conservation decisions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Tian-Hong, L; Peng, H; Zhi-Jie, Z				Tian-hong, Li; Peng, Han; Zhi-jie, Zhao			Impact analysis of coastal engineering projects on mangrove wetland area change with remote sensing	CHINA OCEAN ENGINEERING												In the past decades, two large scale coastal engineering projects have been carried out in the Deep Bay surrounded by Shenzhen City and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. One project is Shenzhen River channel regulation and the other is the sea reclamation along the seashore on the Shenzhen side. The two projects are very close to the two national nature reserves, specifically Futian in Shenzhen and Mai Po in Hong Kong, which are important wetland ecosystems worldwide. This paper aims to identify and monitor the mangrove wetland changes with time series of Landsat Thematic Mapper images pre and post to the two engineering projects being launched. Coupled analysis of the image interpretation results and tidal data acquired at the same time in the context of the two works reveals that the mangrove wetland area has increased from year 1989 to 1994, and has changed little from year 1994 to 2002. Binary coding is applied to reveal the distribution image of mangrove at each phase, and the coding image shows that the construction of the two coastal engineering projects has caused frequent changes in mangrove spatial distribution. The study also shows that the change is not significant regarding to the precision of the method and the natural evolution of mangrove wetland, and the projects do not cause apparently influences upon the two national mangrove conservation zones at least for the research time period.																	0890-5487						2008	22	2					347	358										WOS:000257775200015

The analysis covered two periods: 1949-1972 and 1972-2006 using remote sensing techniques. For the year 2001, we mapped the patterns of distribution of secondary forests dominated by the most abundant exotic tree species (Ligustrum lucidum). Based on land-cover maps, we estimated sediment yield as an index of watershed condition. Urban area was growing during the whole study period. Between 1949 and 2006, forest area increased approximately 1400 ha, mostly over abandoned agriculture and grasslands; this expansion was accelerated between 1972 and 2006. Increased forest cover resulted in a reduction in erosion and sediment yield that was disproportionately large, as most new forests are located in areas of steep slopes and high rainfall. By 2001, Ligustum-dominated forests had expanded to more than 500 ha, in the southern portion of the sierra only. Overall, the analysis quantifies a process of Neotropical peri-urban forest transition, likely associated with socioeconomic changes related to population urbanization, that promotes improvements of some environmental services, such as watershed and biodiversity conservation. However, natural communities are strongly affected by past land use and neighboring urban areas, which have promoted a growing importance of exotic species with mostly unknown ecological consequences.

Studies specifically aimed at the relationship between the spatial variation of soil organic carbon and environmental factors are few. In this paper, a typical small watershed named Tongshuang in the black soil region of northeast China, which was subjected to drastic erosion before 1980 and was managed subtly after 1980, was chosen as a study area. Classical statistic and geostatistic analysis methods, in combination with a geographic information system (GIS), were used to quantitatively research the spatial variation characteristics of the soil organic carbon and their relation to the topographic factors and land use. The data on the soil organic carbon, topographic factors, and land use were obtained by soil sampling and measurements derived from DEM, remote sensing images, and field investigations, respectively. The classical statistics analysis results indicated that the variability of the soil organic carbon was moderate (C-v = 0.30). The slope position and land use types were the most discriminating factors. The soil organic carbon content was the highest in the grassland and lowest in the coniferous forest (P < 0.01). It increased gradually along the slope position gradients from the interfluve to the toe slope. The geostatistics analysis showed that the soil organic carbon had a strong spatial correlation. The C-0/(C-0 + C) was 0.1608, which was mainly induced by structural factors. The mean soil organic content is 2.27% in this watershed. It is on a very low level in the northern black soil of northeast China. In this small watershed of the eroded black soil region, the present soil and water conservation measures play an important role in controlling the soil loss. However, the soil organic carbon's restoration is unsatisfactory. Nearly three-quarters of the land has worrisome productivity. How to improve the soil organic carbon content while targeting the soil fertility is a pressing need.																	1064-2293					JAN	2008	41	1					39	47		10.1134/S1064229308010055								WOS:000253681400005

Remote sensing-measured impacts of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) on landscape structure in southwestern Kansas	GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING												Changes in landscape structure caused by the introduction of the U.S. Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) were examined. Using imagery-derived land cover maps for the pre- and post-CRP enrollment periods, we identified regions of cropland that had been converted to CRP in a six-county area in southwestern Kansas. The major impact of CRP in the study area has been the reversal of an overall trend of grassland fragmentation. The introduction of CRP has substantially modified the spatial structure of the southwest Kansas landscape, generally with important positive implications for wildlife habitat, by changing the count, size, shape, interior areas, and connectivity of grassland patches. The authors also concluded that CRP enrollments had a strong spatial association with the distribution of points of water diversion for irrigation.

Estimation of global SCS curve numbers using satellite remote sensing and geospatial data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS CN) method is an efficient and widely used method for determining the direct runoff (effective rainfall) from a storm event for flood disaster assessment (rainfall-runoff modelling). The CN can be estimated based on the area's hydrologic soil group (HSG), land use/cover, and hydrologic condition. The two former factors are of greater importance in determining the CN value. This study reports an attempt to derive a global CN map. First, HSG was classified from digital soil maps. Second, CN was estimated as a function of HSG, land-cover classification, and hydrologic conditions according to USDA (1986) and NEH-4 (1997) standard lookup tables. Potential applications of this CN map may include real-time global flood assessment by incorporating an operational multisatellite precipitation estimation system (e.g. http://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov).

Refining forest classifications in the western Amazon using an intra-annual multitemporal approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Seasonal dynamics in the north-eastern Peruvian Amazon were assessed within a multitemporal LULC framework informed by Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery of the study area for 2001 that coincided with seasonal flooding dynamics. Three images (12 March, 31 May, and 20 September 2001) were classified separately using a hybrid classification method that combined unsupervised and supervised techniques, and attributed with a classification scheme consisting of 18 LULC classes. A multitemporal classification that included 25 LULC classes was created from the three single-date classifications using a panel analysis technique. While some of the classes describe LULC 'changes' (land-use and land-cover change (LULCC)) that were stable over time (e.g. low sediment water during March, May, and September 2001), others were complex and included multiple trajectories of change. Panel analysis extracts pixel histories of change over three or more observations as a trend or trajectory, rather than segmenting those changes into piecemeal periods as normally done with from-to change detection. This technique was then assessed by testing hypothesized forest trajectories of LULCC. Traditional quantitative accuracy assessment techniques are less appropriate for panel analysis, and so a qualitative accuracy assessment was performed to evaluate the validity of the multitemporal classification. This study suggests that there may not be one typical year-round behaviour for seasonal environments, and that population-environment interaction studies would benefit from incorporating this knowledge into future research. This analysis further demonstrates the effectiveness of a multitemporal remote-sensing approach for gauging landscape fluctuations in seasonal environments.

Agrarian landscapes linear features detection from LiDAR: application to artificial drainage networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Linear features of agrarian landscapes are the anthropogenic elements such as hedgerows, ditches, and bench terraces that strongly impact agrarian areas' environmental behaviour, especially the ecological and hydrological areas. The need to map these linear elements for environmental impact assessments of agrarian areas is thus increasing since these maps limit the developments of spatial indicators and spatially distributed modelling. Until now, no generic remote sensing methodology has been proposed for such mapping purposes. This research was designed to assess the use of airborne LiDAR data for agrarian landscape linear features mapping. We proposed a methodology that uses LiDAR data in three steps. We first estimated elevation profiles from LiDAR points on a set of pre-located sites. We secondly performed profile shape description with wavelet transform or a watershed algorithm. Finally, we classified the profiles using classification trees with predictors coming from shape analysis. Methodology accuracies were calculated for a ditch network detection problem in a Mediterranean vineyard landscape. LiDAR Toposys data and field survey data for ditch location were collected in June 2002. As ditches are always located on field boundary lattices, elevation profiles were only computed on field boundary sites. Methodologies, using wavelets or the watershed algorithm, gave similar accuracies. Overall accuracy is about 70% with a high ditch omission rate (50%) but low commission rate (15%). The omissions conform to those obtained when performing visual classification of profiles. This high omission rate in ditch detection is therefore due to LiDAR data, not methods. Dense vegetation over ditches during the summertime and the specific LiDAR points spatial sampling design explain these omissions. However, the proposed methodology, especially using wavelets transform, looks transposable for the automatic detection or characterization of other agrarian linear features.

Accurate prediction of bird species richness patterns in an urban environment using Landsat-derived NDVI and spectral unmixing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Urban landscapes are expanding rapidly and are reshaping the distribution of many animal and plant species. With these changes, the need to understand and to include urban biodiversity patterns in research and management programmes is becoming vital. Recent studies have shown that remote sensing tools can be useful in studies examining biodiversity patterns in natural landscapes. The present study aimed to explore whether remote sensing tools can be applied in biodiversity research in an urban landscape. More specifically, the study examined whether the Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and linear spectral unmixing of urban land cover can predict bird richness in the city of Jerusalem. Bird richness was sampled in 40 1-ha sites over a range of urban environments in 329 surveys. NDVI and the per cent cover of built-up area were strongly and negatively correlated with each other, and were both very successful in explaining the number of bird species in the study sites. Mean NDVI in each site was positively correlated with the site bird species richness. A hump-shaped relationship between NDVI and species richness was observed (when calculated over increasing spatial scales), with a maximum value (Pearson's R=0.87, p0.001, n=40) at a scale of 15ha. We suggest that remote sensing approaches may provide planners and conservation biologists with an efficient and cost-effective method to study and estimate biodiversity across urban environments that range between densely built-up areas, residential neighbourhoods, urban parks and the peri-urban environment.

J	de Klerk, H				de Klerk, Helen			A pragmatic assessment of the usefulness of the MODIS (Terra and Aqua) 1-km active fire (MOD14A2 and MYD14A2) products for mapping fires in the fynbos biome	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												The moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer ( MODIS) fire-affected area data are not currently available for download by the public; therefore, 1-km pixel MODIS active fire data ( MOD14A2 and MYD14A2) were assessed as a potential source of fire history data for the fynbos biome. These data mapped between 60.1 and 65.7% of the area within fire boundaries mapped by reserve managers between July 2002 and April 2005. These results should not be taken as a negative reflection on the MODIS team, as active fires do not aim to map fire-affected area. Rather this exercise has helped identify specific limitations in the fynbos, which will provide insight into the fine-tuning of other MODIS fire products for use in the fynbos. Limitations are likely to be primarily due to sun-glint around coastlines; topographic shadows; highly reflective, light soils exposed after a fire; partial burning of pixels; patchy and irregular-shaped fires; and large pixel size. The MODIS active fire data are not sufficient for the purposes of developing a 4-year fire history of the fynbos. The publication of the 500-m MODIS fire-affected area data is eagerly anticipated as a solution.																	1049-8001	1448-5516					2008	17	2					166	178		10.1071/WF06040								WOS:000255059400002						
J	Kumar, A				Kumar, Amit			Rediscovering bamboo: remote sensing and geographic information systems perspective	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) are widely applied in forest mapping to obtain high quality and quantity data. The launch of RS satellites heralded a new beginning in natural resource survey and management. Soon the technique was adopted for mapping the distribution of individual species, such as bamboo. Recognizing the importance of bamboo to livelihoods in rural areas, forest ecosystems, and the economy, this work highlights the importance of RS and GIS in the mapping of bamboo-bearing areas through satellite imagery. The work also analyzes the applicability of RS/GIS to better management and conservation of bamboo resources. Mapping bamboo requires improvement in the traditional classification scheme and thorough ground truthing. Successful classification of the imagery would provide data on the current status of bamboo and assist in modeling future scenarios. In a GIS environment, action plans can be generated for effective bamboo resource planning. Over all, since RS and GIS have tremendous ability to remotely identify and classify bamboo, the methods should be put to better use to utilize the potential offered.																	1931-3195						2008	2								022501	10.1117/1.3010736								WOS:000264046200006

Coral reef communities, habitats, and substrates in and near sanctuary zones of Ningaloo Marine Park	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												As Australia's longest fringing reef, Ningaloo Reef lies close to the mainland of northwest Australia in an area of high tourism potential. The establishment of sanctuary zones in and around the northern Ningaloo Marine Park has necessitated improvements in understanding of the biodiversity and distribution of habitats and substrates in the reef lagoon, its seaward barrier, and the adjacent shelf environments. Using a combination of video transects in forereef-to-shelf environments, global positioning system-controlled ground-truthing of colour satellite images, and aerial photography for shallow lagoon settings, 16 habitat types were identified and mapped regionally. Lagoon substrates described in previous reconnaissance were mapped here in greater detail, and some of the first data on poorly known forereef and shelf communities have been analysed from the video transects. There is a strong correlation between reef morphology, inherited substrate type, and coral communities across reef lagoons and their associated barriers, where an energy gradient controlled by wave-driven and tidal circulation in reef flat and lagoon environments is reflected in the distribution and cover of robust to more delicate coral communities. Morphological controls are less distinct in island-associated habitats, where increased turbidity, differing wave energy, and more variable topography result in higher substrate variability and increasing soft coral communities. The data obtained in this study provide a background for management of biodiversity and monitoring of future impacts in some of the sanctuary zones likely to experience increased use in the northern Ningaloo Reef.

Land Use, Erosion, and Habitat Mapping on an Atlantic Barrier Island, Sullivan's Island, South Carolina	JOURNAL OF MAPS												Sullivan's Island is a barrier island residential community in Charleston County, South Carolina. Barrier islands are dynamic landforms constantly changing shape and position, and are essential in protecting the region from hurricanes and other forces of nature. Approximately 86% of the United States coastline in experiencing a net loss of shorelines, however Sullivan's Island is unusual in that during the past three decades the island has experienced accretion as opposed to erosion. In February of 1991, Sullivan's Island Town Council placed approximately 90 acres of accreted beachfront into a protective easement affecting both residents and tourists. This project was designed to survey and establish information of the land use and the conservation easement. As part of the project the erosion and accretion history over the past 60 years was investigated. This project used two basic forms of data collection: modern day and historic aerial photographic analysis of the barrier island's shape and remote sensing analysis of satellite data, from ASTER and IKONOS, to map the land use, land coverage and habitats on the island and the easement area. This map shows the land use of Sullivan's Island in relation to the 2006 aerial photography with the different footprints of Sullivan's Island from 1941 to 2006 overlain to show the island's accretion and erosion patterns.																	1744-5647						2008	4	1					161	174		10.4113/jom.2008.1016								WOS:000267267200015

Evaluating a crop residue cover index for determining tillage regime in a cotton-corn-peanut rotation	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Conservation tillage is a well known best management practice that improves soil quality, reduces runoff and erosion, and increases infiltration. However, a rapid assessment strategy for quantifying the rate and spatial distribution of conservation tillage practices is lacking. This study was designed to evaluate the sensitivity of a remotely derived crop residue cover index for depicting conventional tillage (CT), strip tillage (ST), and no-tillage (NT) systems in a cotton-corn-peanut rotation in the southeastern Coastal Plain. Treatments consisted of CT (rip and bed operation), NT, NT with subsoiling, and ST Remotely sensed data were acquired three times prior to canopy closure, using a handheld multispectral radiometer (485 to 1,650 nm) and thermal imager (7,000 to 14,000 nm). Using a combination of visible and near-infrared spectra, a crop residue cover index was calculated and evaluated. Results showed that crop residue cover is greatest in years planted with, peanut or cotton-likely due to the later winter cover crop termination date compared to years when corn is planted. The crop residue cover index outperformed the thermal infrared, accurately separating conventional from conservation tillage treatments in four out of six data acquisitions in 2004 and 2006. Differentiation among conservation tillage treatments was inconsistent. Regression analyses showed that a strong linear relationship existed between the crop residue cover index and measured crop residue cover (r(2) = 0.51 to 0.86, alpha = 0.10). These data suggest that remotely sensed data may be used as a rapid, field-scale indicator of conservation tillage adoption. Rapid assessment methodologies are necessary to quantify the impact of conservation practice adoption on water quality/quantity, assess adoption rates, and improve the placement of conservation tillage practices at local, watershed and regional scales.																	0022-4561					JAN-FEB	2008	63	1					28	36										WOS:000252518200021

Evolutionary consequences of human disturbance in a rainforest bird species from Central Africa	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY					International Summit on Evolutionary Change in Human-Altered Environments	FEB 08-10, 2007	Inst Environm, Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA		Inst Environm, Univ Calif Los Angeles			Relatively little attention has been directed towards understanding the impacts of human disturbance on evolutionary processes that produce and maintain biodiversity. Here, we examine the influence of anthropogenic habitat changes on traits typically associated with natural and sexual selection in the little greenbul (Andropadus virens), an African rainforest bird species. Using satellite remote-sensing and field survey data, we classified habitats into nonhuman-altered mature and human-altered secondary forest. Mature rainforest consisted of pristine rainforest, with little or no human influence, and secondary forest was characterized by plantations of coffee and cacao and high human impacts. Andropadus virens abundance was higher in secondary forest, and populations inhabiting mature rainforest were significantly larger in wing and tarsus length and bill size; characters often correlated with fitness. To assess the extent to which characters important in sexual section and mate choice might be influenced by habitat change, we also examined differences in plumage colour and song. Plumage colour and the variance in plumage luminance were found to differ between forest types, and song duration was found to be significantly longer in mature forest. The possible adaptive significance of these differences in traits is discussed. Despite relatively high levels of gene flow across habitats, amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that a small proportion of high-F(ST) loci differentiated mature from secondary forest populations. These loci were significant outliers against neutral expectations in a simulation analysis, suggesting a role for divergent selection in differentiation across habitats. A distance-based redundancy analysis further showed that forest type as defined by remote-sensing variables was significantly associated with genetic dissimilarities between habitats, even when controlling for distance. The observed shifts in morphology, plumage and song were consistent with divergent selection on heritable variation, but a role for plasticity cannot be ruled out. Results suggest that anthropogenic habitat changes may have evolutionary consequences, with implications for conservation and restoration.

A recent contribution by Walker et al. (2006, New Zealand Journal of Ecology 30: 169-177) described losses of indigenous vegetation between 1996/97 and 2001/02 (some 17 000 ha) based on an analysis of changes in the Land Cover Database, LCDB1 and LCDB2, respectively. We agree that the general approach of using these and other spatial datasets appears to be appropriate to investigate changes in land cover and the types of land uses that are responsible, but we would like to offer some comments to aid with the interpretation of this and other studies that use LCDB comparisons and similar techniques. Using aerial photography, satellite imagery, site visits, and other methods, we evaluated a stratified sample of 67 of the 449 polygons that were indicated to have changed from the most affected indigenous classes ('Tall Tussock Grassland', 'Manuka and/or Kanuka', and 'Broadleaved Indigenous Hardwoods') to the exotic forest classes 'Afforestation (not imaged)'and 'Afforestation (imaged, post LCDB 1)'. Our assessment of the entire area of each of these polygons covered 56.6% of the total area that was identified to have changed, and this revealed an error rate of c. 70% for this particular comparison of LCDB1 and LCDB2 data. This indicates the accuracy of such analyses may be too low to be meaningful and requires verification of the data that are primarily based on remote sensing, even when the overall aggregate accuracy is very high. In addition, we comment on the relative merits of different land uses in relation to the conservation of indigenous biodiversity, particularly the contributions of low-producing exotic grassland and exotic plantation forests. This is important because much indigenous biodiversity remains in exotic forests and embedded indigenous remnants, and the current clearing of potentially over 100 000 ha of such land for exotic pasture will cause significant losses of indigenous biodiversity.

The present study deals with periodic assessment and monitoring of the mangroves of Mahanadi delta, Orissa using remote sensing and Geographic Information System techniques. Satellite data of Landsat PASS for 1973, Landsat TM for 1990 and IRS P6 LISS III for 2004 were used to find out the changes that occurred in mangrove and other land cover categories during last 30 years. It was found that the delta is occupied by dense mangrove (12.6%), open mangrove (3.3%), aquaculture (12.9%) and agriculture (30.9%) in 2004. A loss of 2606 ha mangrove area and an increase of 3657 ha aquaculture area clearly depict high anthropogenic activities by local villagers. A significant increase of 726 ha plantations illustrates plantation activities taken up by the Orissa Forest Department to protect the coastal shoreline.																	0369-8211						2008	78						81	89										WOS:000262100200008

The results show the benefits of multi-temporal analysis in evaluating the state of landscape and in developing appropriate management projects. Three main aspects emerged: 1) reduction of agricolural practices (that enhanced natural development of herbaceous and shrubby communities, acting as important landscape elements for the emprovment of connectivity in ecological network); 2) natural recovery of shrubby vegetation (that can help the evolution of vegetation towards more evolved successional stages); 3) development of building activities (that may have caused the naturalization of alien species, reducing the floristic quality of the Park).																	1129-8596						2008	40	3					27	37										WOS:000262994700003

RUSLE2 model application for soil erosion assessment using remote sensing and GIS	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												The study is focused on the estimation of rate of soil erosion, using Revised Universal Soil Loss Eq. 2 (RUSLE2), in the Veppanapalli subwatershed of Krishnagiri catchment located in Tamil Nadu, India. The soil erosion is estimated for each of the hillslope units in the study area. The factors considered are intensity of rainfall, type of soil, land use classification and the existing soil conservation practices. Detailed analysis of soil samples were done to assess the texture, structure, permeability and organic matter content of the soil samples of each hillslope unit. The required data for the other parameters were estimated by carrying out intense field investigations and by the analysis of the satellite imagery of 5.6 m resolution. A data base was created with all the subfactor values for the hillslope units. Incorporation of remote sensing technique and Geographic Information System (GIS) made the spatial analysis of the study more reliable and accurate. The annual average soil erosion rate is estimated as 25 t/ha/year, which is on a higher range. This indicates the immediate need for the adoption of proper conservation strategies in this area to control the eutrophication in the Krishnagiri reservoir and to prevent further watershed degradation.																	0920-4741					JAN	2008	22	1					83	102		10.1007/s11269-006-9145-9								WOS:000251831400005						
J	Nautiyal, S; Kaechele, H				Nautiyal, Sunil; Kaechele, Harald			Conserving the Himalayan forests: approaches and implications of different conservation regimes	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												The conservation of Himalayan forests is big concern in view of global agenda. Many studies in this endeavor reported that the rate of forests degradation is posing a severe threat to the landscape and existing biodiversity in the Himalayas. Currently there many conservation approaches exists and of them four are widely recognized (1) Conservation through traditional religious beliefs "traditional conserved forests" (TCF); (2) Conservation through governmental planning and schemes "government conserved forests" (GCF); (3) Conservation through creation of protected areas (PAF); and (4) Conservation through community efforts "community conserved forests" (CCF). Our hypothesis in this direction says that all the conservation approaches lead to same results concerning to forest conservation. To testify our hypothesis we have studied the forests of each conservation regimes and evaluated them based on the identified indicators. We have done empirical studies and following the cloud-free satellite data were used for last three decades (such as Multi-Spectral Scanner, Linear Imaging and Self Scanning, and Enhanced Thematic Mapper ) to study a change in vegetation dynamics of the mountain forests in multi-temporal dimension. Our research concluded that community conservation approach have greater significance for biodiversity conservation and management in the Himalayan region. Here we support the model of CCF for forest ecosystem conservation, alongside the sustainable livelihood of the mountain societies. But every conservation regimes has its own importance in viewpoint of the particular objectives. Therefore, we suggests advancement and revision of PAF and GCF however, some elements of CCF can be introduced in TCF for making up it more sound in view of rapid socio-economic and cultural changes taking place in the communities.

Luis; Dupuy, Juan Manuel			Mapping species density of trees, shrubs and vines in a tropical forest, using field measurements, satellite multiespectral imagery and spatial interpolation	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												We estimated the number of species in a tropical forest landscape in Quintana Roo, Mexico, based on the relationship between reflectance values of satellite imagery and field measurements of plant species density (mean number of species per plot). Total species density as well as that of tree, shrub and vine species were identified from 141 sampling quadrats (16543 individuals sampled). Spatial prediction of plant diversity was performed using universal kriging. This approach considered the linear relationship between plant species density and reflectance values of Thematic Mapper (TM), as well as the spatial dependence of the observations. We explored the linear relationships between spectral properties of TM bands and the species density of trees, shrubs and vines, using regression analysis. We employed Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to select a set of candidate models. Based on Akaike weights, we calculated model-averaged parameters. Linear regression between number of species and reflectance values of TM bands yielded regression residuals. We used variogram analysis to analyze the spatial structure of these residuals. Results show that accounting for spatial autocorrelation in the residual variation improved model R-2 from 0.57 to 0.66 for number of all species, from 0.58 to 0.65 for number of tree species, from 0.26 to 0.41 for number of shrub species and from 0.13 to 0.17 for species density of vines. The empirical models we developed can be used to predict landscape-level species density in the Yucatan Peninsula, helping to guide and evaluate management and conservation strategies.

J	Stocks, A; McMahan, B; Taber, P				Stocks, Anthony; McMahan, Benjamin; Taber, Peter			Indigenous, colonist, and government impacts on Nicaragua's Bosawas reserve	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												We studied the impacts of colonists, two groups of indigenous residents (Miskitu and Mayangna), and management by the Nicaraguan Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARENA) on the forest of the Bosawas International Biosphere Reserve. Indigenous people and colonists subsist on the natural resources of the reserve, and MARENA is responsible for protecting the area from colonization and illicit exploitation. Using geostatistical procedures and Landsat images at three different time periods, we compared per capita deforestation and boundary stabilization in areas with colonists and areas with indigenous peoples. We also examined whether the Mayangna deforested less than the Miskitu and whether the Nicaraguan government has effectively defended the Bosawas boundary against the advance of the agricultural frontier. In addition, we analyzed the current distribution of land uses within the reserve and its contiguous indigenous areas with a supervised classification of current land cover. Indigenous demarcations protected the forest successfully, whereas the Bosawas boundary itself did not inhibit colonization and consequent deforestation. Indigenous farmers deforested significantly less per capita than colonists, and the two indigenous groups in Bosawas did not differ significantly in their effects on the forest. Our results show that indigenous common-property institutions and indigenous defense of homeland have been powerful factors in protecting the forests of Bosawas and that the difficult evolution of a nested cross-scale governance system in Bosawas-under pressure from indigenous peoples-is probably the key to the forest's survival thus far.																	0888-8892					DEC	2007	21	6					1495	1505		10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00793.x								WOS:000251764200019	18173473

Spatial predictability of juvenile fish species richness and abundance in a coral reef environment	CORAL REEFS												Juvenile reef fish communities represent an essential component of coral reef ecosystems in the current focus of fish population dynamics and coral reef resilience. Juvenile fish survival depends on habitat characteristics and is, following settlement, the first determinant of the number of individuals within adult populations. The goal of this study was to provide methods for mapping juvenile fish species richness and abundance into spatial domains suitable for micro and meso-scale analysis and management decisions. Generalized Linear Models predicting juvenile fish species richness and abundance were developed according to spatial and temporal environmental variables measured from 10 m up to 10 kin in the southwest lagoon of New Caledonia. The statistical model was further spatially generalized using a 1.5-m resolution, independently created, remotely sensed, habitat map. This procedure revealed that : (1) spatial factors at 10 to 100-m scale explained up to 71% of variability in juvenile species richness, (2) a small improvement (75%) was gained when a combination of environmental variables at different spatial and temporal scales was used and (3) the coupling of remotely sensed data, geographical information system tools and point-based ecological data showed that the highest species richness and abundance were predicted along a narrow margin overlapping the coral reef flat and adjacent seagrass beds. Spatially explicit models of species distribution may be relevant for the management of reef communities when strong relationships exist between faunistic and environmental variables and when models are built at appropriate scales.

Madagascar's forests are among the most biologically rich and unique in the world but, in spite of longstanding concern about their destruction, past estimates of forest cover and deforestation have varied widely. Analysis of aerial photographs (c. 1953) and Landsat images (c. 1973, c. 1990 and c. 2000) indicates that forest cover decreased by almost 40% from the 1950s to c. 2000, with a reduction in 'core forest' > 1 km from a non-forest edge of almost 80%. This forest destruction and degradation threaten thousands of species with extinction. Country-wide coverage of high-resolution validated forest cover and deforestation data enables the precise monitoring of trends in habitat extent and fragmentation critical for assessment of species' conservation status.																	0376-8929					DEC	2007	34	4					325	333		10.1017/S0376892907004262								WOS:000255376700007

Woody vegetation of a mosaic of protected areas adjacent to the Kruger National Park, South Africa	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: How is pattern detected and spatial scale defined in a manner that is meaningful to management? Location: Protected areas to the west of the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Methods: A Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWIN-SPAN) based on composition and structure was applied to woody survey data. The resulting TWINSPAN classes for individual monitoring sites were used in a supervised classification of Landsat ETM+ imagery across the study area. The training sample's co-ordinates were fed into a GIS and the resulting TWINSPAN point-feature shape file was processed using a 1 km theme-buffer function. Results: The supervised classification using the theme-buffer signatures yielded a satisfactory overall accuracy (kappa = 0.75; r(2) = 0.80; p = 0.05) using a test sample compiled by reserve wardens throughout the study area. The derived vegetation map was smoothed using a majority filter and after on-screen digitizing a small gabbro intrusion, it was accepted as the best representation of the woody vegetation of the study area at a scale of 1: 250 000. Seven plant communities were identified in the current study and satisfactorily accommodated within various topographical units of four extrapolated Landscapes of the Kruger National Park. Conclusions: Vegetation patterns are described of the areas under conservation management to the west of the KNP at a spatial scale that allows for the meaningful examination and comparison of the structure, functioning, and ultimately effective management, of these savannas. This contribution thus links to the co-ordinated effort extending into the Trans-Frontier National Park in Mocambique. A key objective is to better understand the functioning of these savanna systems for effective management and we discuss some of the key ecological issues within the plant communities of each landscape. The latter illustrate the usefulness of the technique in practice.																	1100-9233					DEC	2007	18	6					807	814		10.1658/1100-9233(2007)18[807:WVOAMO]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000250089400005

Morphometric analysis and prioritization of miniwatersheds in mohr watershed, gujarat using remote sensing and gis techniques	PHOTONIRVACHAK-JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												In this study, morphometric analysis and prioritization of the eight miniwatersheds of Mohr watershed, located between Bayad taluka of Sabarkantha district and Kapadwanj taluka of Kheda district in Gujarat State, India is carried out using Remote Sensing and GIS techniques. The morphometric parameters considered for analysis are stream length, bifurcation ratio, drainage density, stream frequency, texture ratio, form factor, circularity ratio, elongation ratio and compactness ratio. The Mohr watershed has a dendritic drainage pattern. The highest bifurcation ratio among all the miniwatersheds is 9.5 which indicates a strong structural control on the drainage. The maximum value of circularity ratio is 0.1197 for the miniwatershed 5F2B5b3. The miniwatershed 5F2B5a2 has the maximum elongation ratio (0.66). The form factor values are in range of 0.29 to 0.34 which indicates that the Mohr watershed has moderately high peak flow for shorter duration. The compound parameter values are calculated and prioritization rating of eight miniwatersheds in Mohr watershed is carried out. The miniwatershed with the lowest compound parameter value is given the highest priority. The miniwatershed 5F2B5b2 has a minimum compound parameter value of 3.12 is likely to be subjected to maximum soil erosion hence it should be provided with immediate soil conservation measures.

J	Munroe, DK; Nagendra, H; Southworth, J				Munroe, Darla K.; Nagendra, Harini; Southworth, Jane			Monitoring landscape fragmentation in an inaccessible mountain area: Celaque National Park, Western Honduras	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Many protected areas across the world are in locations marginal for human uses. Debate remains about the impact of these parks on land-cover change, which may be confounded by the role played by the biophysical landscape. To test whether parks limit landscape fragmentation due to their designated protection or biophysical location, one must control for features that render the park inaccessible. We examine the effect of Celaque National Park, Honduras, on landscape fragmentation from 1987 to 2000 using remote sensing, GIS and landscape pattern analysis. Multivariate analyses of variance and covariance were conducted to examine differences in landscape fragmentation within the park and the surrounding landscape adjusting for differences in accessibility. Indicators of patch fragmentation were significantly correlated with slope, elevation and distance to roads. Different management categories within the park were found to have significant differences in land-cover change and landscape fragmentation, and the impact of management category was even more significant after accounting for the differences in accessibility that exist across these zones. Thus, the park boundaries have been important in mediating land-cover change pressures, even after accounting for the substantial differences in the accessibility of forestland for conversion to agricultural land use.

If satellite-derived vegetation indices can provide us with accurate predictions of richness and rarity in an area, they can serve as an excellent tool in diversity and conservation research, especially in inaccessible areas. The increasing availability of high-resolution satellite images is enabling us to study this question more carefully. We sampled plant richness and rarity in 34 quadrats ( 1000 m(2)) along an elevation gradient between 300 and 2200 m focusing on Mount Hermon as a case study. We then used 10 Landsat, Aster, and QuickBird satellite images ranging over several seasons, going up to very high resolutions, to examine the relationship between plant richness, rarity, and vegetation indices calculated from the images. We used the normalized difference vegetation index ( NDVI), one of the most commonly used vegetation indexes, which is strongly correlated to primary production both globally and locally ( in more seasonal and in drier and/or colder environments that have wide ranges of NDVI values). All images showed a positive significant correlation between NDVI and both plant species richness and percentage tree cover ( with R-2 as high as 0.87 between NDVI and total plant richness and 0.89 for annual plant richness). The high resolution images enabled us to examine spatial heterogeneity in NDVI within our quadrats. Plant richness was significantly correlated with the standard deviation of NDVI values ( but not with their coefficient of variation) within quadrats and between images. Contrary to richness, relative range size rarity was negatively correlated with NDVI in all images, this result being significant in most cases. Thus, given that they are validated by fieldwork, satellite-derived indices can shed light on richness and even rarity patterns in mountains, many of which are important biodiversity centres.				levanoni, oded/D-3095-2013; Kark, Salit/C-6795-2016; Levin, Noam/D-2180-2013; Kark, Salit/I-7123-2013	Kark, Salit/0000-0002-7183-3988; Levin, Noam/0000-0002-9434-7501; Kark, Salit/0000-0002-7183-3988; Levanoni, Oded/0000-0003-0257-8693												1366-9516					NOV	2007	13	6					692	703		10.1111/j.1472-4642.2007.00372.x								WOS:000250297300005

Habitat-suitability models for cavity-nesting birds in a postfire landscape	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Models of habitat suitability in postfire landscapes are needed by land managers to make timely decisions regarding postfire timber harvest and other management activities. Many species of cavity-nesting birds are dependent on postfire landscapes for breeding and other aspects of their life history and are responsive to postfire management activities (e.g., timber harvest). In addition, several cavity nesters are designated as species at risk. We compare the ability of 2 types of models to distinguish between nest and non-nest locations of 6 cavity-nesting bird species (Lewis's woodpecker [Melanerpes lewis], black-backed woodpecker [Picoides arcticus], hairy woodpecker [P. villosus], northern flicker [Colaptes auratus], western bluebird [Sialia mexicana], and mountain bluebird [S. currucoides]) in the early postfire years for a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest in Idaho, USA. The 2 model sets consisted of 1) models based on readily available remotely sensed data and 2) models containing field-collected data in addition to remotely sensed data (combination models). We evaluated models of nesting habitat by quantifying the model's ability to correctly identify nest and non-nest locations and by determining the percentage of correctly identified nest locations. Additionally, we developed relative habitat-suitability maps for nesting habitat of black-backed and Lewis's woodpeckers from the best models. For all species except Lewis's woodpeckers, model performance improved with the addition of field-collected data. Models containing remotely sensed data adequately distinguished between nest and non-nest locations for black-backed woodpecker and Lewis's woodpecker only, whereas models containing both field-collected and remotely sensed data were adequate for all 6 species. Improvements in the availability of more accurate remote sensing technology would likely lead to improvements in the ability of the models to predict nesting locations. External validation with data from other wildfires is necessary to confirm the general applicability of our habitat-suitability models to other forests. Land managers responsible for maintaining habitat for cavity-nesting birds in postfire landscapes can use these models to identify potential nesting areas for these species and select areas in burned forests where postfire salvage logging is most likely to have minimal impacts on cavity-nesting bird habitats.

In order to assist in planning the protection of China cedar habitat and propose a scientific zoning project for TMNNR, we established a nature reserve geographic information system (NRGIS) of TMNNR using a geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS). In support of NRGIS, we produced a 3-dimensional simulation of TMNNR and obtained a predictive model through a combination of logistic regression modeling and multivariate analysis. The results demonstrate that slope direction, soil type, and annual precipitation are the main factors affecting China cedar habitat. The existence probability of China cedar increases with (converted) slope direction and annual precipitation. Yellow soil (FAO classification) is more suitable for the growth of China cedar in comparison to red soil (FAO classification). Finally, we predicted suitable habitats for China cedar using a model and function zoning for TMNNR. We suggest that it is necessary to analyze key factors affecting China cedar habitat in order to ensure appropriate conservation measures. NRGIS has been found indispensable for studying, protecting, and managing China cedar forest and TMNNR. NRGIS provides not only modeling information but also the means for monitoring this rare species, identifying suitable locations for reintroduction, and carrying out visible and dynamic management of the whole reserve.																	0276-4741					NOV	2007	27	4					352	358		10.1659/mrd.0773								WOS:000251660500011

Object-based classification of ikonos imagery for mapping large-scale vegetation communities in urban areas	SENSORS												Effective assessment of biodiversity in cities requires detailed vegetation maps. To date, most remote sensing of urban vegetation has focused on thematically coarse land cover products. Detailed habitat maps are created by manual interpretation of aerial photographs, but this is time consuming and costly at large scale. To address this issue, we tested the effectiveness of object-based classifications that use automated image segmentation to extract meaningful ground features from imagery. We applied these techniques to very high resolution multispectral Ikonos images to produce vegetation community maps in Dunedin City, New Zealand. An Ikonos image was orthorectified and a multi-scale segmentation algorithm used to produce a hierarchical network of image objects. The upper level included four coarse strata: industrial/commercial (commercial buildings), residential (houses and backyard private gardens), vegetation (vegetation patches larger than 0.8/1ha), and water. We focused on the vegetation stratum that was segmented at more detailed level to extract and classify fifteen classes of vegetation communities. The first classification yielded a moderate overall classification accuracy (64%, k = 0.52), which led us to consider a simplified classification with ten vegetation classes. The overall classification accuracy from the simplified classification was 77% with a k value close to the excellent range (k = 0.74). These results compared favourably with similar studies in other environments. We conclude that this approach does not provide maps as detailed as those produced by manually interpreting aerial photographs, but it can still extract ecologically significant classes. It is an efficient way to generate accurate and detailed maps in significantly shorter time. The final map accuracy could be improved by integrating segmentation, automated and manual classification in the mapping process, especially when considering important vegetation classes with limited spectral contrast.

BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Protected areas are crucial for Amazonian nature conservation. Many Amazonian reserves have been selected systematically to achieve biodiversity representativeness. We review the role natural-scientific understanding has played in reserve selection, and evaluate the theoretical potential of the existing reserves to cover a complete sample of the species diversity of the Amazonian rainforest biome. In total, 108 reserves ( 604,832 km(2)) are treated as strictly protected and Amazonian; 87 of these can be seen as systematically selected to sample species diversity ( 75.3% of total area). Because direct knowledge on all species distributions is unavailable, surrogates have been used to select reserves: direct information on some species distributions ( 15 reserves, 14.8% of total area); species distribution patterns predicted on the basis of conceptual models, mainly the Pleistocene refuge hypothesis, ( 5/ 10.3%); environmental units ( 46/ 27.3%); or a combination of distribution patterns and environmental units ( 21/ 22.9%). None of these surrogates are reliable: direct information on species distributions is inadequate; the Pleistocene refuge hypothesis is highly controversial; and environmental classiWcations do not capture all relevant ecological variation, and their relevance for species distribution patterns is undocumented. Hence, Amazonian reserves cannot be safely assumed to capture all Amazonian species. To improve the situation, transparency and an active dialogue with the scientific community should be integral to conservation planning. We suggest that the best currently available approach for sampling Amazonian species diversity in reserve selection is to simultaneously inventory indicator plant species and climatic and geological conditions, and to combine Weld studies with remote sensing.

Here, we examine how two contemporary drivers of fragmentation, anthropogenic climate change and exurbanization, affect movement and responses of animal species to new environmental conditions. We address the definition of fragmentation and how the spatial patterns created by fragmentation can be measured at the scales at which different species of animals respond to their environments. We discuss tools, such as satellite remote sensing, that increasingly make it possible to identify and quantify changes in land cover and vegetation structure across extensive areas. We also describe a range of methods that are available to guide decisions about faunal surveys and monitoring programs in fragments or reference areas. Examination of stochastic changes in land cover and species occurrence over time is important because these shifts can confound detection of systematic responses to fragmentation. Careful evaluation of fragmentation and its influence on the distribution and viability of fauna may help to identify underlying mechanisms and to develop effective strategies for conservation and land use.

Costa Rica's payment for environmental services program: Intention, implementation, and impact	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												We evaluated the intention, implementation, and impact of Costa Rica's program of payments for environmental services (PSA), which was established in the late 1990s. Payments are given to private landowners who own land in forest areas in recognition of the ecosystem services their land provides. To characterize the distribution of PSA in Costa Rica, we combined remote sensing with geographic information system databases and then used econometrics to explore the impacts of payments on deforestation. Payments were distributed broadly across ecological and socioeconomic gradients, but the 1997-2000 deforestation rate was not significantly lower in areas that received payments. Other successful Costa Rican conservation policies, including those prior to the PSA program, may explain the current reduction in deforestation rates. The PSA program is a major advance in the global institutionalization of ecosystem investments because few, if any, other countries have such a conservation history and because much can be learned from Costa Rica's experiences.

Check-dams are effective measures for soil and water conservation; concomitantly check-dam planning and construction urgently require current land use maps. Remote sensing technique plays a key role in achieving up-to-date land use maps. However, limited by the impact of hilly and gully terrain in the loess plateau, commonly used classifier for remote sensing data cannot achieve satisfactory results. In this paper, HongShiMao watershed in the loess plateau was chosen as the study area. Decision tree classifier (DTC) based on a genetic algorithm (GA) was applied to the land use classification automatically. Compared with the results by iterative self-organizing data analysis technique (ISODATA), GA-based DTC had much better results. Its total accuracy was 83.2% with a Kappa coefficient 0.807. The results also showed that most part of the study area belonged to the barren land with sparse grass or crop cover that attributed to the soil erosion and runoff.				shi, Zhou/A-2283-2015	shi, Zhou/0000-0003-3914-5402												0941-0643					OCT	2007	16	6					513	517		10.1007/s00521-007-0104-z								WOS:000250198500003

Fragmentation and clearance of Liberia's forests during 1986-2000	ORYX												We report estimates of the area and rate of loss and fragmentation of Liberian forests from 1986 to 2000. These estimates are based on comprehensive mapping using Landsat satellite imagery, which has a resolution of 28.5 m. We estimate a total forest cover of 4.65 million ha in 1986 and 4.33 million ha in 2000. Most of Liberia's remaining forest is in two large regions. These forests are very important biologically because they are the largest remaining forest areas in West Africa. The average deforestation rate was low at 0.2% per year during 1986-2000. Although the fragmentation of Liberia's forests is also relatively low, most of the remaining forest is readily accessible as it is within a few km of existing roads. This ease of accessibility suggests that the present low deforestation rate could increase if conservation planning is not effectively implemented.																	0030-6053					OCT	2007	41	4					539	543		10.1017/S0030605307000609								WOS:000252295300025

This study draws on multiple sources of data from remote sensing, together with ground observations and water sampling, to distinguish floodplain ecosystems in the Madre de Dios River, a tributary of the Amazon River in Peru. This remote tropical river meanders across sub-Andean alluvial deposits in a tectonically active region and creates floodplain surfaces of varying ages, including terraces that are above the reach of present-day river floods. Data from Landsat ETM+(optical multispectral), JERS-1 (L-band radar), and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (C-band interferometric Digital Elevation Models) were integrated in an object-oriented image analysis approach to distinguish five classes of floodplain vegetation. Vegetation classes generally correspond with successional age and reflect the activity of the riverine meander belt. Stage data for the river show erratic fluctuations and an annual range exceeding 8 m, but the maximum depth of floodplain inundation varied from > 1 m close to the river to approximately 0.1 m on more elevated ten-aces. The major ion composition of standing waters on the floodplain during the dry season indicated the importance of emergence of local groundwater in maintaining saturated soils, particularly further from the river, where backswamp vegetation is distinct and includes palm swamps. Thus, a hydrological continuum exists from deep but sporadic river inundation near the river to constant soil saturation by groundwater emergence in distal backswamps, reflecting the geomorphological origin and age of the floodplain deposits. This hydrogeomorphic continuum results in fundamental ecological differences. The exceptionally rich biodiversity of the sub-Andean region may be ascribed in part to the enhanced biodiversity associated with fluvial geomorphological features, and, thus, conservation planning must account for the diverse landforms created by fluvial dynamics.

J	De Asis, AM; Omasa, K				De Asis, Alejandro M.; Omasa, Kenji			Estimation of vegetation parameter for modeling soil erosion using linear Spectral Mixture Analysis of Landsat ETM data	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Soil conservation planning often requires estimates of soil erosion at a catchment or regional scale. Predictive models such as Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and its subsequent Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) are useful tools to generate the quantitative estimates necessary for designing sound conservation measures. However, large-scale soil erosion model-factor parameterization and quantification is difficult due to the costs, labor and time involved. Among the soil erosion parameters, the vegetative cover or C factor has been one of the most difficult to estimate over broad geographic areas. The C factor represents the effects of vegetation canopy and ground covers in reducing soil loss. Traditional methods for the extraction of vegetation information from remote sensing data such as classification techniques and vegetation indices were found to be inaccurate. Thus, this study presents a new approach based on Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) of Landsat ETM data to map the C factor for use in the modeling of soil erosion. A desirable feature of SMA is that it estimates the fractional abundance of ground cover and bare soils simultaneously, which is appropriate for soil erosion analysis. Hence, we estimated the C factor by utilizing the results of SMA on a pixel-by-pixel basis. We specifically used a linear SMA (LSMA) model and performed a minimum noise fraction (MNF) transformation and pixel purity index (PPI) on Landsat ETM image to derive the proportion of ground cover (vegetation and non-photosynthetic materials) and bare soil within a pixel. The end-members were selected based on the purest pixels found using PPI with reference to very high-resolution QuickBird image and actual field data. Results showed that the C factor value estimated using LSMA correlated strongly with the values measured in the field. The correlation coefficient (r) obtained was 0.94. A comparative analysis between NDVI- and LSMA-derived C factors also proved that the latter produced a more detailed spatial variability, as well as generated more accurate erosion estimates when used as input to RUSLE model. The QuickBird image coupled with field data was used in the validation of results. (C) 2007 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Habitat modeling for Amaranthus pumilus: An application of light detection and ranging (LIDAR) data	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Anthropogenic management of dynamic ecosystems has led to decline of species dependent on processes that maintain suitable habitat, particularly on barrier islands. By evaluating environmental variables over large geographic areas, remote-sensing data and geographic information systems (GIS) hold increasing promise for management of these unique habitats and their species associates. We used light detection and ranging (LIDAR) data to extract habitat variables for Amaranthus pumilus, a federally threatened flowering annual of the Atlantic barrier islands. We asked: (1) can habitat variables for A. pumilus be extracted from remote-sensing data, and (2) can these variables be used to model suitable habitat? We extracted topographic habitat variables for naturally occurring plants and evaluated habitat using multiple statistical techniques and other published model performance measures. We found that elevation was the most limiting topographic variable controlling the occurrence of Amaranthus pumilus. The most occurrences fell with in a 1.23 m range relative to local mean high water. Additionally, we used digital imagery collected concurrently with the LIDAR data to assess the role of vegetation cover in A. pumilus distribution. The occurrence of seabeach amaranth in previous years also was factored into the models. The models performed well, predicting 460%-100% of the plant occurrences using as little as 2% of the habitat. Amaranthus pumilus can potentially serve as a conservation "umbrella" for coastal biodiversity. The methods presented here for identification of A. pumilus habitat, using GIS and model construction of potential habitat, can be applied to other species of concern, including nesting shorebirds and sea turtles.																	0749-0208					SEP	2007	23	5					1193	1202		10.2112/04-0334.1								WOS:000249619100014

Bird distributions relative to remotely sensed habitats in Great Britain: Towards a framework for national modelling	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												This paper develops a comprehensive and objective picture of bird distributions relative to habitats across Britain. Bird species presence/absence data from an extensive field survey and habitat data from the remotely sensed UK Land Cover Map 2000 were analysed in 36,920 tetrads (2km x 2km) across Britain (a 65 % sample of Britain's c. 240 000 km(2). Cluster analysis linked birds to generalised landscapes based on distinctive habitat assemblages. Maps of the clusters showed strong regional patterns associated with the habitat assemblages. Cluster centroid coordinates for each bird species and each habitat were combined across clusters to derive individualised bird-habitat preference indices and examine the importance of individual habitats for each bird species. Even rare species and scarce habitats showed successful linkages. Results were assessed against published accounts of bird-habitat relations. Objective corroboration strongly supported the associations. Relatively scarce coastal and wetland habitats proved particularly important for many birds. However, extensive arable farmland and woodland habitats were also favoured by many species, despite reported declines in bird numbers in these habitats. The fact that habitat-specialists do not or cannot move habitat is perhaps a reason for declining numbers where habitats have become unsuitable. This study showed that there are unifying principles determining bird-habitat relations which apply and can be quantified at the national scale, and which corroborate and complement the cumulative knowledge of many and varied surveys and ecological studies. This 'generality' suggests that we may be able, reliably and objectively, to integrate and scale up such disparate studies to the national scale, using this generalised framework. It also suggests the potential for a landscape ecology approach to bird-habitat analyses. Such developments will be important steps in building models to develop and test the sustainable management of landscapes for birds. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study is designed to evaluate the consequences of human and natural impacts on changes in secondary forest succession land cover from 1972 to 2002 in the Artvin Forest Planning Unit, in NE Turkey. This paper also contributes to the development of a framework for effective conservation of biodiversity through,forest management plans by using successional stages and land cover types. Secondary forest succession stages and land cover types were determined according to Clementsian theory and mapped with Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) technologies through aerial photos and high resolution satellite images (IKONOS). The results indicated that the forest area in 1972 and 2002 was 88% and 80%, and the number of forest patches were 106 and 222, respectively. While the total road length in the Forest Planning Unit (FPU) was 67.7 km in 1972, it was 130.0 km in 2002, an increase of 62.3 km. Results shou, that urbanisation, industrial development and darn construction, together with unregulated forestry activities with clear-cut as well as insect outbreaks, affected the secondary forest succession and fragmented the forest ecosystem in the study area. Determining the secondary forest succession in detail is necessary for the sustainable management of such fragmented forest areas and for the preparation of biodiversity-friendly integrated forest management plans.

Incorporation of spectral data into multivariate geostatistical models to map soil phosphorus variability in a Florida wetland	GEODERMA					Pedometrics Meeting 2005	SEP 12-14, 2005	Naples, FL					Hybrid geostatistical prediction methods incorporate (i) spatially-explicit soil observations and exhaustive grids of ancillary environmental variables (e.g. derived from remote sensing), (ii) spatial autocorrelation, (iii) spatial covariation, and/or (iv) combinations of the above. In numerous studies of terrestrial soils it has been shown that hybrid geostatistical methods outperform univariate spatial and regression (aspatial) methods. However, hybrid methods have rarely been employed to predict soil properties in wetlands, In this study we used spectral data and derived indices from two remote sensors (Landsat ETM+ and ASTER), with different spatial resolutions, from different seasons, but with similar spectral range, ancillary environmental data, as well as floc and soil total phosphorus (TP) observations from 111 sites. The specific objective of our study was to evaluate the performance of aspatial methods (multivariate regressions - REG), univariate spatial (Ordinary Kriging - OK) and hybrid/multivariate geostatistical methods (Regression Kriging - RK and Co-kriging - CK) in predicting the spatial variability and distribution of floc and soil TP in a subtropical wetland, WCA-2A, in the Florida Everglades. Measured floc TP ranged from 194 to 1865 mg kg(-1) with a median of 751 mg kg-1 and standard deviation (SD) of 381 mg kg(-1). According to cross-validation, predictions for floc TP based on the root mean square prediction error (RMSE) were best in the following order: RKquadratic (134.9)>RKmultivariate (201.1)>OK (206.1)>CK (212.1)> REG(multivariate) (218.3)>REG(quadratic) (220.3)>REG(linear) (264.4); and based on the mean prediction error (ME) followed the order RKmultivariate (0.9)similar to RKquadratic (1.1)>CK (-6.7)>REG(multivariate) (18.2)>REG(linear) (25.1)>OK (-27.3)>REG(quadratic) (27.3). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)-green derived from Landsat ETM+ showed the largest predictive power for floc TP. Measured soil TP ranged from 155 to 1702 mg kg(-1) with a median of 433 mg kg(-1) and standard deviation of 316 mg kg(-1). Predictions for soil TP based on RMSE were best in the following order: RKASTER (200.1)>CKASTER (238.2)similar to CKETM (239.0)>OK (258.0)>RKETM (279.2)>REG(ASTER) (281.8)>REG(ETM) (356.1); and based on ME followed the order: CKASTER (0-1)similar to CKETM (0.2)>RKASTER (-5.2)>RKETM (-31.5)>OK (-41.8)>REG(ASTER) (94.4)> REG(ETM) (133.7). The NDVI showed the largest predictive power for soil TP. This comparative study in a subtropical wetland demonstrated the benefits of incorporating remote sensing data into floc and soil TP prediction models. Overall, hybrid geostatistical methods (CK and RK) performed better than regressions and spatial univariate models (OK) in the prediction of floc and soil TP. Depending on the strength of the spatial covariance between primary and secondary variables (CK) and the ability of the regression model in RK to explain the variability of a target variable (e.g., floc or soil TP), either CK or RK performed best. Our findings in this wetland confirmed results from earlier studies on terrestrial soils indicating the superior performance of hybrid geostatistical methods in predicting soil properties.

A first approach to global runoff simulation using satellite rainfall estimation	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Motivated by the recent increasing availability of global remote sensing data for estimating precipitation and describing land surface characteristics, this note reports an approximate assessment of quasi- global runoff computed by incorporating satellite rainfall data and other remote sensing products in a relatively simple rainfall- runoff simulation approach: the Natural Resources Conservation Service ( NRCS) runoff curve number ( CN) method. Using an antecedent precipitation index ( API) as a proxy of antecedent moisture conditions, this note estimates time- varying NRCS- CN values determined by the 5- day normalized API. Driven by a multiyear ( 1998 - 2006) Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Multi- satellite Precipitation Analysis, quasi- global runoff was retrospectively simulated with the NRCS- CN method and compared to Global Runoff Data Centre data at global and catchment scales. Results demonstrated the potential for using this simple method when diagnosing runoff values from satellite rainfall for the globe and for medium to large river basins. This work was done with the simple NRCS- CN method as a first- cut approach to understanding the challenges that lie ahead in advancing the satellite- based inference of global runoff. We expect that the successes and limitations revealed in this study will lay the basis for applying more advanced methods to capture the dynamic variability of the global hydrologic process for global runoff monitoring in real time. The essential ingredient in this work is the use of global satellite- based rainfall estimation.

APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: What relationship exists between productivity, plant species richness and livestock diet? Are the results dependent on scale? Location: A sheep-grazed Koelerio-Corynephoretea sandy habitat of the northern upper Rhine (Germany) as a low productivity model system. Methods: The investigation was carried out for three years at a fine scale (2 m(2)) and for two years at a broad scale (79 m(2)). Productivity was measured by means of weighed above-ground phytomass for fine scale and colour-infrared (CIR) aerial photographs of the same system for fine and broad scales. For both scales, total numbers of vascular plant species and numbers of endangered vascular plant species were extracted from current vegetation releves. Additionally, we obtained data on livestock diet (grazed phytomass, crude protein content). Results: Statistical analyses show an influence of the year on all variables; relationships between variables are not significant in ever), year. Species richness and number of endangered species are negatively related to productivity at fine scale while crude protein content and grazed phytomass are positively related to productivity. At the broad scale the diversity-productivity relationship shows a 'hump' with highest species numbers in middle pioneer stages: numbers of endangered species are highest in all pioneer stages. Conclusions: We found a strong impact of scale and year on the diversity-productivity relationship. It is inappropriate to analyse only small plots (2 m(2)). and it is necessary to study different years. This vegetation complex is dependent on grazing impact; thus there is an inversely proportional relationship between nature conservation value (high diversity) and livestock nutrition.																	1402-2001					AUG	2007	10	2					169	182										WOS:000247766700003

Changes in high-altitude Polylepis forest cover and quality in the Cordillera de Vilcanota, Peru, 1956-2005	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												High-altitude Polylepis forest is distributed throughout the Andes and represents one of the most threatened Neotropical vegetation types. It is an important habitat for a range of associated endemic species and provides vital natural resources to poor highland people, but these forests are threatened by over- exploitation and land management practices. Changes to Polylepis forests over a 50-year period in the Cordillera de Vilcanota, Perfi, were examined using air photographs and extensive field observations and photographs. Structured interviews were carried out with local farmers to record their perceptions of forest change over recent decades. Only about 1% of forest patches had been lost completely during the study period. There was no significant change in forest patch size, though larger patches tended to have denser canopies. Across all altitudes, about 10% of the forest showed a significant decline in canopy density, with very little forest showing the opposite trend. The majority of local farmers who were interviewed collected fuelwood from the forests and grazed their livestock there, but recognised the degradation these activities caused to canopy density and tree size. it is likely that the degradation of these forests over time has had an adverse impact on forest dynamics, associated biodiversity, ecological function and ecosystem services. More attention should be given to measuring and monitoring habitat quality of Polylepis forest, and conservation efforts should, in part at least, be refocused on protecting and enhancing the habitat quality of extant patches. However, habitat quality is difficult to define and measure, and presents a significant challenge to scientists, conservationists and local people. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, deltas, with their fertile soil and unique flora and fauna, need to be protected. In order for the use of such areas to be planned in a sustainable way by local authorities, there is a need for detailed data about these regions. In this study, the changes in land use of the Bal ova Delta, which is to the immediate west of Turkey's third largest city Izmir, from 1957 up to the present day, were investigated. In the study, using aerial photographs taken in 1957, 1976 and 1995 and an IKONOS satellite image from the year 2005, the natural and cultural characteristics of the region and changes in the coastline were determined spatially. Through this study, which aimed to reveal the characteristics of the areas of land already lost as well as the types of land use in the Bal ova delta and to determine geographically the remaining areas in need of protection, local authorities were provided with the required data support. Bal ova consists of flat and fertile wetland with mainly citrus-fruit orchards and flower-producing green houses. The marsh and lagoon system situated in the coastal areas of the delta provides a habitat for wild life, in particular birds. In the Bal ova Delta, which provides feeding and resting for migratory birds, freshwater sources are of vital importance for fauna and flora. The settlement area, which in 1957 was 182 ha, increased 11-fold up to the year 2005 when it reached 2,141 ha. On the other hand, great losses were determined in farming land, olive groves, forest and in the marsh and lagoon system. This unsystematic and rapid urbanization occurring in the study region is not only causing the loss of important agricultural land and wetland, but also lasting water and soil pollution.					esetlili, tolga/0000-0002-8095-4247												0167-6369					AUG	2007	131	1-3					409	419		10.1007/s10661-006-9486-0								WOS:000247467900035	17180418

Comparison of GCIP and stage III radar-rainfall estimates over the Mississippi River Basin for 1997	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The worth of archival, long-term, high spatial and temporal resolution radarrainfall estimates for hydrologic modeling has not yet been established. In particular, uncertainties remain regarding accuracy at the event time-scale, which is a modeling requirement for mass conservation. To explore this issue, an archival radar-rainfatt precipitation dataset produced from the National Reflectivity Composite for the GEWEX Continentat-Scate International Project (GCIP) and US National Weather Service, Weather Surveillance Radar 1988-D (WSR-88D) Stage III (SIII) data were compared with data from 982 National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) rain gages throughout the Mississippi River Basin. These two datasets are derived from the same radar- reflectivity observations but they are different. The GCIP dataset was developed from low resolution (5 dBZ bins) national radar mosaic imagery using a systematic procedure that employed one climatotogicatly-derived reflectivity-rainfall relationship, while the SIII radar-rainfall estimates are produced using a processing algorithm developed by the US National Weather Service that employs near-real time adjustment and varied parameterizations in different River Forecast Centers around the Mississippi River Basin. Statistical analyses were performed to compare both radar-rainfatt datasets with rain gage data on an event time-scale for the entire year of 1997. The investigation shows that the GCIP dataset, given a change in the equation used to calculate rainfall from reflectivity, has a tower root mean square difference for the majority of gages in four of the five river forecast centers that cover the Mississippi River Basin compared to SIII in 1997.

Spatial models of northern bobwhite populations for conservation planning	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Since 1980, northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) range-wide populations declined 3.9% annually. Within the West Gulf Coastal Plain Bird Conservation Region in the south-central United States, populations of this quail species have declined 6.8% annually. These declines sparked calls for land use change and prompted implementation of various conservation practices. However, to effectively reverse these declines and restore northern bobwhite to their former population levels, habitat conservation and management efforts must target establishment and maintenance of sustainable populations. To provide guidance for conservation and restoration of habitat capable of supporting sustainable northern bobwhite populations in the West Gulf Coastal Plain, we modeled their spatial distribution using landscape characteristics derived from 1992 National Land Cover Data and bird detections, from 1990 to 1994, along 10-stop Breeding Bird Survey route segments. Four landscape metrics influenced detections of northern bobwhite: detections were greater in areas with more grassland and increased aggregation of agricultural lands, but detections were reduced in areas with increased density of land cover edge and grassland edge. Using these landscape metrics, we projected the abundance and spatial distribution of northern bobwhite populations across the entire West Gulf Coastal Plain. Predicted populations closely approximated abundance estimates from a different cadre of concurrently collected data but model predictions did not accurately reflect bobwhite detections along species-specific call-count routes in Arkansas and Louisiana. Using similar methods, we also projected northern bobwhite population distribution circa 1980 based on Land Use Land Cover data and bird survey data from 1976 to 1984. We compared our 1980 spatial projections with our spatial estimate of 1992 populations to identify areas of population change. Additionally, we used our projection of the spatial distribution and abundance of bobwhite to predict areas of population sustainability. Our projections of population change and sustainability provide guidance for targeting habitat conservation and rehabilitation efforts for restoration of northern bobwhite populations in the West Gulf Coastal Plain.

J	Knudby, A; LeDrew, E; Newman, C				Knudby, Anders; LeDrew, Ellsworth; Newman, Candace			Progress in the use of remote sensing for coral reef biodiversity studies	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Coral reefs are hotspots of marine biodiversity, and their global decline is a threat to our natural heritage. Conservation management of these precious ecosystems relies on accurate and up-to-date information about ecosystem health and the distribution of species and habitats, but such information can be costly to gather and interpret in the field. Remote sensing has proven capable of collecting information on geomorphologic zones and substrate types for coral reef environments, and is cost-effective when information is needed for large areas. Remote sensing-based mapping of coral habitat variables known to influence biodiversity has only recently been undertaken and new sensors and improved data processing show great potential in this area. This paper reviews coral reef biodiversity, the influence of habitat variables on its local spatial distribution, and the potential for remote sensing to produce maps of these habitat variables, thus indirectly mapping coral reef biodiversity and fulfilling information needs of coral reef managers.

Integrated geophysical and topographical investigation in the territory of Ancient Tarquinia (Viterbo, central Italy)	ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROSPECTION					Conference of the International-Society-for Archaeological-Prospection (ISAP 05)	2005	Rome, ITALY	Int Soc Archaeolog Prospect				This paper presents the results of an ongoing study of the territory of Ancient Tarquinia (Viterbo, central Italy). The work is part of the University of Milano's Tarquinia Project, which studies the monumental area of this territory with particular emphasis on the 'Ara della Regina' temple site. To enhance the knowledge of this territory a scientific collaboration between the University of Milano (Department of Science of Antiquity) and the Institute of Technologies Applied to Cultural Heritage (ITABC-C.N.R.) was initiated in 2000 and is still in progress. The primary objective of the study was to determine the location and degree of conservation of unknown buried structures below the sites studied, using the integration of topographical surveys, three-dimensional laser scanner surveys of the temple and ground-based remote sensing surveys. The remote sensing surveys were carried out using the ground-penetrating radar (GPR). The analysis of the GPR time-slice maps indicates that some structural formations and walls of the buildings are still present below the surface. The results presented and discussed in this paper demonstrate the potential of both the topographical survey combined with the three-dimensional laser scanner survey of the monument and the remote sensing technique for understanding of the presence and the extent of buried buildings with respect to the temple area.

Therefore, we felt that it was important to critically discuss the state of comparative biochemistry and physiology in this country. Our study is based on data collected from the ISI Web-of-Science. We analyzed publication trends through time, availability of novel approaches and techniques, patterns of collaboration among different geographical regions, patterns of collaboration with researchers abroad, and relative efforts dedicated to the study of biochemical and physiological adaptation of native fauna representing different terrestrial Brazilian biomes. Overall, our data shows that comparative biochemistry and physiology is a lively and productive discipline, but that some biases limit the scope of the field in Brazil. Some important limitations are the very heterogeneous distribution of research nuclei throughout the country and the absence of some important approaches, such as remote sensing and the use of molecular biology techniques in a comparative or evolutionary context. We also noticed that international collaboration far surpasses interregional collaboration, and discuss the possible causes and consequences of this situation. Finally, we found that Brazilian comparative biochemistry and physiology is biome-biased, as the Amazonian fauna has received far more attention than the whole pool of fauna representing other terrestrial biomes. We discuss the possible causes of these biases, and propose some directions that may contribute to invigorate the field in the country. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Satellite detection of bird communities in tropical countryside	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												The future of biodiversity hinges partly on realizing the potentially high conservation value of human-dominated countryside. The characteristics of the countryside that promote biodiversity preservation remain poorly understood, however, particularly at the fine scales at which individual farmers tend to make land use decisions. To address this problem, we explored the use of a rapid remote sensing method for estimating bird community composition in tropical countryside, using a two-step process. First, we asked how fine-grained variation in land cover affected community composition. Second, we determined whether the observed changes in community composition correlated with three easily accessible remote sensing metrics (wetness, greenness, and brightness), derived from performing a tasseled-cap transformation on a Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus image. As a comparison, we also examined whether the most commonly used remote sensing indicator in ecology, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), correlated with community composition. We worked within an agricultural landscape in southern Costa Rica, where the land comprised a complex and highly heterogeneous mosaic of remnant native vegetation, pasture, coffee cultivation, and other crops. In this region, we selected 12 study sites (each <60 ha) that encompassed the range of available land cover possibilities in the countryside. Within each site, we surveyed bird communities within all major land cover types, and we conducted detailed field mapping of land cover. We found that the number of forest-affiliated species increased with forest cover and decreased with residential area across sites. Conversely, the number of agriculture-affiliated species using forest increased with land area devoted to agricultural and residential uses. Interestingly, we found that the wetness and brightness metrics predicted the number of forest-and agriculture-affiliated species within a site as well as did detailed field-generated maps of land cover. In contrast, NDVI and the closely correlated greenness metric did not correlate with land cover or with bird communities. Our study shows the strong potential of the tasseled-cap transformation as a tool for assessing the conservation value of countryside for biodiversity.

Fish diversity in relation to landscape and vegetation in central Western Ghats, India	CURRENT SCIENCE												The Western Ghats, one of the well-known biodiversity hotspots of the world, harbours 289 species of freshwater fish of which 119 are endemic. The ecosystems in this region have been, over the past 150 years or so, experiencing tumultuous changes due to the ever-increasing human impacts. In this regard, a study was conducted in Sharavathi River, central Western Ghats to understand fish species composition with respect to landscape dynamics. The study, using a combination of remote-sensing data as well as field investigations shows that the streams having their catchments with high levels of evergreenness and endemic tree species of the Western Ghats were also richer in fish diversity and endemism, compared to those catchments with other kinds of vegetation. This illustrates that the composition and distribution of fish species have a strong association with the kind of terrestrial landscape elements and the importance of landscape approach to conservation and management of aquatic ecosystems. Occurrence of endangered, endemic species and the discovery of two new species of genus Schistura reaffirm the 'hottest hotspot' status of the Western Ghats, a repository of biological wealth of a rare kind, both in its aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.

L., II; Calme, Sophie; Dickson, Rebecca; Pozo, Carmen; Sangermano, Florencia			Land change in the southern Yucatan and Calakmul Biosphere Reserve: Effects on habitat and biodiversity	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												The southern Yucatan contains the largest expanse of seasonal tropical forests remaining in Mexico, forming an ecocline between the drier north of the peninsula and the humid Peten, Guatemala. The Calakmul Biosphere Reserve resides in the center of this region as part of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. The reserve's functions are examined in regard to land changes throughout the region, generated over the last 40 years by increasing settlement and the expansion and intensification of agriculture. These changes are documented from 1987/1988 to 2000, and their implications regarding the capacity of the reserve to protect the ecocline, forest habitats, and butterfly diversity are addressed. The results indicate that the current landscape matrix serves the biotic diversity of the reserve, with several looming caveats involving the loss of humid forests and the interruption of biota flow across the ecocline, and the amount and proximity of older forest patches beyond the reserve. The highly dynamic land cover changes underway in this economic frontier warrant an adaptive management approach that monitors the major changes underway in mature forest types, while the paucity of systematic ecological and environment-development studies is rectified in order to inform policy and practice.

Mapping specific habitats from remotely sensed imagery: Support vector machine and support vector data description based classification of coastal saltmarsh habitats	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Remote sensing has considerable potential for the provision of information on the distribution of habitats that may be used to inform a variety of activities such as those required through the European Union's Habitats Directive. Such programmes are often resource-limited with a need for innovative methods that optimise resource use. This paper explores two approaches to resource savings when mapping habitats from remotely sensed imagery. The first approach realises that in an area of study often interest is focused on a specific habitat with the remaining land cover classes in the region of no importance. In such circumstances conventional statistical supervised classification analyses may be inefficient and yield a map of sub-optimal accuracy. The second approach seeks to further reduce the training requirements of a supervised classification. For this support vector machine (SVM) based approaches to classification are explored to map coastal saltmarsh habitats in North Norfolk, UK from a Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) image. A series of classifications using SVM based approaches and the Maximum Likelihood classifier (MLC) were undertaken. Classification accuracies were significantly higher using the SVM based approaches (e.g., 92.0% overall accuracy) than the MLC (64.8% overall accuracy). The SVM based classifications were demonstrated to be attractive for mapping a priority habitat in that the focus is on the habitat of interest to be mapped throughout the classification process resulting in a reduced need for training data. Moreover, it was shown that this can be further optimised through the use of intelligent training. This approach, based on the use of the support vector data description (SVDD), saved resource requirements even further in that training data were required only for the class of interest and yet still obtained high classification accuracies (95.2% overall accuracy). The wider adoption of SVM based classification of remotely sensed imagery is advocated for use in conservation activities. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Hyperspectral remote sensing of canopy biodiversity in Hawaiian lowland rainforests	ECOSYSTEMS												Mapping biological diversity is a high priority for conservation research, management and policy development, but few studies have provided diversity data at high spatial resolution from remote sensing. We used airborne imaging spectroscopy to map woody vascular plant species richness in lowland tropical forest ecosystems in Hawai'i. Hyperspectral signatures spanning the 400-2,500 nm wavelength range acquired by the NASA Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) were analyzed at 17 forest sites with species richness values ranging from 1 to 17 species per 0.1-0.3 ha. Spatial variation (range) in the shape of the AVIRIS spectra (derivative reflectance) in wavelength regions associated with upper-canopy pigments, water, and nitrogen content were well correlated with species richness across field sites. An analysis of leaf chlorophyll, water, and nitrogen content within and across species suggested that increasing spectral diversity was linked to increasing species richness by way of increasing biochemical diversity. A linear regression analysis showed that species richness was predicted by a combination of four biochemically-distinct wavelength observations centered at 530, 720, 1,201, and 1,523 nm (r(2) = 0.85, p < 0.01). This relationship was used to map species richness at approximately 0.1 ha resolution in lowland forest reserves throughout the study region. Future remote sensing studies of biodiversity will benefit from explicitly connecting chemical and physical properties of the organisms to remotely sensed data.

This study integrated traditional remote sensing and geographic information systems analysis techniques with a narrative policy analysis to assess the 19752004 land cover changes and their determinants in Nam Dong district (central Vietnam). Total forest cover of Nam Dong remained stable, but there were major transitions within forest and non-forest categories. Recent policy initiatives, particularly forest land allocation, have resulted in short-term benefit maximization through land speculation and illegal logging, while increased awareness of the economic potential of forests and their products have motivated people to access forests more frequently, leading to a highly dynamic landscape and increased barriers to forest conservation. This study suggests that (1) state-sponsored logging needs to be reduced, (2) forest allocation should proceed more rapidly to give farmers better incentive to improve and protect allocated forests, and (3) small-scale industry should increase. Forest conservation policy must be amended. More research is needed to link household land-use choices with policies, and determine how those choices lead to changes in the landscape.

Land use changes and associated environmental impacts on the Mediterranean shallow Lake Stymfalia, Greece	HYDROBIOLOGIA					5th International Symposium on Shallow Lakes	JUN 05-09, 2005	Dalfsen, NETHERLANDS					Land cover and land use changes affect ecological landscape functions and processes. Land use changes mainly caused by human activities, is a common reason for wetlands degradation worldwide. Lake Stymfalia, located at Peloponnese, southern Greece, is an ancient wetland with a great ecological value. Lake Stymfalia has been severely degraded and transformed during the past 60 years due to agricultural activities in the surrounding areas and watercourses alterations. In this context, we investigated the land cover/ use changes and the role of the reed beds in the terrestrialization process of this shallow wetland. This particular effort utilized remotely sensed data and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) techniques to estimate land use alterations for the period 1945-1996. Patch related landscape indices were generated to analyze impacts on landscape features. Spatial and thematic information concerning the surface area and the major land cover types of the lake for years 1945, 1960, 1972, 1987, 1992, and 1996 was obtained from aerial photographs and land surveys of the area, and was stored in the GIS database. The 1996 map was ground verified, corrected and updated to 2004 conditions. From the spatio-temporal analysis of the stored data, a permanent decrease of the open water surface has been observed between the years 1945 and 1996. The results indicated that the reed beds expanded dramatically, increasing by 89.3%, and is the predominant aquatic vegetation of the whole wetland. Open water areas and wet meadows decreased by 53.7 and 96.5% respectively. Landscape analyses and, in particular, the use of selected landscape metrics, proved useful for detecting and quantitatively characterising dynamic ecological processes. As land cover/use analysis of the wetland has shown much serious environmental degradation, conservation measures should be undertaken urgently.

Most people lived in rural areas until 1960, but now more than half live in urban areas. This trend has continued over the last 20 years, as families moved further away from city centres to find houses in the country, and this has caused land use to change rapidly. In decision-making studies to protect nature areas, rating and assessment of ecological data by scientific verification is difficult due to the huge volume and diversity of data. Therefore, the search for the most suitable and applicable method to achieve physical planning based on ecological understanding has been sought. The necessity for numerous parameters to be taken into account has stimulated the use of geographic information systems (GIS). This study assesses the usefulness of a GIS-based model in the protected area of Kaynaklar County, to the south of the city of Izmir. Existing cultural and natural land-use types, as well as soil, hydrologic, geologic and geomorphologic data layers (future classes) were gathered from field observation and using Landsat and IKONOS satellite images, and transferred to a database according to GIS rules. Index values were determined by taking impact on attributes of natural protection as a priority and these were attached to each feature class. Layers of data were merged by spatial intersection methods and new polygons were created for both cultural and natural features. A three-grade final map of the study area was generated using total index values of each new polygon.					esetlili, tolga/0000-0002-8095-4247												1350-4509					JUN	2007	14	3					278	286		10.1080/13504500709469728								WOS:000247415300007						
J	Duro, D; Coops, NC; Wulder, MA; Han, T				C., Dennis Duro; Coops, Nicholas C.; Wulder, Michael A.; Han, Tian			Development of a large area biodiversity monitoring system driven by remote sensing	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Biodiversity is a multifaceted concept that often eludes simple operational definitions. As a result, a variety of definitions have been proposed each with varying levels of complexity and scope. While different definitions of biodiversity exist, the basic unit of measurement for the vast majority of studies is conducted at the species level. Traditional approaches to measuring species richness provide useful, yet spatially constrained information. Remote sensing offers the opportunity for large area characterizations of biodiversity in a systematic, repeatable, and spatially exhaustive manner. Based on this review we examine the potential for a national biodiversity monitoring system for Canada driven by remote sensing, a country approaching I billion ha in area, with the aim of producing recommendations that are transferable for regional or continental applications. A combination of direct and indirect approaches is proposed, with four selected key indicators of diversity that can be derived from Earth observation data: productivity, disturbance, topography, and land cover. Monitoring these indicators through time at an ecosystem level has the potential to provide a national early warning system, indicating where areas of potential biodiversity change may be occurring. We believe the large area biodiversity monitoring system as outlined would provide an initial stratification of key areas where regional and local scale analysis can be focused, while also providing context-specific information for species collection data.

From 54 in the year 1987, the rhinoceros (rhino) population has touched 81 in April 2006. Keeping the increase in rhino population in mind and also the tendency of the rhinos to stray out of the sanctuary, particularly during winter season, a detailed study was made between 2000 and 2005 in and around Pabitora WLS, to mark the routes used by rhinos to stray out of the WLS using GPS and remote sensing-based mapping. During the field study, it was observed that on an average 20-30 rhinos strayed out from the sanctuary every night between November and March. Few rhinos were tracked down outside the boundary of the WLS during the study and the routes were mapped to assist the sanctuary managers to initiate appropriate remedial measures.																	0011-3891					MAY 10	2007	92	9					1303	1305										WOS:000246573500032

Our analysis has identified, mapped and sub-classified all remaining areas of Coastal Forest in Lindi and Kilwa Districts, and includes the discovery of a large and hitherto undescribed area of Coastal Forest at Namatimbili, which would make it one of the largest known blocks of contiguous Coastal Forest in eastern Africa. This forest furthermore appears to be minimally impacted by human disturbance. Given the rapidly increasing threats to forested vegetation in this area, urgent efforts are required by the conservation community to ensure the immediate and continued protection of Namatimbili forest.																	0960-3115					MAY	2007	16	5					1551	1565		10.1007/s10531-006-9047-4								WOS:000246802700015

However, there is still a gap in the over-view of global patterns of species distributions. This paper reviews how remote sensing has been used to assess terrestrial faunal diversity, with emphasis on proxies and methodologies, while exploring prospective challenges for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. We grouped and discussed papers dealing with the faunal taxa mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates into five classes of surrogates of animal diversity: (1) habitat suitability, (2) photosynthetic productivity, (3) multi-temporal patterns, (4) structural properties of habitat, and (5) forage quality. It is concluded that the most promising approach for the assessment, monitoring, prediction, and conservation of faunal diversity appears to be the synergy of remote sensing products and auxiliary data with ecological biodiversity models, and a subsequent validation of the results using traditional observation techniques.

Multiscale habitat use and selection in cooperatively breeding micronesian kingfishers	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Information about the interaction between behavior and landscape resources is key to directing conservation management for endangered species. We studied multi-scale occurrence, habitat use, and selection in a cooperatively breeding population of Micronesian kingfishers (Todiramphus cinnamominus) on the island of Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia. At the landscape level, point-transect surveys resulted in kingfisher detection frequencies that were higher than those reported in 1994, although they remained 15-40% lower than 1983 indices. Integration of spatially explicit vegetation information with survey results indicated that kingfisher detections were positively associated with the amount of wet forest and grass-urban vegetative cover, and they were negatively associated with agricultural forest, secondary vegetation, and upland forest cover types. We used radiotelemetry and remote sensing to evaluate habitat use by individual kingfishers at the home-range scale. A comparison of habitats in Micronesian kingfisher home ranges with those in randomly placed polygons illustrated that birds used more forested areas than were randomly available in the immediate surrounding area. Further, members of cooperatively breeding groups included more forest in their home ranges than birds in pair-breeding territories, and forested portions of study areas appeared to be saturated with territories. Together, these results suggested that forest habitats were limited for Micronesian kingfishers. Thus, protecting and managing forests is important for the restoration of Micronesian kingfishers to the island of Guam (United States Territory), where they are currently extirpated, as well as to maintaining kingfisher populations on the islands of Pohnpei and Palau. Results further indicated that limited forest resources may restrict dispersal opportunities and, therefore, play a role in delayed dispersal and cooperative behaviors in Micronesian kingfishers.																	0022-541X					MAY	2007	71	3					765	772		10.2193/2006-011								WOS:000246495300013

Non-point source pollution estimation using a modified approach	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Non-point source (NPS) pollution from agricultural land is increasing exponentially in many countries of the world, including India. A modified approach based on the conservation of mass and reaction kinetics has been derived to estimate the inflow of non-point source pollutants from a river reach. Two water quality variables, namely, nitrate (NO3) and ortho-phosphate (o-PO4), which are main contributors as non-point source pollution, were monitored at four locations of River Kali, western Uttar Pradesh, India, and used for calibration and validation of the model. Extensive water quality sampling was done with a total of 576 field data sets collected during the period from March 1999 to February 2000. Remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) techniques were used to obtain land use/land cover of the region, digital elevation model (DEM), delineation of basin area contributing to non-point source pollution at each sampling location and drainage map. The results obtained from a modified approach were compared with the existing mass-balance equations and distributed modelling, and the performances of different equations were evaluated using error estimation viz. standard error, normal mean error, mean multiplicative error and correlation statistics. The developed model for the River Kali minimizes error estimates and improves correlation between observed and computed NPS loads. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Wu, Q; Wang, MY				Wu, Qiang; Wang, Mingyu			A framework for risk assessment on soil erosion by water using an integrated and systematic approach	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												A new approach for establishment of an analytical risk assessment model to evaluate the risk index for soil erosion by water is proposed, in which the remote sensing, GIS, the analytical hierarchy process (AHIP), and modeling techniques are integrated through investigation of soil erosion by water in a joining area that partially covers the Shanxi province, Shaanxi province, and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China. Based on field survey and information analyses, pertinent factors for soil erosion by water in this region are assessed and nine dominating factors are identified. The considered dominating factors include the soil. type, rainstorm intensity, landform accounting for physiognomy type, ravine density, and land slope, vegetation coverage, mining area, level of water and soil conservation, and type of Land uses. The GIS thematic layers of degrees of risk on soil. erosion for those dominating factors are constructed. The weight of each thematic layer is determined through the AHP technique. This model is then applied in predicting development of soil. erosion at a typical scenario for this study area. A brief discussion on construction and application of this model. is presented. It is demonstrated that the presented methodology is practicable for establishing a risk assessment mode for soil. erosion by water for an area of interest where pertinent information such as remote sensing data is available. A flowchart presenting a general procedure for implementation of the proposed approach is also included. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Classification of burn severity using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS): A case study in the jarrah-marri forest of southwest Western Australia	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The southwest of Western Australia is a fire-prone landscape. In this Mediterranean region, prescribed fuel reduction burning is applied as a management tool by the state government's Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM). Remote sensing data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with multiple observations per day are investigated for operational monitoring of prescribed burning activities. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) is sensitive to the amount of biomass, soil exposure and equivalent water content. The differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (Delta NBR) shows the greatest response of landscape change due to fire. The ratios, originally applied to 30-m Landsat 7 ETM+ data, have been transferred to 250-500 m MODIS data. The high temporal resolution and direct broadcast capability of MODIS are considered favorable for monitoring prefire and postfire conditions, in particular in near-real time. This study applies the Delta NBR to classify burn severity using MODIS data with various levels of preprocessing. On the basis of field studies, four burn severity classes are distinguished with best discrimination for high burn severity where the top layer of the vegetation canopy is altered. As expected, the spatial detail of the classifications from MODIS is reduced when compared to results from Landsat 7 ETM+, but the large-scale spatial patterns are similar. NBR time series of daily data showed that classes of burn severity can be separated for each acquisition date. Large temporal variations of the NBR limit class separation with absolute thresholds, in particular for data uncorrected for effects due to varying viewing geometries. However, MODIS top of atmosphere data allow near-real-time assessment of burn severity, important to fire managers for monitoring postfire conditions.

Fine-resolution remote-sensing and modelling of Himalayan catchment sustainability	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												A number of studies have reported on environmental degradation in the Nepal Himalaya as a result of large-scale deforestation and the associated agricultural extension. In contrast to many previous regional scale studies, we consider land cover and its environmental impact on an individual catchment-scale, using fine-resolution Quickbird data and a soil erosion model. First, using a detailed land cover map generated from Quickbird imagery, we establish basic relationships between land cover, dwelling density and topographic variability, which exist in a typical mid-elevation Nepalese catchment, the Pokhare Khola. These data suggest a strongly subsistence type of household economy based predominantly on terraced arable farming. We demonstrate using multitemporal vegetation indices that this farmland has existed in the region since the late 1980s, and that widespread deforestation has not taken place since then, possibly as a result of specific forest conservation policies of the government coupled with efforts by local communities. Further, through the use of soil erosion modelling we demonstrate the role that the terraced farming practices can play in reducing runoff and hence soil nutrient loss, thereby enabling restoration of vegetation in the previously deforested land terrains. Finally, by combining this information with regional land cover data, we show that the findings of this research can be scaled up to draw conclusions about environmental degradation across the Nepal Himalayan region.

We used newly available spatial and remote sensing datasets, including spacebome optical and radar observations, and new techniques of spatial data analysis to generate subbasin (>= 100 km(2)), stream, and floodplain and wetland habitat classifications. We then generated a preliminary plan for a network of conservation areas to protect the most intact examples of representative habitat types while maximizing longitudinal and lateral connectivity. Proposed additions for freshwater conservation complement existing reserves and build on earlier conservation planning efforts for terrestrial ecosystems. In the resulting integrated plan, at least 20% of the area of each major freshwater habitat type is represented and two continuous corridors exist from the mouth of the Madre de Dios to its headwaters in the Andes. In total, we highlighted 84 currently unprotected subbasins to fulfill our representation and connectivity goals. About two-thirds of these subbasins were considered relatively undisturbed and are identified as Level I (critical management zones) or Level II (indigenous territories), whereas one-third are potentially degraded and thus were designated as Level III (threat mitigation zones). This exercise provides an example of how newly available remote-sensing datasets and analytical tools may be used to advance freshwater conservation planning, particularly in data-poor regions.

Coupling ecology and GIS to evaluate efficacy of marine protected areas in Hawaii	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												In order to properly determine the efficacy of marine protected areas ( MPAs), a seascape perspective that integrates ecosystem elements at the appropriate ecological scale is necessary. Over the past four decades, Hawaii has developed a system of 11 Marine Life Conservation Districts ( MLCDs) to conserve and replenish marine resources around the state. Initially established to provide opportunities for public interaction with the marine environment, these MLCDs vary in size, habitat quality, and management regimes, providing an excellent opportunity to test hypotheses concerning MPA design and function using multiple discrete sampling units. Digital benthic habitat maps for all MLCDs and adjacent habitats were used to evaluate the effficacy of existing MLCDs using a spatially explicit stratified random sampling design. Analysis of benthic cover validated the a priori classification of habitat types and provided justification for using these habitat strata to conduct stratified random sampling and analyses of fish habitat utilization patterns. Results showed that a number of. sh assemblage characteristics (e.g., species richness, biomass, diversity) vary among habitat types, but were significantly higher in MLCDs compared with adjacent. shed areas across all habitat types. Overall. sh biomass was 2.6 times greater in the MLCDs compared to open areas. In addition, apex predators and other species were more abundant and larger in the MLCDs, illustrating the effectiveness of these closures in conserving fish populations within their boundaries. Habitat type, protected area size, and level of protection from. shing were all important determinates of MLCD effectiveness with respect to their associated. sh assemblages. Although size of these protected areas was positively correlated with a number of. sh assemblage characteristics, all appear too small to have any measurable influence on the adjacent. shed areas. These protected areas were not designed for biodiversity conservation or. sheries enhancement yet still provide varying degrees of protection for. sh populations within their boundaries. Implementing this type of biogeographic process, using remote sensing technology and sampling across the range of habitats present within the seascape, provides a robust evaluation of existing MPAs and can help to de. ne ecologically relevant boundaries for future MPA design in a range of locations.																	1051-0761					APR	2007	17	3					715	730		10.1890/06-0536								WOS:000245744500008	17494391

It is endemic to scrub habitats in southeast India which have been lost and degraded because of human land use. We used satellite images from 1991 and 2000 and two methods for classifying land cover to quantify loss of Jerdon's Courser habitat. The scrub habitats on which this species depends decreased in area by 11-15% during this short period (9.6 years), predominantly as a result of scrub clearance and conversion to agriculture. The remaining scrub patches were smaller and further from human settlements in 2000 than in 1991, implying that much of the scrub loss had occurred close to human population centres. We discuss the implications of our results for the conservation of Jerdon's Courser and the use of remote sensing methods in conservation.

One-class classification for mapping a specific land-cover class: SVDD classification of fenland	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												Remote sensing is a major source of land-cover information. Commonly, interest focuses on a single land-cover class. Although a conventional multiclass classifier may be used to provide a map depicting the class of interest, the analysis is not focused on that class and may be suboptimal in terms of the accuracy of its classification. With a conventional classifier, considerable effort is directed on the classes that are not of interest. Here, it is suggested that a one-class-classification approach could be appropriate when interest focuses on a specific class. This is illustrated with the classification of fenland, a habitat of considerable conservation value, from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus imagery. A range of one-class classifiers is evaluated, but attention focuses on the support-vector data description (SVDD). The SVDD was used to classify fenland with an accuracy of 97.5 % and 93.6 % from the user's and producer's perspectives, respectively. This classification was trained upon only the fenland class and was substantially more accurate in fen classification than a conventional multiclass maximum-likelihood classification provided with the same amount of training data, which classified fen with an accuracy of 90.0% and 72.0% from the user's and producer's perspectives, respectively. The results highlight the ability to classify a single class using only training data for that class. With a one-class classification, the analysis focuses tightly on the class of interest, with resources and effort not directed on other classes, and there are opportunities to derive highly accurate classifications from small training sets.																	0196-2892					APR	2007	45	4					1061	1073		10.1109/TGRS.2006.890414								WOS:000245566200025

Mapping a specific class with an ensemble of classifiers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Often, in remote sensing, interest is focused on just one of the many classes that are typically represented in the area covered by an image. Various binary classifiers may be used to separate this specific class of interest from all others. It can, however, be difficult to identify the most appropriate classifier in advance. The selection of classifier is also often further complicated by a desire for information on classification uncertainty to indicate the spatial variation in classification quality. Here, five classifiers (a discriminant analysis, decision tree, support vector machine, multi-layer perception, and radial basis function neural network) were used to map fenland, an important class for conservation activities, from Landsat ETM + data. The classifications derived ranged in accuracy from 81.2 to 96.8%. The outputs of the classifications were also combined using a simple voting procedure to determine class allocation. The accuracy of this ensemble approach was 95.6%. Although marginally, but insignificantly (at 95% level of confidence), less accurate than the most accurate individual classifier, it is difficult to specify the most appropriate classifier in advance. In addition, the ensemble approach yielded class-allocation uncertainty information that may be used to help post-classification refinement operations and later analyses. For example, as only a small proportion of cases were allocated with a high degree of uncertainty and these contained most of the misclassifications, targeting such sites for fieldwork could be one simple and efficient means of increasing classification accuracy. Alternatively, the cases for which all five classifiers agreed on an allocation could be treated as being correctly labelled with a high degree of confidence.																	0143-1161					APR	2007	28	7-8					1733	1746		10.1080/01431160600962566								WOS:000246208000018

A land-cover map for South and Southeast Asia derived from SPOT-VEGETATION data	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Our aim was to produce a uniform 'regional' land-cover map of South and Southeast Asia based on 'sub-regional' mapping results generated in the context of the Global Land Cover 2000 project. Location The 'region' of tropical and sub-tropical South and Southeast Asia stretches from the Himalayas and the southern border of China in the north, to Sri Lanka and Indonesia in the south, and from Pakistan in the west to the islands of New Guinea in the far east. Methods The regional land-cover map is based on sub-regional digital mapping results derived from SPOT-VEGETATION satellite data for the years 1998-2000. Image processing, digital classification and thematic mapping were performed separately for the three sub-regions of South Asia, continental Southeast Asia, and insular Southeast Asia. Landsat TM images, field data and existing national maps served as references. We used the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) for coding the sub-regional land-cover classes and for aggregating the latter to a uniform regional legend. A validation was performed based on a systematic grid of sample points, referring to visual interpretation from high-resolution Landsat imagery. Regional land- cover area estimates were obtained and compared with FAO statistics for the categories 'forest' and 'cropland'. Results The regional map displays 26 land-cover classes. The LCCS coding provided a standardized class description, independent from local class names; it also allowed us to maintain the link to the detailed sub-regional land-cover classes. The validation of the map displayed a mapping accuracy of 72% for the dominant classes of 'forest' and 'cropland'; regional area estimates for these classes correspond reasonably well to existing regional statistics. Main conclusions The land-cover map of South and Southeast Asia provides a synoptic view of the distribution of land cover of tropical and sub-tropical Asia, and it delivers reasonable thematic detail and quantitative estimates of the main land-cover proportions. The map may therefore serve for regional stratification or modelling of vegetation cover, but could also support the implementation of forest policies, watershed management or conservation strategies at regional scales.																	0305-0270					APR	2007	34	4					625	637		10.1111/j.1365-2699.2006.01637.x								WOS:000245253000006						
J	Falcucci, A; Maiorano, L; Boitani, L				Falcucci, Alessandra; Maiorano, Luigi; Boitani, Luigi			Changes in land-use/land-cover patterns in Italy and their implications for biodiversity conservation	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Land-use/land-cover change is the most important factor in causing biodiversity loss. The Mediterranean region has been affected by antropic disturbance for thousands of years, and is, nowadays, one of the most significantly altered hotspots in the world. However, in the last years a significant increase in forest cover has been measured. These new patterns are independent from planned conservation strategies and appear to have a substantial impact on landscapes and biodiversity. We used three land-use/land-cover maps (from 1960 to 2000) covering the Italian peninsula to analyze the pattern of land-use/land-cover change. We measured an increase in forests, especially in mountains, an increase in artificial areas, especially in coastal zones, and a decrease in pastures. Intensively cultivated areas showed a limited decrease while extensively cultivated ones showed a marked decrease. In the same period mammal and bird species followed a similar pattern, with forest birds, ungulates and carnivores increasing, and typically Mediterranean species decreasing. We suggest that our results may provide important information, which could be useful for conservation planning in the entire Mediterranean hotspot. We suggest that an increasing conservation effort should be made to protect the Mediterranean-type forests and scrublands, as well as traditional agricultural practices. Moreover, future conservation efforts should consider the broad socio-political and ecological processes that are most likely to occur across the whole hotspot, especially along coastal areas, and the network of protected areas should be functionally integrated in a conservation strategy that includes the human-dominated landscape.

Land development, land use, and urban sprawl in Puerto Rico integrating remote sensing and population census data	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												The island of Puerto Rico has both a high population density and a long history of ineffective land use planning. This study integrates geospatial technology and population census data to understand how people use and develop the lands. We define three new regions for Puerto Rico: Urban (16%), Densely Populated Rural (36%), and Sparsely Populated Rural (48%). Eleven percent of the island is composed of urban/built-up surfaces. A large part of these developments occur in both low-density patterns of construction and sparsely populated neighborhoods. Half of the urban development occurs outside of urban centers. This analysis helps differentiate zones in the landscape with different uses and conditions, identifying not only urban and rural settings, but also the interface where development occurs in a territory dominated by forests and pastures, analogous to a wildland urban interface. The ineffective plan of land development has left a high degree of urban sprawl in 40% of island, where cities and towns appear typically surrounded by sprawl. The San Juan Metropolitan Area is one of the most expanded urbanized areas with a population of 2-2.5 million, comparable with the most sprawled cities of the U.S. mainland. This study reinforces the need for an efficient land use planning, and provides information to support research and planning efforts related to land development and conservation. It represents the first approach integrating satellite imagery with population census data for studying the human environment in the Caribbean. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Numerous areas within this landscape are considered 'sacred' by the indigenous Tibetans of the region, who interact with these sites in ways potentially beneficial to conservation. Our previous remote sensing study indicated that sacred sites are found in habitats with greater species richness, diversity, and endemism than randomly selected non-sacred sites. This study examines the role of sanctity in biodiversity conservation within habitats in the Khawa Karpo region by pairing plots within the same habitats in sacred and non-sacred areas. Understory richness, diversity, cover, and number of useful species are measured; for trees, richness, diversity, cover, and density are measured. Results indicate that within habitats sanctity does not affect understory plant communities; however, within sacred areas trees are larger (p = 0.003) and forests have greater cover (p = 0.003) than non-sacred areas. Our results indicate that, whereas placement of sacred areas and preservation of vegetation cover affects useful plants, biodiversity and endemism, within habitats sacred sites preserve old growth trees and forest structure. In sum, Tibetan sacred sites are ecologically unique and important for conservation on varying scales of landscape, community, and species.																	0960-3115					MAR	2007	16	3					693	706		10.1007/s10531-005-4381-5								WOS:000244684700008

There are many protected areas in the region, including Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (NDBR) and Valley of Flowers (VOF) where natural resource management plan (NRMP) has been implemented for the conservation of biodiversity. This has affected the traditional animal husbandry system, as well as the vegetation dynamics of alpine pastures. An integrated approach to studying the impact of NRMP in the region has been applied by us. First, a survey was conducted regarding livestock management, data pertaining the livestock husbandry, the role of animal husbandry in economics of rural household, and socioeconomics. Second, field based study on phytosociology of some important alpine herbs was done to enumerate the density and species richness in different land mark of the region. Thereafter, satellite data and Geographic Information System (GIS) were used to develop a land cover map of the area and to note changes in the landscape over time after implementation of NRMP. From an economic point of view the implementation of such plan is a setback to the rural economy. However, the ecological perspective of such models is a threat to the diversity of alpine pastures. The invasion of bushes/thorny bushes/shrubs and weeds with their luxuriant growth is changing the vegetation index and dynamics. Consequently, the diversity of herbs in alpine pastures of the Himalayan Mountains is in jeopardy. Overall, the situation is leading to landscape change in the region. This study is helpful for generating useful outcomes and strategies considering the question or debate "is grazing good or bad for pasture ecosystems in the Himalayas?".

The area suitable for agricultural production was carved out for imparting the productivity analysis; the land suitable for raising agricultural crops was delineated into different mapping units as productivity ratings good, fair, moderate and poor. The analysis performed using remote sensing and GIS helped to generate the attribute maps with more accuracy and the ability of integrating these in GIS environment provided the ease to get the required kind of analysis. Conventional methods of land evaluation procedures in terms of either soil erosion or productivity are found not comparable with the out put generated by using remote sensing and GIS as the limitations in generating the attribute maps and their integration. The results obtained in this case study show the use of different kinds of data derived from different sources in land evaluation appraisals.																	0255-660X					MAR	2007	35	1					21	30										WOS:000248101300003						
J	Huang, H; Zhang, L				Huang, Huamei; Zhang, Liquan			A study of the population dynamics of Spartina alterniflora at Jiuduansha shoals, Shanghai, China	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												This study investigated the population expansion pattern of an exotic species of Spartina alterniflora for a period of 7 years, after it had been newly introduced to the neonatal shoals of Jiuduansha (GPS), in the Yangtze Estuary, Shanghai. Remote sensing, in conjunction with geographical information systems (GIS) and global positioning systems (GPS) was used to map saltmarsh vegetation on the Jiuduansha shoals and the classifications were then checked using in situ field surveys of selected areas. The results showed that the S. alterniflora population had expanded from 55 hm(2) when first introduced in 1997, to 1014 hm(2) in 2004. The population expansion pattern of S. alterniflora on the Jiuduansha shoals was compatible with the common feature of invasions, i.e. the initial colonization, a lag time and the onset of rapid population growth and range expansion. In the first year of plantation (1997), about 35 hm(2) of S. alterniflora was successfully colonized on the Jiuduansha shoals. The period between 1998 and 2000 was characterized by a lag time, and the area of S. alterniflora increased only to 101.6 hm(2). The year 2000 marked an onset of rapid population growth and range expansion and the annual expanding rate reached 25-116%, which exceeded any of the indigenous species and indicated the strong competitive capability, rapid range expansion and wide ecological niche of S. alterniflora. The advent of remote sensing, in conjunction with geographical information systems and global positioning systems, provides a potential tool for mapping vegetation, and for monitoring population dynamics and range expansion of invasive species on a large scale. The implications for population and community dynamics, biodiversity conservation and wetland management in terms of the analysis of the sequence of events associated with the initial colonization, a lag time, rate of geographic spread and features of geographic spread of the exotic S. alterniflora and the native R australis on the Jiuduansha shoals are discussed.

Remote sensing and GIS techniques for selecting a sustainable scenario for Lake Koronia, Greece	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												During recent decades, Lake Koronia has undergone severe degradation as a result of human activities around the lake and throughout the basin. Surface and groundwater abstraction and pollution from agricultural, industrial, and municipal sources are the major sources of degradation. Planning a restoration project was hampered by lack of sufficient data, with gaps evident in both spatial and temporal dimensions. This study emphasized various remote sensing and geographic information system techniques, such as digital image processing and geographic overlay, to fill gaps using satellite imagery and other spatial environmental, hydrological, and hydrogeological data in the process of planning the restoration of Lake Koronia, following Ramsar guidelines. Current and historical remote sensing data were used to assess the current status and level of degradation, set constraints and define the ideotype for the restoration, and, finally, define and select the best restoration scenario.

However, there is still a gap in the overview of global patterns of species distributions. This paper reviews how remote sensing has been used to assess terrestrial faunal diversity, with emphasis on proxies and methodologies, while exploring prospective challenges for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. We grouped and discussed papers dealing with the faunal taxa mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates into five classes of surrogates of animal diversity: (1) habitat suitability, (2) photosynthetic productivity, (3) multi-temporal patterns, (4) structural properties of habitat, and (5) forage quality. It is concluded that the most promising approach for the assessment, monitoring, prediction, and conservation of faunal diversity appears to be the synergy of remote sensing products and auxiliary data with ecological biodiversity models, and a subsequent validation of the results using traditional observation techniques.

J	Stevens, CE; Paszkowski, CA; Foote, AL				Stevens, Cameron E.; Paszkowski, Cynthia A.; Foote, A. Lee			Beaver (Castor canadensis) as a surrogate species for conserving anuran amphibians on boreal streams in Alberta, Canada	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												We explored the use of beaver (Castor canadensis) as a surrogate species for amphibian conservation on small (1st-4th-order) streams in the Boreal Foothills of west-central Alberta. Anuran call surveys indicated that beaver create breeding habitat for the boreal chorus frog (Pseudacris maculata), wood frog (Rana sylvatica) and western toad (Bufo boreas). No calling males of any species were recorded on unobstructed streams. Wood frog, the most abundant species, exhibited high rates of juvenile recruitment on beaver ponds. Pitfall traps captured more wood frogs on beaver ponds versus unobstructed streams, and most individuals (84%) were young-of-year. Abundance of young-of-year was strongly correlated with percent landscape occupied by beaver ponds indicating that anurans captured along streams originated in beaver ponds. Based on a novel combination of a digital elevation model and aerial photographs examined with GIS, statistical models showed that the probability of beaver pond occurrence on streams was positively associated with stream order and dependent on the interacting effects of distance to nearest forestry cutblock and availability of beaver foods (Populus spp.). We propose that the distribution and abundance of beaver ponds could be determined over large areas quickly and inexpensively by remote sensing and used to identify and monitor amphibian habitat, and possibly, populations. This work establishes the pre-eminence of beaver-created wetlands as amphibian habitat in the Boreal Foothills and that the incorporation of dam-building patterns into forest management strategies could aid amphibian conservation.

Water balance for the Ji-Parana River Basin, Western Amazon, using a simple method through geographical information systems and remote sensing	EARTH INTERACTIONS												The Thornthwaite-Mather climatological model integrated into a Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to simulate the monthly water balance for the Ji-Parana river basin, in the western Amazonian state of Rondonia (RO), from February 1995 through December 1996. Model inputs were Advanced Very High Resolution Radar (AVHRR) images, rainfall from rain gauges within and around the basin, soils, and land cover maps. Mean monthly temperature images, estimated from AVHRR, were used to calculate monthly potential evapotranspiration images. Rainfall measurements were interpolated to obtain monthly rainfall images using the spline method. Results were compared with annual water mass balance for 10 internal subbasins. Model results underestimated basin evapotranspiration in -6% and water surplus was overestimated in +12%. Annual basin evapotranspiration was 1166 mm, or 3.2 mm day(-1), with a minimum in the dry season (1.7 mm day(-1) in July) and maximum in the beginning of the wet season (4.2 mm day(-1) in October). Three distinct land cover scenarios were evaluated. Complete basin deforestation reduced basin evapotranspiration and increased water deficit and surplus in approximately 200 mm yr(-1).

J	Mathieu, R; Cervelle, B; Remy, D; Pouget, M				Mathieu, Renaud; Cervelle, Bernard; Remy, Dominique; Pouget, Marcel			Field-based and spectral indicators for soil erosion mapping in semi-arid mediterranean environments (Coastal Cordillera of central Chile)	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												The Coastal Cordillera of central Chile is naturally sensitive to soil erosion due to moderate to steep slopes, intense winter rains when the vegetation cover is scarce, and deeply weathered granitic rocks. In 1965, 60 per cent of its surface was moderately to very severely eroded. Today this process is still largely active, but no data are currently available to evaluate the real extent, distribution and severity of soil degradation on a regional scale. This information is vital to support efficient soil conservation plans. A multi-scale approach was implemented to produce regional land degradation maps based on remote sensing technologies. Fieldwork has shown that the surface colour or 'redness' and the density of coarse fragments are pertinent erosion indicators to describe a typical sequence of soil degradation in the context of mediterranean soil developed on granitic materials and micaschists. Field radiometric experiments concluded that both factors influence the reflectance of natural surfaces and can be modelled using radiometric indices accessible from most satellites operating in the optical domain, i.e. redness index and brightness index. Finally the radiometric indices were successfully applied to SPOT images to produce land degradation maps. Only broad classes of erosion status were discriminated and the detection of the degradation processes was only possible when most of the fertile layer had already been removed. This technology provides decision-making information required to develop regional soil conservation plans and to prioritize actions between catchment areas, especially in vast inter-tropical regions where spatialized data are not always readily available.

Forest cover and pattern changes in the Carpathians over the last decades	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												This study aims at developing a satellite-based methodology for the implementation of two Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe indicators for the European Alpine Bio-geographic region, and their changes over time: (1) area of forest cover and (2) forest spatial pattern. The northern Carpathians were selected as a study area due to the documented recent increase of forest cover. Changes of forest cover were quantified using Landsat images for the years 1987 and 2000. Single-date forest-non-forest maps were derived by image segmentation and supervised classification, including the use of ancillary data (CORINE Land Cover and a digital elevation model). These maps were an input for the post-classification change detection. The forest spatial pattern maps with four classes (core, patch, edge and perforated forest) were derived with morphological image processing. A simple method to mask uncertainty areas on forest maps and related products was also developed. The accuracy of the resulting forest-non-forest map was assessed with orthophotos and amounts to 93.9%. Uncertainty areas, for which change assessment was judged more difficult and less reliable, were not considered for assessing forest cover change. The annual forest cover change rate of 0.38% was found over the 1987-2000 period. For the 13-year time period, we found a decrease of core forest and an increase of patch and perforated forest. We conclude that the proposed methodology allows to quantify changes of forest cover and forest spatial pattern at similar to 1 ha minimum mapping unit.

The aim here is to examine vegetation changes in this area on a regional scale from 2000 to 2004 in relation to land-use changes and climate traits. The data in this assessment include remote sensing information from moderate-resolution imaging spectro-radio meter normalized difference vegetation index from 2000 to 2004, and climate data (precipitation and temperature) from 1956 to 2000. The results show an increase in vegetation production from 2000 to 2004, particularly in the north, which cannot be explained solely by climate impacts. Since the vegetation in the north is more dependent on climate variation than the other parts of Shaanxi due to more serious water limitation, the results suggest that the large-scale land-use policy implemented over the last decade, with a focus on northern Shaanxi, is possibly having an impact on the overall vegetation.

Recent studies however found extensive loss of tropical. forest habitat around protected areas, vastly contributing to increase the levels of ecotogical. isotation. Using high-resolution satellite data we investigated the isolation trend occurring in the W-Arty-Pendjari (WAP) ecological complex in West Africa. A land-cover change analysis was performed for the period 1984-2002: savanna vegetation extension and toss were derived within the complex and in a 30 km peripheral buffer. Sample regions in the buffer were also analysed using selected spatial. indicators to quantify temporal trends in habitat fragmentation. Implications for change in relative capacity to conserve biodiversity were discussed through the calculation of the species richness capacity (SRC). More than 14.5% of savanna habitat was lost in the WAP peripheral areas, while 0.3% was converted inside the complex. The degree of fragmentation of remnant savanna habitat has also drastically increased. Despite the effectiveness of the park conservation programme, we found through the SRC approach that the WAP complex is decreasing its potential capacity to conserve species richness. This process is mainly due to the rapid and extended agricultural expansion taking place around the complex. A better understanding of the ecological dynamics occurring in the peripheral regions of reserves and the consideration of development needs are key variables to achieve conservation goals in protected areas.

Monitoring the Chilla-Motichur wildlife corridor using geospatial tools	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION												The present study attempts to assess the Chilla-Motichur wildlife corridor of Rajaji National Park in the Uttaranchal State of India using temporal satellite imagery from the years 1972, 1990, and 2005. The on-screen visual interpretation of three-period imagery followed by change matrix analysis revealed considerable corridor toss between 1972 and 2005 (17.56 km(2)). The loss was more pronounced between 1972 and 1990 (11.18 km(2)) than between 1990 and 2005 (6.38 km(2)). The toss of the corridor was attributed to various developmental projects, such as: roads; rail; hydropower canal; the expansion of townships of Hardwar and Rishikesh; the resettlement of people displaced by the construction of the Tehri dam; and creation of the army cantonment. This study highlights the conservation concerns relating to the depletion of the corridor with the passage of time.

Comparison of predictor sets for species richness and the number of rare species of butterflies and birds	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Accurate inventories of biota are typically restricted to few locations within an extensive region. Accordingly, effective planning must involve some form of surrogate measures coupled with spatial modelling. We conducted a simultaneous comparison of models of both species richness and the number of rare species using three types of surrogates (indicator species, vegetation composition and structure, and topoclimate) as predictors. We evaluated each type of surrogate alone and in combination with others. Location Data for our analyses were collected from 1996-2004 in three adjacent mountain ranges in the central Great Basin (Lander and Nye counties, Nevada, USA), the Shoshone Mountains, Toiyabe Range and Toquima Range. Methods Data on species richness and species composition of butterflies and birds and measures of vegetation composition and structure were obtained in the field. Topoclimatic variables were derived by GIS from digital sources and satellite images. We used Poisson regression with Bayesian model averaging to predict species richness and the number of rare species. We compared the expected prediction success of all models on the basis of internal and external validation trials. Results Same-taxon indicator species were the most accurate predictors of species richness and of the number of rare species of butterflies and birds. Cross-taxon indicator species and topoclimate variables were reasonably accurate predictors of species richness of butterflies and birds and of the number of rare butterfly species. Although vegetation variables were more effective for predicting species richness and number of rare species of birds than of butterflies, they were the least accurate predictors overall. Main conclusions Although indicator species may provide the most accurate predictions of species richness, their practical value, like any surrogate measure, depends greatly on ecological considerations and land-use context. In general, the ability to predict numbers of rare species based on any set of candidate predictors was weaker than the ability to predict species richness, which may result from the high degree of stochasticity that often characterizes distributions of rare species. Our statistical approach for objective examination of different candidate predictors can help ensure that selection of species-richness surrogates in any system is scientifically reliable and cost-effective.

Western Indian Ocean coral communities: bleaching responses and susceptibility to extinction	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												A field study of coral bleaching and coral communities was undertaken spanning 8 countries and similar to 35 degrees of latitude in 2005. This was combined with studies in southern Kenya and northeast Madagascar in 1998 and Mauritius in 2004 to develop a synoptic analysis of coral community structure, bleaching response, susceptibility of the communities to bleaching, and the relative risk of extinctions in western Indian Ocean coral reefs. Cluster analysis identified 8 distinct coral communities among the 91 sites sampled, with 2 distinct communities in northern South Africa and central Mozambique, a third in the central atolls of the Maldives, and 5 less differentiated groups, in a swath from southern Kenya to Mauritius, including Tanzania, the granitic islands of the Seychelles, northeast Madagascar, and Reunion. Massive Porites, Pavona, and Pociflopora dominated the central and northern Indian Ocean sites and, from historical records, replaced dominance by Acropora and Montipora. From southern Kenya to Mauritius, coral communities were less disturbed, with Acropora and Montipora dominating, and a mix of subdominants including branching Porites, Fungia, Galaxea, massive Porites, Pocillopora, and Synarea. The survey identified an area from southernmost Kenya to Tanzania as having the least disturbed and highest diversity reefs, and as being a regional priority for management. Taxa vulnerable to future extinction based on their response to warm water, population density, and commonness include largely low-diversity genera with narrow environmental ranges, such as Gyrosmilia interrupta, Plesiastrea versipora, PlerogyTa sinuosai and Physogyra lichtensteini.

Utilizing remote sensing and GIS to detect prairie dog colonies	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												The locations of black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus [Ord]) colonies on a 550-km(2) study site in northeastern Wyoming, United States, were estimated using 3 remote sensing methods: raw satellite imagery (Landsat 7 ETM+), enhanced satellite imagery (integration of imagery with thematic layers via a Geographic Information System), and aerial reconnaissance (observations taken from a small plane). A supervised classification of the raw satellite imagery yielded an overall accuracy of 64.4%, relative to ground-truthed locations of prairie dog colonies. The enhanced satellite imagery, resulting from a filtering of the data based on an index derived from the sum of weighted ecological factors associated with prairie dog colonies (slopes, land cover, soil, and "greenness" via the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) yielded ail overall accuracy of 69.2%. The aerial reconnaissance method provided 65.1% accuracy. The highest rate of false positives resulted from the aerial reconnaissance method (39.9%). The highest rate of false negatives resulted from the raw satellite imagery (60.0%), a value that was markedly reduced via the enhancement with ecological data from thematic layers (45.8%). Given the accuracy, interpretability of results, repeatability, objectivity, cost, and safety, the enhanced satellite imagery method is the recommended approach to large-scale detection of black-tailed prairie dog colonies. If a greater accuracy is required, this method can be employed as a coarse filter to narrow the scale and scope of a more costly and laborious fine-scale analysis effectively.

Florida Grasshopper Sparrow distribution, abundance, and habitat availability	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST												Remote sensing, geographical information system applications, and ground and aerial assessments revealed a fragmented distribution of 44,933 ha of potential habitat for the endangered Ammodramus savannarum floridanus (Florida Grasshopper Sparrow) with most of this habitat (30,262 ha, 67%) located oil conservation lands. A continued decrease in available habitat since 1996 was indicated. Searches of potential habitat and information from surveys at known locations found 278 male Florida Grasshopper Sparrows at seven sub-populations during 2004. No previously unknown breeding aggregations were found. The current distribution evinces a considerable contraction in range compared to historic distribution; however, other breeding aggregations may exist on private property (10,7 18 ha) where access was denied. Three formerly large sub-populations on Avon Park Air Force Range have declined and are now near extirpation. The low number of individuals and the paucity and fragmented distribution of suitable dry prairie will be limiting factors for recovery of this sedentary subspecies. Habitat expansion and management, and demographic improvements at existing locations may restore some Florida Grasshopper Sparrow sub-populations. Large areas (> 377 ha) of protected potential habitat in Manatee, DeSoto, and Glades counties offer the best opportunities for the establishment of additional sub-populations (> 50 pairs) to achieve recovery goals. The cooperative effort of public land managers from various agencies and of private landowners will be needed to prevent the extinction of this bird.

One of the difficulties in this process is to set and achieve management objectives, and conservation targets. A sustainable forest management concept requires that a target forest structure (the composition and the configuration) be set before developing alternative management actions for the achievement of management objectives and the conservation targets. In this respect, developing and understanding vegetation succession play important roles in setting the target forest conditions. This study was conducted in the Bulanikdere Forest planning unit (Kirklareli, Turkey) where the biodiversity-integrated multiple-use forest management planning process is conducted as part of the GEF project. The seral stages of secondary forest succession were determined according to Clements's succession theory by using 639 systematically distributed sample plots in the planning unit in 2003. The secondary forest succession was generated and mapped using a geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS), along with aerial photographs. The paired samples t-test was used to determine whether or not there were significant differences between estimated and calculated succession values. The difference was not statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. The results indicated that the forest has developed towards the climax stage. Around 70.1% of the area is in the competition stage, while the areas in the nudation, migration, and ecesis stages account for about 2.8%. Results show that anthropogenic disturbances and harvesting techniques have been the major causes of the succession. Under a selective harvesting regime, the trees left uncut or damaged would become the main components of the subsequent forest succession. The spatial database offers excellent opportunities to understand the vegetation dynamics and to help the forest manager in deciding future forest conditions for maintaining biodiversity.

Geoinformatics-based management of biodiversity from landscape to species scale - An Indian perspective	CURRENT SCIENCE												Trans-scale information on biodiversity is fast becoming the critical for policy decision and action. Remote sensing systems addressing the structure and biophysical processes have the ability to achieve a seamless scalable information scheme. Necessity of down-scaling the coarse scale database to implementation scale is quite high under current circumstances, as practical schemes/ measures to reverse the erosion of biodiversity are needed. The nesting of information required should address the landscape heterogeneity and stakeholder coflicts arising out of socio-economic dimensions. Species level distributions can be predicted based on genetic algorithm-oriented fundamental niche mapping, enabling prioritization of areas for monitoring and conservation. Geoinformatics rendering of diversity on the principles of landscape ecology, integrated with spatialized anthropogenic demand patterns can be a potential interface to resolve conflicts in stake management.																	0011-3891					DEC 10	2006	91	11					1477	1485										WOS:000243169700021

Biodiversity characterization in Nubra Valley, Ladakh with special reference to plant resource conservation and bioprospecting	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Trans-Himalayan mountains, owing to harsh climatic conditions and a short growing season support low vegetation cover (< 20%), yet it is known to harbour a unique assemblage of flora and fauna which have not been systematically inventoried and documented so far. This paper deals with spatial and non-spatial information on landscape units, vegetation characteristics and plant species diversity of Nubra Valley in Ladakh, India. Based on digital - visual (on screen) interpretation of remote sensing data coupled with knowledge-based classification we delineated 19 cover classes (11 vegetation types and 8 non-vegetation categories). The vascular plants (angiosperms and gymnosperms) were systematically collected using stratified random sampling of different landscape/vegetation to characterize plant communities and assess the distribution patterns of species. The study reveals that nearly 78-80% of plant species in Nubra are restricted to the valley bottoms. In all, 414 species of vascular plants were recorded from the study area. These belongs to 56 families and 202 genera. Of these, 102 species were reported to be used in traditional system of medicine by Amchis over 80 species are largely associated with cultivated fields and human habitation. As many as 49 species were cultivated which include several varieties of crop plants especially those of barley and buckwheat. Aspects of bioprospecting and conservation of valuable species have been discussed.																	0960-3115					DEC	2006	15	13					4253	4270		10.1007/s10531-005-3578-y								WOS:000242418500013

We used a data set of approximately 13,500 specimen records compiled from both historical and contemporary collections resulting from recent intensive inventory efforts to enumerate total plant species richness and to analyze the degree of endemism within littoral forests. Change in littoral forest cover from original to current extent was estimated using geographical information systems tools, remote sensing data (satellite imagery and low-elevation digital photography), and environmental data layers. Of the original littoral forest only 10.3% remains in the form of small forest parcels, and only 1.5% of these remaining fragments are included within the existing protected-areas network. Additionally, approximately 13% of Madagascar's total native flora has been recorded from these forests that originally occupied < 1% of its total land surface, and over 25% of the 1535 plant species knownfrom littoral forests are endemic to this community Given the ongoing pressure from human settlement along Madagascar's eastern coast, protection of the remaining forest fragments is critical for their survival. Fifteen of the largest intact littoral forest fragments we identified, collectively representing 41.5% of remaining littoral forest, are among priority sites recommended to the government of Madagascar for plant conservation and incorporation into the protected-areas network.																	0888-8892					DEC	2006	20	6					1799	1803		10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00562.x								WOS:000242724500030	17181815

Spatial distribution of forest fires and controlling factors in Andhra Pradesh, India using spot satellite datasets	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Fires are one of the major causes of forest disturbance and destruction in several dry deciduous forests of southern India. In this study, we use remote sensing data sets in conjunction with topographic, vegetation, climate and socioeconomic factors for determining the potential causes of forest fires in Andhra Pradesh, India. Spatial patterns in fire characteristics were analyzed using SPOT satellite remote sensing datasets. We then used nineteen different metrics in concurrence with fire count datasets in a robust statistical framework to arrive at a predictive model that best explained the variation in fire counts across diverse geographical and climatic gradients. Results suggested that, of all the states in India, fires in Andhra Pradesh constituted nearly 13.53% of total fires. District wise estimates of fire counts for Andhra Pradesh suggested that, Adilabad, Cuddapah, Kurnool, Prakasham and Mehbubnagar had relatively highest number of fires compared to others. Results from statistical analysis suggested that of the nineteen parameters, population density, demand of metabolic energy (DME), compound topographic index, slope, aspect, average temperature of the warmest quarter (ATWQ) along with literacy rate explained 61.1% of total variation in fire datasets. Among these, DME and literacy rate were found to be negative predictors of forest fires. In overall, this study represents the first statewide effort that evaluated the causative factors of fire at district level using biophysical and socioeconomic datasets. Results from this study identify important biophysical and socioeconomic factors for assessing 'forest fire danger' in the study area. Our results also identify potential 'hotspots' of fire risk, where fire protection measures can be taken in advance. Further this study also demonstrate the usefulness of best-subset regression approach integrated with GIS, as an effective method to assess 'where and when' forest fires will most likely occur.

Po'ouli landscape bioinformatics models predict energetics, behavior, diets, and distribution on Maui	INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY					Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Integrative-and-Comparative-Biology	JAN 04-08, 2006	Orlando, FL					This study uses a spatially explicit microclimate/biophysical approach to examine the potential distribution of the Po'ouli on Maui to find either new habitats to search for existence or refine search efforts in previously occupied areas. We used specific physiological and behavioral ecology bird data, and Po'ouli morphological and spectral data obtained from museum specimens to address ecological and conservation-related questions about the Po'ouli that are other-wise very difficult to quantify. Laboratory and field tested microclimate and biophysical-behavioral animal computer models were integrated with remote sensing technologies. To show that the generic microclimate and enclotherm models can predict metabolic and water loss requirements of Hawaiian Honeycreepers, we used the 2 species with known physiological properties, the Hawaiian Amakihi, Hemignathus virens, and the Hawaiian Anianiau, Hemignathus parvus. Predictions were within experimental measurement error of the laboratory measurements. Then using field rather than laboratory conditions as input data, we predict the field distribution of the Amakihi on Maui as the first spatial test of the models applied to birds. Results are consistent with Amakihi field distribution data. Fossils show that the Po'ouli once lived on Maui at low elevations in dry/mesic habitats on a likely diet of native tree snails and insects. The arrival of lethal mosquito-borne avian malaria in Hawaii exterminated low elevation Po'ouli forcing a population shift to mountain rainforests and possibly a snail diet instead of insects. To explore the maximum consequences of such a diet shift we assumed exclusive diets of snails versus insects at both low and high elevations. Snail diets require similar to 4 times higher foraging rates than do insect diets, making a predominantly snail diet an unlikely prospect for the Po'ouli. Landscape scale simulations suggest that a snail diet would force a Po'ouli distribution inconsistent with observations. A predominantly insect diet is consistent with distribution observations. We show that as local environmental conditions change across the landscape in space and diurnal/seasonal time it is possible to quantify animal physiological and behavioral consequences of those variations in their local environment. This enables quantification of the requisite spatial and temporal distribution and amount or availability of resources that may affect species' potential for survival, growth, reproduction and distribution.																	1540-7063	1557-7023				DEC	2006	46	6					1143	1158		10.1093/icb/icl051								WOS:000242442300040	21672814

Remote sensing technology was applied in combination with field investigations to monitor and analyze the changes in these wetlands, and a combination of fusion technologies, Landsat TM/ETM+ and IKONOS imaging, was used to investigate and map them. This study indicates that not only have wetland areas been reduced by half, but also their ecological environments have been degraded because of rapid economic development and population increase. Suggestions based on this research are made to reconstruct the ecological environment of the wetlands and return them to their previous state.																	1006-9321					DEC	2006				2			97	107		10.1007/s11431-006-8097-x								WOS:000244756700012

Remote sensing of crop residue cover and soil tillage intensity	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Management of plant litter or crop residues in agricultural fields is an important consideration for reducing soil erosion and increasing soil organic C. Current methods of quantifying crop residue cover are inadequate for characterizing the spatial variability of residue cover within fields or across large regions. Our objectives were to evaluate several spectral indices for measuring crop residue cover using satellite multispectral and hyperspectral data and to categorize soil tillage intensity in agricultural fields. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and EO-1 Hyperion imaging spectrometer data were acquired over agricultural fields in central Iowa in May and June 2004. Crop residue cover was measured in corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max Merr.) fields using line-point transects. Spectral residue indices using Landsat TM bands were weakly related to crop residue cover. With the Hyperion data, crop residue cover was linearly related to the cellulose absorption index (CAI), which measures the relative intensity of cellulose and lignin absorption features near 2100 nm. Coefficients of determination (r(2)) for crop residue cover as a function of CAI were 0.85 for the May and 0.77 for the June Hyperion data. Three tillage intensity classes, corresponding to intensive (< 15% residue cover), reduced (15-30% cover) and conservation (> 30% cover) tillage, were correctly identified in 66-68% of fields. Classification accuracy increased to 80-82% for two classes, corresponding to conventional (intensive + reduced) and conservation tillage. By combining information on previous season's (2003) crop classification with crop residue cover after planting in 2004, an inventory of soil tillage intensity by previous crop type was generated for the whole Hyperion scene. Regional surveys of soil management practices that affect soil conservation and soil C dynamics are possible using advanced multispectral or hyperspectral imaging systems.

A model based on GRAMI, previously modified to simulate cotton (Gossjpium hirsutum L.) growth, was revised and tested to simulate leaf area development and to estimate lint yield of water-stressed cotton. To verify the model, cotton field data, such as leaf area index (LAI), lint yield, and remotely sensed vegetation indices (VI), were obtained from an experimental field treated with various irrigation levels at the Plant Stress and Water Conservation Laboratory at Lubbock, Texas from 2002 to 2004. The model was validated using field data obtained separately from verification data at the same location in 2005. A hand-held multispectral radiometer with 16 spectral bands was used to measure reflectance. Five VI designs of interest were evaluated and used as input values for within-season calibration of the model. Simulated VI and LAI were in agreement with the measured VI and LAI, with r(2) values from 0.96 to 0.97 and RMSE values from 0.02 to 0.24 in validation. Simulated lint yields were in agreement with measured lint yields, with r(2) values from 0.63 to 0.67 and RMSE values from 28.3 to 100.0. The model was not very sensitive to the higher irrigation treatments in reproducing lint yield. We believe that validation with more data sets can deal with this matter. The VI worked equally well in reproducing measured cotton growth when they were used for within-season calibration. The results of this calibration scheme suggest that remote sensing data could be used to adjust modeled cotton growth for various water-stressed conditions.																	0002-1962					NOV-DEC	2006	98	6					1600	1609		10.2134/agronj2005.0284								WOS:000242036200029

Ullas			Prioritisation of conservation areas in the Western Ghats, India	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Areas of high conservation value were identified in the Western Ghats using a systematic conservation planning approach. Surrogates were chosen and assessed for effectiveness on the basis of spatial congruence using Pearson's correlations and Mantel's tests. The surrogates were, threatened and endemic plant and vertebrate species, unfragmented forest areas, dry forests, sub-regionally rare vegetation types, and a remotely sensed surrogate for unique evergreen ecosystems. At the scale of this analysis, amphibian richness was most highly correlated with overall threatened and endemic species richness, whereas mammals, especially wide-ranging species, were better at capturing overall animal and habitat diversity. There was a significant relationship between a remote sensing based habitat surrogate and endemic tree diversity and composition. None of the taxa or habitats served as a complete surrogate for the others. Sites were prioritised on the basis of their irreplaceability value using all five surrogates. TWO alternative reserve networks are presented, one with minimal representation of surrogates, and the second with 3 occurrences of each species and 25% of each habitat type. These networks cover 8% and 29% of the region respectively. Seventy percent of the completely irreplaceable sites are outside the current protected area network. While the existing protected area network meets the minimal representation target for 88% of the species chosen in this study and all of the habitat surrogates, it is not representative with regard to amphibians, endemic tree species and small mammals. Much of the prioritised unprotected area is under reserve forests and can thus be incorporated into a wider network of conservation areas. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We explain and predict the spatial variation of alpha (i.e. within plot) and beta (i.e. between plot) tree diversity in a tropical montane landscape subjected to a high deforestation rate. A major aim is to demonstrate the potential of a method that combines data from multiple sources (field data, remote sensing imagery and GIS) to evaluate and monitor forest diversity on a broad scale over large unexplored areas. Location The study covered an area of c. 3500 km(2) in the Highlands of Chiapas, southern Mexico. Methods We identified all of the tree species within 204 field plots (1000 m(2) each) and measured different environmental, human disturbance-related, and spatial variables using remote sensing and GIS data. To obtain a predictive model of alpha tree diversity (Fisher's alpha) based on selected explanatory variables, we used a generalized linear model with a gamma error distribution. Mantel tests of matrix correspondence were used to determine whether similarities in floristic composition were correlated with similarities in the explanatory variables. Finally, we used a method that combines alpha and beta tree diversity to define priority areas for conservation. Results The model for alpha tree diversity explained 44% of the overall variability, of which most was mainly related to precipitation, temperature, NDVI, and canopy (all relationships were positive, and quadratic for temperature and NDVI). There were no spatially structured regional factors that were ignored. Similarity in tree composition was correlated positively with climate and NDVI. Main conclusions The results were used to: (1) identify and assign conservation priority of unexplored areas that have high tree diversity, and (2) demonstrate the importance of several vegetation formations in the region's biodiversity. The method we present can be particularly useful in assessing regional needs and in developing local conservation strategies in poorly surveyed (and often at risk) tropical areas worldwide, where accessibility is usually limited.

Evaluating temporal variability in the spectral reflectance response of annual ryegrass to changes in nitrogen applications and leaching fractions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												A two-year study was conducted in 2002 and 2003 at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas's center for urban water conservation to assess canopy spectral response of annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) grown under various combinations of N and irrigation (based on leaching fraction: LF) treatments. Multispectral measurements were acquired using a ground-based spectro-radiometer (200-1100 nm) on a biweekly basis during the growing season (October-May) in 2002 and 2003. Multispectral parameters were correlated with soil-plant parameters and temporal variability was investigated. Results showed that the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), stress index (SI), photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and canopy reflectance at 693 nm, were highly correlated with tissue N concentration (TN), tissue moisture content (TM), TN x TM and canopy colour, as influenced by N and LF treatment combinations. Coefficients of determination ranged from 0.50 to 0.79 (P < 0.001) based on single-day correlations and correlations established over the entire growing period in 2002 and in 2003. TN was mainly predicted from wavelengths in the VIS portion of the spectrum, while TM was predicted from wavelengths in the VIS and NIR. Correlations were inconsistent between spectral parameters and physiological parameters throughout the study confirming the problem of temporal variation associated with spectral signatures of turfgrass species. However, spectral reflectance showed significant potential for monitoring turfgrass N and moisture status, and was able to capture temporal variability over the same growing period and from one year to another. The results provide a sound basis for future validation of ground-based remote sensing for turfgrass management on golf courses.																	0143-1161					OCT 10	2006	27	19					4137	4157		10.1080/01431160600851843								WOS:000241651000006

Predicting the effects of habitat homogenization on marine biodiversity	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Seafloor habitats throughout the world's oceans are being homogenized by physical disturbance. Even though seafloor sediments are commonly considered to be simple and unstructured ecosystems, the negative impacts of habitat homogenization are widespread because resident organisms create much of their habitat's structure. We combine the insight gained from remote sensing of seafloor habitats with recently developed analytical techniques to estimate species richness and assess the potential for change with habitat homogenization. Using habitat-dependent species-area relationships we show that realistic scenarios of habitat homogenization predict biodiversity losses when biogenic habitats in soft sediments are homogenized. We develop a simple model that highlights the degree to which the reductions in the number of species and functional diversity are related to the distribution across habitats of habitat-specific and generalist species. Our results suggest that, by using habitat-dependent species-area relationships, we can better predict variation in biodiversity across seafloor landscapes and contribute to improved management and conservation.

MPAs have been most often designated to protect benthic habitats and their biota. Increasingly, there is a need to account for highly mobile pelagic taxa, such as marine birds, mammals and turtles, and their oceanic habitats. For breeding seabirds foraging from a central place, particular attention should be paid to distant foraging grounds and movement corridors, which can often extend to hundreds of kilometers from breeding colonies. We assessed the habitat use by the most threatened Mediterranean seabird, the Balearic Shearwater, Puffinus mauretanicus, using vessel-based surveys during the chick-rearing period (May June). We used a hierarchical modeling approach to identify those environmental variables that most accurately reflected the oceanographic habitat of this species by (1) delineating its foraging range using presence/absence data and (2) identifying important foraging grounds where it concentrates in dense aggregations. The foraging range comprised the frontal systems along the eastern Iberian continental shelf waters (depth < 200 m) and areas close to the breeding colonies in the Balearic Islands. Shearwater's aggregated in productive shelf areas with elevated chlorophyll a concentrations. Following the model of a core-buffer MPA, we envisioned those areas of dense aggregation (i.e., the area of influence of the Ebro River discharge and Cape La Nao regions) as the core regions deserving elevated protection and more stringent management. More diffuse protective measures would be applied within the larger buffer region, delineated by the foraging range of the species. Marine zoning measures can greatly benefit the conservation of the Balearic Shearwater and other far-ranging seabirds by extending protective measures beyond their breeding colonies during both the breeding and nonbreeding seasons.

However, tourism may also play positive roles in natural resource conservation, which has rarely been verified in practice, although some researchers have demonstrated this in theory. In this article, taking the Jiuzhaigou Biosphere Reserve as a case study area, we conducted an analysis for the environmental impacts from tourism development based on social survey and interpretation of remote sensing images. The results show that the natural environment was not degraded and some indicators are even improving because all the residents have participated in tourism and given up farming and hunting. It is concluded that it is possible to use tourism as a way to balance natural resource conservation and economic development under the preconditions of making effective policies to encourage and help local people participate in tourism business and to benefit from it.

A numerical study of the modulation of short sea waves by longer waves	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												The spatial spectrum of short sea waves is locally modulated by the presence of longer waves or currents; in the remote sensing literature, this process is described by the hydrodynamic modulation transfer function (HMTF). Such modulations are important in understanding radar images of sea waves with water wavelengths longer than the radar range resolution. Existing models for the HMTF utilized in remote sensing are based on approximations derived from consideration of conservation of wave action. However, the accuracy of these approximations has been quantified only through comparison with experimental data; in such comparisons, numerous empirical models for terms such as wind forcing and breaking wave dissipation are required, which make direct evaluation of the hydrodynamic effects difficult. A method for providing direct insight into the hydrodynamic modulation of short sea waves by longer waves is described in this paper, through use of numerical nonlinear hydrodynamic codes for sea surface evolution. The codes applied are reviewed, and a Monte Carlo simulation process based on a stochastic spectrum of short waves propagating over a single deterministic long wave is described, including the data analysis techniques developed to extract a numerical HMTF from the simulated surfaces. HMTF values obtained from the simulations are compared with those from a first-order wave action solution and are found to be in reasonable agreement, although differences on the order of 10% are observed. A numerical evaluation of long wave effects on the short wave dispersion relation is also provided.																	0196-2892					OCT	2006	44	10	2				2880	2889		10.1109/TGRS.2006.877756								WOS:000240881300004

Krishna			Application of geoinformatics for conservation and management of rare and threatened plant species	CURRENT SCIENCE												Currently available floras, which provide valuable information about the species distribution pattern, do not indicate specific locations. The preservation of threatened plants has to be based upon site-specific geographical information, knowledge of their critical habitat and distribution pattern of each threatened species in a phytosociological layout. Precise point-location data on microclimate, topography, and soil in association with geographical distribution of threatened species in the phytosociological layout will lead to the exact locality information of the concerned taxa, their population status, edaphic and climatic characters of their habitat, their niche width, potential localities to be searched, knowledge of their habitat requirements, particularly the factors limiting their distributions, the factors leading to local and biological extinction and critical habitats. In the present study, habitats of Peppara Wildlife Sanctuary were analysed by stratified random sampling techniques and locations of rare and threatened species were gathered by GPS. Satellite remote sensing data with the aid of GIS were used for site-specific mapping of each threatened species, their realized niches and the status of niches with regard to degradation. The study resulted in documenting 151 tree species belonging to 51 families with six rare and eight threatened species. The distribution of each rare and threatened species, their realized niches and status, ecological amplitude among forest types and their geographical positions in the landscape were documented and mapped.

Evaluating techniques for determining tillage regime in the southeastern coastal plain and piedmont	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Reduced tillage and residue management can have significant impacts on soil and water quality, primarily through the accumulation of soil organic C. Yet, methods of tillage and residue cover assessment are time and resource intensive, and often do not yield spatially representative results. A major goal of this study was to compare new remote sensing (RS) indices with the current line-transect approach for differentiating between conventional (CT) and conservation tillage systems. Experimental plots were located in two physiographic regions in Georgia: the Southern Piedmont and Southern Coastal Plain. Treatments consisted of no tillage (NT) or CT at the Piedmont site, and strip-tillage (ST) or CT at the Coastal Plain site. Remotely sensed data were acquired three times prior to canopy closure, using a handheld multispectral radiometer (485-1650 nm) and thermal imager (7000-14000 nm). Soil texture and soil water content were measured to assess the impact of changes in soil background reflectance on crop residue assessments. Results showed that differences in spectral response between CT and conservation tillage systems were best observed using a normalized difference ratio of near infrared (NIR) (1650 +/- 100 nm) and blue (485 +/- 45 nm) spectra under dry conditions and low canopy cover (< 25%). Differences in soil texture and color were the primary limiting factors in differentiating between tillage treatments. However, using readily available soil survey data, our data indicate that visible and NIR spectra can be used to rapidly differentiate between CT and conservation tillage systems in the Georgia Southeastern Coastal Plain and Piedmont physiographic regions.

Development of a technique for Lake habitat survey (LHS) with applications for the European Union Water Framework Directive	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. In the absence of a standard procedure for characterizing the physical habitat of lakes in Europe, this paper describes the development of a multi-purpose Lake Habitat Survey (LHS). The technique has been designed to meet the hydromorphological assessment needs of the Water Framework Directive (WFD), as well as to assist in monitoring the condition of designated sites in the UK and for wider application in environmental impact assessments and restoration programmes. 2. LHS involves detailed recording of shoreline features at a number of plots (Hab-Plots), complemented by a meso-scale survey of the entire lake, including shoreline characteristics and pressures, and modifications to the hydrological regime. A temperature and dissolved oxygen profile is also compiled at the deepest point of the lake (Index Site). Existing databases are exploited where possible, and remote sensing data (e.g. aerial photographs) are used to assist field-based observations. 3. Initial field trials demonstrated that the consistency of the method, whether conducted by boat or on foot, was high. More than 250 surveys were carried out across the UK in 2004 through collaboration with the statutory environment and conservation agencies. 4. Two levels of complexity were tested - a full version requiring 10 Hab-Plots and an abridged version, LHS,ore. involving four plots and omitting the Index Site. While 8-10 plots were required to capture the full diversity of features at complex sites. LHScore data were sufficient to generate metrics for classification purposes. 5. A Lake Habitat Modification Score (LHMS) may be calculated from LHS data. This synthesizes a wide array of hydromorphological and human pressures and has direct applications for assessment of ecological status under the WFD. Preliminary analysis illustrates a spectrum of hydromorphological alteration of 82 lakes in the UK. 6. Further considerations are discussed, including the prospect that the LHS protocol might form the basis of a European standard developed through CEN (Comite Europeen de Normalisation).

Designing a conservation plan for protecting and connecting the fragmented habitat will improve the chances for survival of this endangered species. For such a plan, this study assessed the overall habitat suitability for the species in the Qionglai mountain range (Sichuan, China) using Landsat TM imagery acquired in 2001, geographical data, field surveys, and information acquired in previous researches. Results show that the habitat is separated by roads and rivers, as well as by human settlements and cropland areas, into four main habitat blocks. Overlapping these four habitat blocks with the current nature reserve network reveals that only 36% of the total habitat is protected within nature reserves. Thus, the current nature reserve network is failing to preserve essential habitat for dispersal and genetic exchange. In this study, five key areas and four linkage areas were identified and suggested as nature reserves and/or corridors. These areas, together with the six currently established nature reserves in the mountain range, will form a conservation unit for facilitating the exchange of giant panda individuals among previously isolated habitat blocks. Policies recently implemented by the Chinese government, including the Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) and the Grain-to-Green Program (GTGP), could aid in the formation of such a conservation unit.

J	Naidoo, R; Hill, K				Naidoo, Robin; Hill, Kim			Emergence of indigenous vegetation classifications through integration of traditional ecological knowledge and remote sensing analyses	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) can play an important role in the understanding of ecological systems. Although TEK has complemented scientific and managerial programs in a variety of contexts, its formal incorporation into remote sensing exercises has to date been limited. Here, we show that the vegetation classifications of the Ache, an indigenous hunter-gatherer tribe of the Mbaracayu Forest Reserve in Paraguay, are reflected in a supervised classification of satellite imagery of the reserve. Accuracy of classification was toward the low end of the range of published values, but was reasonable given the difficult nature of separating forest classes from satellite images, Comparison of the resultant map with a more traditionally elaborated vegetation map highlights differences between the two approaches and the gain in information obtained by considering TEK classifications. We suggest that integration of TEK and remote sensing may provide alternative insights into the ecology of vegetation communities and land cover, particularly in remote and densely forested areas where ecological field research is often limited by roads and/or trail systems.																	0364-152X					SEP	2006	38	3					377	387		10.1007/s00267-004-0338-9								WOS:000239657000005	16832592

In this paper, we document the present distribution of the major lakes and the changes in size that have taken place over the past 50 years, using remote sensing data and historical observations of land cover in the region. We also provide an overview of the changes in species richness, community composition, population size and age structure, and individual body size of aquatic plants, fishes, and waterfowl in these lakes. The overall species richness of aquatic plants found in eight major lakes has decreased substantially during the study period. Community composition has also been greatly altered, as have population size and age and individual body size in some species. These changes are largely attributed to the integrated effects of lake degradation, the construction of large hydroelectric dams, the establishment of nature reserves, and lake restoration practices.

Experimental use of remote sensing by private range managers and its influence on management decisions	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Although remote sensing has many potential applications for range management, its use by range managers thus far has been limited. To investigate the factors that encourage use of remote sensing and to examine its influence on decision making by individuals who manage privately owned rangeland, we evaluated the decision-making processes of 3 ranch owners and I professional ranch manager who were introduced to remote sensing while collaborating with us in a rangeland stewardship program in California. Two of the participants had extensive ranching experience (11 to > 20 years) and managed large cattle ranches (1 000 to > 2 000 ha), and 2 had less experience and managed smaller sheep ranches (< 200 ha). During the 5-year program, the participants implemented a series of new management practices, including prescribed burning, rotational grazing, and seeding of native grasses, with the aim of reducing noxious weeds and increasing productivity. We used remote sensing to quantify the effect of these practices and provided ranch-wide remote sensing analyses to each manager on a password -protected Web site. Using case study methodologies, we found that managers of larger, commercially active ranches found the experimental use of remote sensing to be a highly positive experience that convinced them that this technology could help address difficult management situations and increase ranch profitability. This suggests that the broad use of remote sensing by managers of privately held, commercial rangelands may be limited in part by the simple lack of opportunity to test these technologies. Programs that assist ranchers in obtaining appropriate remote sensing products thus may be a cost-effective way to enhance conservation on private rangelands. Our findings suggest that voluntary self-analysis by ranchers of the landscape dynamics of their own properties is likely to lead to more engaged conservation efforts than will topdown prescriptions.																	1550-7424	1551-5028				SEP	2006	59	5					541	548		10.2111/05-184R1.1								WOS:000240928300013

Mapping Posidonia oceanica from IKONOS	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Posidonia oceanica is the dominant seagrass in the Mediterranean Sea that affects biological, biogeochemical and physical processes in Mediterranean coastal areas. The widespread loss of this species is attributed to excessive anthropic pressure and other large-scale environmental changes. Seagrass conservation requires mapping to estimate the extent of existing stocks and to measure changes over time. Optical remote sensing provides a cost-effective method to monitor vast areas of shallow waters that are potential P. oceanica habitat. As part of an interdisciplinary research effort, where the effects of these seagrasses on the hydrodynamics were investigated, new technologies of reliable, fast and effective monitoring of R oceanica were essential. This paper presents a method for using IKONOS multispectral imagery for bottom classification in a shallow coastal area of Mallorca (Balearic Islands). After applying a supervised classification, pixels are automatically classified in four classes: sand, rock, P oceanica bottoms and unclassifiable pixels. Results indicate that, in these clear waters, the spectral response of P. oceanica can be determined to a depth of about 15 m. In order to validate the method, the image classification is compared with a bottom classification derived from an acoustical survey. Agreement with the reference acoustic seabed classification is up to 84% for the sampled area. Spectral IKONOS image analysis is presented as an effective approach for monitoring P. oceanica meadows in most clear, shallow waters of the western Mediterranean.

J	Willson, A				Willson, Andrew			Forest conversion and land use change in rural northwest Yunnan, China - A fine-scale analysis in the context of the 'big picture'	MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT												Contrary to the trend of rapid deforestation continuing across Asia, regional assessments point to recent increases in forest cover in China, including Yunnan Province, since the implementation of dramatic forestry policy changes. There is debate about whether the statistics that describe increasing forest cover adequately account for forest status and quality. In this context, the present article aims to quantify forest cover and land use changes in a Tibetan-dominated rural township in northwest Yunnan, China-an ecologically important region affected by recent forest policy changes. Three sequences of Landsat satellite imagery dating from 1981 to late 1999 and other digital datasets were used in a rules-based hybrid classification approach, achieving acceptable accuracy assessment scores. The results show an average aggregate decline in conifer forests of 23%, mostly due to an active logging industry. Much of this forest has converted to shrubland, which increased in area by over 100%. Grassland also increased, mainly at the expense of cultivation, as a response to increasing dependence on livestock by the rural communities, although high elevation rangelands decreased in area due to changing livelihoods and restrictions by the government on grazing and deliberate burning. Using the accepted definitions of forest and shrubland categories, it was difficult to depict forest and shrubland dynamics due to variation in forest regeneration and afforestation, dieback-affected forests, secondary succession of disused rangelands, and a variety of other mixed community types. Conversion analysis revealed significant forest-shrubland exchanges occurring even during the 1990s when reduction in overall forest cover slowed considerably. The results support the view that the standard categorizations and representations of land cover only portray a partial picture of forest status, as they do not account for multiple conversions that occur between different land covers over time. Due to ongoing forestry programs and increasing utilization of forest resources by local communities, these conversion issues may be significant, with implications for forest quality and biodiversity. Our understanding of China's forest status will be improved by correlating inventory data with finer-scale spatial datasets to enable conversion analysis in representative ecological regions. This will advance our knowledge of China's forest status and the effectiveness of forest policy for both local rural community needs, as well as for broader ecological conservation.																	0276-4741					AUG	2006	26	3					227	236		10.1659/0276-4741(2006)26[227:FCALUC]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000240026400009

Incorporating domain knowledge and spatial relationships into land cover classifications: a rule-based approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												For some tropical regions, remote sensing of land cover yields unacceptable results, particularly as the number of land cover classes increases. This research explores the utility of incorporating domain knowledge and multiple algorithms into land cover classifications via a rule-based algorithm for a series of satellite images. The proposed technique integrates the fundamental, knowledge-based interpretation elements of remote sensing without sacrificing the ease and consistency of automated, algorithm-based processing. Compared with results from a traditional maximum likelihood algorithm, classification accuracy was improved substantially for each of the six land cover classes and all three years in the image series. Use of domain knowledge proved effective in accurately classifying problematic tropical land covers, such as tropical deciduous forest and seasonal wetlands. Results also suggest that ancillary data may be most useful in the classification of historic images, where the greatest improvement was observed relative to results from maximum likelihood. The cost of incorporating contextual knowledge and extensive spatial data sets may be justified, since results from the proposed technique suggest a considerable improvement in accuracy may be achieved.																	0143-1161					JUL 20	2006	27	14					2949	2975		10.1080/01431160600567753								WOS:000239239100009						
J	Romero-Calcerrada, R; Luque, S				Romero-Calcerrada, Raul; Luque, Sandra			Habitat quality assessment using Weights-of-Evidence based GIS modelling: The case of Picoides tridactylus as species indicator of the biodiversity value of the Finnish forest	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Biodiversity issues have gained importance in forestry as a result of the increased awareness of forest landscape changes, but still there is much to do before forest management meets reasonable goals for forest protection and renewal of biodiversity. In this work, we focus on boreal forest landscapes, using Finland as a case study, and taking advantage of a valuable database-the National Forest Inventory (NFI). We explore a multicriteria approach by using a predictive habitat suitability model for three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactyius) based on Weights-of-Evidence (WofE) and a combination of remote sensing and field data derived from the Multisource Finnish National Forest Inventory (MS-NFI). The WofE model is a quantitative method used for combining evidence to examine the support for a given hypothesis. WE involves the estimation of a response variable (favourability for certain habitat occurrence) and a set of predictor variables (e.g. GIS layers containing environmental variables). WE is based on a log-linear form of Bayes' rule and uses the prior probability distribution and the likelihood of the data to generate a posterior probability distribution. Very few examples exist of WbfE being used to predict the spatial distribution of species or communities using biophysical descriptors. This work explores WofE as a tool for rapid biodiversity assessment using georeferenced species information. Since the method is dependent of the indicator species used as a surrogate of biodiversity value it can be applied for assessing biodiversity conditions of both managed and protected areas to help decision-making concerning protection of valuable habitats. Thus, the map of habitat suitability; represented as a range of probabilities of occurrence, offers an objective framework for evaluating the outcomes of different scenarios. Similarly, an objective assessment of habitat suitability provides a rational basis for management decisions incorporating impact on species habitat.

The shortage of reliable data regarding the area currently occupied by MCF remains an obstacle to operational conservation planning in Mexico. This paper assesses how much MCF remains in the central Highlands of Chiapas (Mexico) and how fragmented it is in relation to other forest cover. We estimated that the area covered by MCF was between 3700-5250 ha. This estimate contrasted with the approximately 40,000 ha reported for the same region by the Mexican National Forestry inventory in 2000. MCF was highly scattered and fragmented within a matrix of other tropical montane forest types. Other forest types may be partially buffering the remaining MCF habitats, however, mitigating their disturbance and enhancing their connectivity. We conclude that mechanisms should be sought to promote the protection of core areas containing MCF fragments in agreement with communal and private landowners and to conserve the ecological functions of surrounding buffer zones. Such a conservation strategy would match the natural configuration of these endangered habitats.

Using remote sensing image texture to study habitat use patterns: a case study using the polymorphic white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis)	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Ecological factors that vary along spatial scales can greatly influence the outcome of evolution. However, often it is difficult for researchers to identify significant ecological variables that might be associated with the geographical distribution of phenotypes and genotypes in nature. In this paper, we use remote sensing image texture analyses to investigate breeding territories of the white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis), a polymorphic passerine species that has been shown to segregate spatially according to morph. Our aim was to examine how an integrative measure of landscape feature, such as image texture, could be used to distinguish subtle differences in habitat use and, presumably, habitat selection. Location A population of white-throated sparrows located 1.5 miles east of the Cranberry Lake Biological Station in the Adirondack Mountains of St Lawrence County, New York, was used in this study; the study site itself was approximately 1 km(2). Methods We analysed 27 territories (16 white males; 11 tan males) to determine if image texture can be used to distinguish differences in vegetation and structure in territories of the two colour morphs. First (variance)- and second (homogeneity)order image texture measurements with three different window sizes were derived using the green, red, and near infrared bands of Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data. Texture was then placed into t-tests to determine statistical differences between the territories of the two male morphs. Results Significant differences between the territories of the two morphs were found in both variance and homogeneity texture measures in the red and green ASTER bands in all three window sizes. There were no differences with any near infrared texture measures. Main conclusions Examination of first- and second-order statistical measures indicated that the territories of tan males have significantly more spectral variance than the territories of white males, while white males' territories are significantly more homogeneous. These findings are consistent with the previous finding of the morphs settling in 'high' and 'low' neighbour density habitats that differ with respect to the amount of useable area on their borders. Previous study has also suggested that white and tan male territories differ according to overall landscape structure, not vegetation composition. Therefore, we suggest that red and green spectra may be more useful when examining differences in territory structure and possibly territory quality of similar edge-type species. Our results suggest that image texture is a useful tool for ecological and evolutionary modelling of the distributions of phenotypes/genotypes across landscapes.

J	Fan, H; Huang, HJ; Zeng, T				Fan, Hui; Huang, Haijun; Zeng, Thomas			Impacts of anthropogenic activity on the recent evolution of the Huanghe (Yellow) River delta	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Hydrological statistical data, remote sensing images, and bathymetric charts were used to study the recent evolution of the Huanghe (Yellow) River delta under human-induced interventions. It was clear that water and sediment discharge from the Huanghe River had dropped rapidly since 1970, particularly after 1986. The water and sediment discharges for the period of 1986-2000 were found to have been reduced to only 29.2% and 31.2% of those in the period of 1950-69. This was caused by human factors in the upper and middle reaches of the Huanghe River, including water diversion, damming and reservoir construction, and water and soil conservation. Based on the results from visual interpretation of processed Landsat (MSS or TMJETM+) images dated from 1976 to 2001 and two digital elevation models generated from bathymetric charts surveyed in 1976 and 1992, we found that human-induced reduction of water and sediment discharge led to coastline retrogradation, with the maximum mean recession rate of -0.51 km yr-1 over the period of 1976-98, and seabed erosion beyond the -20 m isobath between 1976 and 1992. Other impacts of human activities on the recent evolution of the Huanghe River delta, including tidal flats shrinking, artificial coastline increasing, land surface sinking and so on, were also analyzed. We found that: (i) the whole delta, including subaerial and subaqueous, has turned from a highly constructive period to a destructive phase; (ii) channelization and dredging were two of the main causes of delta destruction; (iii) land loss in the Huanghe River delta caused by submersion will be increased in the near future; (iv) the Huanghe River delta was becoming more fragile and susceptible to natural hazards.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JUL	2006	22	4					919	929		10.2112/04-0150.1								WOS:000239547000016						
J	Wang, XB; Enema, O; Hoogmed, WB; Perdok, UD; Cai, DX				Wang, XB; Enema, O; Hoogmed, WB; Perdok, UD; Cai, DX			Dust storm erosion and its impact on soil carbon and nitrogen losses in northern China	CATENA												There is increased awareness of the environmental impacts of soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) losses through wind erosion, especially in areas heavily affected by dust storm erosion. This paper reviews the recent literature concerning dust storm-related soil erosion and its impact on soil C and N losses in northern China. The purpose of our study is to provide an overview of the area of erosion-affected soils and to estimate the magnitude of soil C and N losses from farmland affected by dust storm erosion. According to the second national soil erosion remote-sensing survey in 2000, the area affected by wind erosion was 1.91 million km(2), accounting for 20% of the total land area in China. This area is expanding quickly as the incidence of heavy dust storms has greatly increased over the last five decades, mainly as a result of the intensification of soil cultivation. The economic and ecological damage caused by wind erosion is considerable. Heavily affected areas show a loss of nutrients and organic carbon in soils and the heavily degraded soils are much less productive. Compared with the non-degraded soil, the C and N contents in degraded soils have declined by 66% and 73%, respectively. The estimated annual losses per cm toplayer of soil C and N by dust storm erosion in northern China range from 53 to 1044kg ha(-1) and 5 to 90kg ha(-1) respectively. Field studies suggest that soil losses by wind erosion can be reduced by up to 79% when fanners shift from conventional soil tillage methods to no-till. Thus shifting to no-till or reduced tillage systems is an effective practice for protecting soil and soil nutrients. Our study indicates that soil conservation measures along with improved soil fertility management measures should be promoted in dry-land fanning areas of northern China. As erosion is a major mechanism of nutrient withdrawal in these areas, we plead for the development of accurate methods for its assessment and for the incorporation of erosion, as a nutrient output term, in nutrient budget studies.

This research tests the utility of threshold precipitation in predicting inundation of Rosamond lake. Arcview v.3.2, with the ESRI extension 'watershed delineator' and detailed field investigations were used to delineate the watershed and determine elevation-bounded intervals based on soil types and vegetation types and densities. The natural resource conservation service curve number approach was used to estimate the initial abstraction of precipitation, infiltration, runoff, and estimate the threshold depth of precipitation. Climatic data from the western regional climate center and remotely sensed data from the USA Army Corps of Engineers Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory were used to examine the association between winter precipitation events and surface water inundation. Visual-Data, a remote sensing analysis program, was used to analyze the Landsat multispectral images in the infrared (IR) bands and apply remote sensing techniques to determine the areal change of water on Rosamond lake over a defined temporal resolution. Threshold precipitation was then compared to precipitation events that occurred within the temporal resolution of the image subtractions to determine the association between precipitation and the inundation of Rosamond lake. The results of this study demonstrated that with refinement this approach could be used to predict the flow of water to a playa lake to predict the duration of inundation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Remote sensing analysis identified predisaster mangrove change and postdisaster structural damage and landscape changes. Field data from five sites (20 villages), gathered via the VIEWS (TM) data collection system, validated and supplemented this analysis. Key informants at several of these villages were also interviewed. A preliminary comparison of villages that otherwise faced similar tsunami exposure suggests that the presence of healthy mangroves did afford substantial protection. Village performance in mangrove conservation and management efforts, and thus the presence of healthy forests, is influenced by both social capital and the design of external aid delivery programs.																	8755-2930					JUN	2006	22			3			S863	S887		10.1193/1.2201971								WOS:000251517100044						
J	Fernandez, N; Delibes, M; Palomares, F				Fernandez, Nestor; Delibes, Miguel; Palomares, Francisco			Landscape evaluation in conservation: Molecular sampling and habitat modeling for the Iberian lynx	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Conservation of endangered species requires comprehensive understanding of their distribution and habitat requirements, in order to implement better management strategies. Unfortunately, this understanding is often difficult to gather at the short term required by rapidly declining populations of many rare vertebrates. We present a spatial habitat modeling approach that integrates a molecular technique for species detection with landscape information to assess habitat requirements of a critically endangered mammalian carnivore, the Iberian lynx. (Lynx pardinus), in a poorly known population in Spain. We formulated a set of model hypotheses for habitat selection at the spatial scale of home ranges, based on previous information on lynx requirements of space, vegetation, and prey. To obtain the required data for model selection, we designed a sampling protocol based on surveys of feces and their molecular analysis for species identification. After comparing candidate models, we selected a parsimonious one that allowed (1) reliable assessment of lynx habitat requirements at the scale of home ranges, (2) prediction of lynx distribution and potential population size, and (3) identification of landscape management priorities for habitat conservation. This model predicted that the species was more likely to occur in landscapes with a higher percentage of rocky areas and higher cover of bushes typical of mature mediterranean shrubland mosaics. Its accuracy for discriminating lynx presence was similar to 85%, indicating high predictive performance. Mapping model predictions showed that only 16% of the studied areas constitute potential habitat for lynx, even though the region is dominated by large extents of well-preserved native vegetation with low human interference. Habitat was mostly clumped in two nearby patches connected by vegetation adequate for lynx dispersal and had a capacity for 28-62 potential breeding territories. The lynx population in Sierra Morena is probably the largest persisting today, but it is still critically small for optimism about its long-term persistence. Model results suggest habitat conservation and restoration actions needed for preserving the species, including reconciliation of hunting management with preservation of mature shrubland over large areas (particularly in rocky landscapes). The approach presented here can be applied to many other species for which the ecological information needed to develop sound habitat conservation strategies is lacking.

In this manuscript, we reconstruct the process of creation and maintenance of forest reserve boundaries in the West Mengo region of Uganda to identify why these boundaries have largely remained stable over the long term under conditions in which they may be predicted to fail. The dramatic boundary stability in West Mengo we attribute to key aspects of institutional design and enforcement of boundaries.																	1708-3087					JUN	2006	11	1							38									WOS:000239121300019						
J	Hernandez-Stefanoni, JL; Ponce-Hernandez, R				Hernandez-Stefanoni, J. Luis; Ponce-Hernandez, Raul			Mapping the spatial variability of plant diversity in a tropical forest: Comparison of spatial interpolation methods	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Knowledge of the spatial distribution of plant species is essential to conservation and forest managers in order to identify high priority areas such as vulnerable species and habitats, and designate areas for reserves, refuges and other protected areas. A reliable map of the diversity of plant species over the landscape is an invaluable tool for such purposes. In this study, the number of species, the exponent Shannon and the reciprocal Simpson indices, calculated from 141 quadrat sites sampled in a tropical forest were used to compare the performance of several spatial interpolation techniques used to prepare a map of plant diversity, starting from sample ( point) data over the landscape. Means of mapped classes, inverse distance functions, kriging and co-kriging, both, applied over the entire studied landscape and also applied within vegetation classes, were the procedures compared. Significant differences in plant diversity indices between classes demonstrated the usefulness of boundaries between vegetation types, mapped through satellite image classification, in stratifying the variability of plant diversity over the landscape. These mapped classes, improved the accuracy of the interpolation methods when they were used as prior information for stratification of the area. Spatial interpolation by co-kriging performed among the poorest interpolators due to the poor correlation between the plant diversity variables and vegetation indices computed by remote sensing and used as covariables. This indicated that the latter are not suitable covariates of plant diversity indices. Finally, a within- class kriging interpolator yielded the most accurate estimates of plant diversity values. This interpolator not only provided the most accurate estimates by accounting for the indices' intra-class variability, but also provided additional useful interpretations of the structure of spatial variability of diversity values through the interpretation of their semi-variograms. This additional role was found very useful in aiding decisions in conservation planning.

Spatial and temporal scale issues in determining biomass burning regimes in Bolivia and Peru	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING					Annual Conference of the Remote-Sensing-and-Photogrammetry-Society	SEP 10-12, 2003	Nottingham, ENGLAND	Remote Sensing & Photogrammetry Soc				ATSR-2 active fire data from 1996 to 2000, TRMM VIRS fire counts from 1998 to 2000 and burn scars derived from SPOT VEGETATION ( the Global Burnt Area 2000 product) were mapped for Peru and Bolivia to analyse the spatial distribution of burning and its intra- and inter-annual variability. The fire season in the region mainly occurs between May and October; though some variation was found between the six broad habitat types analysed: desert, grassland, savanna, dry forest, moist forest and yungas (the forested valleys on the eastern slope of the Andes). Increased levels of burning were generally recorded in ATSR-2 and TRMM VIRS fire data in response to the 1997/1998 El Nino, but in some areas the El Nino effect was masked by the more marked influences of socio-economic change on land use and land cover. There were differences between the three global datasets: ATSR-2 under-recorded fires in ecosystems with low net primary productivities. This was because fires are set during the day in this region and, when fuel loads are low, burn out before the ATSR-2 overpass in the region which is between 02.45 h and 03.30 h. TRMM VIRS was able to detect these fires because its overpasses cover the entire diurnal range on a monthly basis. The GBA2000 product has significant errors of commission (particularly areas of shadow in the well-dissected eastern Andes) and omission (in the agricultural zone around Santa Cruz, Bolivia and in north-west Peru). Particular attention was paid to biomass burning in high-altitude grasslands, where fire is an important pastoral management technique. Fires and burn scars from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) data for a range of years between 1987 and 2000 were mapped for areas around Parque Nacional Rio Abiseo (Peru) and Parque Nacional Carrasco (Bolivia). Burn scars mapped in the grasslands of these two areas indicate far more burning had taken place than either the fires or the burn scars derived from global datasets. Mean scar sizes are smaller and have a smaller range in size between years the in the study area in Peru (6.6-7.1 ha) than Bolivia (16.9-162.5 ha). Trends in biomass burning in the two highland areas can be explained in terms of the changing socio-economic environments and impacts of conservation. The mismatch between the spatial scale of biomass burning in the high-altitude grasslands and the sensors used to derive global fire products means that an entire component of the fire regime in the region studied is omitted, despite its importance in the farming systems on the Andes.

J	Dong, RC; Dong, JJ; Wu, G; Deng, HB				Dong Rencai; Dong Jiajia; Wu Gang; Deng Hongbing			Optimization of post-classification processing of high-resolution satellite image: A case study	SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES E-TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCES												The application of remote sensing monitoring techniques plays a crucial role in evaluating and governing the vast amount of ecological construction projects in China. However, extracting information of ecological engineering target through high-resolution satellite image is arduous due to the unique topography and complicated spatial pattern on the Loess Plateau of China. As a result, enhancing classification accuracy is a huge challenge to high-resolution image processing techniques. Image processing techniques have a definitive effect on image properties and the selection of different parameters may change the final classification accuracy during post-classification processing. The common method of eliminating noise and smoothing image is majority filtering. However, the filter function may modify the original classified image and the final accuracy. The aim of this study is to develop an efficient and accurate post-processing technique for acquiring information of soil and water conservation engineering, on the Loess Plateau of China, using SPOT image with 2.5 m resolution. We argue that it is vital to optimize satellite image filtering parameters for special areas and purposes, which focus on monitoring ecological construction projects. We want to know how image filtering influences final classified results and which filtering kernel is optimum. The study design used a series of window sizes to filter the original classified image, and then assess the accuracy of each output map and image quality. We measured the relationship between filtering window size and classification accuracy, and optimized the post-processing techniques of SPOT5 satellite images. We conclude that (1) smoothing with the majority Mer is sensitive to the information accuracy of soil and water conservation engineering, and (2) for SPOT5 2.5 m image, the 5x5 pixel majority filter is most suitable kernel for extracting information of ecological construction sites in the Loess Plateau of China.																	1006-9321					JUN	2006	49			1			98	107		10.1007/s11431-006-8111-3								WOS:000240203200011

Remote sensing has considerable potential as a source of data on biodiversity at spatial and temporal scales appropriate for biodiversity management. To-date, most remote sensing studies have focused on only one aspect of biodiversity, species richness, and have generally used conventional image analysis techniques that may not fully exploit the data's information content. Here, we report on a study that aimed to estimate biodiversity more fully from remotely sensed data with the aid of neural networks. TWO neural network models, feedforward networks to estimate basic indices of biodiversity and Kohonen networks to provide. information on species composition, were used. Biodiversity indices of species richness and evenness derived from the remotely sensed data were strongly correlated with those derived from field survey. For example, the predicted tree species richness was significantly correlated with that observed in the field (r = 0.69, significant at the 95% level of confidence). In addition, there was a high degree of correspondence (similar to 83%) between the partitioning of the outputs from Kohonen networks applied to tree species and remotely sensed data sets that indicated the potential to map species composition. Combining the outputs of the two sets of neural network based analyses enabled a map of biodiversity to be produced. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, the use of indigenous knowledge for the identification of habitat types in the field was compared against an ecological characterization of habitat types, including their species composition obtained by using classification and ordination techniques for a tropical landscape mosaic in a rural Mayan area of Quintana Roo, Mexico. Plant diversity data calculated from 141 sampled sites chosen randomly on a vegetation class's thematic map obtained by multispectral satellite image classification were used for this propose. Results indicated high similarity in the categorization of vegetation types between the Mayan classification and those obtained by cluster and detrended correspondence analysis. This suggests that indigenous knowledge has a practical use and can be comparable to that obtained by using science-based methods. Finally, identification and mapping of vegetation classes (habitat types) using satellite image classification allowed us to discriminate significantly different species compositions, in such a way that they can provide a useful mechanism for interpolating diversity values over the entire landscape.

J	Cayuela, L; Benayas, JMR; Echeverria, C				Cayuela, L; Benayas, JMR; Echeverria, C			Clearance and fragmentation of tropical montane forests in the Highlands of Chiapas, Mexico (1975-2000)	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Tropical montane forests have been recognised as having global conservation importance. However, they are being rapidly destroyed in many regions of the world. Our study focuses on the rate of loss and patterns of fragmentation in tropical montane forests in the Highlands of Chiapas, Mexico, during a 25-year period. Data from Landsat satellite imagery from 1975 (MSS), 1990 (TM) and 2000 (ETM+) were used to ascertain annual deforestation rates of 1.3 and 4.8% for the 1975-1990 and 1990-2000 periods, respectively. Spatial patterns of forest fragmentation were identified using selected landscape indices. Increases in the number of forest fragments (3520-10,542), patch density (1.0-3.2 patches/100 ha), and total edge length (24,781-38,400 km) were associated with decreases in the mean patch size (65.0-8.7 ha), largest patch index (60.7-4.0%), total core area (99,422-9,611 ha), and mean proximity index (10 1,369-1405). The observed trends indicate increasing deforestation and fragmentation, particularly during the 1990-2000 period. Circa 50% of the forest cover in the Highlands has been lost in 25 years, and a proportion of the remaining forests have been degraded as a result of human use. Increasing human population and a more demanding use of soils for agriculture and timber arise as the major causes of deforestation in the study area. We suggest that conservation efforts should be focused on the management of the natural system and the management of the external influences on it, particularly the detection of hotspots, passive and active restoration and sustainable forest exploitation by the local indigenous communities.

J	Vrieling, A; Sterk, G; Vigiak, O				Vrieling, A.; Sterk, G.; Vigiak, O.			Spatial evaluation of soil erosion risk in the West Usambara Mountains, Tanzania	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Effective soil and water conservation programmes require the concentration of resources on limited areas. For that purpose regional-scale assessments of erosion risk are required. However, availability of good-quality spatial data for such assessments is often poor, especially in regions like sub-Saharan Africa. This study was conducted to evaluate the potential of analysing regional erosion risk using a limited amount of readily available data. The analysis was executed for the 70-km(2) Baga watershed in the West Usambara Mountains, Tanzania. Principal data sources were a Landsat image and an SRTM DEM. Two qualitative mapping methods resulting in five erosion risk classes were evaluated against field-based erosion risk estimates. The first method derived slope classes from the DEM and fractional vegetation cover (FVC) classes from the Landsat image and FVC field estimates. Data integration was achieved with a decision tree. The second method did not apply field data for the map construction, but combined five equally sized NDVI classes and five slope classes using the minimum-operator. Resulting maps showed a high and comparable accuracy, 80 percent for Method 1, and 81 percent for Method 2, when allowing a maximum difference of one class with field erosion risk estimates. Spatial patterns of erosion risk were well represented by both methods and high erosion risk areas can be properly identified within the Baga watershed. Due to the limited data requirement of Method 2, it has a high potential for quick identification of erosion risk in other areas of the East African Highlands.

J	Brandt, JS; Townsend, PA				Brandt, Jodi S.; Townsend, Philip A.			Land use - land cover conversion, regeneration and degradation in the high elevation Bolivian Andes	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Regional land-cover change affects biodiversity, hydrology, and biogeochemical cycles at local, watershed, and landscape scales. Developing countries are experiencing rapid land cover change, but assessment is often restricted by limited financial resources, accessibility, and historical data. The assessment of regional land cover patterns is often the first step in developing conservation and management plans. This study used remotely sensed land cover and topographic data (Landsat and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission), supervised classification techniques, and spectral mixture analysis to characterize current landscape patterns and quantify land cover change from 1985 to 2003 in the Altiplano (2535-4671 m) and Intermediate Valley (Mountain) (1491-4623 m) physiographic zones in the Southeastern Bolivian Andes. Current land cover was mapped into six classes with an overall accuracy of 88% using traditional classification techniques and limited field data. The land cover change analysis showed that extensive deforestation, desertification, and agricultural expansion at a regional scale occurred in the last 20 years (17.3% of the Mountain Zone and 7.2% of the Altiplano). Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) indicated that communal rangeland degradation has also occurred, with increases in soil and non-photosynthetic vegetation fractions in most cover classes. SMA also identified local areas with intensive management activities that are changing differently from the overall region (e.g., localized areas of increased green vegetation). This indicates that actions of local communities, governments, and environmental managers can moderate the potentially severe future changes implied by the results of this study.

However, the development of this activity induces changes that potentially have negative impacts on the environment, one of which is wetland deterioration. This paper describes the use of a proposed change detection methodology in the assessment of mangrove forest alterations caused by aquaculture development, as well as the effectiveness of the measures taken to mitigate deforestation in the district of Giao Thuy, Vietnam, between 1986, 1992 and 2001. Geometric and radiometric corrections were applied to Landsat images prior to identifying changes through comparison of unsupervised classifications. Changes were afterwards validated using a thresholding method based on Tasselled Cap feature image differencing and a rule-based feature selection matrix. The matrix is used to identify the feature that is most efficient at detecting the presence of change between given land-cover classes. The proposed approach aims to minimize commission errors in the post-classification change detection process. The results suggest that 63% of mangrove areas apparent in 1986 had been replaced by shrimp ponds in 2001. Between 1986 and 1992, 440 ha of adult mangrove trees had disappeared, whereas the mangrove extent increased by 441 ha between 1992 and 2001. This recovery is attributed to reforestation projects and conservation efforts that promoted natural regeneration.

J	Trichon, V; Julien, MP				Trichon, V; Julien, MP			Tree species identification on large-scale aerial photographs in a tropical rain forest, French Guiana - application for management and conservation	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Management and conservation planning of any ecosystem requires knowledge of species composition. This is a real challenge in tropical rain forests that are characterised by very high species richness and canopy access limitations. The possibility of approaching trees from remote sensing on large-scale aerial photographs, takes on its full significance in this context. Results of tree species identification by photo-interpretation in a French Guianan forest canopy are discussed, as well as an overview of the part of the forest accessible from the photographs. Two sets of aerial photographs were used. One set (1:3700 colour slides) covers 15 ha of primary forest, divided into a training set (TS, 5 ha) and a validation set (VS 1: 10 ha). Another validation set, taken in different conditions of acquisition, scale and season, is available for an adjacent area (VS 2: 6.5 ha). Aerial photographs captured a quarter of the tree community (dbh >= 10 cm) on average, and about 45% of the SGS (Species or Group of Species) on the training set. The crown appearance of 12 major canopy SGS, including commercial species and species of ecological interest, had been described in a previous work on the same training set. Following these descriptions, two photo-interpreters separately identified 309 tree crowns overall on VS 1, with a good agreement in their respective judgements. After their interpretations were checked in the field, the overall average identification success was high (87%) but the results varied according to the SGS. The results on VS 2 showed that some species displayed major seasonal and scale variations and were hardly recognized, whereas some others could be identified without modifying the learning process. The results are encouraging and this work will be extended as the identification of tropical rain forest trees from remote sensing has many applications, ranging from fundamental ecological knowledge of canopy species to the management and conservation of such highly diverse and hardly inventoried ecosystems.

J	Behera, S; Panda, RK				Behera, S; Panda, RK			Evaluation of management alternatives for an agricultural watershed in a sub-humid subtropical region using a physical process based model	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Assessments of potential environmental impacts of non-point source (NPS) pollutants at local and regional scales are necessary as a basis for effective management strategies to protect precious resources such as land and water. Intensive watershed scale study is therefore necessary to develop management strategies for abating the agricultural NPS pollution. The major goal of the present study was to identify the critical areas of an agricultural watershed and recommend the best management practices using a physical process based watershed scale model, soil water assessment tool (SWAT). A 973-ha agricultural watershed located in Midnapore district of West Bengal state in eastern India was monitored to quantify the hydrologic parameters such as runoff, sediment yield and the quality of surface water. The model was calibrated and validated using observed hydrologic and water quality data of the watershed monitored during the rainy seasons of 2002 and 2003, respectively. Besides these data, micro-meteorological data, topographical map, soil map, land resources data and remote sensing data (satellite imagery) of the watershed were used as input to the model. The study revealed that SWAT model simulates daily runoff, sediment yield and nutrient concentration in runoff satisfactorily throughout the entire rainy season, as evident from standard statistical tests. The calibrated model was then successfully used for identifying the critical sub-watersheds and for development of best management practices. Several simulations were performed to determine the best out of the 48 different combinations of treatments for the management of the critical sub-watersheds. The study revealed that no other crop could replace the rice (Oryza sativa) crop during the rainy season and the existing conventional tillage practice needs to be replaced by conservation tillage in order to minimize the sediment yield and nutrient losses. Fertilizer application rate of 80:60 kg ha(-1) of N:P is also recommended to minimize the surface water pollution in the watershed due to NO3-N and P. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Exploring human-environment tradeoffs in protected area conservation	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Protected areas, or parks, remain a major focus for biodiversity conservation globally. The goal of this special issue is to bring together a broad-based set of papers that examine the human dimensions of forest conservation in protected areas across the world. Park landscapes are often characterized by biological and socio-political dilemmas due to conflicts between biodiversity goals and local livelihood strategies. To best inform policy. research should seek to document the livelihoods of people in the landscapes around parks and investigate the impacts that parks and biodiversity outside the parks have on their livelihoods and activities in turn. Given the current debate on the effectiveness of protected area management, there is an urgent need for careful, quantitative evaluations that analyze the impact of exclusionary policies of protected area management on forest cover over time. Each of the four papers in this issue deals with a distinct case study. using different methods and questions. This research illustrates the utility of remote sensing. spatial statistics. fragmentation analyses and modeling for the study of parks. and for evaluation of the potential effectiveness of different management strategies in protected areas. These studies also underline the need for satellite image analysis to be supplemented by detailed field research to provide insights into the social and institutional processes that impact land cover change and forest conservation.

J	Nagendra, H; Pareeth, S; Ghate, R				Nagendra, Harini; Pareeth, Sajid; Ghate, Rucha			People within parks- forest villages, land-cover change and landscape fragmentation in the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve, India	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												There has been extensive debate on the conservation impact of people located within protected areas. In a tiger reserve in central India, we find that the densely populated villages located outside the park boundary are better connected to regional markets by road networks, and are associated with greater deforestation rates and more forest fragmentation compared to the more isolated villages in the park interior. The park itself however appears well protected in terms of forest cover and connectivity. Instead of focusing on resettlement of forest villages, forest protection needs may be better served by working with these surrounding communities to develop alternate mechanisms for income generation.

J	Armenteras, D; Rudas, G; Rodriguez, N; Sua, S; Romero, M				Armenteras, D; Rudas, G; Rodriguez, N; Sua, S; Romero, M			Patterns and causes of deforestation in the Colombian Amazon	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Ecosystem information on the Colombian Amazonia is poor in comparison with that on the Brazilian Amazon. We examined patterns of ecosystem diversity, deforestation and fragmentation and provided an estimate on their possible causes through a temporal and spatial analysis of biotic and abiotic data using remote sensing and geographical information systems in six pilot areas covering a total of 4,200,000 ha. Ecological, demographic and socio-economic data were analysed to establish the local conditions. We used a landscape ecology approach to calculate indicators of ecosystem diversity, cover and forest fragmentation such as number of patches, mean patch size, mean shape index and mean nearest neighbour distance. Patterns of deforestation did not run parallel to access roads; instead the typical pattern of unplanned colonization follows the only transportation network existing in many areas in the Colombian Amazonia: rivers. In addition, we have used indicators of human influence such as demographic pressure, quality of life and economic activity indicators. Results show that the extent and rate of change varies between areas depending on population density. Annual deforestation rates were 3.73 and 0.97% in the high population density growth areas of Alto Putumayo and Macarena respectively, and 0.31, 0.23, and 0.01% in the relatively unpopulated areas of indigenous population. These changes are related to land use history as well as to environmental and historical socio-economic factors such as oil extraction, deforestation, cattle ranching or illegal cropping. The current situation in the region suggests that tropical deforestation rates in the Colombian Amazon are substantially higher than those found in previous studies in the rest of the Amazon.

J	Rasmussen, HB; Wittemyer, G; Douglas-Hamilton, I				Rasmussen, HB; Wittemyer, G; Douglas-Hamilton, I			Predicting time-specific changes in demographic processes using remote-sensing data	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Models of wildlife population dynamics are crucial for sustainable utilization and management strategies. Fluctuating ecological conditions are often key factors influencing both carrying capacity, mortality and reproductive rates in ungulates. To be reliable, demographic models should preferably rely on easily obtainable variables that are directly linked to the ecological processes regulating a population. 2. We compared the explanatory power of rainfall, a commonly used proxy for variability in ecological conditions, with normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), a remote-sensing index value that is a more direct measure of vegetation productivity, to predict time-specific conception rates of an elephant population in northern Kenya. Season-specific conception rates were correlated with both quality measures. However, generalized linear logistic models compared using Akaike's information criteria showed that a model based on the NDVI measure outperformed models based on rainfall measures. 3. A predictive model based on coarse demographic data and the maximum seasonal NDVI value was able to trace the large variation in observed season-specific conception rates (Range 0-0.4), with a low median deviation from observed values of 0.07. 4. By combining the model of season-specific conception rates with the average seasonal distribution of conception dates, the monthly number of conceptions (range 0-22) could be predicted within +/- 3 with 80% confidence. 5. Synthesis and applications. The strong predictive power of the normalized differential vegetation index on time-specific variation in a demographic variable is likely to be generally applicable to resource-limited ungulate species occurring in ecologically variable ecosystems, and could potentially be a powerful factor in demographic population modelling.																	0021-8901					APR	2006	43	2					366	376		10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01139.x								WOS:000236396100017						
J	Stuart, N; Barratt, T; Place, C				Stuart, N; Barratt, T; Place, C			Classifying the Neotropical savannas of Belize using remote sensing and ground survey	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim: This paper evaluates a method of combining data from GPS ground survey with classifications of medium spatial resolution LANDSAT imagery to distinguish variations within Neotropical savannas and to characterize the boundaries between savanna areas and the associated gallery forests, seasonally dry forests and wetland communities. Location: Rio Bravo Conservation Area, Orange Walk District, Belize, Central America. Methods: Dry season LANDSAT data for 10 April 1993 and 9 March 2001 covering a conservation area of 240,000 acres (97,459 ha), were rectified to sub-pixel accuracy using ground control points positioned by GPS ground survey. The 1993 image was used to assess the accuracy with which the boundaries between the savanna matrix and gallery forests, high forests, wetlands and water bodies could be discriminated. The image was classified by a maximum likelihood (ML) classifier and the shapes and areas of forest and wetland classes were compared with an interpretation of these land cover types from 1 : 24,000 aerial photography, mapped at 1 : 50,000 scale in 1993. The 2001 image was used to assess whether different subtypes of savanna could be distinguished from LANDSAT data. This required the creation of a reference ('ground truth') data set for testing classifications of the image. One hundred and sixty sample patches (650 ha, distributed over an area of 7000 ha) of ten sub-types of savanna vegetation and associates identified using a physiognomic classification scheme, were delineated on the ground by GPS and divided into two subsets for training and testing. Continuous classifications of LANDSAT data covering the savannas were developed that estimated potential contributions from up to five sub-types of land cover (grassland, wetland, pine woodland, gallery forest and palmetto). The accuracy of each classification was assessed by comparison against ground data. An ML classification was also produced for the 2001 image using the same areas for training. This allowed a comparison of the relative accuracy of both continuous and Boolean ML methods for classifying savanna areas. Results: The boundary between savannas and evergreen forests, gallery forests and open water in the study region could be delineated by the ML classifier to within 2 pixels (60 m) using LANDSAT imagery. However, the constituent sub-types within the savanna were poorly discriminated. Whilst the shape and extent of closed canopy forest, gallery forest, wetlands and water bodies agreed closely with the distributions interpreted from aerial photography, classes such as 'open pine savanna' or 'grassland' were only 45-65% accurate when tested against ground data. A continuous classification, estimating the proportions of three savanna vegetation subtypes (grassland, marshland and woodland) present in each pixel, correctly classified more of the ground data for these cover types than the comparable ML result. Proportional mixtures of the land cover estimated by the continuous classifier also compared realistically with the vegetation formations observed along ground transects. Main conclusions: By using GPS, a ground survey of vegetation cover was accurately matched to remotely sensed imagery and the accuracy of delineating boundaries and classifying areas of savanna was assessed directly. This showed that ML classification techniques can reliably delineate the boundaries of savannas, but continuous classifiers more accurately and realistically represent the distribution of the subtypes comprising savanna land cover. By combining these ground survey and image classification methods, medium spatial resolution satellite sensor data can provide an affordable means for land managers to assess the nature, extent and distribution of savanna formations. Over time, using the archives of LANDSAT (and SPOT) data together with marker sites surveyed in the field, quantitative changes in the extents and boundaries of savannas in response to both natural (e.g. fire, hurricane and drought) and anthropogenic (e.g. cutting and disturbance) factors can be assessed.																	0305-0270					MAR	2006	33	3					476	490		10.1111/j.1365-2699.2005.01436.x								WOS:000235256700009

J	Chowdhury, RR				Chowdhury, RR			Driving forces of tropical deforestation: The role of remote sensing and spatial models	SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY												Remote sensing technologies are increasingly used to monitor landscape change in many parts of the world. While the availability of extensive and timely imagery from various satellite sensors can aid in identifying the rates and patterns of deforestation, modelling techniques can evaluate the socioeconomic and biophysical forces driving deforestation processes. This paper briefly reviews some emerging spatial methodologies aimed at identifying driving forces of land use change and applies one such methodology to understand deforestation in Mexico. Satellite image classification, change analysis and econometric modelling are used to identify the rates, hotspots and drivers of deforestation in a case study of the southern Yucatan peninsular region, an enumerated global hotspot of biodiversity and tropical deforestation. In particular, the relative roles of biophysical and socioeconomic factors in driving regional deforestation rates are evaluated. Such methodological approaches can be applied to other regions of the forested tropics and contribute insights to conservation planning and policy.

J	Dalle, SP; de Blois, S; Caballero, J; Johns, T				Dalle, SP; de Blois, S; Caballero, J; Johns, T			Integrating analyses of local land-use regulations, cultural perceptions and land-use/land cover data for assessing the success of community-based conservation	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Studies of land-use/land cover change are an important means for examining the viability of community-based programs for forest conservation, although an analysis of the social processes influencing land-use decisions is necessary to understand the factors leading to different conservation outcomes. In this paper, we demonstrate that an analysis of locally recognized land-use rules and regulations embedded in local institutions can inform remote-sensing approaches by helping: (1) to elucidate some of the local perceptions, criteria and interactions with outside agencies that drive conservation actions and (2) to better interpret the spatial patterns of land-use change and forest conservation revealed by remote-sensing data. Based on a case study of a forest ejido from the Maya Zone of Quintana Roo, Mexico, we evaluate changes in forest cover and in local land-use regulations before and after the initiation in the mid-1980s of a community forestry program, the Plan Piloto Forestal (PPF). Methods included development of a time series of land cover maps based on LANDSAT imagery from 1976, 1988, 1991, 1997 and 2000, as well as interviews and participant observation with local farmers and community leaders. Results indicate a high degree of forest conservation on community lands with net rates of forest loss of 0.6-0.7%/year. Locally recognized conservation regulations included a number of forest reserves as well as regulations which protect specific forest types, resulting from both local initiatives and interventions of external agencies. These initiatives included but were not limited to the PPF, highlighting the importance of evaluating community-based conservation programs within a broader historical context. Conservation regulations protecting an important commercial non-timber forest product (Manilkara zapota) pre-dated the PPF and may have facilitated its implementation. In the most accessible agricultural areas, the only mature forest patches were customary forest reserves and an area regenerated from secondary forests, protected due to enrichment plantings of commercial timbers. Recognition of local Maya terminology used to distinguish forest types was crucial for proper interpretation of local land-use regulations, which revealed that less-valued forest types may not be adequately protected on community lands. We suggest that future research should examine the significance of the less-valued forest types for global biodiversity conservation. In addition careful consideration of the historical antecedents and community institutions which may have facilitated the implementation of the Plan Piloto Forestal will be important for the successful application of this model of community forestry to other socio-economic and cultural contexts.

J	Zhao, CY; Nan, ZR; Cheng, GD; Zhang, JH; Feng, ZD				Zhao, CY; Nan, ZR; Cheng, GD; Zhang, JH; Feng, ZD			GIS-assisted modelling of the spatial distribution of Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia) in the Qilian Mountains, northwestern China based on biophysical parameters	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												There has been an increasing use of predictive spatial distribution of main communities or dominant species at the landscape scale for ecological restoration planning, biodiversity conservation planning and regional management decisions in the Qilian Mountains, northwest China. Understanding the spatial distribution of dominant species at the regional scale is also essential for assessing the impacts of environmental change or human effects on vegetation distribution. Based on the spatial distribution of resource variables that correlate with or control plant distribution, this study focused on the prediction of Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia) distribution at the regional scale, i.e., where the extent of the prediction was within the biogeographic range of Qinghai spruce in the upper reach of Heihe River. The development of the predictive model in the study required the integration of geographical information system (GIS) with remote sensing (RS), spatial analytic and statistical tools. First, we selected the main resource variables such as mean July temperature, water and solar radiation. These variables were spatialized as functions of elevation and horizontal coordinates or as functions of aspect and slope via a GIS. Second, the niche spaces of Qinghai spruce were determined by incorporating the spatially-distributed resource variables with the current distribution of the species, which came from remote sensing data (Landsat TM image). The niche spaces defined then were extrapolated over the study area. Third, the distribution pattern was validated by field investigations. The study showed that the scope of mean July temperature ranged from 8.5 degrees C to 13.5 degrees C, average annual precipitation from 370 mm to 660 mm, the soil moisture index from 2.3 m(3) m(-1) year(-1) to 4.5 m(3) m(-1) year(-1) and the shortwave radiation for an average July day from 3.8 mm m(-2) day(-1) to 7.8 mm m(-2) day(-1). The elevation range belonging to Qinghai spruce in Qilian Mountains was also determined according to the mean July temperature space occupied by the forest. The elevation occupied by Qinghai spruce was about from 2600 m to 3400 m. We found that the density of the species has higher value from 2650 m to 3100 m based on the field investigation, and from 3 100 m the density decreased with elevation increase. The basal area of Qinghai spruce had the same change as the density. That is, the suitable niche of the species ranged from 2650 m to 3 100 m. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Poulin, M; Beslisle, M; Cabeza, M				Poulin, M; Beslisle, M; Cabeza, M			Within-site habitat configuration in reserve design: A case study with a peatland bird	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												This study assesses the effects of considering within-site habitat configuration when designing reserve networks. This attribute takes all its importance in situations where the long-term integrity of (within-site) habitat patches cannot be preserved without protecting their surrounding environment. We addressed this issue through the concrete problem of selecting a reserve network of natural peatlands in southern Quebec, Canada. We used a reserve-selection algorithm that minimized the total number of peatlands to include within networks. The algorithm was constrained to include peatlands containing habitat patches that met specific size thresholds. Five habitat-clustering thresholds were used to set the eligibility of each site to the selection process. The resulting reserve networks were evaluated according to their representation efficiency and to the expected consequences for the Palm Warbler (Dendroica palmarum), an area and isolation-sensitive bird restricted to peatlands in southern Quebec. Constraining the algorithm to include peatlands showing increasingly larger patches of habitats led to larger networks, both in terms of area and number of sites, and to networks composed of smaller sites. These effects increased with the representation target (i.e., the % of each habitat preserved). With respect to the Palm Warbler, selecting peatlands with larger patches of habitats had only an indirect effect on its site-occupancy pattern. Indeed, despite the fact that the probability of occurrence of the warbler was negatively correlated with the size of habitat patches, the habitat-clustering threshold influenced the incidence of the warbler mainly via its effect on the physical attributes of the selected networks including the area, isolation level, and the number of selected sites. Because increasing the habitat-clustering threshold led indirectly to a greater regional availability of prime breeding habitats for the Palm Warbler, it mitigated the severe negative impact of an hypothetical alteration or destruction of non-selected peatlands. Our study thus emphasizes the importance of determining how the different factors describing within-site configuration are correlated with other intrinsic characteristics of the sites available to the selection process before opting for a site-selection strategy.

J	Nams, VO; Mowat, G; Panian, MA				Nams, VO; Mowat, G; Panian, MA			Determining the spatial scale for conservation purposes - an example with grizzly bears	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												This study suggests procedures for determining the spatial scale for conservation guidelines for animals, giving an illustration with an analysis of grizzly bear habitat selection. Bear densities were sampled by identifying hairs at bait stations in British Columbia. Habitat variables were measured using remote sensing. Spatial scale was changed by varying the window size over which the variables were averaged. First, the spatial pattern of bears was studied, measuring the patchiness in bear densities at a variety of spatial scales, by calculating the correlation in bear densities between adjacent windows. This was repeated for the habitat variables. Finally, the overall interaction between bears and habitats was analysed, measuring the strength of habitat selection at different spatial scales. There are three domains of scale: at 2-4 km, bears and habitats are patchy, at 5-10 km, bears select for habitats, and at 40+ km, habitats are patchy and bears select for habitats. At scales of 40+ km, bears selected for: (i) higher slopes, or (ii) higher slopes, and some combination of more avalanche chutes, fewer roads and trees, higher elevations, and less logged land. Within 15 km areas, bears selected for 6 km areas that are either at higher elevations, or at higher elevations and had fewer trees. The relationship of conservation guidelines at different spatial scales should be determined by measuring and comparing hierarchical to non-hierarchical selection. The scales that bears select for habitats roughly correspond to the scales used in present grizzly bear conservation plans in British Columbia. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Dramatic changes in the Black Sea's ecosystem and resources are due to natural and anthropogenic causes (increase in the nutrient and pollutant load of rivers input, industrial and municipal wastewater pollution along the coast, and dumping on the open sea). A scientific management system for protection, conservation and restoration must be based on reliable information on bio-geophysical and geomorphologic processes, coastal erosion, sedimentation dynamics, mapping of macrophyte fields, water quality, climatic change effects. Synergetic use of quasi-simultaneously acquired multi-sensor data may therefore allow for a better approach of change detection of coastal area. This paper is an application of multi-temporal and multi-spectral satellite remotely sensed data (Landsat MSS, TM, ETM, SAR ERS, ASTER, MODIS) over a period of time between 1975 and 2003 for North-Western Black Sea coastal zone change detection assessment. Spectral mixture analysis, supervised and unsupervised classification are used to study chosen test areas. The results can be utilized as a temporal land-use change model for a region to quantify the extent and nature of change, and aid in future prediction studies, which helps in planning environmental agencies to develop sustainable land-use practices.																	1454-4164					FEB	2006	8	1					252	256										WOS:000236107300056

Location: The Panama Canal watershed. Methods: To assess which factors (climate, topography, geology and geographical distance) account for floristic composition, we performed Mantel tests on distance matrices and partitioned variation in species composition using canonical analysis. We used a permutation-based regression model computed on distance matrices and a hierarchical clustering of the tree composition to construct a predictive map of forest types of the Panama Canal Watershed. Results: We found that spatial variation alone explained 22-27% of species variation, while the fraction of species variation explained by environmental variables was smaller (10-12%); 13-19% of the variation was accounted for by the joint effect of environmental variation and geographic distance. The similarity-based map emphasizes the principal division in tree flora between the drier Pacific side and the wetter Caribbean slopes. Conclusions: The distribution of Panamanian tree species appears to be primarily determined by dispersal limitation, then by environmental heterogeneity. 'Environmental segregation' processes do play an important role. Maps of broad-scale vegetation patterns based on thorough tree inventories can be used in conservation planning in the tropics.

Lemes			Mapping and characterization of vegetation units by means of Landsat imagery and management recommendations for the Pantanal of Mato Grosso (Brazil), north of Pocone	AMAZONIANA-LIMNOLOGIA ET OECOLOGIA REGIONALIS SYSTEMAE FLUMINIS AMAZONAS												In the present study, remote sensing in the northern region of Pocone-MT was used to identify vegetation categories, which were then mapped and characterized. The goal in generating the map was to provide information needed to support sustainable use and to formulate conservation policies. Vegetation units were identified and classified using digital images that were taken in 1990 by the Landsat Thematic Mapper (c) Satellite and then processed using ERDAS software. First, the vegetation classes were systematically defined. In a preliminary interpretation of the image data. Landsat-TM bands that allowed the best visual differentiation of these classes were selected and the image was georeferenced. Routes for trips to the study area to collect ground truth data (training samples) for further supervised classification were then determined. These data were subsequently classified according to The System of Classification of Brazilian Vegetation (VELLOSO et al. 1991), which has been used in other physiognomic maps of the Pantanal, in order to make our results comparable to those from other mappings. In addition, some modifications of this system were made due to the particular characteristics of the Pantanal and the scale used for this map. Six classes and 16 subclasses were defined for part I of the vegetation map of Pantanal, Mato Grosso, Brazil, specifically, the area north of Pocone. A distinction was made between the vegetation units of the Paraguayan Depression and those of the Pantanal due to the different characteristics of the vegetation from these two regions, and particularly the role played by inundation. The phytoecological region savanna (cerrado) covers a large part of the total area (53.05 %) and consists of five sub-classes. Two forest classes were identified: seasonal semideciduous forest and seasonal deciduous forest. These two phytoecological classes occupied 16.21 % of the total mapped area: 14.45 % of the area has been strongly modified by humans (agriculture. pasture, gold mine, and construction); 0.80 % is covered during the dry season by perennial water bodies. Based upon ground truth data and regional field experience, ten eco-zones are proposed and suggestions for sustainable management and conservation measures are discussed.

Oceanographic characteristics of biological hot spots in the North Pacific: A remote sensing perspective	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY					13th Annual Meeting of the North-Pacific-Marine-Science-Organization (PICES)	OCT 14-24, 2004	Honolulu, HI	N Pacific Marine Sci Org				Biological hot spots in the ocean are likely created by physical processes and have distinct oceanographic signatures. Marine predators, including large pelagic fish, marine mammals, seabirds, and fishing vessels, recognize that prey organisms congregate at ocean fronts, eddies, and other physical features. Here we use remote sensing observations from multiple satellite platforms to characterize physical oceanographic processes in four regions of the North Pacific Ocean that are recognized as biological hot spots. We use data from the central North Pacific, the northeastern tropical Pacific, the California Current System, and the Galapagos Islands to identify and quantify dynamic features in terms of spatial scale, degree of persistence or recurrence, forcing mechanism, and biological impact. The dominant timescales of these processes vary from interannual (Rossby wave interactions in the central North Pacific) to annual (spring-summer intensification of alongshore winds in the California Current System; winter wind outflow events through mountain gaps into the northeastern tropical Pacific), to intraseasonal (high-frequency equatorial waves at the Galapagos). Satellite oceanographic monitoring, combined with data from large-scale electronic tagging experiments, can be used to conduct a census of biological hot spots, to understand behavioral changes and species interactions within hot spots, and to differentiate the preferred pelagic habitats of different species. The identification and monitoring of biological hot spots could constitute an effective approach to marine conservation and resource management. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Primary producer and seabird associations with AVHRR-derived sea surface temperatures and gradients in the southeastern Gulf of Alaska	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY					13th Annual Meeting of the North-Pacific-Marine-Science-Organization (PICES)	OCT 14-24, 2004	Honolulu, HI	N Pacific Marine Sci Org				Identification and characterization of critical habitat is an important component of marine conservation. In this study, we compare relative sea-surface temperature (SST) and gradients in SST as derived from advanced very high-resolution radiometry (AVHRR) with primary producer biomass, indexed by remotely sensed Chlorophyll a concentrations (from the sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor [SeaWiFS]), and seabird observations collected during replicate surveys along Line P in the southeastern Gulf of Alaska. Because of cloudiness, we used monthly composites for both Sea-WiFS and AVHRR. Sea bird data were collected three times per year ('seasons') starting in 1996, and summarized in 4 x 4 km grids. We divided our analyses into two regions based on oceanography; the outer 'oceanic' region and the 'coastal' region. We calculated SST anomalies as residuals from mean SST calculated per region, season, and year. We calculated maximum SST gradients between AVHRR data pixels (both 4 x 4 km and 9 x 9 km resolution) and defined areas of 'steep' SST gradients. Within each region we found that primary producer biomass varied with SST gradients, but not as expected (i.e. we expected sharp increases in chlorophyll a with steeper SST gradients). There was, however, strong evidence of seabird associations with SST and SST gradients, especially in the coastal region where almost all species were associated with fronts. In the oceanic region, 62% of the species were associated with steep SST gradients. This study demonstrates the importance of mesoscale oceanographic structures on seabird distributions in the southeastern Gulf of Alaska, and illuminates how these relationships can be characterized using remote-sensing of habitats at large spatial scales.

Comparative study of fertilization effect on weed biodiversity of long term experiments with near field remote sensing methods	JOURNAL OF PLANT DISEASES AND PROTECTION					23rd German Conference on Weed Biology and Weed Control	MAR 07-09, 2006	Stuttgart, GERMANY					Since the decision of The Earth Summit in Rio (UN 1992), conservation of biodiversity is a critical environmental protection issue. However the sector specific arable land agro biodiversity was only defined a few years ago in OECD countries. The one-sided usage of herbicide led to the selection of several weed species, and some species need protection. In this study, we analyzed the rate of weed coverage and population in a 22 year long term field experiment. A coenological survey has been performed simultaneously to a maize field production test with the application of increasing doses of NPK and NPK-FYM. Parallel with the conventional mapping, we also used a wide broad handy camera, taking images in NIR-R-G spectra, for mapping. The results of the image analysis significantly improved the reliability of field surveying in case of high weed cover (> 25 %) compared to traditional surveying methods. Regarding NPK and NPK-FYM treatments: the results of the statistical analysis (Student's t test) showed that the values of NDVI, weed cover (%) and the visual coenological survey (%) were significantly higher (SD = 5 %) for NPK-FYM treatments. We expressed the changes of the weed species constitution with the Shannon-index, well known in ecology. We evaluated the development of species number according to the different relations of nutrient supply. The application of increasing fertilizer doses reduced the number of occurring species in both treatments compared to control treatments. The information gained is suitable for the indication of biodiversity of other production sites, and can be a basis for optimising the cropping technology interferences.																	1861-3829	1861-3837					2006					20		801	807										WOS:000243263500100

While recent work articulating the 'misreading' of the African landscape have begun to challenge this paradigm, much work remains regarding the pervasiveness and character of this misread. A method is presented for investigating mechanisms of land-cover change that combines remotely sensed data, archival data, and rapid appraisals in a way less influenced by dominant paradigms. We present a case where increasing human activity is resulting in accumulation of woody biomass on edaphic grasslands of a forest-grassland mosaic, rather than the expansion of grasslands at the expense of forests as is currently understood in that area. These increases in biomass are stimulated by anthropogenic influences that are shaped by institutional and edaphic factors. We do not claim that resources are being pervasively enhanced across sub-Saharan Africa under conditions of population growth, but that there may be many mechanisms of change, resulting in both degradation and enhancement, occurring simultaneously across sub-Saharan Africa or even intra-regionally within a nation under these conditions. The integration and application of these methods serve to improve applied analyses of land-cover change to better characterize these mechanisms, and avoid the wrong policy prescriptions.

Understanding hydrology and ecology of the lake and its tributaries is particularly important for the conservation of the Park's floodplain habitats and its biodiversity. There are concerns that hydrological boundary conditions and ecology of Lake Urema have changed in recent years. Possible causes for this change include climatic and land use changes as well as tectonic and geomorphological processes. In this study, a multi-temporal and multi-disciplinary approach was applied to investigate the dynamics and control mechanisms of Lake Urema. Principal methods comprised remote sensing analyses of time series of Landsat and ASTER data, geomorphological interpretations of a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) as well as field investigations such as analyses of water quality and sediment composition. The waters of Lake Urema have a low mineralization and pH values approximately neutral. The spatially dominant sediment type has a pure clay texture consisting of kaolinite and smectite. The sandy type consists of quartz, kali felspar, and plagioclase. The results of the supervised classifications for the satellite images from 1979 to 2000 showed that the lake's extent ranged between 17 km(2) (09/1995) and 25 km(2) (08/1979). Above average rainfall was responsible for the extreme lake size in May 1997 (104 km(2)). The interpretations of the Digital Terrain Model demonstrated that alluvial fans limit the Urema basin from all sides and make Lake Urema a form of "reservoir lake". The control mechanisms of the hydrological regime of Lake Urema, such as the contribution of groundwater, are not yet fully understood. The lake's condition during the rainy season was not investigated. In the future, investigations of the sources and amounts of sediment input into the lake should be conducted. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Preliminary investigation of catchment hydrology in response to agricultural water use innovations: A case study of the Potshini catchment - South Africa	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH					6th WaterNet/Warfsa/GWP-SA Symposium	NOV 02-04, 2005	Ezulwini, SWAZILAND	Waternet, Water Res Fund So Africa, Global Water Partnership So Africa				Water use system innovations encompass various techniques for storing and conserving water resources in different mediums for domestic and livestock use including agricultural production. Although, several authors have indicated that rainwater harvesting techniques, especially for upgrading smallholder farming systems, are not new but have been practiced since ancient civilizations, the impacts of such water use innovations on eco-hydrological systems are rarely assessed, especially from a cascading spatial and temporal perspective. The need to quantify the supposedly potential and related hydrological impacts of water use innovations on a catchment and river basin at large, led to the on-going research study aimed at investigating the biophysical consequences at different spatial and temporal scales in the Thukela river basin, of increased productivity in smallholder rainfed agriculture enabled through adoption at larger spatial scale of integrated land use management and water use system innovations. In this paper we discuss and outline the approach used in setting up the research study in one of the catchments in the Thukela river basin, the Potshini catchment, in the KwaZulu-Natal Province of South Africa in an effort to seek answers to the question: "What is the impact of adapting water use innovations in a predominantly agricultural area on catchment ecology and hydrology?" The approach incorporates a catchment monitoring network, hydrological modelling and application of a remote sensing technique, the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL), for spatially estimating the total evaporation in the region covering the Potshini catchment and beyond. Preliminary results indicate that water use innovations in the Potshini catchment have influenced the partitioning of rainfall, by significantly reducing surface runoff over agricultural lands under conservation tillage practices, with a reduction of above 100%, while encouraging infiltration and deeper percolation into the soil. It is envisaged that, on accomplishment, the study will contribute to formulation of sustainable adaptation of water use innovations and up-scaling strategies to enhance food production and hydro-ecological balance in semi-arid savannahs of Africa, at which stage hydrological modelling will form an important part of the study.

J	Hunt, ER; Miyake, BA				Hunt, ER; Miyake, BA			Comparison of stocking rates from remote sensing and geospatial data	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Remote sensing data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) have coarse spatial resolution (1 km(2) pixel size) and high temporal resolution, which can be used to estimate net primary production regionally. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is used to determine the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, which is sensitive to differences in growth caused by a large year-to-year variation in precipitation. The 12-year average of net primary production was used to calculate stocking rates in animal-unit months per acre for the state of Wyoming. Stocking rates were also calculated for Wyoming from 1:500 000 scale soil and climate geospatial data layers based on stocking rates from the US Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service Technician Guide to Range Sites and Range Condition. In a pixel-by-pixel comparison, there was a weak but significant correlation between the 2 methods based on the spatial distribution of precipitation. There were classes of vegetation type for which the AVHRR data predicted either touch lower or much higher stocking rates. More work needs to be done to reduce geospatial data uncertainties for the determination of stocking rates from both NDVI and stocking rate tables. Remote sensing indicates the actual condition of vegetation, so this is an important step in the development of regional forecasting of range condition, trend, and projected stocking rates for decision Support tools.																	1550-7424					JAN	2006	59	1					11	18		10.2111/04-177R.1								WOS:000234905100002						
J	Fisher, RF; Fox, TR; Harrison, RB; Terry, T				Fisher, RF; Fox, TR; Harrison, RB; Terry, T			Forest soils education and research: Trends, needs, and wild ideas	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT					10th North American Forest Soils Conference	JUL 20-24, 2003	Saulte St Marie, CANADA					Requirements of an excellent forestry education have changed. Students are now required to complete more quantitative, social science and humanities courses. There are cogent reasons for this, but it has resulted in a marked decrease in the emphasis being placed on the land. Only 15% of the North American forestry schools require geology or geomorphology, while 15% have it as a recommended elective. Thus, as many as two-thirds of forestry graduates may be geologically illiterate! Ninety percent of US forestry schools require a soils course, but only 50% require forest soils. All Canadian forestry schools require both soils and forest soils. While this erosion of emphasis placed on the soil resource has taken place in education, the use of soils information in natural resource management has dramatically increased. Many organizations are increasing the intensity of forest management and moving toward the domesticated forest, which requires more knowledge of forest soils. All natural resource professionals need a firm understanding of the land and the processes that shape it. Nineteenth century forest soils research was basic and in the 20th century it was largely empirical. The 21st century requires a balanced mix of basic and applied research with more integration with other natural resource disciplines. Many principles remain to be elucidated, but in some areas descriptive research is still necessary. The establishment of long-term regional data sets that can be used in testing hypotheses to be translated into management guidelines should be a priority. Planning tools must be developed so that the best knowledge can be applied to management. In both research and planning, science rather than politics must set the agenda. We need to teach students the full range of soil management possibilities including active management as well as conservation and preservation. We must 'bust' our conceptual blocks in both education and research. We do not need more education-. we need better education. Forest soils research needs to utilize emerging remote sensing technology both to improve our research efforts and to aid in land management planning. Remote sensing, GIs, and GPS technology can revolutionize silvicultural research, but we may need to alter our research paradigm to take advantage of it. We are too often prisoners of our past. We, those of us in education, government agencies, industry, and NGOs, must learn to work together or we will not meet the challenges of the new century. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Yang, XJ; Liu, Z				Yang, XJ; Liu, Z			Quantifying landscape pattern and its change in an estuarine watershed using satellite imagery and landscape metrics	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Degradation of estuarine ecosystems caused by human-induced stressors justifies finding efficient ways to manage and protect these environments. This study demonstrates the utilities of satellite remote sensing, landscape metrics and multivariate statistical analysis for quantifying landscape pattern and its change in a highly sensitive estuarine watershed. The objective of this study was to identify the appropriate method for landscape pattern characterization in the Pensacola estuarine drainage area (PEDA) as part of an interdisciplinary effort to develop environmental indicators for integrated estuarine ecosystem assessment in the Gulf of Mexico. The study has several components. First, two land-use and land-cover maps were produced from satellite imagery by using hierarchical classification and spatial reclassification techniques. Then, 56 metrics of landscape composition or configuration were computed from the two maps for different spatial observational units, including the PEDA, four sub-watersheds, and three predefined buffer areas. Because some of the landscape metrics may be correlated with each other, landscape ecology principles, principal component analysis and Spearman's rank correlation analysis were used to eliminate redundant metrics. This resulted in a parsimonious set of core metrics which were not redundant but spanned the important dimensions of landscape structure and pattern. These core metrics were finally used to quantify landscape pattern for different spatial observational units at the two different years. Landscape structure has been found to be more fragmented in the Pensacola Bay watershed, around the city centres and along the coastlines, where urbanization and human economic activities are more concentrated. Over time, the landscape mosaics became more heterogeneous while the classes of patches tended to be more fragmented. Results of this study should help coastal managers in the PEDA target those areas in need of conservation and protection.																	0143-1161					DEC 10	2005	26	23					5297	5323		10.1080/01431160500219273								WOS:000234504800011						
J	Hache, C; Shibusawa, S; Sasao, A				Hache, C; Shibusawa, S; Sasao, A			Discriminating conventional and conservation agricultural management practices with airborne multispectral imagery	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												In its collaborative efforts towards environmental preservation, the agricultural sector faces the challenge of adopting management practices that reduce carbon emission and increase its sequestration. Remote sensing offers the means to discriminate the spectral signatures of conventional and conservation practices and develop monitoring methods so needed by policy makers. This research provides valuable insight into the applicability of wheat canopy multispectral airborne images to discriminate conventional and conservation tillage practices interacting with two nutrient sources (i.e., inorganic and a mixture of inorganic-organic fertilizer). Combinations of tillage and nutrient sources were considered as treatments in this research. Multispectral images were acquired at different growth stages. Three simple analysis methods (analysis of variance, supervised image classification and its contingency analysis, and unsupervised classification) yielded similar results. Analysis of variance indicated high capability of the red band to discriminate tillage practices, the green band to differentiate nutrient sources and the near infrared to separate treatments. Tillage practices were discriminated with high accuracy throughout the g-rowing season using both supervised (70-82% accuracy) and unsupervised classification methods. Nutrient source classification accuracy was also high (77-89%), but imagery should be collected from partially vegetated fields (i.e., before flowering). For treatment discrimination using either supervised or unsupervised methods, images should be acquired before flowering. Multispectral images collected early in the season demonstrated a high potential to discriminate conventional and conservation practices.

We used a combination of spectral vegetation indices derived from Landsat 7 ETM+ medium resolution and IKONOS high-resolution imagery. The indices (using the red and near-infrared hands) simple ratio and normalized difference vegetation index separated the Successional stages well. Two other indices using mid-infrared bands did not separate successional stages as well. In a comparison of the successional stages with chronological age, there was no separability in the spectral reflectance among different age classes.

J	Feeley, KJ; Gillespie, TW; Terborgh, JW				Feeley, KJ; Gillespie, TW; Terborgh, JW			The utility of spectral indices from Landsat ETM+ for measuring the structure and composition of tropical dry forests	BIOTROPICA												There is a growing emphasis oil developing methods for quantifying,ing the structure and composition of tropical Forests that can be applied over large landscapes, especially for tropical dry forests that are severely fragmented and have a high conservation priority This study investigates the relationships between various measures of forest structure (annual wood), increment, canopy closure, stand density stand basal area) and composition (tree species diversity, tree community composition) measured in semi-deciduous tropical dry forests oil islands in Lago Guri, Venezuela and three spectral indices derived from Landsat ETM+: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Infrared Index (IRI), and Mid-infrared Index (MIRI). Even though there were significant autocorrelations among spectral indices, there were significant differences in the relationships between spectral indices and forest attributes. IRI was not significantly correlated with any of the structural variables while MIRI was correlated with canopy closure and NDVI values were correlated with canopy Closure as well is annual woody increment. NDVI and MIRI were both related to relative tree diversity and all three indices were associated with aspects of tree species composition. Based on the results of this study, it appears that spectral indices, and in particular NDVI, may be useful indicators of forest attributes in tropical dry forest habitats. Further research needs to be undertaken to identify if the results of this study can be applied to other tropical dry forests at a global spatial scale.

Although their potential extent covers ca 400,000 km(2) (44% of the land), they currently occupy about 10 percent of this area. The diversity and complexity of Venezuelan dry forests increases from north to south along a gradient of decreasing severity of the dry season. A typical dry forest in Venezuela presents ca 110-170 species of plants front ca 40 to 50 families with in an area of approximately 10 ha. Species composition and forest structure, however, are dependent oil local landscape conditions (e.g., soil type, topography), and nearby forest types call be very different. Our analysis of five dry forest variants showed a maximum family similarity of 67 percent, although most values fell in the 50-60 percent interval. They are currently considered as one of venezuelas most threatened ecosystems, but only 5 percent of extant dry forests are included in protected areas; this represents 0.5 percent of their potential extent. It is fundamental to promote the creation of at least 3 or 4 more large protected areas (ca 5000 ha), with different climatic and orographic characteristics, in combination with the recovery of threatened species, the restoration of degraded systems, and the implementation of sustainable development projects. Their apparent high resilience suggests Chat with the proper management we call restore and maintain the integrity of Venezuelan dry forests.

J	Harris, GM; Jenkins, CN; Pimm, SL				Harris, GM; Jenkins, CN; Pimm, SL			Refining biodiversity conservation priorities	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Although there is widespread agreement about conservation priorities at large scales (i.e., biodiversity hotspots), their boundaries remain too coarse for setting practical conservation goals. Refining hotspot conservation means identifying specific locations (individual habitat patches) of realistic size and scale for managers to protect and politicians to support. Because bot. pots have lost most of their original habitat, species endemic to them rely oil what remains. The issue now becomes identifying where this habitat is and these species are. We accomplished this by using straightforward remote sensing and GIS techniques, identifying specific locations in Brazil's Atlantic Forest hotspot important for bird conservation. Our method requires a regional map of current forest cover so we explored six popular products for mapping and quantifying forest: MODIS continuous fields and a MODIS land cover (preclassified products), AVHRR, SPOT VGT, MODIS (satellite images), and a GeoCover Landsat thematic mapper mosaic (jpg). We compared subsets of these forest covers against a forest map based oil a Landsat enhanced thematic mapper The SPOT VGT forest cover predicted forest area and location well, so we combined it with elevation delta to refine coarse distribution maps for forest endemic birds. Stacking these species distribution maps enabled identification of the subregion richest in threatened birds the lowland forests of Rio de Janeiro State. We highlighted eight priority fragments, focusing on one with finer resolved imagery for detailed study This method allows prioritization of at-eels for conservation front a region >1 million km(2) to forest fragments of lens of square kilometers. To set priorities for biodiversity conservation, coarse biological information is sufficient. Hence, our method is attractive for tropical and biologically rich locations, where species location information is sparse.

J	Bromberg, KD; Bertness, MD				Bromberg, KD; Bertness, MD			Reconstructing New England salt marsh losses using historical maps	ESTUARIES												Analyses of habitat loss are often restricted to the past 75 years by the relative youth of aerial photography and remote sensing technologies. Although photographic techniques are highly accurate, they are unable to provide measurements of habitat loss prior to the 1950s. In this study, historical maps from the late 1700s and early 1800s covering portions of Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine were used to approximate naturally occurring salt marsh cover in New England. Historical data was compared to current salt marsh coverage available in public geographic information system (GIS) data sets. The average loss in New England is estimated at 37% using this technique. Rhode Island has lost the largest proportion of salt marshes by state, a staggering 53% loss since 1832. Massachusetts has also experienced large losses, amounting to a 41% loss of salt marsh since 1777. The Boston area alone has lost 81% of its salt marshes. Salt marsh loss was highly correlated with urban growth. Restoration and preservation efforts have resulted in the retention of salt marsh in less populated areas of New England. Although historical maps are difficult to verify, they represent an extremely valuable and underused data repository. Using historical maps to trace land use practices is an effective way to overcome the short-term nature of many ecological studies. This technique could be applied to other habitats and other regions, wherever accurate historical maps are available. Analysis of historic conditions of habitats can help conservation managers determine appropriate goals for restoration and management.

Rain fed and irrigated agriculture, livestock herding, and wildlife and tourism have all experienced rapid change in their structure, extent, and interactions over the past 30 years in response to a variety of economic, cultural, political, institutional, and demographic processes. Land use patterns and processes are explored through a complementary application of interpretation of satellite imagery and case study analysis that explicitly addresses the local-national spatial scale over a time frame appropriate to the identification of fundamental causal processes. The results illustrate that this combination provides an effective basis for describing and explaining patterns of land use and land cover change and their root causes.																	0300-7839					DEC	2005	33	6					763	794		10.1007/s10745-005-8210-y								WOS:000234022800001

Interaction of Biodiversity and Economic Welfare - A Case Study from the Himalayas of India	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS												In any area to achieve the goal of biodiversity conservation, the existing resources must be strengthened, which are helpful to provide the alternate livelihood or income to the local people. However, although various programmes/policies are being set up over the world for conservation of biodiversity, a variety of factors are hurdles to achieve the expected goals. Particularly in developing countries the sustainable livelihood of the local perople is difficult if restrictions are imposed on their traditional usufruct rights over the natural resources. Based on the extensive field work and analysis of satellite imagery in the selected localities of the Indian Himalaya, we found that if the people are having the alternate avenue (profitable options) for earning, their dependencies on the existing resources (only to meet the subsistence needs, not for commercial purpose) will become much lower. Therefore, the biodiversity in these areas is conserved and managed in a healthy way. In this paper, the interactions of biodiversity and economic welfare of local people are discussed in view of understanding that the economic security is more important than pure enforcement of policies for biodiversity conservation.

J	Yoshino, K; Ishioka, Y				Yoshino, Kunihiko; Ishioka, Yoshinori			Guidelines for soil conservation towards integrated basin management for sustainable development: A new approach based on the assessment of soil loss risk using remote sensing and GIS	PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT												Soil suspension in the Cidanau River of western Java, Indonesia, has increased recently, perhaps because of rapid environmental change in this watershed region. The objectives of this research are to assess soil loss risk using remote sensing and GIS and to develop effective guidelines for soil conservation in this watershed. To assess soil loss risk, a new soil loss model based on Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) was applied, in which C factor (crop management factor) was estimated using the perpendicular vegetation index (PVI); this was computed with satellite remote sensing data and used to simulate soil loss risk. The simulation showed that areas with highest risk of soil loss are on northern- and southern-facing hillsides with poor vegetation. Guidelines for soil conservation in the watershed were proposed: under these guidelines soil-loss risk is managed by evaluating the effectiveness of contour farming, belt farming, and mulch farming. Some recommended measures for soil conservation are as follows: (1) Green vegetation cover should be preserved as much as possible. (2) Vegetation coverage must be increased by forestation in steep sloped areas. (3) Belt farming and contour farming are recommended in areas with slopes under 100%, and mulch farming (more than 50% ground cover mulching is recommended) is desirable in areas with slopes over 100% and without green cover.																	1611-2490					DEC	2005	3	4					235	247		10.1007/s10333-005-0023-5								WOS:000208365700007

In recent decades, the inflow to the reservoir has shown a decreasing trend, which has seriously threatened water use in Beijing. In order to analyze the influents of land use and cover change (LUCC) upon inflow to Miyun Reservoir, terrain and land use information from remote sensing were utilized with a revised evapotranspiration estimation formula; a water loss model under conditions of human impacts was introduced; and a distributed monthly water balance model was established and applied to the Chaobai River Basin controlled by the Miyun Reservoir. The model simulation suggested that not only the impact of land cover change on evapotranspiration, but also the extra water loss caused by human activities, such as the water and soil conservation development projects should be considered. Although these development projects were of great benefit to human and ecological protection, they could reallocate water resources in time and space, and in a sense thereby influence the stream flow.				ye, aizhong/G-6739-2014	ye, aizhong/0000-0002-5272-134X												1002-0160					DEC	2005	15	6					761	767										WOS:000233780600009

Improved management is impossible without proper monitoring at various levels. In the Aral Sea Basin, monitoring is carried out, albeit largely by under-paid staff-however the water flows to farms and fields remain largely unmeasured due to poor infrastructure and lack of proper measurement facilities. Any conclusions drawn, and therefore the policies devised for water conservation, remain largely ineffective. Contrary to the prevalent human methods of monitoring, the potential for standard monitoring of large areas at field- or farm-level in terms of water depletion and yield, using the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL), and eventually leading to water productivity calculations, is explored here using multi-source public and non-public remote sensing data combinations. The results show reasonable levels of accuracy and indicate areas needing improvements and further investigation and refinement. Farm-level maps of various water depletions and productivities provide a practical view of the performance for the meso-level. Finally, the link between the field, farm, district, and province is briefly addressed in order to provide a methodology using water depletion assessment at smaller level to upscale it to a sub-basin scale.																	0250-8060					DEC	2005	30	4					513	521		10.1080/02508060508691895								WOS:000234619500010

However, at the present time, automated grain size measurement is limited to the dry exposed bed areas of the channel. This paper shows that the application area of automated grain size mapping can be extended in order to include the shallow wetted areas of the channel. The paper then proceeds to illustrate how automated grain size measurement in both dry and shallow wetted areas can be used to measure grain sizes automatically for long river lengths. For the present study, this results in a median grain size profile covering an 80 km long river which is constructed from over three million automated grain size measurements.

J	Berry, JK; Delgado, JA; Pierce, FJ; Khosla, R				Berry, JK; Delgado, JA; Pierce, FJ; Khosla, R			Applying spatial analysis for precision conservation across the landscape	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Although new technologies such as precision farming will contribute to increasing yields per unit area, similarly soil and water conservation will be instrumental in maintaining these increases in productivity while reducing environmental degradation, off-site transport, and water pollution. Initially, 'precision conservation' was defined as the integration of spatial technologies such as global positioning systems (GPS), remote sensing, and geographic information systems (GIS) and the ability to analyze spatial relationships within and among mapped data. Surface modeling, spatial data mining and map analysis are three broad approaches that can be used to analyze layers of information to help develop and implement management practices that contribute to soil and water conservation in agricultural and natural ecosystems. In this paper, we expand the definition of precision conservation to a developing science that uses the new spatial technologies to link a system from a site specific location, to a field, to a set of fields (farm) to a regional scale. We also expand our discussion based on the status of precision conservation as it was shown by twenty six precision conservation papers presented at the 2004 Soil Science Society of America annual meeting. We propose that precision conservation will be a key science to contribute to the sustainability of our biosphere in this century.																	0022-4561					NOV-DEC	2005	60	6					363	370										WOS:000233893300018						
J	Delgado, JA; Bausch, WC				Delgado, JA; Bausch, WC			Potential use of precision conservation techniques to reduce nitrate leaching in irrigated crops	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												There is a continuing need to develop advanced nitrogen (N) management practices that increase N use efficiencies and reduce nitrate-nitrogen(NO3-N) leaching. Our goal was to evaluate the use of geographic information systems (GIS), global positioning systems (GPS), modeling and remote sensing for reducing residual soil NO3-N and NO3-N leaching in a centerpivot irrigated corn (Zea mays L.) field. Specific objectives were: 1) to determine if productivity zones delineated using precision agriculture technologies could also correctly identify unique areas within corn fields that differed in residual soil NO3-N and NO3-N leaching potential; and 2) evaluate the potential to use remote sensing of crop productivity to reduce NO3-N leaching losses. This study was conducted in northeastern Colorado during the 2000 and 2001 growing seasons in a 70 ha (173 ac) center-pivot irrigated commercial cornfield. For the first objective, initial and final soil samples after harvesting were collected at known locations in high, medium and low productivity areas across this field. For the second objective initial and final soil samples after harvesting were collected in a tow productivity area where "in season" N management was conducted based on remote sensing data. Crop yields and total N were determined on plant samples located at the soil sampling coordinates. The N reflectance index was used to determine the "in season" N application. Remote-sensing-based N fertilization treatment occurred whenever the mean N reflectance index was lower than 0.95 and/or more than 50 percent of the area had an N reflectance index less than 0.95. For both studies, the nitrate leaching economic analysis package and GIS were used to evaluate NO3-N leaching 4. losses. We found that GIS, GPS, and modeling technologies can be used to identify and simulate the spatial residual soil NO3-N patterns. Productivity zones delineated using precision agriculture technologies identified areas within corn production fields that differed in residual soil NO3-N and NO3-N leaching potential. This spatial variability was negatively correlated with the soil texture (P < 0.0001), having lower residual soil NO3-N on the lower productivity sandier areas, which also had a higher NO3-N leaching potential. The N Reflectance Index method can maximize the synchronization of "in season" N applications with corn N uptake needs to increase N use efficiencies and reduce NO3-N leaching losses by 47 percent when compared to traditional practices (P < 0.0001).																	0022-4561					NOV-DEC	2005	60	6					379	387										WOS:000233893300020

Habitat suitability models using empirical species-specific habitat parameters and a Geographic Information System were applied to evaluate and compare the degree of consistency among three different land cover data sets. The study area encompassed 10,000 km(2) in a landscape mosaic of managed boreal forests and is within the distribution range of all four focal species. Although the three land cover data sets indicated similar total amounts of deciduous forest, the habitat suitability models showed that different land cover data yielded inconsistent results regarding the amount and distribution of suitable habitat within 5x5 km grid cells. Given this sensitivity to the choice of land cover data sets, the habitat suitability models showed positive relationships among the selected focal species for each land cover data set separately. As expected, decreasing amounts of suitable habitat were identified for species with higher specialisation. Thus, because habitat suitability models are an appropriate way to gain insight into the functionality and connectivity of habitat networks, land cover data must be carefully evaluated and if necessary combined with other landscape information for effective conservation planning.

In this study, we used Landsat TM/ ETM data at a spatial resolution of 30 in to reconstruct spatial and temporal patterns of cropland across China for the time period of 1990-2000. Our estimate has indicated that total cropland area in China in 2000 was 141.1 million hectares (ha), including 35.6 million ha paddy land and 105.5 million ha dry farming land. The distribution of cropland is uneven across the regions of China. The North-East region of China shows more cropland area per capita than the South-East and North regions of China. During 1990-2000, cropland increased by 2.79 million ha, including 0.25 million ha of paddy land and 2.53 million ha of dry farming land. The North-East and North-West regions of China gained cropland area, while the North and South-East regions showed a loss of cropland area. Urbanization accounted for more than half of the transformation from cropland to other land uses, and the increase in cropland was primarily due to reclamation of grassland and deforestation. Most of the lost cropland had good quality with high productivity, but most gained cropland was poor quality land with less suitability for crop production. The globalization as well as changing environment in China is affecting land-use change. Coordinating the conflict between environmental conservation and land demands for food will continue to be a primary challenge for China in the future. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This approach may improve monitoring through diagnosing forest fragments instead of quantifying only forest area reduction. This paper aims to evaluate relationships between forest structure and vegetation indices in Atlantic Rainforest fragments, in southeastern Brazil. Two Landsat 7 ETM+ images acquired in humid and dry seasons were used, and measurements of forest structure in nine forest fragments and in a continuous forest area in the Guapiacu River Basin, in Rio de Janeiro State were taken. Three vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), moisture vegetation index using Landsat's band 5 (MV15) and moisture vegetation index using Landsat's band 7 (MV17)) were correlated with measurements of forest structure (frequency of multiple- stemmed trees, density of trees, mean and range of tree diameter, mean and range of tree height and average of basal area). Models describing the relationships between forest structure and vegetation indices using linear regression analysis were also developed. MV15 and MV17 showed the best performances in dense humid forests, whereas NDVI seems to be a good indicator of green biomass in deciduous and dry forests. Moreover, the saturation matter in vegetation indices and the transferability of relationships between biophysical characteristics and vegetation indices to other sites and times were discussed.

Logged areas ranged from 12,075 to 19,823 square kilometers per year (+/- 14%) between 1999 and 2002, equivalent to 60 to 123% of previously reported deforestation area. Up to 1200 square kilometers per year of logging were observed on conservation lands. Each year, 27 million to 50 million cubic meters of wood were extracted, and a gross flux of similar to 0.1 billion metric tons of carbon was destined for release to the atmosphere by logging.

Ten vegetation types were identified and mapped using aerial photography and the resultant map was assessed for inaccuracy using field methods and GIS technology. Internal and external buffers of various widths were created on the boundaries of Spekboomveld vegetation type and the area recalculated and used to estimate abundance of the potential mammal community. Mean deviation of drawn boundaries from observed ones was 28.4 m, creating a zone of error, which may support 53 herbivores within the Spekboomveld type. The number of animals predicted to occur in the mapped vegetation type was 869 individuals while the created zones of error could support from 46 (25 m wide) to 673 (400 m wide) individuals. The key issue for planning or management is that seemingly small errors in locating vegetation boundaries will have significant effects on the error in the number of animals that can be supported.

J	McConnell, WJ; Sweeney, SP				McConnell, WJ; Sweeney, SP			Challenges of forest governance in Madagascar	GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL												There has been a huge surge in interest in the preservation of Madagascar's forests in the past two decades, but despite the investment of hundreds of millions of dollars, the goal remains elusive. Recent legislation has given the government the authority to enter into contractual arrangements with communities for the management of the country's public forests, so it has become crucial to grapple with the significant challenges involved. This paper explores the enormity of the challenge of forest governance in Madagascar in an era of decentralization. By examining several forests in one part of the country, it reveals a dizzying range of forest types and forms of use and governance within a fairly small portion of the country. These examples make it apparent that the history of forest management in Madagascar constitutes a broad-ranging experiment with forest governance. Simply monitoring the dynamics of the forest canopy is a significant technical challenge. However, this pales in comparison to the difficulties inherent in explaining those dynamics and assessing the sustainability and equity of different management regimes. Of the forests considered in the study, those where the Malagasy state has partnered with international conservation and development organizations seem to stand out, both in terms of stabilized, or even growing, forest cover, as well as a balance of interests among users.																	0016-7398					SEP	2005	171		3				223	238		10.1111/j.1475-4959.2005.00162.x								WOS:000231928100003

The aim of this paper is to test whether plant species richness can be inventoried more efficiently by means of a spectrally-based ordering of sites to be sampled. Location The study area was a complex wetland ecosystem, the Lake Montepulciano Nature Reserve, central Italy. This is one of the most important wetland areas of central Italy because of the diverse plant communities and the seasonal avifauna. Methods Field sampling, based on a random stratified sampling design, was performed in June 2002. Plant species composition was recorded within sampling units of 100 m(2) (plots) and 1 ha (macroplots). A QuickBird multispectral image of the same date was acquired and corrected both geometrically and radiometrically. Species accumulation curves based on spectral information were obtained by ordering sites to be sampled according to a maximum spectral distance criterion (i.e. by ordering sampling units based on the maximum distances among them in a four-dimensional spectral space derived from the remotely sensed data). Different distance measures based on mean and maximum spectral distances among sampling units were tested. The performance of the species accumulation curve derived by the spectrally-based ordering of sampling units was tested against a rarefaction curve obtained from the mean of 10,000 accumulation curves based on randomly ordered sampling units. Results The spectrally-derived curve based on the maximum spectral distance among sampling units showed the most rapid accumulation of species, well above the rarefaction curve, at both the plot and the macroplot scales. Other ordering criteria of sampling units captured less richness over most of the species accumulation curves at both the spatial scales. The accumulation curves based on other measurements of distance were much closer to the random curve and did not show differences with respect to the species rarefaction curve based on random ordering of sampling units. Main conclusions The present investigation demonstrated that spectral-based ordering of sites to be sampled can lead to the maximization of the efficiency of plant species inventories, an activity usually driven by the 'botanist's internal algorithm' (intuition), without any formalized rule to drive field sampling. The proposed approach can reduce costs of plant species inventorying through a more efficient allotment of time and sampling.

For this purpose, cloud free satellite images on the scale of 1 : 50,000. from Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellite IRS-ID and IRS-IC were used. The iotal area of mangroves in Mumbai suburban region has been estimated to be 56.40 km(2) (including mud flats) with dense mangroves contributing 45.4% to the total. During 1990 to 2001, a total mangrove area of 36.54 km(2) was lost, indicating a 39.32% decrease in the area of mangroves. It has been observed that the quantitative degradation of mangrove vegetation is largely due to burgeoning population pressure, construction and development activities, conversion to agricultural land and fish farms besides the effect of industrial effluents. Avicennia marina was found to be the most dominant mangrove species. Measures have been suggested for conservation and management of mangroves of Mumbai on a sustainable basis.																	0379-5136	0975-1033				SEP	2005	34	3					310	315										WOS:000232121900008

In the Pays de Caux region of northwestern France, the silty soils with crusting properties induce a high risk of runoff and erosion. Changes in agricultural practices, land use and landscape patterns appear to have increased the occurrence of erosion and mud flows over the past few decades. A runoff and erosion model called STREAM, applicable to single rainfall events at catchment scale, has been developed to simulate the impacts of land-use modifications. The model takes into account processes that degrade surface states when calculating infiltration rates, as well as agricultural aspects when computing the runoff circulation network. STREAM is based on an expert-system approach that focuses on the dominant processes whilst having only a few input parameters: three of these are used to determine the runoff circulation network, and the other four to calculate infiltration rates. Input nevertheless requires field observations, which restricts application of the model to small catchments. Satellite data covering large areas is considered as an alternative input for such a model, the main objectives being to adapt STREAM accordingly, and to compare the obtained results with field data. In view of previous work involving the extraction and validation of roughness indices using RADARSAT data, this study is based on RADARSAT and LANDSAT TM data collected during the winter of 1998. After adaptation to receive remote-sensing data, the resulting STREAM-TED model requires less input, namely (1) slope and orientation, (2) land-use classification from optical remote-sensing data, (3) roughness indices from radar remote-sensing data, and (4) previous rainfall. Runoff volumes at a gauged catchment outlet (Bourville in Upper Normandy, France) are simulated by four successive versions of the model ranging from the original STREAM to the adapted STREAM-TED. Predictions of the four versions are compared, and performance of the successive simulations is assessed in relation to measured values and according to five statistical indices. Predictions of runoff volume at the catchment outlet using STREAM-TED are similar to those using the original STREAM model, but with a tendency towards overestimation. The final STREAM-TED version is capable of identifying areas sensitive to runoff within a group of catchments and could be used as a planning decision tool in the implementation of conservation practices.

J	Arsenault, E; Bonn, F				Arsenault, E; Bonn, F			Evaluation of soil erosion protective cover by crop residues using vegetation indices and spectral mixture analysis of multispectral and hyperspectral data	CATENA					1st Meeting on Significance of Soils Surface Characteristics in Soil Erosion	SEP, 2001	Strasbourg, FRANCE	RIDES/PNRH Grp, BRGM, French Res Grp, CNRS, French Res Grp, INRA, French Res Grp, IRD, French Res Grp				Crop residues are efficient in reducing erosion and surface water runoff on agricultural soils. Evaluating the crop residue cover fraction and its spatial distribution is important to scientists involved in the modelling of soil erosion and surface runoff; and also to authorities wishing to assess soil conservation adoption by farmers. This study focuses on the evaluation of four remote sensing techniques to estimate the cover fraction of cereal crop residues (i.e., wheat and corn) from multispectral and hyperspectral measurements. These are the Soil Adjusted Corn Residue Index (SACRI), the Crop Residue Index Multiband (CRIM), the Normalized Difference Index (NDI) and the spectral mixture analysis technique (SMA). Field campaigns that were carried out by the FLOODGEN project in Sainte-Angele-de-Monnoir, Quebec, Canada and in the Pays-de-Caux located in the Normandy region of France, allowed us to gather digital photographs, spectra and other measurements to determine the actual ground cover fraction. A linear regression analysis between results derived from Landsat-5 TM simulated field spectra and the actual ground cover fractions showed best results for the GRIM on the Ste-Angele-de-Monnoir study site (R-2 = 0.96), and equally good results for the Pays-de-Caux study site (R-2 = 0.94). Results were not as good when SMA was applied to the same Landsat-5 TM simulated field spectra with R-2 values of 0.70 and 0.68 for both sites, respectively. However, results improved significantly when SMA was applied to the hyperspectral data in which case the R-2 values increased to 0.92 for the Sainte-Angele-de-Monnoir site and 0.89 for the Pays-de-Caux study site. Results obtained with the NDI and SACRI from both simulated TM and hyperspectral field spectra were not conclusive.

Existing methods to identify priority areas for conservation have focused almost entirely on biological factors. We suggest a new relative ranking method for identifying priority conservation areas that integrates both biological and social aspects. It is based on the following criteria: the habitat's status, human population pressure, human efforts to protect habitat, and number of endemic plant and vertebrate species. We used this method to rank 25 hotspots, 17 megadiverse countries, and the hotspots within each megadiverse country. We used consistent, comprehensive, georeferenced, and multiband data sets and analytical remote sensing and geographic information system tools to quantify habitat status, human population pressure, and protection status. The ranking suggests that the Philippines, Atlantic Forest, Mediterranean Basin, Caribbean Islands, Caucasus, and Indo-Burma are the hottest hotspots and that China, the Philippines, and India are the hottest megadiverse countries. The great variation in terms of habitat, protected areas, and population pressure among the hotspots, the megadiverse countries, and the hotspots within the same country suggests the need for hotspot- and country-specific conservation policies.																	0888-8892					AUG	2005	19	4					1273	1285		10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00225.x								WOS:000231118600033

ECOGRAPHY												The structure and composition of arthropod assemblages are strongly associated with habitat complexity. Accurate, time efficient estimates of habitat complexity may provide insights for biodiversity management in natural systems. We obtained high-resolution (0.7 m pixel) multi-spectral aerial imagery of National Parks 20 km north and 20 km south of Sydney, Australia. We explored both the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the standard deviation of reflectance in the near-infrared spectrum (stdevR(NIR)) as indicators of low and high habitat complexity in sandstone forests north of Sydney. We then tested described predictions of ant community patterns (based on a previous study) using sites selected from high-resolution multi-spectral imagery in sandstone forests south of Sydney. Ground-scored habitat complexity was positively correlated with NDVIs and, to a lesser extent, stdevR(NIR) values in sandstone forests north of Sydney. As predicted, ant species richness was negatively correlated with NDVIs in forests to the south of Sydney. Also, ant species composition was different in areas with contrasting NDVIs. The ant species driving composition differences responded to habitat complexity in a similar way in forests to the north, and south, of Sydney. The strong association we detected between NDVIs and habitat complexity, most likely reflects the relatively exposed nature of the vegetative layers in the forests we sampled. Remote sensing, integrated with quantitative research testing predictive faunal responses to vegetation structure and biomass at landscape scales, may provide efficient means of estimating biodiversity for management in particular habitats.

These dynamic processes shape the floodplain landscape, resulting in a shifting mosaic of habitats, both above and below ground. We present a new and innovative methodology to quantitatively assess the geomorphic work potential necessary to maintain a shifting habitat mosaic for gravel-bed river floodplains. This approach can be used to delineate critical habitats for preservation through land acquisition and conservation easements, often critical elements of river restoration plans worldwide. Spatially explicit modeling of water depth, flow velocity, shear stress, and stream power derived from surface hydraulic measurements was combined with airborne multispectral remote sensing for detailed modeling of floodplain water surfaces over tens to hundreds of square kilometers. The model results were then combined within a GIS framework to determine potential nodes of channel avulsion that delineate spatially explicit zones across the floodplain where the potential for geomorphic work is the greatest. Results of this study demonstrate the utility of integrating existing multispectral remote sensing data coupled with time-lagged ground-based measures of flow hydraulics to model fluvial processes at relatively fine spatial resolutions but over broad regional extents.																	1051-0761					AUG	2005	15	4					1209	1222		10.1890/03-5290								WOS:000230876900011						
J	Lathrop, RG; Montesano, P; Tesauro, J; Zarate, B				Lathrop, RG; Montesano, P; Tesauro, J; Zarate, B			Statewide mapping and assessment of vernal pools: A New Jersey case study	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												In 2001, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) adopted rules specifically protecting vernal pool habitat for the first time. Vernal pools are small isolated temporary bodies of water that provide critical breeding habitat for a number of amphibian species. To implement these rules and ultimately afford vernal pools protection, the NJDEP first needed to assemble a statewide database of vernal pool locations. In response, the Rutgers University Center for Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis (CRSSA) was funded to develop a cost effective technique to map vernal pool locations statewide. The objective of CRSSA's mapping effort was to develop a complete potential vernal pool database to be able to identify individual isolated vernal pools as well as areas of high local density, or 'hotspots'. CRSSA used visual interpretation of leaf-off color infrared digital orthophotography in a computerized GIS environment to identify and map over 13,000 potential vernal pools. Using the 1 m scale imagery, we determined the minimum detectable pool size to be on the order of 0.02 ha in size. Subsequent field checking has revealed a 12% error of commission that was due to our inclination towards erring on the side of inclusion in mapping many water features as potential vernal pools. For a vernal pool to receive regulated protection, it must be 'certified' that it serves as habitat for obligate or facultative vernal pool amphibian species. To aid in these efforts, CRSSA developed an interactive internet mapping site to assist NJDEP and its citizen volunteer corps in locating and navigating to their survey areas and to facilitate the on-line submittal of survey observations.

J	Benfield, SL; Guzman, HM; Mair, JM				Benfield, SL; Guzman, HM; Mair, JM			Temporal mangrove dynamics in relation to coastal development in Pacific Panama	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												This study assessed the changes in extent of fringing mangrove located in Punta Mala Bay, Panama in relation to coastal development over a period of two decades. Punta Mala Bay was chosen for this study, due to its social importance and its biological significance, as it is one of the few mangrove areas left around Panama City. Fieldwork confirmed the importance of Laguncularia racemosa in the bay, which formed nearly monospecific stands with a large number of seedlings indicating that the forest was rejuvenating. The mangrove was mapped from 1980 to 2002 using digitised aerial photographs and a GIS was used to determine the location and rates of mangrove growth and loss before and after the construction of a road and water treatment works in 1998. The land use maps were produced with an overall accuracy of 83.8%. The user's accuracy of the maps for L. racemosa dominated stands was 89.7%, although the producer's accuracy was lower due to the omission of seedlings on intertidal areas. It was found that the mangrove was spatially dynamic and had grown substantially in the bay at a rate ranging from 6 to 215% per year until the construction commenced. Between 1997 and 2002 there were 100% loss of mangrove in some areas due to the coastal development. The resilience of the dominant species L. racemosa at this locality was shown by the continued growth of two mangrove zones during the construction period 1997-2002, with one zone increasing in area by 61%. The pioneering ability of L. racemosa after disturbance was demonstrated by the development of two new mangrove zones of 498 and 1254 m(2) on bare intertidal areas after construction finished. Future mapping and fieldwork could provide information on the development of mangrove communities and their response to reoccurring human impacts. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Backhaus, R; Beule, B				Backhaus, R; Beule, B			Efficiency evaluation of satellite data products in environmental policy	SPACE POLICY												Environmental policy requires increasing monitoring and reporting and Europe's GMES initiative offers good prospects in this regard. With this in mind, the potential to use remote sensing data for tasks mandatory for the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, and its assigned agencies was analysed. The general potential of satellite data applications was studied for a total of 13 departmental issues, concentrating on nine specific remote sensing products and services important to the agencies, with the emphasis on the monitoring of land cover and land use. Product costs were estimated for an efficiency analysis and an independent product appraisal was performed by thematic experts. The evaluation showed most products to be of paramount importance for mandatory tasks in the fields of environmental observation and the Federal Environmental Specimen Bank; soil protection; water management (implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive); and air pollution control (impacts on sensitive ecosystems). Concluding recommendations discuss the harmonisation, implementation and shared funding of a stock of satellite data for federal and state agencies, the German position on further implementation of GMES, and the continuity of data provision to be secured by operational satellite missions.

Remote sensing has considerable potential to provide such maps, but classification accuracy within primary rain forests has generally been inadequate for practical applications. Here we test how accurately floristically defined forest types in lowland tropical rain forests in Peruvian Amazonia can be recognized using remote sensing data (Landsat ETM+ satellite image and STRM elevation model). Floristic data and a vegetation classification with four forest classes were available for eight line transects, each 8 km long, located in an area of ca 800 km. We compared two sampling unit sizes (line transect subunits of 200 and 500 m) and several image feature combinations to analyze their suitability for image classification. Mantel tests were used to quantify how well the patterns in elevation and in the digital numbers of the satellite image correlated with the floristic patterns observed in the field. Most Mantel correlations were positive and highly significant. Linear discriminant analysis was used first to build a function that discriminates between forest classes in the eight field-verified transects on the basis of remotely sensed data, and then to classify those parts of the line transects and the satellite image that had not been visited in the field. Classification accuracy was quantified by 8-fold crossvalidation. Two of the tierra firme (non-inundated) forest types were combined because they were too often misclassified. The remaining three forest types (inundated forest, terrace forest and Pebas formation/intermediate tierra firme forest) could be separated using the 500-m sampling units with an overall classification accuracy of 85% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.62. For the 200-m sampling units, the classification accuracy was clearly lower (71%, Kappa 0.35). The forest classification will be used as habitat data to study wildlife habitat use in the same area. Our results show that remotely sensed data and relatively simple classification methods can be used to produce reasonably accurate forest type classifications, even in structurally homogeneous primary rain forests.

The basin is covered by hard crystalline rock and overall has poor groundwater conditions. Hence, an artificial recharge study was carried out in this region through a project sponsored by Tamil Nadu State Council for Science and Technology. The Indian Remote Sensing satellite 1A Linear Imaging Self Scanning Sensor II (IRS 1A LISS II) satellite imagery, aerial photographs and geophysical resistivity data were used to prioritize suitable sites for artificial recharge and to estimate the volume of aquifer dimension available to recharge. The runoff water available for artificial recharge in the basin is estimated through Soil Conservation Service curve number method. The land use/land cover, hydrological soil group and storm rainfall data in different watershed areas were used to calculate the runoff in the watersheds. The weighted curve number for each watershed is obtained through spatial intersection of land use/land cover and hydrological soil group through GeoMedia 3.0 Professional GIS software. Artificial recharge planning was derived on the basis of availability of runoff, aquifer dimension, priority areas and water table conditions in different watersheds in the basin.																	0943-0105					JUL	2005	48	2					158	170		10.1007/s00254-005-1284-4								WOS:000230624900003						
J	Leimgruber, P; Christen, CA; Laborderie, A				Leimgruber, P; Christen, CA; Laborderie, A			The impact of Landsat satellite monitoring on conservation biology	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Landsat 7's recent malfunctioning will result in significant gaps in long-term satellite monitoring of Earth, affecting not only the research of the Earth science community but also conservation users of these data. To determine whether or how important Landsat monitoring is for conservation and natural resource management, we reviewed the Landsat program's history with special emphasis on the development of user groups. We also conducted a bibliographic search to determine the extent to which conservation research has been based on Landsat data. Conservation biologists were not an early user group of Landsat data because a) biologists lacked technical capacity - computers and software - to analyze these data; b) Landsat's 1980s commercialization rendered images too costly for biologists' budgets; and c) the broad-scale disciplines of conservation biology and landscape ecology did not develop until the mid-to-late 1980s. All these conditions had changed by the 1990s and Landsat imagery became an important tool for conservation biology. Satellite monitoring and Landsat continuity are mandated by the Land Remote Sensing Act of 1992. This legislation leaves open commercial options. However, past experiments with commercial operations were neither viable nor economical, and severely reduced the quality of monitoring, archiving and data access for academia and the public.

Such a method will be a useful tool in planning the sustainable use and conservation of Amazonian rain forests. Location The study covered an area of c. 700 km(2) of primary rain forest in Amazonian Ecuador. Methods We field inventoried the species composition of pteridophytes and Melastomataceae in 340 inventory plots (5 m x 50 m), described the prevailing topography and analysed soil cation concentration and texture. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to summarize the floristic variation among the inventory plots in three ordination dimensions. The scores of the three ordination axes were predicted to non-visited places using a Landsat TM (thematic mapper) satellite image and the k nearest neighbours (knn) estimation method. To avoid extrapolation, we excluded from the analysis those pixel windows whose spectral values were not represented in the areas covered by field sampling. The accuracy of the predictions was evaluated by cross-validation and by comparing the predictions based on spectrally nearest neighbours to the predictions based on random neighbours. Results The floristic gradients presented by NMDS ordination were interpretable in terms of topography, drainage and soil cation content. Thirteen percent of the cloud-free pixels were excluded from the knn analysis to avoid extrapolation. The estimates of the floristic ordination scores based on spectrally nearest neighbours were always more accurate than estimates based on random neighbours. Main conclusions The presented method needs a relatively small input of work and resources, is mechanistic and produces maps that give relevant information on floristic variation over forest areas that are traditionally considered essentially homogeneous. Therefore, the method appears to have a great potential for use in mapping large areas of Amazonian rain forests.

J	Lin, LW; Demirbilek, Z				Lin, LW; Demirbilek, Z			Evaluation of two numerical wave models with inlet physical model	JOURNAL OF WATERWAY PORT COASTAL AND OCEAN ENGINEERING-ASCE												This paper evaluates the performance of two numerical wave models, GHOST and STWAVE, with measurements made in an idealized inlet physical model. The emphasis of this paper is on the overall performance of these models in coastal inlets. Both wave models are similar in that they employ a finite-difference method to solve the wave action conservation equation for the steady-state wave spectral transformation. However, these models differ in the computation of diffraction, reflection, wave breaking, and representation of the directional spectrum transformation. The models' performance is compared with a new set of physical model data for four different idealized inlet configurations. Wave height is measured in the physical model by a linear array of capacitance wave gauges, and wave direction is measured by a remote-sensing video-camera system. The comparison with data is presented as mean absolute relative errors of wave height and mean absolute difference of wave direction. Both wave models produced similar results, but neither could accurately describe waves observed in the physical model in inlets and near structures. The mean absolute relative error of wave height prediction from models was between 22 and 40% as compared with the measured data. The mean absolute error of wave direction estimates ranged from 5 to 12 degrees. Overall, wave direction estimates from GHOST in inlets and near structures compared slightly better with measurements.																	0733-950X					JUL-AUG	2005	131	4					149	161		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-950X(2005)131:4(149)								WOS:000230124800002

("pajonal") in the Flooding Pampa (Argentina) is relevant for the identification of conservation sites and sustainable management and land-use planning. Since European settlement, vast areas of pajonal were converted to croplands and short-grass prairies. The only available vegetation map of these grasslands was made in the mid-20th century. We evaluated 2 methods of land-cover classification (supervised and unsupervised) using a Landsat TM satellite image over an area of 2 258.21 km(2) in Ayacucho county, where pajonal still persists as an important ecosystem. At the paddock scale, this grassland community presents a complex structure in which the pajonal is not a pure category but a mosaic of tall and short grasses. Six categories of land cover were adopted (crops, sown pastures, short grasses, pajonal, wetlands, and urban areas). A very good overall accuracy was obtained for both classifications (86.9% and 87.9% for supervised and unsupervised classifications, respectively). However, both producer's and user's accuracies for the pajonal and short grasses were better for the unsupervised classification than for the supervised classification. The pajonal class occupied only 20% of the study area with patch size ranging between 0.09 and 1 653 ha. This work suggests an important replacement of tall-tussock grass by short-grass matrix, which represents noticeable structural and functional changes. The unsupervised classification of Landsat image seems a particularly suitable method for mapping complex vegetation units like the highly fragmented pajonal of the Flooding Pampa and should be an important tool for management and tracking future changes.																	1550-7424					JUL	2005	58	4					406	412		10.2111/1551-5028(2005)058[0406:RSAOPQ]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000230799500012						
J	Gottschalk, TK; Huettmann, F; Ehlers, M				Gottschalk, TK; Huettmann, F; Ehlers, M			Thirty years of analysing and modelling avian habitat relationships using satellite imagery data: a review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The application of remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technologies provides powerful tools when used to investigate wildlife and its habitat for an analysis or modelling approach. In this context, birds have been of great and progressive value as biological and environmental indicators. In order to learn about the common approaches used-its methods, processing steps, trends, advantages and challenges-over 120 representative publications of the last 30 years that made use of satellite images for avian applications have been reviewed. The reviewed studies have shown that GIS-based analyses of satellite and bird data have been well established for efficient ecosystem descriptions and species modelling within a large range of scales and habitats. In order to improve the quality of inference and for comparative analyses, it is recommended that further studies are documented in detail. Also, in order to verify and improve the obtained results, additional ground data on the main structure of the vegetation relevant to the bird species in question are usually necessary. Satellite-based remote sensing applications in ornithology could be used increasingly for assisting in habitat evaluation, habitat modelling and monitoring programmes and in achieving overall wildlife conservation and management objectives effectively. This is especially true for remote regions of the world that are difficult to access where few habitat studies have been undertaken to date but whose study is urgently needed.																	0143-1161	1366-5901				JUN 20	2005	26	12					2631	2656		10.1080/01431160512331338041								WOS:000230731900009

The aim of this study was to investigate and assess spatial distribution changes and temporal coverage changes of the following endangered rare plants: Tetraena mongolica, Helianthemum soongolicum, Reaumuria trigyna, Reaumuria soongorica, Potaninia mongolica, and Ammopiptanthus mongolicus, in the West Ordos Plateau National Conservation Region in Inner Mongolia, China. Using ETM+ (August 1999) remote sensing data, DEM data, and data from 25 field samples collected from Gangdeger Mountain in July 1999, digital maps highlighting endangered plant populations (1994) were processed using the 'MPH feature extraction method' to view the current spatial distribution pattern of the endangered plants. The 'radiometric normalization' and 'vegetation change detection' methods were then used to reveal temporal coverage changes of the endangered plants, using TM (September 1987) and ETM+ (August 1999) data.																	0143-1161					JUN 10	2005	26	11					2297	2310		10.1080/01431160310001654419								WOS:000230646900004

Consequently, there is a loss of biodiversity due to change in habitat conditions. These remnant fragments provide the last hope for biodiversity conservation. The present study deals with the impact of decreasing patch size of a fragmented forest on the diversity of the tropical dry deciduous forests in Vindhyan highlands, India. There is considerable change in the vegetation cover of this region owing to rapid industrialization and urbanization, which has also contributed to forest fragmentation. In the present study, remotely sensed data has been used to describe the changes brought about in vegetated areas over a period of 10 years as a result of fragmentation and its impact on biodiversity was assessed. Further, in order to assess the loss of species with respect to the reduction in patch size, species area curves for various change areas were analysed. It was observed that the rate of decrease in the number of species is faster in the case of negative change areas as compared to the positive change areas of the region. Various diversity indices also support this observation. Such an analysis would help in formulating appropriate conservation measures for the region.

J	Nagendra, H; Karmacharya, M; Karna, B				Nagendra, H; Karmacharya, M; Karna, B			Evaluating forest management in Nepal: Views across space and time	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY												This research follows the manner in which State-driven, upwardly accountable, forest decentralization programs play out on the ground, and evaluates their impact on forests and local institutions, a topic of much current concern and debate. In a landscape in Nepal's Terai plains, we conducted a census of 23 co-managed community and buffer-zone forest user groups-two predominant approaches to involving communities in forest-management activities in Nepal's Terai plains-to draw statistically relevant conclusions about the relative impact of these two programs at a landscape scale. We use a multidate Landsat TM (R) image classification to develop a land-cover change classification, and use this to generate objective, quantitative, biophysical indicators that enable us to assess the extent of clearing and regeneration in the forest areas controlled and managed by each of these communities. In-depth field interviews with the communities provide us with information about the impact of these initiatives on local institutions. Finally, we link these two kinds of information sets to interpret the satellite information on forest-cover change with reference to the socioeconomic processes and management rules that influence forest-cover change in these regions. Satellite image analysis shows the regeneration of several patches of forest that are managed within the purview of the Royal Chitwan National Park's buffer-zone program. This can be related to high levels of investment in plantation and forest-management activities by external agencies. The substantial revenue that these communities derive from ecotourism also helps, allowing them to hire forest guards, and afford better monitoring capabilities. In contrast, the less wealthy, community-forestry user groups have to make do with volunteer patrols, and do not have the same level of external technical and financial support to invest in plantation activities. Buffer-zone users, however, have to deal with rather strict controls on export of forest products, which were put in place by park authorities, and which the users do not have the power to modify. Downward accountability is limited, and communities do not have a high degree of effective control over forest-management policies. Thus, local communities currently function under a situation of constraint, where they have been delegated responsibilities, but lack the devolution of property rights and decision-making power. This has significant and potentially negative implications for the future of the program.

J	Peters, M; Hyman, G; Jones, P				Peters, M; Hyman, G; Jones, P			Identifying areas for field conservation of forages in Latin American disturbed environments	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY												This paper uses the spatial analysis tools DIVA and FloraMap to identify potential areas for the in situ conservation of a set of 10 forage species. We introduce the idea of roadside verges as conservation areas and discuss the risks and opportunities of two potential scenarios for conservation. These are the introduction of mass reservoirs outside of the original areas of collection and conservation inside the area of origin. Four potential areas for in situ conservation in Latin America are identified. Although more detailed studies using remote sensing, soil information, and field reconnaissance will be necessary for a final assessment of the suggested areas as field conservation sites, we discuss the possibilities of establishing low-maintenance communities and the potential dangers of introducing harmful weed species. We do not have final answers with regard to the permanent maintenance of genetic diversity in these areas but suggest that further studies of genetic drift in the populations would not only be scientifically useful but might also lead to identifying useful genotypes for local use.																	1708-3087					JUN	2005	10	1							1									WOS:000230237900005

Factors such as explosive population growth, logging, mining, small-scale farming and ranching have synergistically fuelled deforestation in the state. The total area deforested in Rondonia in 1978 was 4200 km(2). In 1988, the area increased to 30 000 km(2), in 1998 to 53 300 km(2) and by the year 2003, a total of 67 764 km(2) of Rondonia was deforested. In response to the high rate of deforestation observed in Rondonia and other Amazonian states, state and federal agencies worked to create a network of conservation units (CUs) in Brazil during the 1990s that was signed into law (Law 9985/00) in 2000. The ability of these CUs to reduce the rate of deforestation was analysed. Remotely-sensed data from Landsat and thematic coverages were used to measure deforestation inside all CUs in Rondonia. A more detailed analysis of CUs with the highest levels of deforestation, including an analysis between soil types and deforestation and a forecast of potential future deforestation, was conducted. The creation of conservation units in Rondonia has been useful in curbing deforestation within their boundaries; however, many CUs face pressure from the combined activities of illegal loggers, cattle ranchers and small-scale farmers seeking new sources of timber and agricultural land. For example, an exponential increase in the amount of deforestation was observed in Rondonia's Bom Futuro National Forest between 1992 and 2000. A regression model indicated a total of 20 500 ha deforested by 2002, while measurements from 2002 imagery showed an actual total deforestation of 20 720 ha. Should this trend persist, Bom Futuro National Forest could be completely deforested by 2017. CUs in Rondonia must be developed and implemented jointly by all stakeholders through the creation of partnerships between local communities, non-governmental organizations and government agencies.

Reconsidering land-cover change in the Brazilian savanna	GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL												The Cerrado, the tropical savanna covering 22% of Brazil's territory, or approximately 1.783 million km(2), has suffered significant human impacts during the past three decades. This paper re-examines estimates of Cerrado vegetation change dynamics using high-resolution satellite remote sensing data from an area of interest extracted from eastern Mato Grosso State. This region has undergone a high degree of typical agricultural development since the early 1970s. Results indicate significant loss of original vegetation as well as high levels of regeneration, suggesting Cerrado vegetation may be more resilient to human impacts than catastrophic estimations suggest. The paper concludes with a critical review of Cerrado land-cover change studies and the implications of evidence for vegetation regeneration, land-cover dynamism and land-use intensification, paying particular attention to spatial scale and research methods. The discussion concludes that Cerrado land-cover change studied at a higher resolution and larger scales (smaller area) is required to represent more effectively the complexity of land conversion for better assessment of human impacts and environmental policy.																	0016-7398					JUN	2005	171		2				99	111		10.1111/j.1475-4959.2005.00153.x								WOS:000230553200001

Large mammal populations are difficult to census and monitor in remote areas. In particular, elephant populations in Central Africa are difficult to census due to dense forest, making aerial surveys impractical. Conservation management would be improved by a census technique that was accurate and precise, did not require large efforts in the field, and could record numbers of animals over a period of time. 2. We report a new detection technique that relies on sensing the footfalls of large mammals. A single geophone was used to record the footfalls of elephants and other large mammal species at a waterhole in Etosha National Park, Namibia. 3. Temporal patterning of footfalls is evident for some species, but this pattern is lost when there is more than one individual present. 4. We were able to discriminate between species using the spectral content of their footfalls with an 82% accuracy rate. 5. An estimate of the energy created by passing elephants (the area under the amplitude envelope) can be used to estimate the number of elephants passing the geophone. Our best regression line explained 55% of the variance in the data. This could be improved upon by using an array of geophones. 6. Synthesis and applications. This technique, when calibrated to specific sites, could be used to census elephants and other large terrestrial species that are difficult to count. It could also be used to monitor the temporal use of restricted resources, such as remote waterholes, by large terrestrial species.

A RULEBASE PHYSIOGRAPHIC CHARACTERIZATION OF A DROUGHT PRONE WATERSHED APPLYING REMOTE SENSING AND GIS	PHOTONIRVACHAK-JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Efficient micro-watershed management needs characterization of it to optimize natural resources, which is especially important in drought prone areas. In the present study micro-watersheds of Gandheshwari tributary in Chotta-Nagpur Plateau are characterized based on physiographic properties towards agricultural potentiality. An algorithm interpolating elevation values using an empirical formula is proposed to obtain an improved Digital Elevation Model (DEM). IRS LISS-III Satellite data is used to acquire important parameters like landuse/landcover and drainage. Image processing techniques like edge enhancement, edge detection, and principal components analysis are used for improving lineament detection. For characterization of watershed landform analysis using physiographic parameters is done in Geographic Information System (GIS). Detailed drainage network obtained from satellite image, the improved DEM and other GIS layers of land based information are used to delineate micro-watersheds. The Agricultural Hydrologic Response Units (AHRU) targeting agricultural use of the land are derived by overlaying the delineated parameters and are grouped into thirty response units based on their agricultural potential. Micro-watersheds are characterized based on the dominant AHRU giving spatial information about agricultural suitability, emphasizing availability and scarcity of water so that respective water conservation practices can be improved to use the potential AHRU.																	0255-660X					JUN	2005	33	2					189	201										WOS:000207618300003

While the entire conservation programme in this region revolves around a network of protected areas (PAs), safeguarding the genetic exchanges amongst wildlife populations, located in spatially separated but biologically rich PAs, is a prerequisite for the longevity of these conservation areas. We present here the results of a new methodological framework that evaluates the potential of forested tracts for functioning as viable corridors between Kanha Tiger Reserve and Achanakmar Wildlife Sanctuary located in the states of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh respectively. We use I : 250,000 scale Indian remote sensing (IRS LISS-I) data to generate a detailed landuse map. The landscape suitability model is developed in GIS domain and is essentially based on two spatial characteristics of the landscape, viz. interspersion and juxtaposition, using landuse map. The landscape suitability model was refined by overlaying the human pressure map. The model underlines that a combination of moderate and highly suitable habitats can establish habitat connectivity between the two PAs. The model results are also substantiated by ground information collected from about 200 sample points across the forested landscape. We also identify a few forest patches and various management strategies that are critical for the viability of the entire corridor within the landscape.																	0011-3891					MAY 10	2005	88	9					1441	1448										WOS:000229402800030						
J	Daughtry, CST; Hunt, ER; Doraiswamy, PC; McMurtrey, JE				Daughtry, CST; Hunt, ER; Doraiswamy, PC; McMurtrey, JE			Remote sensing the spatial distribution of crop residues	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Management of plant litter or crop residues in agricultural fields is an important consideration for reducing soil erosion and increasing soil organic C. Current methods of quantifying crop residue cover are inadequate for characterizing the spatial variability of residue cover within fields and across large regions. Our objectives were to evaluate several spectral indices for measuring crop residue cover using ground-based and airborne hyperspectral data and to categorize soil tillage intensity in agricultural fields based on crop residue cover. Reflectance spectra of mixtures of crop residues, green vegetation, and soil were acquired over the 400- to 2500-nm wavelength region. High-altitude AVIRIS (Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) data were also acquired near Beltsville, MD, in May 2000. Broad absorption features near 2100 and 2300 nm in the reflectance spectra of crop residues were associated with cellulose and lignin. These features were not evident in the spectra of green vegetation and soils. Crop residue cover was linearly related to the cellulose absorption index, which was defined as the relative depth of the 2100-nm absorption feature. Other spectral indices for crop residue were calculated and evaluated. The best spectral indices were based on relatively narrow (10-50 nm) bands in the 2000- to 2400-nm region, were linearly related to crop residue cover, and correctly identified tillage intensity classes in > 90% of test agricultural fields. Regional surveys of soil management practices that affect soil conservation and soil C dynamics may be feasible using advanced multispectral or hyperspectral imaging systems.																	0002-1962					MAY-JUN	2005	97	3					864	871		10.2134/agrong2003.0291								WOS:000229388100029

It assesses the implications for bird conservation regionally and the scope for biodiversity assessments generally. Location A 200 km by 400 km area of farmland with seminatural and urban areas, covering south-eastern England. Methods Cluster analysis was used to link birds to landscapes. Cluster centroid coordinate values were processed to derive indices of bird-habitat preference. Further developments assessed the relative values of individual habitats for birds. Results Clustering objectively linked birds to landscapes. Maps of the clusters showed strong regional patterns associated with distinctive habitat assemblages. Derived indices related bird species directly to individual habitats and habitats to birds. Even rare species and scarce habitats showed successful linkages, often to each other. Objective corroboration strongly supported the associations of coastal, wetland, urban and woodland birds and habitats; but, it suggested that farmland birds, whose numbers have nearly halved since 1977, may prefer alternative habitats. Main conclusions Land cover maps from remote sensing provide an effective way to link birds to habitats and vice versa. Thus, generalized habitat maps might be used to extrapolate localized or sample-based bird observations or the results of autecological studies, helping to predict and understand bird distributions in the wider countryside. The weak links between farmland birds and farmland habitats in a region dominated by farming, suggests that reasons for the decline in farmland birds may be deep seated and thus hard to reverse. The procedures described are repeatable elsewhere and applicable more generally to evaluate landscapes and biodiversity. It is suggested that remote sensing could rarely be bettered as a means of assessing habitats, comprehensively, over wide areas, in most parts of the world.

Continuous land/sea terrain was mapped by merging Digital Elevation Models (DEM) with satellite-derived bathymetry. Benthic habitat characterizations were created by-unsupervised classifications of Landsat imagery clustered using field data, and produced maps with an estimated overall accuracy of > 75% (Tau coefficient > 0.65). These were merged with Geocover-LC (land use/land cover) data to create continuous land/sea cover maps. Image pairs from different dates were analyzed using Principle Components Analysis (PCA) in order to detect areas of change in the marine environment over two different time intervals: 2000 to 2001, and 1991 to 2003. This activity demonstrates the capabilities of Landsat imagery to produce continuous summit-to-sea maps, as well as detect certain changes in the shallow-water marine environment, providing a valuable tool for efficient coastal zone monitoring and effective management and conservation.																	0034-7744					MAY	2005	53			1			185	193										WOS:000230498900021	17465158					
J	Goparaju, L; Tripathi, A; Jha, CS				Goparaju, L; Tripathi, A; Jha, CS			Forest fragmentation impacts on phytodiversity - An analysis using remote sensing and GIS	CURRENT SCIENCE												The present study deals with the forest fragmentation of Vindhyan highlands in the Indian dry tropical forests. The fragmentation scenario has been quantified using remote sensing data and GIS techniques. The remotely sensed data-derived vegetation map was an input to the fragmentation analysis. Transects were laid to inventory along different forest patch sizes of various communities to study the biodiversity levels. It was observed that with changing fragment, there is change in biodiversity levels. Hence, patch size might play an important role in the regulation of biodiversity levels. This information may provide an insight into the conservation strategy formulation for the fragmented dry tropical area. The analysis has brought out that biodiversity levels are different in various fragments of different sizes. Small fragments are similar to each other in terms of species composition; similar is the case with large fragments in general. It was also found that the small and large fragments are dissimilar in terms of species composition. The diversity levels among the fragments of similar size class varied across the anthropogenic gradient. Analysis of species richness, diversity indices has helped in studying the patterns/levels of biodiversity in different fragment size classes along different levels of anthropogenic pressure. The merits of conserving the small and large fragments have been discussed.																	0011-3891					APR 25	2005	88	8					1264	1274										WOS:000228825100018

Mass conservation equations are solved for carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate material (PM2.5). Source emissions of trace gases and particles associated with biomass burning activities in tropical forest, savanna and pasture have been parameterized and introduced into the model. The sources are distributed spatially and temporally and assimilated daily using the biomass burning locations detected by remote sensing. Advection effects (at grid scale) and turbulent transport (at sub-grid scale) are provided by the RAMS parameterizations. A sub-grid transport parameterization associated with moist deep and shallow convection, not explicitly resolved by the model due to its low spatial resolution, has also been introduced. Sinks associated with the process of wet and dry removal of aerosol particles and chemical transformation of gases are parameterized and introduced in the mass conservation equation. An operational system has been implemented which produces daily 48-h numerical simulations (including 24-h forecasts) of CO and PM2.5, in addition to traditional meteorological fields. The good prediction skills of the model are demonstrated by comparisons with time series of PM2.5 measured at the surface.

J	Hilli, M; Kuitunen, MT				Hilli, M; Kuitunen, MT			Testing the use of a land cover map for habitat ranking in boreal forests	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Habitat loss and modification is one of the major threats to biodiversity and the preservation of conservation values. We use the term "conservation value" to mean the benefit of nature or habitats for species. The importance of identifying and preserving conservation values has increased with the decline in biodiversity and the adoption of more stringent environmental legislation. In this study, conservation values were considered in the context of land-use planning and the rapidly increasing demand for more accurate methods of predicting and identifying these values. We used a k-nearest neighbor interpreted satellite (Landsat TM) image classified in 61 classes to assess sites with potential conservation values at the regional and landscape planning scale. Classification was made at the National Land Survey of Finland for main tree species, timber volume, land-use type, and soil on the basis of spectral reflectance in satellite image together with broad numerical reference data. We used the number and rarity of vascular plant species observed in the field as indicators for potential conservation values. We assumed that significant differences in the species richness, rarity, or composition of flora among the classes interpreted in the satellite image would also mean a difference in conservation values among these classes. We found significant differences in species richness among the original satellite image classes. Many of the classes examined could be distinguished by the number of plant species. Species composition also differed correspondingly. Rare species were most abundant in old spruce forests (> 200 m(3)/ha), raising the position of such forests in the ranking of categories according to conservation values. The original satellite image classification was correct for 70% of the sites studied. We concluded that interpreted satellite data can serve as a useful source for evaluating habitat categories on the basis of plant species richness and rarity. Recategorization of original satellite image classification into such new conservation value categories is challenging because of the variation in species composition among the new categories. However, it does not represent a major problem for the purposes of early-stage land-use planning. Benefits of interpreted satellite image recategorization as a rapid conservation value assessment tool for land-use planners would be great.																	0364-152X					APR	2005	35	4					505	516		10.1007/s00267-003-0301-1								WOS:000229616700013	15902448

Location South-east Scotland, UK. Methods Fine-taxa vegetation data collected using point samples were used for a supervised classification of a Landsat 7 image, while linear regression was used to model vegetation height over the same image. Generalized linear models describing bird abundance were developed using field-collected bird and vegetation data. The satellite-derived vegetation data were substituted into these models and efficacy was examined. Results The accuracy of the classification was tested over both the training and a set of test plots, and showed that more common vegetation types could be predicted accurately. Attempts to estimate the heights of both dwarf shrub and graminoid vegetation from satellite data produced significant, but weak, correlations between observed and predicted height. When these outputs were used in bird abundance-habitat models, bird abundance predicted using satellite-derived vegetation data was very similar to that obtained when the field-collected data were used for one bird species, but poor estimates of vegetation height produced from the satellite data resulted in a poor abundance prediction for another. Conclusions This pilot study suggests that it is possible to identify moorland vegetation to a fine-taxa level using point samples, and that it may be possible to derive information on vegetation height, although more appropriate field-collected data are needed to examine this further. While remote sensing may have limitations compared with relatively fine-scale fieldwork, when used at relatively large scales and in conjunction with robust bird abundance-habitat association models, it may facilitate the mapping of moorland bird abundance across large areas.																	0305-0270					APR	2005	32	4					697	707		10.1111/j.1365-2699.2004.01187.x								WOS:000228017800012

In this paper, using information of forest cover from 1960 to 2000 derived from aerial photography and remote sensing data, we examine the dynamics associated with deforestation and secondary growth processes at the Chorotega region, Costa Rica. Our analysis is conducted using a comprehensive land capability map developed for the country. Our results indicate the occurrence of two well-defined land cover change processes over time. Extensive/intensive cattle ranching practices that contribute to significant forest degradation and forest cover loss characterize the first of these processes, occur-ring between 1960 and 1980. The second period (1980-2000) is characterized by a dynamic process of secondary forest growth resulting from a combination of internal and international market forces and conservation initiatives. Conclusions from this paper indicate that more attention needs to be paid to tropical secondary landscapes that are recuperating from years of constant degradation. This natural recovery process could be beneficial for biodiversity recovery, biological corridors and environmental services. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Pandey, VK; Panda, SN; Sudhakar, S				Pandey, VK; Panda, SN; Sudhakar, S			Modelling of an agricultural watershed using remote sensing and a geographic information system	BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING												In the present study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT2000) model was tested on daily, monthly and seasonal basis and applied to the Banikdih agricultural watershed, for the development of management scenarios for the prioritised sub-watersheds. The attributes of sub-watersheds, tributary channels and main channel in each sub-watershed were generated using the digital elevation model (DEM) and geographical information system (GIS)-based ArcView SWAT2000 interface. The model was calibrated and validated for monsoon season (June-September) of 1998 and 2000 and 2001, respectively. Calibration and validation results revealed that the model was predicting the daily, monthly and seasonal surface runoff and sediment yield satisfactorily. Nutrients such as organic nitrogen and organic phosphorus in the sediment and NO3-N and soluble phosphorus in the runoff were also considered for model validation. Observed and simulated mean values of. organic nitrogen, organic phosphorus, NO3-N and soluble phosphorus showed close agreement. Irrespective of the fertiliser level, the disc plough, mouldboard plough and field cultivator yielded about 22, 15 and 8% more sediment, respectively, as compared to conventional tillage. The sediment yield for zero tillage and conservation tillage were found to be 11 and 5% less, respectively, as compared to the conventional tillage. In comparison to conventional tillage, the NO3-N losses in zero tillage and conservation tillage were found to be up to 10-78 and 4.91% less, respectively, in all the fertiliser treatments, where as the field cultivator, mouldboard plough and disc plough increased the NO3-N losses up to 14-22, 18-96, and 44-79%, respectively. The soluble P losses increased as fertilised doses increased. As compared to conventional tillage, the losses of soluble P were increased from 19 to 40% with disc plough and decreased up to 14% with mouldboard plough. Poor availability of phosphorus in the watershed resulted losses of soluble P within permissible limit. As the fertiliser dose increased, the loss of organic N was also increased, which might be due to higher rate of the mineralisation, where as organic P was decreased, which might be due to the reduction in immobilisation. After zero tillage, the conservation tillage performed better in all the fertiliser treatments, as per loss of organic N and P is concerned. (c) 2004 Silsoe Research Institute.

J	Andrefouet, S; Guzman, HM				Andrefouet, S; Guzman, HM			Coral reef distribution, status and geomorphology-biodiversity relationship in Kuna Yala (San Blas) archipelago, Caribbean Panama	CORAL REEFS												Most of the knowledge of the reef geomorphology and benthic communities of Kuna Yala coral reefs (Caribbean Panama) comes from the western side of the archipelago, a few tens of kilometers around Punta San Blas (Porvenir). To bridge the gap between Porvenir and the Colombia-Panama border, we investigated with Landsat images the extent and geomorphological diversity of the entire Kuna Yala to provide geomorphologic maps of the archipelago in 12 classes. In addition to remote sensing data, in situ survey conducted in May-June 2001 provided a Kuna Yala-wide first synoptic vision of reef status, in terms of benthic diversity (number of species of coral, octocorals, and sponges) and reef health (coral versus algal cover). For a total reef system estimated to cover 638 km(2) along 480 km of coastline, 195 km(2) include coral dominated areas and only 35 km(2) can be considered covered by corals. A total of 69 scleractinian coral, 38 octocoral, and 82 sponge species were recorded on the outer slopes of reef formations, with a slightly higher diversity in the area presenting the most abundant and diverse reef formations (western Kuna Yala). Attempts to relate benthic diversity and geomorphological diversity provided only weak relationships regardless of the taxa, and suggest that habitat heterogeneity within geomorphological areas explain better the patterns of coral diversity. This study confirms the potential of combined remote sensing and in situ surveys for regional scale assessment, and we suggest that similar approaches should be generalized for reef mapping and assessment for other reef sites.																	0722-4028					MAR	2005	24	1					31	42		10.1007/s00338-004-0444-4								WOS:000227742400006

MAPPING AND CHARACTERIZATION OF INLAND WETLANDS USING REMOTE SENSING AND GIS	PHOTONIRVACHAK-JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Sustainable management of wetland ecosystem is necessary as it serves the important functions such as food storage, water quality maintenance and providing habitat for different species of wildlife. Hence, an inventory of wetlands in any given area is a pre-requisite for their conservation and management. A study has been carried out to delineate the wetlands of east Champaran district of Bihar, India, using IRS 1D LISS III data. The data for the pre and post monsoon seasons have been analysed and the wetlands have been qualitatively characterized based on the turbidity and aquatic vegetation status. The extent of water logging problem in the study area was inferred from the seasonal variation of waterspread during both the seasons. The three categories of wetlands (ponds/lakes, water logged areas and oxbow lakes) have been identified. From the analysis, it has been observed that the inland wetlands constitute 2.7% of the study area, of which 1.8% is subjected to water logging. Thus, this study highlights the usefulness of remotely sensed data for wetland mapping, seasonal monitoring and characterization.

SOIL EROSION MODELING USING MMF MODEL - A REMOTE SENSING AND GIS PERSPECTIVE	PHOTONIRVACHAK-JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Hardly any part of the world has remained unchanged since the arrival of the species Homo sapiens including the mountain ecosystems. Himalayan physiographic unit of India in due course has become populated and is tolerating all kinds of human interventions. Soil erosion in this region has been identified as a major problem due to both natural and anthropogenic factors. Remote sensing and Geographical Information system (GIS) techniques hold great promises in the assessment and conservation of natural resources including the surface soil. The major objective of the present study was to apply a process based model to quantify soil erosion and to prioritize the sub-watershed on this basis. The sub-watershed located at Jakhan rao area of Western Dun in lower Himalayan belt was taken as the test site for the study at 1 : 50,000 scale. Deforestation, unscientific agricultural practices, terrace farming, cattle grazing and land degradation in the sub-watershed are some of the anthropogenic factors causing soil erosion in the area. Here, MMF model was used for estimation of soil erosion by incorporating layers derived from both remote sensing and ancillary data. IRS 1C LISS III satellite data was used for the preparation of land use map that was used to derive RD map, BD map and K map. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) provided slope map, an intermediate layer used in equation 6 to generate G map, and soil map provided MS map, BD map and K map. The above intermediate layers generated were then integrated in GIS domain to estimate the amount of soil erosion in the sub-watershed area. Results show high values 4572.333 kg/m(2) for G map, which depicted transport capacity of overland flow. Comparatively lower values 13.15, and 7.98 kg/m(2) were observed for F map, which depicted soil detachment by raindrop impact. The subtracted image of the aforesaid layers produced the real picture, where in the highest value 3.770 kg/m(2) was found in the midland region of the site. The crossed erosion map was then classified into different erosion classes for sub-watershed area. This study illustrates the applications of remote sensing and GIS techniques for soil erosion modeling.																	0255-660X					MAR	2005	33	1					165	176										WOS:000207618200022						
J	DeFries, R; Hansen, A; Newton, AC; Hansen, MC				DeFries, R; Hansen, A; Newton, AC; Hansen, MC			Increasing isolation of protected areas in tropical forests over the past twenty years	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Protected areas are one of the cornerstones for conserving the world's remaining biodiversity, most of which occurs in tropical forests. We use multiple sources of satellite data to estimate the extent of forest habitat and loss over the last 20 years within and surrounding 198 of the most highly protected areas (IUCN status 1 and 2) located throughout the world's tropical forests. In the early 1980s, surrounding habitat in the 50-km unprotected or less highly protected "buffers" enhanced the protected areas' effective size and their capacity to conserve richness of forest-obligate,species above the hypothetical case of complete isolation. However, in nearly 70% of the surrounding buffers, the area of forest habitat declined during the last 20 years, while 25% experienced declines within their administrative boundaries. The loss of habitat occurred in all tropical regions, but protected areas in South and Southeast Asia were most severely affected because of relatively low surrounding forest habitat in the early 1980s and high subsequent loss, particularly in dry tropical forests. The future ability of protected areas to maintain current species richness depends on integrating reserve management within the land use dynamics of their larger regional, settings.

J	Gillespie, TW				Gillespie, TW			Predicting woody-plant species richness in tropical dry forests: A case study from south Florida, USA	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Tropical dry forests are one of the world's most endangered forest types. Currently there are no comparative data on extent or levels of species richness for remaining forest fragments. This research identifies landscape metrics and spectral indices that can be applied at the stand and patch level to predict woody-plant species richness in tropical dry forests. This study was undertaken in 18 stands of tropical dry forest with nine sites in the Florida Keys and nine sites within an urban-agricultural matrix in mainland Florida, USA. Woody-plant species richness was quantified at the stand level (belt transects totaling 500 m(2)) and patch level (presence/absence data for 65 native tropical plants less than or equal to2.5 cm dbh) for all study sites. Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite images (pixel resolution 30 x 30 m) were used to assess the utility of landscape metrics (forest patch area, nearest neighbor distance, shape index, boundary complexity) and spectral indices (normalized-difference vegetation index [NDVI] for nine pixels and 500 pixels directly over transects, and all pixels in the forest patch area) for predicting stand- and patch-level species richness. The 18 stands of tropical dry forest sampled in this study included 4248 woody plants, representing 71 species. Islands in the Florida Keys had higher levels of woody-plant species richness than mainland sites. There was a significant positive relationship between mean NDVI for the nine pixels over each stand and stand species richness and a significant negative relationship between species richness and standard deviation of NDVI for nine pixels over each stand. The density of evergreen plants explained 66% of the variability in mean NDVI. At the patch level, forest patch area and mean NDVI at the stand, 500-pixel, and patch level were all positively associated with patch species richness. However, combining forest patch area with NDVI significantly improved the prediction of patch species richness. Results from this study support the species-energy theory at the level of a forest stand and patch and suggest that a first-order approximation of woody-plant species richness in stands and patches of tropical dry forest is possible in biodiversity hot spots.																	1051-0761					FEB	2005	15	1					27	37		10.1890/03-5304								WOS:000227120700003

Wetlands constitute a significant environmental system, since they incorporate unique habitats with endemic and migrant species and therefore contribute to the conservation of high global biodiversity. However, they suffer from degradation because of the intensification of agriculture, the increase in pollution rates and poor water management practices. This study attempts to develop a methodology by combining GIS applications, remote-sensing techniques and physically based hydrologic modelling for the formation of water management plans in lake catchments. This methodology has been tested in Trichonis Lake catchment, in Western Greece, where the endangered calcareous fens habitat undergoes great ecological stresses due to the irrational use of local water resources. The first results indicated that the particular methodology operated efficiently. The suggested scenario has been adopted by the local water authorities and the significant water level fluctuations observed in the past have been eliminated to approximately 25% in the initial implementation period.

J	Hladnik, D				Hladnik, D			Spatial structure of disturbed landscapes in Slovenia	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING					International Conference on Disturbed Landscapes - Analysis, Modeling and Valuation	SEP 24-27, 2002	Cottbus, GERMANY					On the basis of land use maps, remote sensing techniques and GIS a spatial model was established to determine landscape types in Slovenia, specifically core areas of the primary forest and spatial structure of agricultural areas with intensive agricultural production. Forest and forested landscapes in Slovenia encompass 72% of the country's surface area. Using the spatial model, open space without forest patches, hedgerows and remnants of natural vegetation was observed in 44% of the area designated as farmland with intensive agricultural production. Pomurje is the sole Slovenian macroregion in which agricultural landscape still prevails. Most forest patches and forest fragments in the central part of the Pomurje macroregion are isolated and have a minor depth of interior forest area. They represent the ecological infrastructure for sustainable management of the cultural landscape. Despite the low level of forest cover in the macroregion (27%), just 52% of the area of agricultural and urban land is located more than 150 m from forest edges, hedgerows, and remnants of the former natural vegetation. Human corridors, urban centers, and smaller, scattered settlements also affect the stability and processes sustained by these landscape elements. It is in such cases that this spatial model may prove to be an efficient tool for spatial planning and for assisting in the coordination of different land users. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J	Turner, J; Klaus, R				Turner, J; Klaus, R			Coral reefs of the Mascarenes, Western Indian Ocean	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON SERIES A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES												The reefs of the Mascarenes differ in structure and stage of development. Mauritius is the oldest island, bound by a discontinuous fringing reef and small barrier reef, with large lagoon patch reefs. Rodrigues has nearly continuous fringing reefs bounding an extensive lagoon with deep channels and few patch reefs. Reunion, the youngest island, has short stretches of narrow fringing reefs along southwestern coasts. The islets of St Brandon are bound to the east by an extensive arc of fringing reef. Reef mapping of the Mascarenes using satellite imagery provides an estimate of 705 km 2 of shallow reef habitats. These areas have been modified over geological time by changes in sea level, ocean-atmosphere disturbances and biological and chemical forcing. Further modification has resulted from historical changes in land-use patterns. Recent economic development has placed many of these reefs at risk from anthropogenic impact. The reefs of the Mascarenes have escaped mass mortality from bleaching to date, which increases their conservation significance within the wider Indian Ocean. The reefs are poorly protected. A case study shows how a geographic information system incorporating reef-habitat maps can help formulate and demonstrate Marine protected Area boundaries.																	1364-503X					JAN 15	2005	363	1826					229	250		10.1098/rsta.2004.1489								WOS:000225970100021	15598634

Merr.). Soybean produces inadequate crop residue for soil conservation purposes in many production years. Crop residues left on the soil surface after harvest slow soil erosion rates. The CAI remote sensing technique was tested over field plots of conventional and large biomass soybean (LBS) with known above ground crop residue biomass and surface coverage. New LBS types are being bred and tested at the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC), Beltsville, Maryland, US, and can grow to heights of 1.8 m and produce increased amounts of crop residue compared to conventional cultivars. The highest performing LBS line for these traits provided 2963 kg/ha more crop residue biomass and provided a maximum increase of 42% more crop residue cover than the poorest performing conventional soybean. The comparison of LBS versus conventional soybean provided a wide range of soybean residue coverage for testing the CAI remote sensing algorithm. Spectrally derived CAI measures of crop residue were significantly associated with physical ground measurements of crop biomass at harvest and % cover after over wintering. Significant correlations were found between, the CAI and at harvest biomass (r(2) = 0.66), between, the CAI and the line point transect measurement (r(2) = 0.74), and between, CAI and the analysis of red-green-blue digital imagery (r(2) = 0.74) for measuring crop residue cover. These findings indicate that LBS can increase crop residue biomass and crop residue soil coverage by soybean litter and these factors can be detected by remote sensing methods in the field.

Four quantitative models that describe sage grouse breeding habitat selection were developed for multiple scales using logistic regression and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS-Salford Systems). Based on candidate models and AIC, important habitat predictor variables were elevation, distance to human development, slope, distance to roads, NDVI and distance to water, but not Sagebrush. Some predictors changed when using different scales and MARS. For the year 2011, a cumulative prediction index approach is presented on how the population viability of sage grouse can be assessed over time and space using Markov chain models for deriving future landscape scenarios and MARS for species predictions.																	0302-9743		3-540-25862-0				2005	3482						152	161										WOS:000229696900017

Ecosystem structure throughout the Brazilian amazon from Landsat observations and automated spectral unmixing	EARTH INTERACTIONS												The Brazilian Amazon forest and cerrado savanna encompasses a region of enormous ecological, climatic, and land-use variation. Satellite remote sensing is the only tractable means to measure the biophysical attributes of vegetation throughout this region, but coarse-resolution sensors cannot resolve the details of forest structure and land-cover change deemed critical to many land-use, ecological, and conservation-oriented studies. The Carnegie Landsat Analysis System (CLAS) was developed for studies of forest and savanna structural attributes using widely available Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite data and advanced methods in automated spectral mixture analysis. The methodology of the CLAS approach is presented along with a study of its sensitivity to atmospheric correction errors. CLAS is then applied to a mosaic of Landsat images spanning the years 1999 - 2001 as a proof of concept and capability for large-scale, very high resolution mapping of the Amazon and bordering cerrado savanna. A total of 197 images were analyzed for fractional photosynthetic vegetation (PV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and bare substrate covers using a probabilistic spectral mixture model. Results from areas without significant land use, clouds, cloud shadows, and water bodies were compiled by the Brazilian state and vegetation class to understand the baseline structural typology of forests and savannas using this new system. Conversion of the satellite-derived PV data to woody canopy gap fraction was made to highlight major differences by vegetation and ecosystem classes. The results indicate important differences in fractional photosynthetic cover and canopy gap fraction that can now be accounted for in future studies of land-cover change, ecological variability, and biogeochemical processes across the Amazon and bordering cerrado regions of Brazil.

J	Nilsen, EB; Herfindal, I; Linnell, JDC				Nilsen, EB; Herfindal, I; Linnell, JDC			Can intra-specific variation in carnivore home-range size be explained using remote-sensing estimates of environmental productivity?	ECOSCIENCE												Carnivore home-range sizes vary profoundly between populations within a species. One commonly cited reason for this is variation in prey population density and environmental productivity. However, obtaining reliable measures of prey density in the field is both time and effort consuming. Therefore, a methodology that enabled scientists and managers to extrapolate home-range sizes across areas would be a valuable tool. So far, the potentials of different remote-sensing indices to represent environmental productivity have been poorly evaluated in this context. In this study, we have evaluated the utility of a readily available remote-sensing index, the Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation absorbed by vegetation canopies (FPAR), to explain interpopulation variation in home-range size for 12 carnivore species. In multiple regression models, evaluated by the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), we found that the FPAR index added predictive power to the models for eight of the species. The explanatory power varied between 16% and 71% for the different species. We suggest that using remote-sensing indices such as FPAR to predict area specific home-range sizes for carnivores could potentially be a powerful tool, but that the methodology needs to be further developed in order to add more explanatory power for some species.

J	Patenaude, G; Milne, R; Dawson, TP				Patenaude, G; Milne, R; Dawson, TP			Synthesis of remote sensing approaches for forest carbon estimation: reporting to the Kyoto Protocol	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY												The Kyoto Protocol requires that signatory countries reduce their human-induced emissions of CO(2) by at least 5% below their emission levels of 1990 by 2008-2012. Parties ratifying the agreement are given the option to meet part of their reduction requirements through the conservation and enhancement of the carbon stored in forest ecosystems. To do this, they must estimate carbon stocks in 1990 and any changes since 1990 from all afforestation, reforestation and deforestation activities. In the UK, although some data are already available, the Protocol will require additional monitoring. To address this, we provide a quantitative assessment of remote sensing approaches for: (1) land cover discrimination to monitor deforestation; and (2) above-ground forest carbon stocks estimation. For land cover discrimination, both optical and radar remote sensing have been successful. For forest carbon stock monitoring, radar is most appropriate until LiDAR is made available from satellite platforms. While focusing on the requirements specific to the UK, our treatment is relevant for Parties having similar requirements. Finally, we stress the need for a synergetic use of approaches and for the launch of satellite missions designed especially for terrestrial carbon stock monitoring. We also highlight future requirements for improving the current forest inventory scheme. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Spatio-temporal information oil actual evapotranspiration (ET) helps users to better understand evaporative depiction and to establish links between land use. water allocation. and water use. Satellite-based measurements, used in association with energy balance models. can provide the spatial distribution of ET for these linkages. This paper describes the major principles of the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and summarizes its accuracy under several climatic conditions at both field and catchment scales. For a range of Soil wetness and plant community conditions, the typical accuracy at field scale is 85% for 1 day and it increases to 95% on a seasonal basis. The accuracy of annual ET of large watersheds was found to be 96% on average. SEBAL has been applied in more than 30 countries worldwide, and the 26 research studies that were conducted over the past 10 years are now gradually being replaced by application studies (17 studies finished). A short case Study in the Yakima River basin (Washington State) is presented as new material to demonstrate how ET from remote sensing can be used for evaluating water conservation projects.																	0733-9437	1943-4774				JAN-FEB	2005	131	1					85	93		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9437(2005)131:1(85)								WOS:000226431500008

However, the fact that home ranges can vary widely within a species makes data transfer between study areas difficult. Home ranges of Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx vary by a factor of 10 between different study areas in Europe. This study aims to try and explain this variation in terms of readily available indices of prey density and environmental productivity. On an individual scale we related the sizes of 52 home ranges, derived from 23 (9:14 male:female) individual resident lynx obtained from south-eastern Norway. with an index of density of roe deer Capreolus capreolus. This index was obtained from the density of harvested roe deer within the municipalities covered by the lynx home ranges. We found a significant negative relationship between harvest density and home-range size for both sexes. On a European level we related the sizes of 111 lynx (48:63 male: female) from 10 study sites to estimates derived from remote sensing of environmental productivity and seasonality. A multiple linear regression model indicated that productivity of the study site had a clear negative relationship with home-range size. At both scales, sex emerged as a significant explanatory variable with males having larger home ranges than than females. In addition, the size of male home-ranges increased faster with decreasing prey density than for females. These analyses support widely held predictions that variation in home-range size is due to variation in prey densiry.

J	Borghesio, L; Giannetti, F				Borghesio, L; Giannetti, F			Habitat degradation threatens the survival of the Ethiopian bush crow Zavattariornis stresemanni	ORYX												The Ethiopian bush crow Zavattariornis streseinanni is one of the most remarkable ornithological discoveries of the 20th century. It is restricted to an area of c. 5,000 km(2) in southern Ethiopia, and a large part of its range is protected inside Yabello Wildlife Sanctuary. We report on the results of roadside counts carried out in 1989, 1995 and 2003 showing that the population of the species has decreased by 80% during this time. By comparing two Landsat satellite images from 1986 and 2002, we highlight land cover trends within the range of the species. These include a general increase in bush density, probably related to increasing grazing pressure by domestic animals, fire suppression (only in the Sanctuary) and the disappearance of wild herbivores. Land cover trends differed between the Sanctuary and the area outside, where open areas expanded, apparently indicating an increase in agricultural exploitation. Satellite images also showed that, within its range, the bush crow selects areas having relatively open terrain. Our data suggest that the population decrease within the Sanctuary could be due to the encroachment of open savannah by dense bush and that, therefore, the Sanctuary has failed to protect the bush crow. More research is urgently needed to evaluate its conservation status outside the Sanctuary and the impact of human activities on the species.																	0030-6053					JAN	2005	39	1					44	49		10.1017/S0030605305000086								WOS:000226951300013						
J	Hernandez-Stefanoni, JL				Hernandez-Stefanoni, JL			Relationships between landscape patterns and species richness of trees, shrubs and vines in a tropical forest	PLANT ECOLOGY												The present study aims to identify and characterize the relationships among landscape structure and plant diversity in a tropical landscape forest in Quintana Roo, Mexico. Total species richness as well as that of trees, shrubs and vines species were identified from 141 sampling quadrats (16,543 individuals sampled). Based on vegetation classes obtained from multi-spectral satellite image classification, I constructed plant diversity maps of the landscape under study using stratified kriging. I calculated the mean number of species in individual patches as the average values of kriging estimates inside of each patch. I then explored the relationships between landscape pattern metrics and the species richness of trees, shrubs and vines, as well as all groups combined using regression analysis. I employed Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to select a set of candidate models. Based on akaike weights, I calculated model-averaged parameters. Results show that plant diversity of the patches depends on both the quality of the surrounding habitats and the proximity of surrounding patches (i.e., patch isolation).

We conducted a mammal survey in eucalypt woodlands near Darwin, and found very few mammals in an intact region of the study area. This is consistent with an emerging pattern suggesting that many mammal species are declining across northern Australia, even though habitats remain relatively intact. However, we also found apparently healthy populations of the same species in a fragmented region of the study area. Using a combination of remote sensing, GIS and generalised linear modeling, we found some evidence of relationships between fire regime, fire heterogeneity or vegetation heterogeneity and the distributions of mammal species in this area. However, there was a strong regional component of the distribution that is not explained by these variables. The cause of the lack of mammals in the intact region of the study area has not been revealed by this analysis. One possible reason for this failure is that the landscape variables used in the analysis were too fine to detect variation in mammal abundance occuring at a much courser regional scale.

J	Hernandez-Stefanoni, JL; Ponce-Hernandez, R				Hernandez-Stefanoni, JL; Ponce-Hernandez, R			Mapping the spatial distribution of plant diversity indices in a tropical forest using multi-spectral satellite image classification and field measurements	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												The relationships among alpha and beta diversity indices, computed from 141 randomly sampled quadrats, and the vegetation classes obtained by multi-spectral satellite image classification, were used as a strategy for mapping plant diversity in a tropical landscape mosaic. A relatively high accuracy of the land cover map was revealed by the overall accuracy assessment and the Cohen's Kappa statistic. Species accumulation models were used to evaluate how representative the sample size was of the different vegetation types. A standard one-way, between-subjects ANOVA confirmed a significant reduction of the within-class variance of plant diversity with respect to their total variance across the landscape. Computed uniformity indices, to assess the internal uniformity of vegetation classes on the diversity indices, confirmed the goodness of the mapped classes in stratifying variability of plant diversity. This allowed for the use of the mapped classes as spatial interpolators of plant diversity values for estimation and up-scaling purposes. Finally, it was revealed that the plant diversity of the landscape depends, to a large extent, on the diversity contained in the most mature forest class, which is also the most diverse community in the studied area. High and moderate beta diversity values between mature forests and both the secondary associations and the first stages of succession, respectively, indicated that there is a significant contribution to the diversity of the landscape by those vegetation classes.																	0960-3115					DEC	2004	13	14					2599	2621										WOS:000225468900002						
J	Kodandapani, N; Cochrane, MA; Sukumar, R				Kodandapani, N; Cochrane, MA; Sukumar, R			Conservation threat of increasing fire frequencies in the Western Ghats, India	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												The acceleration of processes such as forest fragmentation and forest fires in landscapes under intense human pressures makes it imperative to quantify and understand the effects of these processes oil the conservation of biodiversity in these landscapes. We combined information from remote-sensing, imagery and ground maps of all fires in the Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary (MWLS) in the Western Ghats of India over 14 years (1989-2002). These spatial data on fire occurrence were integrated with maps of vegetation types found in the MWLS to examine fire conditions in each. We calculated the average fire-return interval for. each of the vegetation types individually, and for the MWLS as a whole. Using vegetation data from the larger Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve and the entire Western Ghats region, we conservatively estimated fire frequency information for these larger regions. Because the MWLS does not contain tropical evergreen or montane forests, we were unable to estimate fire conditions in these fire conditions in these forest types, which represent 31% of all Western Ghats vegetation cover. For the MWLS, all vegetation types had average fire-return intervals of <7 years, and the sanctuary as a whole had a fire-return interval of 3.3 years. Compared with a 13-year MWLS fire data set from 1909-1921, this represents a threefold increase in fire frequency over the last 80 years. We estimated average fire-return intervals of roughly 5 years for both the larger Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve and the entire Western Ghats region. Given other recent reports, the estimated fire frequencies for the Western Ghats forests outside protected reserves are conservative. We conclude that the current fire regime of the Western Ghats poses a severe and persistent conservation threat to forests both within and outside protected reserves.

J	Luoto, M; Virkkala, R; Heikkinen, RK; Rainio, K				Luoto, M; Virkkala, R; Heikkinen, RK; Rainio, K			Predicting bird species richness using remote sensing in boreal agricultural-forest mosaics	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												One of the main goals in nature conservation and land use planning is to identify areas important for biodiversity. One possible cost-effective surrogate for deriving appropriate estimates of spatial patterns of species richness is provided by predictive modeling based on remote sensing and topographic data. Using bird species richness data from a spatial grid system (105 squares of 0.25 km(2) within an area of 26.25 km(2)), we tested the usefulness of Landsat TM satellite-based remote sensing and topographic data in bird species richness modeling in a boreal agricultural-forest mosaic in southwestern Finland. We built generalized linear models for the bird species richness and validated the accuracy of the models with an independent test area of 50 grid squares (12.5 km(2)). We evaluated separately the modeling performance of habitat structure, habitat composition, topographical-moisture variables and all variables in the model-building and model-test areas. Areas of high observed and predicted bird species richness in the boreal agricultural-forest mosaic were mainly concentrated along river valleys in the grid squares with a high habitat diversity and steep topography. This landscape type also has the highest cover of habitats important for nature conservation: seminatural grasslands, deciduous forests, and watercourses. The covers of deciduous forests and serninatural grassland were included as explanatory variables of the bird species richness model, although they both cover only about 5% of the land in the study area. When the four models were evaluated by fitting them to the model test area, the explanatory power of the topography-moisture model decreased clearly, whereas the habitat-composition, habitat-structure, and all-variables models were more rigorous. Finally, we extrapolated the models to the whole study area of 600 km(2) and produced bird species richness probability maps using GIS techniques. We conclude that, instead of scattered study plots in which birds are counted, predictive modeling requires large study areas where the variation within the whole landscape can be taken into account. A spatial grid system with several environmental variables derived from remote sensing data produces the most reliable data sets, which can be used when predicting species richness in other landscapes.

J	Kerr, JT; Deguise, I				Kerr, JT; Deguise, I			Habitat loss and the limits to endangered species recovery	ECOLOGY LETTERS												Canada is one of the last places on earth with extensive wilderness areas, yet the number of Canadian species threatened with extinction continues to rise every year. Using satellite-derived land use data, we find that habitat loss explains most of the variation in numbers of endangered species across Canada. Habitat loss within species ranges is, therefore, likely to be the leading factor inhibiting their recovery. We measured habitat loss individually within the known ranges of 243 terrestrial species at risk of extinction across Canada. Recovery potential, as measured by extent of natural habitat within each species' range, is bimodally distributed, but less than 50% of the range of the majority of Canada's species at risk is natural habitat and there is no detectable habitat remaining for 16 of the 243 species at risk. There were no differences in the recovery potential of species categorized either by threat level (special concern, threatened, or endangered) or taxon. Despite having extensive wilderness areas, Canada has similar rates of endangerment to other countries in the Americas, underlining the effect of severe habitat loss to intensive agriculture that has occurred in Canada's most biologically diverse regions. Improvements to protected areas networks and especially cooperative conservation activities with private landowners will do the most to improve the recovery prospects of species at risk in Canada.																	1461-023X					DEC	2004	7	12					1163	1169		10.1111/j.1461-0248.2004.00676.x								WOS:000225078000006

Spectral information obtained through remote sensing observations makes possible the evaluation of Woodland Caribou habitat use over large areas. With the use of Global Positioning System (GPS) collars fitted on the animals, correlations between satellite observations and Woodland Caribou locations were studied. This study examines Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper imagery of the Wabasca region of northern Alberta in relation to a dataset containing nearly 100000 locations acquired from GPS radio-collars and approximately 5000 locations acquired from Very High Frequency (VHF) radiocollars. The intent was to determine if spectral signatures measured by remote sensing satellites could be related to habitat use or avoidance by caribou, and to use this knowledge to predict caribou habitat selection in areas where there are no collared animals. The analysis presented in this paper provides a new perspective for the analysis of large and complex habitat selection datasets and opens new opportunities for the implementation of better and more comprehensive conservation policies in boreal environments. The methodology and habitat associations presented in this paper are being used in northern Alberta to advance caribou conservation.

Much of the current discussion centered around comparisons of management regimes can be traced to a dearth of cross-site quantitative evaluations, Remote sensing provides a particularly effective tool for this purpose, yet analysis of remotely sensed data requires fieldwork to interpret human activities and the socioeconomic and political contexts that relate to land cover change. This paper examines the effect of establishment of the Celaque National Park, Honduras, and the Royal Chitwan National Park buffer zone, Nepal, on limiting deforestation. In Celaque, the park itself has been largely successful in maintaining forest cover. However, recent changes in land use patterns have led to increasing pressure on the park boundaries, exacerbated by the lack of involvement of local residents. In the Royal Chitwan National Park, in contrast, participatory approaches towards co-management have been implemented over the past decade in the park buffer zone. With significant incomes derived from ecotourism, complete protection of the buffer zone forest has been adopted, leading to significant regrowth of tree cover. However, local decision-making power is limited, and buffer zone management has largely proven successful due to the investment and support provided by international donor agencies. These two case studies demonstrate the utility of remote sensing and Geographical Information Systems analysis in providing a spatiotemporal perspective for assessing management policies. They also demonstrate the importance of fieldwork to provide a nuanced understanding of the socioeconomic and institutional conditions affecting the outcomes of forest management regimes.

J	Ravan, S; Kale, M; Roy, PS				Ravan, S; Kale, M; Roy, PS			Identification of potential sites for in situ conservation of landraces associated with forest ecosystem - Geomatics approach	CURRENT SCIENCE												Landraces may be defined as a locally adapted strain of a species bred through traditional methods of direct selection. There has been a continuous threat to these landraces due to outcrossing, migration of cultivators to the urban areas and replacement of high yielding varieties with traditional crops. Among many reasons to conserve forest ecosystem, landraces can be one of the important reasons, which focuses on protecting agro-biodiversity existing in the vicinity of forest ecosystem. One of the important observations was that, these landraces were present in proximity of forest areas where forest floor litter serves as source of manure. So it is implicit that without forests these crops cannot sustain. Forest floor litter, which is generally abundant in the study area, is gradually converted to humus, which during rainy seasons goes down-streams to agricultural areas. No chemical fertilizers are used for growing these crops. Since mapping of landraces using remote sensing data is difficult, an alternative approach is proposed for 'Mapping Potential Land Race Zone' rather than delineating agricultural patches. Land races are governed largely by terrain complexity and remoteness of villages. This information coupled with land-use land cover map provides basis to perform multi criteria modeling, thus helping in identifying potential land race zones.																	0011-3891					OCT 25	2004	87	8					1115	1122										WOS:000224925100027						
J	Southworth, J; Nagendra, H; Carlson, LA; Tucker, C				Southworth, J; Nagendra, H; Carlson, LA; Tucker, C			Assessing the impact of Celaque National Park on forest fragmentation in western Honduras	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												The effectiveness of parks as management regimes is much in debate. This study examines the effect of establishment of the Celaque National Park, Honduras, in 1987, on limiting deforestation through a comparison with the surrounding landscape using remote sensing, GIS and landscape pattern analysis. Pressure on the park region is found to relate spatially to the locations of towns and roads, with increasing deforestation in the landscape surrounding the park. In contrast, the park has been largely successful in maintaining forest cover. Although the extent of change within the park is not pronounced, the pattern of change is. Expansion of agriculture and coffee production have led to increasing pressure on the park boundaries, with as much as 25% of the landscape surrounding the park experiencing land cover change between 1996 and 2000. This has significant implications for the future of the park. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mingjiang valley plays an important role in water and soil resources conservation and erosion control in the upper Yangtze River. In this paper, the influence of vegetation type on hydrological processes at the landscape scale was studied using remote sensing and spatial analysis in Mingjiang valley and its five catchments. First, the vegetation distribution was mapped with high accuracy using three scenes of Landsat thematic mapper (TM) imagery and the optimal iterative unsupervised classification method. Then the spatial precipitation and actual evapotranspiration (AET) database was developed by converting the point-based data of meteorological stations to spatial surface with spatial interpolation. Cross-tabulation spatial analysis was employed to study the relationship between vegetation and rainfall, evaporation, and runoff. The results show that dominant vegetation types are grasslands, forests, and shrublands in the Mingjiang valley, with the proportions of 37.44%, 29.97%, and 22.62%, respectively. The annual precipitation ranges from 560 to 720 mm in areas of conifer and mixed forests, shrublands, and grasslands. For broadleaf forests, croplands, and other vegetation types, the precipitation distribution ranges from 480 to 800 mm, indicating a broader variation than that for the dominant vegetation type. In high-precipitation regions of the valley, forest vegetation covers the largest area. The precipitation is positively correlated with vegetation cover. We found that AFT has a nonlinear relationship with vegetation cover, but this relationship is complicated. Our results demonstrated that the relative evapotranspiration rate (ER) is negatively correlated with precipitation, and water remaining (WR) is positively correlated with precipitation in the landscape. From the hydrological records in the Mingjiang valley, the annual mean runoff is 502 m(3). s(-1), the mean annual runoff amount is 140 x 10(9) m(3), and the annual runoff rate is 0.0213 in m(3).s(-1). km(-2). We found that percent forest cover is positively correlated with percent runoff. This supports the results of previous nonspatial investigation in the valley. From scale analysis, we found that most spatial patterns of climate and hydrological variations are scale dependent, e.g., precipitation, AET, ER, WR, and runoff vary at different levels of landscape scales.

Surface features caused by historic sites under ground can be recorded with color and infrared film and digital multi-spectral, hyper-spectral, and synthetic aperture radar imagery. Several previously unknown underground features were visible in the processed imagery, and were subsequently confirmed with archaeological excavations. In this paper the use of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing in Archeology will be investigated with the support of documents of Fifth World Archeology Congress (WAC5) 2003, Session of "Remote Sensing for Archeology".

J	Chust, G; Ducrot, D; Pretus, JLL				Chust, G; Ducrot, D; Pretus, JLL			Land cover discrimination potential of radar multitemporal series and optical multispectral images in a Mediterranean cultural landscape	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The aim of the present study is (1) to evaluate the performances of two series of European Remote Sensing (ERS) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images for land cover classification of a Mediterranean landscape (Minorca, Spain), compared with multispectral information from Systeme Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) sensors, and (2) to test the synergy of SAR and optical data with a fusion method based on the Demspter-Shafer evidence theory, which is designed to deal with imprecise information. We have evaluated as a first step the contribution of multitemporal ERS data and contextual methods of classification, with and without filtering, for the discrimination of vegetation types. The present study shows the importance of time series of the ERS sensor and of the vectorial MMSE (minimum mean square error) filter based on segmentation for land cover classification. Fifteen land cover classes were discriminated (eight concerning different vegetation types) with a mean producer's accuracy of 0.81 for a five-date time series within 1998, and of 0.71 for another four-date time series for 1994/1995. These results are comparable to those from SPOT XS images: 0.69 for July, 0.67 for October (0.85 for July plus October), and also from TM data ( 0.81). These results are corroborated by the kappa coefficient of agreement. The fusion between the 1994 series of ERS and XS (July), based on a derived method of the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, shows a slight improvement on overall accuracies: +0.06 of mean producer's accuracy and +0.04 of kappa coefficient.

J	Thoma, DP; Gupta, SC; Bauer, ME				Thoma, DP; Gupta, SC; Bauer, ME			Evaluation of optical remote sensing models for crop residue cover assessment	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Measurement of crop residue cover over large areas is useful for monitoring conservation tillage adoption, assessing carbon sequestration potential and erosion modeling. This study was designed to test the accuracy of crop residue estimates in current Tillage Transect Surveys, and to test the feasibility of predicting crop residue cover based on data recorded by Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite scenes. A total of 468 corn and/or soybean fields in 11 Minnesota counties were characterized for residue cover in the course of three sampling campaigns coinciding in time with satellite scene acquisition. Results showed that Tillage Transect Survey estimates were correct for 49 percent to 74 percent of fields when either five or two categories were used in classification respectively. Regression analysis showed a strong positive relationship between percent soybean residue cover and ETM+ bands 1, 3, and 7 (r(2) = 0.66) and between percent corn residue and ETM+ bands 4, 5 and 7 (r(2) = 0.44). Three additional indices based on satellite digital numbers, the Soil Tillage Index, Normalized Difference Index, and Normalized Difference Tillage Index had coefficients of determination between 0.02 and 0.56 for corn and soybean residues. The Crop Residue Index Multiband model, a more physically based model, correctly predicted residue cover categories for 30 to 64 percent of fields when five or two categories were used in classification respectively. We conclude that remote-sensing techniques had accuracy as good or better than Tillage Transect Surveys estimates when residue cover classifications were decreased to two categories (0 to 30 percent, and >30 percent). Since residue cover information is primarily needed to assess the extent of two categories, conservation and conventional tillage, remote sensing with Landsat imagery provides a means of sampling every field with an efficient, economical and uniform methodology.																	0022-4561					SEP-OCT	2004	59	5					224	233										WOS:000224721100014

Remote sensing data supported by field investigations was used to generate land-use and soil maps. Present relationships between soils and associated land cover/use are analysed and patterns in these relationships are identified using GIS techniques. Relationships observed on the basis of a priori knowledge of the area and the available statistics are compared and these relationships in the field and through interviews with farmers are correlated. This allows three land-use analysis objectives to be formulated: crop management improvement; crop selection; and conservation. The results can be used to focus the efforts of planning and extension services in the area. The method was tested using a participatory rural appraisal in eighteen villages in which the areas for the three land-use analysis objectives were identified. The findings are that the areas identified for crop management improvement require knowledge about management practices for a specific crop to optimize yield and water use. Most areas identified for crop selection are occupied by smallholder subsistence farmers with insufficient water for irrigation, and a lack of contact with the extension service. In these areas, identifying suitable crops to minimize risk and allow subsistence for the resource-poor farmers may be the priority. In areas identified for conservation the question to be addressed is whether to grow a crop at all, or to encourage alternative activities.

J	Lourie, SA; Vincent, ACJ				Lourie, SA; Vincent, ACJ			Using biogeography to help set priorities in marine conservation	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Biogeographic information has great potential to enhance systematic conservation planning, although it has yet to be routinely incorporated in marine situations. Fundamental differences between marine and terrestrial environments (physical, biological, and sociopolitical) mean that biogeographic data are harder to obtain for marine systems, biogeographic boundaries more difficult to define, and the outcomes of similar conservation approaches may differ Despite these challenges, an understanding of spatial context, connections, and scales of processes is needed to set conservation priorities that ensure the representation and continued persistence of species and habitats within functioning ecosystems. As we discovered in our review, scientific knowledge of marine systems is increasing rapidly thanks to recent advances in genetics, remote sensing, and geographical information systems. Such knowledge and tools have important implications for marine planning. We also reviewed the degree to which biogeography is incorporated into current marine conservation projects at spatial scales ranging from global to local. Overall, initiatives are becoming more regional in scope and incorporating biogeographic data in an increasingly rigorous manner However, initiatives that use few or no data are also on the rise and need to be treated with due caution. We recommend undertaking global and regional reviews within biogeographic frameworks; combining analytical approaches to determine biogeographic classifications and to define a range of potential conservation areas with stakeholder involvement to set priorities; understanding contemporary processes that maintain species distributions; and acquiring knowledge of historical distributions to provide appropriate baselines for current conservation. The urgent need for marine conservation, however, means that planning should proceed with the best currently available biogeographic information even while biogeographic research continues.																	0888-8892					AUG	2004	18	4					1004	1020		10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00137.x								WOS:000222979400022						
J	Cushman, SA; McGarigal, K				Cushman, SA; McGarigal, K			Hierarchical analysis of forest bird species-environment relationships in the Oregon Coast Range	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Species in biological communities respond to environmental variation simultaneously across a range of organizational levels. Accordingly, it is important to quantify the effects of environmental factors at multiple levels on species distribution and abundance. Hierarchical methods that explicitly separate the independent and confounded influences of environmental variation across several levels of organization are powerful tools for this task. Our study used a hierarchical approach to partition explained variance in an Oregon Coast Range bird community among plot-, patch-, and landscape-level factors. We used a series of partial canonical ordinations to decompose species-environment relationships across these levels of organization to test four hypotheses about the importance of environmental control over community structure. We found that plot-level factors were better predictors of community structure than patch- or landscape-level factors. In addition, although landscape-level variables contributed substantial independent explanatory power, there was little evidence that patch-level environmental variability provided additional explanation of community structure beyond that provided by plot- and landscape-level factors. At higher levels of the hierarchical analysis, we found that, among plot-level factors, vegetation cover type was as powerful a predictor of community structure as detailed floristics, and more powerful than vegetation structure. At the landscape level, we found that landscape composition and configuration both provided substantial independent explanatory power, with landscape composition being the better overall predictor. Our results have a number of implications for sampling, analysis, and conservation. For example, misleading results could be obtained by studies conducted at a single organizational level. Also, the high degree of confounding among several levels of our analysis suggests that there is a lack of independence between the influences of environmental structure at different organizational levels. Due to this confounding, our results suggest that patch-based studies of forest-bird ecological relationships in the Oregon Coast Range may be equivocal. In addition, the power of mapped cover class as a plot-level predictor variable suggests that coarse-filter, multiscale approaches utilizing remote sensing and GIS may be nearly as effective at predicting local patterns as expensive field surveys of habitat conditions at the plot level, and more effective at predicting patterns continuously across large regions.																	1051-0761					AUG	2004	14	4					1090	1105		10.1890/03-5131								WOS:000223156600012

There are substantial problems in directly transferring remote sensing approaches from terrestrial systems to the subtidal marine environment because of differences in sampling technologies and interpretation. At present, seafloor remote assessments tend to produce habitats predominantly based oil sediment type and textural characteristics, with benthic communities often showing a high level of variability relative to these habitat types. Yet an integration of information on both the physical features of the seafloor and its ecology would be appropriate in many applications. In this study, data collected from a multi-resolution nested survey of side-scan, single-beam sonar and video are used to investigate a bottom-up approach for integrating acoustic data with quantitative assessments of subtidal soft-sediment epibenthic communities. This approach successfully identified aspects of the acoustic data, together with environmental variables, that represented habitats with distinctly different epibenthic communities. The approach can be used, regardless of differences in data resolution, to determine location- and device-specific relationships with the benthos. When such relationships can be successfully determined, marine ecologists have a tool for extrapolating from the more traditional small-scale sampling to the scales more appropriate for broad-scale impact assessment, management, and conservation.

The difficult cases for soil surfaces are with exponential correlation functions when the surfaces have fine-scale structures of large slopes. The difficulty for ocean surfaces is that because the emissivities are close to that of a flat surface, the emissivities have to be calculated accurately to correctly assess the rough-surface effects. In this paper, the accuracies of emissivity calculations are improved by using Rao-Wilton-Glisson basis functions. We further use sparse matrix canonical method to solve the matrix equation of Poggio-,NIiller-Chang-Harrington-Wu integral equations. Energy conservation checks are provided for the simulations. Comparisons are made with results from the pulse basis function. Numerical results are illustrated for soil and ocean surfaces respectively with exponential correlation function and ocean spectrum. The emissivities of soil are illustrated at both L- and C-bands and at multiple incidence angles for the same physical roughness parameters. The brightness temperatures for ocean surfaces are illustrated for cases with various wind speeds. We compare results with those from the sparse matrix methods. Comparisons are also made with experimental emissivity measurements of soil surfaces. Parallel computation is also implemented. Lookup tables of emissivities based on NMM3D are provided.

Land cover information from digital orthophoto quarter quadrangles (DOQQ), and enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+) were analyzed for the years 1990, 1995, and 2000. The corresponding infiltration excess runoff response of the study area was estimated using the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Natural Resources Conservation Service Curve Number (NRCS-CN) method. A digital elevation model (DEM)/GIS technique was developed to predict stream response to runoff events based on the travel time from each grid cell to the watershed outlet. A comparison of predicted to observed stream response shows that the model predicts the total runoff volume with an efficiency of 0.98, the peak flow rate at an efficiency of 0.85, and the full direct runoff hydrograph with an average efficiency of 0.65. The DEM/GIS travel time model can be used to predict the runoff response of ungaged watersheds and is useful for predicting runoff hydrographs resulting from proposed large scale changes in the land use.

J	Bird, M; Chua, S; Fifield, LK; Teh, TS; Lai, J				Bird, M; Chua, S; Fifield, LK; Teh, TS; Lai, J			Evolution of the Sungei Buloh-Kranji mangrove coast, Singapore	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												The mangroves from Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve to Kranji Dam represent the largest intact mangrove forest left on mainland Singapore. Mangroves colonized the area around 6820 BP, as sea level rose following the last glacial maximum and a variable thickness of Holocene sands, muds and peats (generally similar to1 to >3.8 m thick) were deposited over the pre-transgression land surface. An analysis of a time series of photographs covering the period from 1946 to 2001 has revealed major changes in the distribution of mangroves in the area resulting from development-induced changes in the local hydrodynamic regime and clearance for aquaculture. Mangroves covered 117.3 ha in the study area in 1946 and were actively advancing over the coastal mudflats until 1980. Despite the addition of 6.24 ha from mangrove colonization, the total area covered by mangroves was reduced by similar to50% by 1980 due to clearance for aquaculture. Following 1980, a reduction in sediment supply possibly due to the construction of the Kranji Dam, immediately cast of the study area, led to the initiation of erosion along much of the coastline, with the mangrove fringe having retreated by up to 50 m in 2001. Establishment of the wetland reserve in 1992 enabled the partial regeneration of mangroves in the area to 86.8 ha, 25% less than in 1946. Three areas of undisturbed old growth mangroves >55 years in age have been identified and are considered to be of high conservation value. Two of these areas are within the current boundaries of the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, but are located along coastal areas that are undergoing severe erosion. The third area is located in the south of the study area, protected from coastal erosion, but outside the current nature reserve boundary and hence is susceptible to loss as a result of future development. This third area is possibly the oldest undisturbed fragment of mangrove forest on mainland Singapore. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The present paper describes a methodology to estimate plant diversity involving landscape structure as a proportional weight associated with different plant communities found in the landscape mosaic. The area occupied by a plant community, its patch number or its spatial distribution of patches are variables that could be expressed in gamma plant diversity of a territory. The methodology applies (1) remote sensing information, to identify land cover and land use types; (2) aspect, to discriminate composition of plant communities in each land cover type; (3) multi-scale field techniques, to asses plant diversity; (4) affinity analysis of plant community composition, to validate the stratified random sampling design and (5) the additive model that partitions gamma diversity into its alpha and beta components. The method was applied to three Spanish rural areas and was able to record 150-260 species per ha. Species richness, Shannon information index and Simpson concentration index were used to measure diversity in each area. The estimation using Shannon diversity index and the product of patch number and patch interspersion as weighting of plant community diversity was found to be the most appropriate method of measuring plant diversity at the landscape level.

J	Mulley, BG; Unruh, JD				Mulley, BG; Unruh, JD			The role of off-farm employment in tropical forest conservation: labor, migration, and smallholder attitudes toward land in western Uganda	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The potential for off-farm employment (OFE) to contribute significantly to forest conservation in the tropics is a widely held logic among donors, governments, and social scientists. While an aggregate level examination of OFE cases can support this logic, there is disagreement as to the operative aspects of specific linkages and assumptions. This study examines the case of the tea industry in western Uganda, and uses a combination of fieldwork and remote sensing to pursue a more nuanced examination of the role of migration and non-monetary aspects of OFE on forest conservation in both a national park and unprotected forest contexts. Results indicate that the tea industry does serve as an off-farm employer to a limited number of local smallholders but these benefits are offset by the industry's overwhelming dependence on migrant labor which sees OFE as temporary, then seeks to settle locally. There is also evidence that the tea industry is contributing to conservation efforts of Kibale National Park by unintentionally serving as a physical buffer zone, which inhibits both human encroachment on the park and wildlife encroachment on smallholder crops. The latter represents a site-specific phenomenon that holds much potential for future management plans of the area and exemplifies the importance of considering the site-specific circumstances associated with OFE development.

J	Fan, JR; Zhang, JH; Zhong, XH; Liu, SZ; Tao, HP				Fan, JR; Zhang, JH; Zhong, XH; Liu, SZ; Tao, HP			Monitoring of soil erosion and assessment for contribution of sediments to rivers in a typical watershed of the Upper Yangtze River Basin	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												An assessment of the effectiveness of soil conservation practices is very important for watershed management, but the measurement over a small area does not necessarily represent the truth over a large area. Monitoring of soil erosion and analysis of sediment delivery were carried out in the Lizixi watershed (which is typical of the Upper Yangtze Basin, China), using remote sensing and a geographic information system (GIS). Land-use and land-cover maps were prepared by an interpretation of 1986 and 1999 images from SPOT and Landsat TM. Slope-gradient maps were created from digital elevation model (DEM), while merged images of SPOT and Landsat TM were used to obtain land-use information. The area of soil erosion was classified by an integration of slope gradients, land-use types and vegetation cover rates, and soil erosion rates and their changes were calculated in a grid-based analysis using an Erdas GIS. The change in sediment delivery ratio was estimated based on the changes in soil erosion rates from both monitoring and the truth survey. There was a reduction in soil erosion rate of 4.22 per cent during a 13-year period after soil conservation practices were adopted in the Lizixi watershed. The amount of sediments transported into rivers has decreased by 51.08 per cent during the same period due to an integrated application of biological and engineering measures. The comparison of soil erosion severity between pre-conservation and post-conservation revealed that soil loss has been obviously diminished and the measures were quite effective.

Conventional-colour and colour-infrared aerial photographs were taken in spring and summer on three olive farms of 75-100 ha, from a plane at 1525 m above the ground. Images (scale 1:10,000) were digitized, georeferenced and processed. Twenty-six selected vegetation indexes were assayed for land-use discrimination. Early summer was the most suitable time to distinguish between cover crops and olive trees. Conventional-colour was more adequate and economic than infrared photography. Indexes based on blue and red wavelength reflectivity values divided by combinations of several reflectivity values were suitable for cover crop and olive tree discrimination. Selected vegetation indexes allowed for the cover crop areas to be estimated at 32.50% of the 100.5 ha total farm surface, with an estimated accuracy of 91.9 +/- 1.4%. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The level of landslide hazard is not only dependent on storm and land physical attributes, human activities, especially agriculture practices, are also important considerations. Hurricane Mitch was one of the strongest hurricanes of the 20th century; it generated intense rain that triggered widespread landslides and flooding throughout Honduras and Nicaragua. The objective of this study was to develop and test a heuristic approach for predicting spatial distribution of landslide hazard. Four variables, slope, aspect, stream proximity, and land cover type, generated from available topography and remote sensing data, were used in the model. This model was developed and verified in southern Honduras based on data from the Namasigue watershed and validated in the adjacent El Triunfo watershed. Results of GIs analyses showed that the likelihood of landslide was significantly influenced by slope and land cover. As slope increased, the percentage of land affected by landslides, when the soils were saturated, increased sharply on land used for crop production, indicating that agricultural activity and the associated removal of deep-rooted permanent vegetation increased the landslide hazard on steep sites. Consequently, sites covered by shrub fallow and forests had relatively low incidence of landslides regardless of the topographic features. The model was effective in predicting landslide hazard and generating landslide hazard maps; this model has been found to be a useful aid for soil and water conservation organizations in the region to target conservation investment.

Many applications such as agriculture, flood forecasting, urban development, and wetland conservation require routine monitoring of hydrological parameters. As hydrological resources are dynamic, timely information is essential for the accuracy required in these applications. The increased repeat time and larger spatial coverage of remote sensing tools give water resource managers up-to-date information over their areas of interest. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been successfully utilized to monitor hydrological parameters because of its sensitivity to moisture. Polarimetric SAR systems provide many dimensions of information as polarization images can be synthesized from the phase information. The Canada Centre for Remote Sensing has been involved with numerous research projects aimed at developing SAR techniques for monitoring hydrological resources. Four main hydrological features are discussed: soil moisture, snow, wetlands, and flooding.																	0703-8992					JUN	2004	30	3					470	483		10.5589/m03-073								WOS:000223256100024						
J	Parra, JL; Graham, CC; Freile, JF				Parra, JL; Graham, CC; Freile, JF			Evaluating alternative data sets for ecological niche models of birds in the Andes	ECOGRAPHY												Ecological niche modeling (ENM) is an effective tool for providing innovative insights to questions in evolution, ecology and conservation. As environmental datasets accumulate, modelers need to evaluate the relative merit of different types of data for ENM. We used three alternative environmental data sets: climatic data, remote-sensing data (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and elevation data, to model the distribution of six bird species of the genus Grallaria in the Ecuadorian Andes. We assessed the performance of models created with each environmental data set and all possible combinations by comparing the geographic predictions of our models with detailed maps developed by expert ornithologists. Results varied depending on the specific measure of performance. Models including climate variables performed relatively well across most measures, whereas models using only NDVI performed poorly. Elevation based models were relatively good at predicting most sites of expected occurrence but showed a high over-prediction error. Combinations of data sets usually increased the performance of the models, but not significantly. Our results highlight the importance of including climatic variables in ENM and the simultaneous use of various data sets when possible. This strategy attenuates the effects of specific variables that decrease model performance. Remote-sensing data, such as NDVI, should be used with caution in topographically complex regions with heavy cloud-cover. Nonetheless, remote-sensing data have the potential to improve ENM. Finally, we suggest a priori designation of modeling purposes to define specific performance measures accordingly.

J	Kerr, JT; Cihlar, J				Kerr, JT; Cihlar, J			Patterns and causes of species endangerment in Canada	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Few studies have addressed patterns and causes of species endangerment at different resolutions and geographical extents. Using newly developed remote sensing and species distribution data sets, we examined the influence of both natural and anthropogenic factors on the density of terrestrial endangered species in Canada at two spatial scales. The first was at a national extent and the second was within a region of Canada (the mixed wood plains) where there are particularly large numbers of endangered species. We also examined the distribution of protected areas throughout Canada to determine their capacity to shelter endangered species. Land use, which is measured by 1-km resolution satellite data, is a strong predictor of endangered species densities at both scales of analysis. Land use integrates information on habitat loss to agriculture and land use intensity, an index of agricultural pollution. The amount of protected area in a region is unrelated to endangered species numbers except to the extent that areas with the most endangered species are, at best, nearly devoid of protected area. Newly legislated protections for endangered species are unlikely to bring much improvement to this conservation dilemma. Canada's endangered species legislation promotes cooperative conservation activities in areas where species endangerment is most pronounced but does little to protect remaining habitat.																	1051-0761					JUN	2004	14	3					743	753		10.1890/02-5117								WOS:000222174000010

However, compared to overstorey, information about understorey vegetation distribution is scant, available mainly over small areas or through imprecise large area maps from tedious and time-consuming field surveys. A practical approach to classifying understorey vegetation from remote sensing data is needed for more accurate habitat analyses and biodiversity estimates. As a case study, we mapped the spatial distribution of understorey bamboo in Wolong Nature Reserve (southwestern China) using remote sensing data from a leaf-on or growing season. Training on a limited set of ground data and using widely available Landsat TM data as input, a nonlinear artificial neural network achieved a classification accuracy of 80% despite the presence of co-occurring mid-storey and understorey vegetation. These results suggest that the influences of understorey vegetation on remote sensing data are available to practical approaches to classifying understorey vegetation. The success here to map bamboo distribution has important implications for giant panda conservation and provides a good foundation for developing methods to map the spatial distributions of other understorey plant species.

This research points out the relevance of spatially explicit habitat models as an essential part of a decision support system for lake shore management. The Great Reed Warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus L.) was selected as a key species of aquatic reed structures. Many results of investigation about breeding behaviour of this German Red List species are available. The factors of selecting a breeding range were modelled in a Geographic Information System (GIS) using indices that quantify the corresponding spatial characteristics of patches in the ecosystem (e.g. shape complexity or distance to other vegetation structures). A habitat suitability map was created for a nature conservation area at Lake Constance, Germany. The observed breeding places in the investigation area showed a great coincidence with the modelled habitat ranges. This modelling approach of integrating spatial indicators is an important basis to provide automated monitoring systems based on remote sensing methods.																	0075-9511					MAY	2004	34	1-2					132	139		10.1016/S0075-9511(04)80032-X								WOS:000222030800018

Remote sensing techniques were applied for this classification, employing an ASTER satellite image from October 2002. The whole region was classified into 6 land cover types, relevant to the application of habitat mapping for the kiang. The classes are: grassland, shrubland, bar water bodies, snow cover, and agriculture and settlement. The area of each land cover type was tabulated to give a general picture of the land cover situation. Habitat information was collected mostly from the literature and partially from a field visit. GIS tools for spatial analysis were used to identify the suitability of the habitat in the region. The whole region was classified into 3 different suitability levels, ie primary, secondary, and non-suitable, based on use and potential use by the species in the particular area. The region with suitable habitats was delineated so that any further conservation activities related to kiang habitat can be concentrated within this boundary a : a management implication.

J	Rushton, SP; Ormerod, SJ; Kerby, G				Rushton, SP; Ormerod, SJ; Kerby, G			New paradigms for modelling species distributions?	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. The management of both desirable and undesirable species requires an understanding of the factors determining their distribution. Quantitative distribution models offer simple methods for formulating the species-habitat link and the means not only for predicting where species should occur, but also for understanding the factors involved. Generalized linear modelling, in particular, links the incidence of species to habitat variables, and has increasingly formed the backbone of the modelling approaches used. New 'data technologies', such as remote sensing and geographical information systems, have further broadened these modelling applications to almost any ecological system and any species for which there are distribution data. 2. Many previous approaches have aimed to identify the most parsimonious model with the best suite of predictors, selected on the basis of null hypothesis testing. However, information-theoretic approaches based on Akaike's information criterion allow the selection of a best approximating model or a subset of models from a set of candidates. Information-theoretic approaches require a deeper understanding of the biology of the system modelled and may well become an improved paradigm for species distribution modelling. 3. Synthesis and applications. This special profile of six papers demonstrates the development in methodology used in species distribution modelling. The papers show how information-theoretic approaches can be coupled with emerging data technologies to address issues of conservation significance. With conservation biology and applied ecology at the forefront of many of the basic science developments so far, we expect these methods to pervade other areas of ecological research more fully in future.

J	Amar, A; Arroyo, B; Redpath, S; Thirgood, S				Amar, A; Arroyo, B; Redpath, S; Thirgood, S			Habitat predicts losses of red grouse to individual hen harriers	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Hen harriers Circus cyaneus prey on red grouse Lagopus l. scoticus and high breeding densities of harriers can limit the number of grouse available for shooting in the autumn. Ultimately, grouse hunting contributes to the maintenance of heather moorland, an ecologically important habitat for biodiversity in general and hen harriers in particular. Predation rates vary widely among harrier individuals. Understanding which factors influence this variation would be useful to target management to mitigate the effect of harriers on grouse, such as diversionary feeding. 2. We used a simple habitat-based approach to test whether we could identify harrier nests to which most grouse were delivered. Using remote sensing habitat data, we tested whether delivery rates of dead grouse to the nest by hen harriers were higher for those pairs nesting in sites with more heather Calluna vulgaris. A relationship between heather cover and grouse delivery rates might have been expected as grouse densities were correlated with heather cover. 3. After adjusting for annual variation in grouse abundance, the rate at which grouse were delivered to harrier nests was positively associated with the proportion of heather cover within 2 km of harrier nests. This was primarily due to the positive effect of heather cover on female delivery rates. 4. This result allowed us to use habitat data to predict the harrier nests to which most grouse chicks would be delivered. Comparison of predictions of the model with observations of food delivery to nests indicated that, in terms of grouse chick delivery, the model correctly predicted the top 50% of harrier nests in five of six years. 5. We undertook an experiment where carrion was provided to certain harriers at nest sites, in order to decrease their predation on grouse. Data from this experiment showed that when harriers were given diversionary food, the relationship between grouse predation rate and habitat was removed, with grouse predation reduced to negligible levels in most cases. This demonstrated the increased benefit of feeding birds with the highest proportion of heather cover within 2 km of their nest sites, rather than feeding birds at random within the conflict population. 6. Synthesis and applications. The amount of heather cover around hen harrier nests can be used to predict which pairs will predate most grouse within a population. This information should facilitate targeted management practices, which may accrue greater benefit for grouse stocks and potentially reduce the conflict between grouse shooting and conservation of biodiversity.

J	Zhao, B; Kreuter, U; Li, B; Ma, ZJ; Chen, JK; Nakagoshi, N				Zhao, B; Kreuter, U; Li, B; Ma, ZJ; Chen, JK; Nakagoshi, N			An ecosystem service value assessment of land-use change on Chongming Island, China	LAND USE POLICY												Chongming Island is the world's largest alluvial island. Its coastal wetland and tidal flats provide many important ecological services including buffers against tidal surges and staging areas for migratory birds. Due to its extraordinary resources, scenic qualities, and its proximity to the city of Shanghai 45 km away, the island is also an attractive tourist destination, and it supports important agricultural and fisheries economies. Yet, large-scale land reclamation projects that are severely affecting these ecosystems have been implemented. In this paper, we report an investigation of changes in land use and ecosystem services on Dongtan (East Beach of Chongming Island) between 1990 and 2000. We used three LANDSAT TM and/or ETM data sets to estimate changes in the size of five land-cover/land-use categories, and we also used previously published value coefficients to estimate changes in the value of ecosystem services delivered by each land category. Finally, we ranked the contribution of various ecosystem functions to the overall value of the ecosystem services. We determined that the total value of ecosystem services in Dongtan declined by 62% from $ 316.77 to 120.40 million per year between 1990 and 2000 (totaling $855.26-981.85 million over 10-years). This massive decrease is largely attributable to the 71% loss of wetlands/tidal flats. Our sensitivity analysis suggested that these estimates were relatively robust. We also found that the contribution of water regulation, water supply, waste treatment, and raw materials increased, while the contribution of nutrient cycling, food production, disturbance regulation, recreation, habitat/refugia, and biological control decreased during the 10-year time period. We conclude that future land-use policy formulation should give precedence to the conservation of these ecosystems over uncontrolled reclamation, and that further land reclamation should be based on rigorous environmental impact analyses.

J	Suleiman, A; Crago, R				Suleiman, A; Crago, R			Hourly and daytime evapotranspiration from grassland using radiometric surface temperatures	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Determination of evapotranspiration (E) is needed for many applications in agriculture, hydrology, and meteorology. The spatial variability of leaf area index (LAI) and soil water availability makes it impractical to model E over heterogeneous lands using ground-based techniques. Remote sensing can be a good source for both LAI and radiometric surface temperature (T-s) estimates. However, remotely sensed soil moisture content is not suitable for E prediction. In this study, we propose a procedure to estimate E using T,. The method uses a dimensionless temperature Delta(T), defined as (T-s - T-a)/(T-max - T-a) where T-a is the air temperature and T-max is the surface temperature that would occur if all the net radiation (R.) was converted to sensible heat flux and no evaporation occurred. This approach has been tested on data from two grassland sites in Oklahoma and Kansas. Root mean square differences between hourly predicted and measured E ranged from 30 to 50 W m(-2). The slope and r(2) for the zero-intercept linear regression between hourly estimated and measured E ranged from 1.01 to 1.37 and 78 to 0.94, respectively. Daytime conservation of evaporative fraction (EF = E/R-n) was used to extrapolate from hourly to daytime E. The slope and r(2) of the linear regression between daytime estimated and measured E ranged from 0.89 to 1.07 and 0.69 to 0.9, respectively. These results demonstrate that, for grassland, the model may give good estimates of E when T-a and T-s are available.																	0002-1962					MAR-APR	2004	96	2					384	390		10.2134/agronj2004.0384								WOS:000220382200008

The research method was based on (i) recording land cover characteristics by means of a vegetation indicator, and (ii) classifying and mapping coastal wetlands utilizing a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image of Cukurova Deltas in Turkey. Vegetation characteristics of various habitats, such as sand dunes, salt marshes, salty plains and afforestation areas, were identified by field surveys. A Landsat TM image of 4 July 1993 was preprocessed and then classified using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithm and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). As a result of this supervised classification, the land cover types were classified with a largest accuracy of 90.2% by ANN. The classified satellite sensor imagery was linked to vegetation and bird census data, which were available through literature in a Geographical Information System (GIS) environment to determine the spatial distribution of plant and bird biodiversity in this coastal wetland. The resulting data provide an important baseline for further investigations such as monitoring, change detections and designing conservation policies in this coastal ecosystem.																	0960-3115					MAR	2004	13	3					615	633		10.1023/B:BIOC.0000009493.34669.ec								WOS:000187427000009						
J	Yagoub, MM				Yagoub, MM			Monitoring of urban growth of a desert city through remote sensing: Al-Ain, UAE, between 1976 and 2000	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The objective of this article is to investigate the development of Al Ain city, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), between 1976 and 2000, with particular reference to the space-time relationship. Al Ain is the fastest changing city in the Arabian Peninsula. It has gone from a desert oasis to a thriving modern city in just over 30 years. Maps, colour aerial photographs, satellite imagery, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Geographical Information System (GIS) were used as an aid for understanding the development of the city. Change and development in the city is evident from comparison of old maps, aerial photographs, and satellite imagery taken during 1976, 1978, 1984, 1994, 1998 and 2000. The city was found to have a tendency for major expansion in the direction of the west and south-west. Expansion in any direction was found to be governed by the availability of utilities (water, electricity), economic activities along roads (agriculture, industry), geographical constraints (valleys, sand dunes, mountains), and legal factors (boundary with Sultanate of Oman, planning and institutional rules). Many cities around the world are developed at the cost of agricultural areas, which are the main source of food. For example, in Tempe, Arizona between 1970 and 1979 and in Cairo. However, in Al Ain the research concludes that the development is based on conservation of agricultural areas (oases) and reclamation of the desert. Revenue from oil is a significant drive for this development, but even more important is the determination of the UAE government to proceed with the development.					Yagoub, M.

J	Coops, NC; White, JD; Scott, NA				Coops, NC; White, JD; Scott, NA			Estimating fragmentation effects on simulated forest net primary productivity derived from satellite imagery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Conversion of native forests to agriculture and urban land leads to fragmentation of forested landscapes with significant consequences for habitat conservation and forest productivity. When quantifying land-cover patterns from airborne or spaceborne sensors, the interconnectedness of fragmented landscapes may vary depending on the spatial resolution of the sensor and the extent at which the landscape is being observed. This scale dependence can significantly affect calculation of remote sensing vegetation indices, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and its subsequent use to predict biophysical parameters such as the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by forest canopies (fPAR). This means that simulated above-ground net primary productivity (NPPA) using canopy radiation interception models such as 3-PG (Physiological Principles for Predicting Growth), coupled with remote sensing observations, can yield different results in fragmented landscapes depending on the spatial resolution of the remotely sensed data. We compared the amount of forest fragmentation in 1 km SPOT-4 VEGETATION pixels using a simultaneously acquired 20m SPOT-4 multi-spectral (XS) image. We then predicted NPPA for New Zealand native forest ecosystems using the 3-PG model with satellite-derived estimates of the fPAR obtained from the SPOT-4 VEGETATION sensor, using NDVI values with and without correction for fragmentation. We examined three methods to correct for sub-pixel fragmentation effects on NPPA. These included: (1) a simple conversion between the broad 1 km scale NDVI values and the XS NDVI values; (2) utilization of contextural information from XS NDVI pixels to derive a single coefficient to adjust the 1 km NDVI values; and (3) calculation of the degree of fragmentation within each VEGETATION 1 km pixel and reduce NDVI by an empirically derived amount based on the proportional areal coverage of forest in each pixel. Our results indicate that predicted NPPA derived from uncorrected 1 km VEGETATION pixels was significantly higher than estimates using adjusted NDVI values; all three methods reduced the predicted NPPA. In areas of the landscape with a large degree of forest fragmentation (such as forest boundaries) predictions of NPPA indicate that the fragmentation effect has implications for spatially extensive estimates of carbon uptake by forests.

J	Symeonakis, E; Drake, N				Symeonakis, E; Drake, N			Monitoring desertification and land degradation over sub-Saharan Africa	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												A desertification monitoring system is developed that uses four indicators derived using continental-scale remotely sensed data: vegetation cover, rain use efficiency (RUE), surface run-off and soil erosion. These indicators were calculated on a dekadal time step for 1996. Vegetation cover was estimated using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The estimation of RUE also employed NDVI and, in addition, rainfall derived from Meteosat cold cloud duration data. Surface run-off was modelled using the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) model parametrized using the rainfall estimates, vegetation cover, land cover, and digital soil maps. Soil erosion, one of the most indicative parameters of the desertification process, was estimated using a model parametrized by overland flow, vegetation cover, the digital soil maps and a digital elevation model (DEM). The four indicators were then combined to highlight the areas with the greatest degradation susceptibility. The system has potential for near-real time monitoring and application of the methodology to the remote sensing data archives would allow both spatial and temporal trends in degradation to be determined.

J	Wallace, JF; Caccetta, PA; Kiiveri, HT				Wallace, JF; Caccetta, PA; Kiiveri, HT			Recent developments in analysis of spatial and temporal data for landscape qualities and monitoring	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Monitoring biodiversity presents the challenge of informing complex aspects of biological systems with consistent, repeatable, data-based indicators. The present paper does not address directly the selection of indicators for rangeland biodiversity, but rather presents essential aspects and examples of monitoring systems that address natural resource questions at comparable scales. In general, concepts of landscape quality, such as range condition, conservation value, health and biodiversity, are descriptive rather than quantitative and are either ill-defined or multiply defined. Assessment of the status of such indicators involves value systems, as well as process understanding at a range of scales for which data are often unavailable. Effective monitoring systems, in contrast, require repeated quantitative data at suitable temporal density and spatial scale, as well as appropriate methods and a conceptual framework to simplify and interpret these data. In recent years, broad-scale operational monitoring systems for land and vegetation have been developed in Australia based on sequences of satellite data, digital elevation models, ground information and appropriate statistical methods. These same datasets have been used to inform landscape qualities over broad areas; examples are given of the production of salinity risk maps and conservation management zones based on fragmentation patterns. These results have been achieved as a partnership between ecologists, resource scientists and statisticians and illustrate how surrogates for integrated concepts such as biodiversity can be derived from available data.

Precipitation, topographic, soil, and land use data were collected, processed, and constructed into a spatial database using GIS and remote sensing data. Areas that had suffered soil erosion were analysed and mapped using the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE). The factors that influence soil erosion are rainfall erosivitiy (R) from the precipitation database, soil erodibility (K) from the soil database, slope length and steepness (LS) from the topographic database, and crop and management (C) and conservation supporting practices (P) from the land use database. Land use was classified from Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite images. The soil erosion map verified use of the landslide location data. Landslide locations were identified in the Boun area from interpretation of aerial photographs and field surveys.

J	Niemi, GJ; McDonald, ME				Niemi, GJ; McDonald, ME			Application of ecological indicators	ANNUAL REVIEW OF ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS												Ecological indicators have widespread appeal to scientists, environmental managers, and the general public. Indicators have long been used to detect changes in nature, but the scientific maturation in indicator development primarily has occurred in the past 40 years. Currently, indicators are mainly used to assess the condition of the environment, as early-warning signals of ecological problems, and as barometers for trends in ecological resources. Use of ecological indicators requires clearly stated objectives; the recognition of spatial and temporal scales; assessments of statistical variability, precision, and accuracy; linkages with specific stressors; and coupling with economic and social indicators. Legislatively mandated use of ecological indicators occurs in many countries worldwide and is included in international accords. As scientific advancements and innovation in the development and use of ecological indicators continue through applications of molecular biology, computer technology such as geographic information systems, data management such as bioinformatics, and remote sensing, our ability to apply ecological indicators to detect signals of environmental change will be substantially enhanced.																	1543-592X						2004	35						89	111		10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.35.112202.130132								WOS:000226244100004						
J	Vigilante, T; Bowman, DMJS				Vigilante, T; Bowman, DMJS			Effects of fire history on the structure and floristic composition of woody vegetation around Kalumburu, North Kimberley, Australia: a landscape-scale natural experiment	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Indigenous landscape burning is practiced around remote communities in the Kimberleys but has been replaced by wildfires across uninhabited areas. A landscape-scale natural experiment was established to investigate the effects of these different fire histories ( derived from a 10-year Landsat remote-sensing sequence) on the floristic structure and composition of woody vegetation within and among three of the major vegetation types on three landscape types (sandplain, sandstone and volcanics) near Kalumburu in the North Kimberley bioregion. Substrate factors determine vegetation and associated fire patterns within the landscape such that each landscape type needs to be examined independently. Basalt soils are dominated by an open savanna and tend to have very high fire frequencies. Basalt vegetation showed few significant response variables to fire-history parameters. The total density of woody stems showed no significant relationship to fire-history variables, regardless of size class. The 0-2.0-m size class of Erythrophleum chlorostachys (F.Muell.) Baillon showed significant (P < 0.005) responses to the various interactions involving all three fire-history variables, indicating that seedling density is sensitive to fire. Sandplain is dominated by open woodland, with relatively low fire frequency. Total stem density, shrub density and the densities of Grevillea agrifolia Cunn. Ex R. Br., Canthium sp. A and Stenocarpus cunninghamii R. Br. showed strong positive ( P < 0.005) relationships with the total number of fire-free months. In sandstone, the density of all woody stems, acacias and a range of mid-storey trees showed significant positive relationships with the total number of fire-free months. Other species showed strong relationships with the number of late dry season fires. Vegetation thickening was evident in sand environments through the accumulation of woody stems in fire-free years and in sandstone through the promotion of 'fireweeds' such as Acacia gonocarpa F. Muell. after fire events. Mid-storey tree species capable of resprouting after fire showed some evidence of structural suppression in response to frequent fire events, including Planchonia careya (F. Muell.) Knuth, Persoonia falcata R. Br. and Buchanania obovata Engl. Results are discussed in the context of indigenous landscape burning and biodiversity conservation.

Measuring Spatial and Vertical Heterogeneity of Grasslands Using Remote Sensing Techniques	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS												Grassland heterogeneity, defined by its components of spatial pattern, vertical structure, and species composition, is one of the most important indicators of prairie habitat. Maintaining grassland under conservation without disturbance may result in homogeneity at multiple spatial scales that could reduce wildlife diversity as a consequence. Therefore, monitoring grassland conditions that contribute to diversity can be critical for wildlife habitat and ecological integrity. Remote sensing, with multi-spatial, multi-spectral, and multi-temporal resolutions plus newly developed analytical techniques, provides a potential tool for measuring grassland heterogeneity under different management regimes quickly, efficiently, and at low cost. The objectives of this study were 1) to evaluate the heterogeneity of grassland under grazing and conservation management practices spatially and vertically. and 2) to investigate the feasibility of using remotely sensed data to measure grassland heterogeneity. The study area was Grasslands National Park of Canada and its surrounding pastures. Field data were collected in the 1999 growing season by measuring the grassland vertical profile in a fixed spatial array. A Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image was acquired for the same year. A grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture analysis was applied to the Landsat ETM+ imagery to compare the grasslands under grazing and those under the conservation practice. The results derived from field measurement show that the variation of vertical structures of grasslands differ significantly under grazing and conservation management regimes. Optical remote sensing data could detect the spatial variation of grasslands under these two management practices. Texture analysis is effective at 15 in resolution, which confirmed other studies that grassland heterogeneity is at about 15 meter.																	1726-2135	1684-8799				JAN	2004	3	1					24	32		10.3808/jei.200400024								WOS:000207620100002						
J	Chust, G; Pretus, JL; Ducrot, D; Ventura, D				Chust, G; Pretus, JL; Ducrot, D; Ventura, D			Scale dependency of insect assemblages in response to landscape pattern	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Patches and their boundaries are sensitive to the scale at which they are viewed. The response of species to patchiness may depend on the resolution and on the extent by which the spatial pattern is perceived. The goal of this paper is to identify the scale at which forest spatial pattern causes changes in species richness and abundances of Dipteran and Homopteran species as a whole, and further on their distinctive ecological functional groups. Using remotely-sensed optical imagery, we described the landscape structure surrounding sampling sites. We used two approaches to deal with the problem of the scale of observation: 1) variation of extent using a multiscale analysis, and 2) comparison of two satellite sensors with different spatial resolutions (SPOT: 20 x 20 m, and Landsat TM: 30 x 30 m). The relationship between entomological data and landscape descriptors at different spatial scales was tested with the Mantel test, redundancy analysis and stepwise multiple linear regression. Relative abundances of Homopteran species were affected by landscape patterns at finer scales than in Diptera. The strength of response to landscape was different for each Dipteran functional group. The multiscale analysis also enabled the optimal scale (6.25 ha) of landscape pattern, accounting for 62% of the variation in Homopteran richness, to be identified. As a practical application, Homopteran richness was mapped by extrapolation of the regression function to the pixels of the image. Multiscale analysis provides an alternative view of fragmentation effects, which are traditionally studied through the patch-based approach, and highlights the importance of scale in ecological processes. The detection of optimal scales and the use of satellite images enable maps of important biotic indicators to be drawn up.

Fire scar maps, discriminated by means of 30-60 m resolution remote sensing imagery, have been used as a source of fire occurrence. We employ several visual or analytical approaches to interpret fire occurrence in this region, such as those of Minnich and Chou (1997), Ricotta et al. (2001) or Krummel et al. (1987). Crucial spatial patterns such as fire size distribution, fire frequency distribution, spots and residual vegetation islands are documented. In addition, several geographical layers were overlaid with burned area maps in order to determine interactions between fire occurrence and environmental parameters such as altitude, slope, solar radiation, and burned land cover. Assuming that fire occurrence is well determined by such a posteriori empirical factors we detect areas most prone to fire in this region and aim to enhance the local forest management and conservation plans.

J	Treitz, P; Rogan, J				Treitz, P; Rogan, J			Remote sensing for mapping and monitoring land-cover and land-use change	PROGRESS IN PLANNING												Information about land cover and land use is a very important component of the planning process as it can contribute to the debate on the current arrangements and patterns and the need to modify land use as part of a regional plan, a resource development or management project, an environmental planning exercise, or as a baseline study of a region. Planners may seek to suggest modifications to land-use patterns to achieve some social or economic outcomes, or as part of an environmental conservation or sustainability project, or to avoid some predicted future unwanted consequences. Access to accurate land-use maps can assist planners and the enterprise of planning. It is in this context that remote sensing is able to contribute. The purpose of this monograph is to present an overview and critique of the growing field of remote sensing as it applies to the mapping and monitoring of land-cover and land-use at a range of spatial and temporal scales. The ability of remote sensing to contribute to the mandate of planners and managers has changed significantly over the last decade. Satellite data are now available that can be used to map and monitor change from continental to local scales and over daily to weekly temporal scales. With the recent launch of satellites capable of collecting data that is comparable to aerial platforms, there is an enhanced capability of identifying change at small spatial scales. Similarly, advances in image processing, database management and spatial analysis tools have enhanced our ability to analyse these data for depicting land-cover and land-use change. Here, remote sensing technologies are described along with methods of analysing remote sensing data for detecting change at local, regional and continental scales. It is this diverse range of scales of observation and analysis that are now key to mapping and monitoring both anthropogenic and natural, and dramatic and incremental change. These aspects are demonstrated using case studies with different objectives and applied at different scales.																	0305-9006						2004	61		4				267	+		10.1016/S0305-9006(03)00062-X								WOS:000220838100001

Remote sensing and field transects reveal changes in forest carbon stocks and accumulation rates. Deforestation was most rapid along the Interoceanic Highway during 1986-91 when credit and guaranteed markets were available, resulting in emissions of 708,000 Mg Cyr(-1), of which 14% was offset by secondary regrowth. Despite continued population growth, deforestation slowed during 1991-97 when fiscal austerity measures were imposed, resulting in emissions of 389,000 Mg Cyr(-1), of which 41% was offset by regrowth. Strategies to conserve frontier forests are compared in terms of carbon, biodiversity and economic costs and benefits. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The evergreen forests of Tamil Nadu are distributed in four distinct hill ranges, Nilgiri, Anamalai, Palni and Tirunelveli, having different topographic, bioclimatic and disturbance levels. The evergreen forests in these four hill ranges are characterized for their uniqueness in terms of patch characteristics and phytosociology. A vegetation type map was prepared using IRS LISS III satellite data and was used to study the patch characteristics in terms of patch size, number, shape, porosity and landcover diversity (LD). The phytosociological characteristics, namely species richness, diversity, similarity and community assemblages, were studied using ground data collected from 95 sample points of 0.1 ha size. Patch size and number revealed distinct intactness and disturbance levels in these four hill ranges. Evergreen forests in the Tirunelveli hills comprising 216.09 km(2) are distributed in 306 patches, and in the Palni hills, with 285 km(2), forests are distributed in 1029 patches, indicating a high level of fragmentation. LD, indicating the spatial heterogeneity of landcover, was very high in the Nilgiri hills and low in the Tirunelveli hills. The spatial analysis helped to delineate homogenous large patches of evergreen forest, which can be adopted for appropriate conservation strategies. A total of 342 tree species belonging to 4490 stems were evaluated for phytosociology. Only 15-28% of similarity in terms of species distribution was found across the hill ranges. Conjunctive analysis of patch characteristics and species distribution showed high species richness in less fragmented evergreen forests and vice versa. The study identified the areas of prioritization in terms of ecorestoration and conservation based on patch and phytosociological characteristics.																	0960-3115					DEC	2003	12	12					2331	2359		10.1023/A:1025858713716								WOS:000185493400001						
J	Hiers, JK; Laine, SC; Bachant, JJ; Furman, JH; Greene, WW; Compton, V				Hiers, JK; Laine, SC; Bachant, JJ; Furman, JH; Greene, WW; Compton, V			Simple spatial modeling tool for prioritizing prescribed burning activities at the landscape scale	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Resources for prescribed fire are frequently insufficient to manage public lands for all conservation and resource management objectives, necessitating prioritization of the application of fire across the landscape within any given year. Defining tradeoffs when applying prescribed fire to large landscapes is problematic not only because of the complexity of weighing competing management objectives at the landscape scale, but also because of the difficult nature of independently applying need-to-burn criteria to large areas. We present a case study of a simple modeling process implemented at Eglin Air Force Base in the Florida Panhandle (U. S. A.) to prioritize the application of prescribed fire. In a workshop setting, managers and biologists identified key conservation criteria and landscape management objectives that drive the application of prescribed fire. Remote sensing and other spatial data were developed to directly or indirectly represent all these criteria. Using geographic information system software, managers and biologists weighted each criterion according to its relative contribution to overall burn prioritization, and individual values for the criterion were scored according to how they influence the need to burn. Subsequently, this process has been validated and modified through ecological monitoring. This modeling process has also been applied to the 77,400-ha Blackwater River State Forest, public land adjacent to Eglin Air Force Base, demonstrating its applicability to lands with varying management priorities. The advantages of this model-based approach for prioritizing prescribed fire include the reliance on accessible, inexpensive software, the development of spatially explicit management objectives, the ease of transferability, and clearly stated assumptions about management that may be tested and reviewed through monitoring and public comment.																	0888-8892					DEC	2003	17	6					1571	1578		10.1111/j.1523-1739.2003.00381.x								WOS:000186869700017

Currently, these forests are facing strong exploitation pressure in the form of extensive clearcuts. Demand for conservation is also high. We characterize the boreal forest landscape in the region and assess the impacts of past and potential management actions through a mapping and modeling study that synthesizes methods from landscape ecology, remote sensing, and simulation modeling. The forests of the study area were mapped using techniques for interpreting multitemporal satellite images and detecting changes. The species composition and structure of the forests were estimated using the multisource k-nearest neighbors (k-nn) method. Forest harvesting rates and current landscape patterns were used to parameterize models built with a cell-based Spatially Explicit Landscape Event Simulator (SELES) modeling tool, and alternative land-use policy strategies were simulated with and without natural fire. Based on 10 Monte Carlo runs for each scenario, we can predict dramatic changes in the forest landscape structure after 30-70 yr. The current, complexly structured, near-natural forest assemblage will rapidly be converted into its transpose: an expanse of young regeneration stands, with blocks of near-natural forest extant only as islands within mires and in the reserve areas. The prompt establishment of the proposed Kalevala National Park is regionally important for these reasons: (1) to increase the types of near-natural forest conserved, (2) to provide a second large biodiversity source adjacent to the heavily fragmented Finnish forests, and (3) to reduce the currently inflated rate of harvesting.																	1195-5449					DEC	2003	7	2							8									WOS:000189307800004						
J	Shanmugam, S; Lucas, N; Phipps, P; Richards, A; Barnsley, M				Shanmugam, S; Lucas, N; Phipps, P; Richards, A; Barnsley, M			Assessment of remote sensing techniques for habitat mapping in coastal dune ecosystems	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Bare sand and semi-fixed dunes represent ideal conditions for successionally young slack habitats that support rare species of coastal dune flora such as fen orchid (Liparis loeselii) and liverworts (e.g., Petallophyllum ral/sii). In ecologically significant and large dune systems, such as the Kenfig National Nature Reserve, UK, the identification and mapping of habitats and the provision of information on the relative proportion of sand and vegetation form the key to conservation management. To map this habitat, mapping algorithms are applied to Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) data. Per-pixel mapping was performed using the minimum distance, maximum likelihood and Mahalanobis distance classification algorithms with training data extracted for habitats at various levels of the National Vegetation Classification (NVC) scheme. Sub-pixel mapping was performed using a linear mixture model, fuzzy membership functions and neural networks, and the sub-pixel proportions of the spectral end members viz. sand, vegetation and shade/moisture were defined. Results indicate that per-pixel mapping can only be achieved for broad habitat categories that correspond to level I of the NVC. Of the algorithms used, the minimum distance, with an overall mapping accuracy of 92%, outperforms both maximum likelihood and Mahalanobis distance. Results from the sub-pixel algorithms indicate that all three techniques can be used to map the relative proportions of sand and vegetation. It is argued that both approaches provide baseline maps that are required to implement successfully an effective dune conservation programme.																	0749-0208					WIN	2003	19	1					64	75										WOS:000182374100007

It has been reported that world population is expected to be about 9.4 billion by 2050, and that increases in crop yields will have to be achieved primarily from land that is currently under production since most of the world's arable land is already being cultivated. These increases in population growth and food and water demands will put increasing pressure for development of new more efficient technology and production practices that contribute to higher yields. Since intensive farming can potentially impact soil and water quality, parallel increases in new practices and technology contributing to improved soil and water conservation practices will be needed to help sustain and maintain the needed yield increases from agricultural systems.																	0022-4561					NOV-DEC	2003	58	6					332	339										WOS:000186955300005						
J	Albertson, JD; Montaldo, N				Albertson, JD; Montaldo, N			Temporal dynamics of soil moisture variability: 1. Theoretical basis	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												[1] Coarse soil moisture fields and nonlinear relationships between fluxes and soil moisture combine to yield errors in both diagnostic and predictive estimates of large-scale mass and energy fluxes. Efforts to empirically define the dynamics of subgrid spatial variance of soil moisture have led to contradictory results. Moreover, most reports of soil moisture variability range from qualitative to descriptively quantitative, owing to the lack of a robust theoretical framework for moisture variance dynamics. In this paper we derive a conservation equation for the spatial variance of subgrid root zone soil moisture, based on first principles of statistical fluid mechanics. We arrive at a variance budget in which explicit covariances between moisture fields and land surface flux fields act to produce or destroy variance through time (according to the sign of the correlation between the flux and state fields). A series of examples are used to explore how simple forms of soil, vegetation, precipitation, topography, and initial moisture variability lead to evolving covariances between spatial fields of soil moisture and particular land surface fluxes and how these covariances relate to the temporal trajectory of the spatial variance of soil moisture. We isolate a set of processes and conditions that demonstrate variance production through time and a set that demonstrate variance destruction. Of particular interest is the tendency for transpiration and infiltration-runoff processes to either produce or destroy variance, depending on the background wetness regime. Field data are also employed and shown to demonstrate a temporal behavior of the spatial variance that is readily described by the proposed approach. Ultimately, this work should aid field data interpretation and, when supplemented with a closure model for the variance budget, lead to improved land surface flux predictability over coarse grids.

J	Montaldo, N; Albertson, JD				Montaldo, N; Albertson, JD			Temporal dynamics of soil moisture variability: 2. Implications for land surface models	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												[1] Given that land surface processes most often depend nonlinearly on soil moisture and that coarse-grained soil moisture fields are often used in modern large-scale applications, it becomes necessary to account in some way for the subgrid variability of physiographic properties and their interactions with subgrid soil moisture dynamics in order to derive robust estimates of grid-scale land surface fluxes. Albertson and Montaldo [2003] present a conservation equation for subgrid soil moisture spatial variability, which includes production and destruction terms related to the various interactions between moisture fields and flux fields (i.e., infiltration, drainage, evapotranspiration, and horizontal redistribution). Here we present a rigorous closure of the conservation equations of the first and second moments of the soil moisture field (omitting topographic redistribution in this effort). Closed terms include correlation coefficients between soil moisture and physiographic properties. The approach presented here provides accounting for the effects of dynamic interaction between soil moisture spatial variability and the underlying soil texture and vegetation density fields. Closure is achieved in terms of the spatial mean soil moisture evolution, with closure coefficients being functions of the correlation coefficient between the underlying soil texture and vegetation density patterns (i.e., the physiographic setting). Making use of these relationships, the proposed approach uses known subgrid soil texture and vegetation density fields to accurately simulate the temporal trajectory of subgrid variance of soil moisture, which supports improved estimates of grid-scale land surface fluxes. The approach is tested synthetically (closure model versus distributed model) over a wide range of physiographic characteristics and meteorological conditions, with results demonstrating that the closure model based approach reproduces the temporal dynamics of the soil moisture variability and provides improved grid-scale land surface flux estimates. In fact, the second-order closure was shown to reduce the errors in integrated land surface flux estimates, as compared to those derived from zero-order approximation estimates, by an order of magnitude in certain conditions.

We present the results of a study of the fragmentation of Andean forests and other ecosystems and an assessment of the representativeness at the ecosystem level of protected natural areas in the eastern Andes of Colombia.

The I I identified ecosystem types were analyzed within existing protected areas to assess the representativeness of these sites within the region. Five ecosystems were well-represented and six of them had <10% of their area protected. Highland ecosystems were the best represented in protected areas due to the preponderance of highland parks in the eastern Andes. However Andean and sub Andean forests have less than 4.5 and 6.4% of their original pre-Columbian extent currently protected. Fragmentation parameters such as patch size, patch shape, number of patches, mean nearest neighbor distance and landscape shape index were also analyzed. Andean, sub Andean and dry forests are highly fragmented ecosystems but there is a clear latitudinal gradient of fragmentation. Our findings suggested that conservation efforts should be directed first toward the conservation of dry and oak forests in the center of the eastern Andes, and then Andean and sub Andean montane forests toward the south near the border with Ecuador.

The analysis indicates that the area of the mangrove forest cover has increased by about 90%. A science-based, community-centred and process-oriented approach followed for the restoration of the Pichavaram mangrove wetland in collaboration with the Forest Department, Government of Tamil Nadu and participation of local mangrove user-communities is mainly responsible for success of the effort. This study indicates that remote sensing data can be used as a monitoring tool to assess the effectiveness of restoration and conservation programmes of the mangrove wetland, where direct and regular physical monitoring is difficult due to marshy nature of the soil and presence of numerous tidal creeks and canals.																	0011-3891					SEP 25	2003	85	6					794	798										WOS:000185811100024

Six major vegetation types, forest plantation and other land cover categories have been mapped. The slope map was prepared and overlaid on the vegetation-type map and the vegetation in different slope categories was identified. Sampling plots of 0.1 ha were established for each vegetation type in different slope categories. The woody species were measured at greater than or equal to 30 cm gbh. The analysis shows that the forestland occupies a major part of the hill (49.50%) followed by villages (38.12%) and forest plantation (12.37%). The slope is directly proportional to the number of individuals, but indirectly proportional to the girth of the woody species. The data provided by the spatial distribution of the vegetation classes in different slope categories could help in the effective management/conservation of vegetation in the Shervarayan hills.																	0011-3891					SEP 10	2003	85	5					645	653										WOS:000185548100025

Due in large part to their inaccessibility, relatively little is known about the landscapes of this biodiverse region, which also supports some of the highest population densities in the world. A broad-scale NDVI-based IRS 1B satellite image classification is used to analyze north-south and east-west trends across the entire Western Ghats and western coast of India, an area over 170 000 km(2). Northern and eastern landscapes are more fragmented compared to the southern and western slopes. Western slopes also have greater landscape diversity with land cover types more interspersed compared to the eastern slopes. These differences can be related to north-south and east-west variations in rainfall and plant distribution. Data from thirteen landscapes 10-50 km(2) in area, are further utilized to analyze trends in landscape pattern, and describe the geographical distribution of major natural and managed ecotope types. At this scale, very high levels of intra-ecotope type variability in landscape pattern are encountered for all land cover types. Results at these two scales are integrated to suggest a hierarchical stratified approach for monitoring land cover and biodiversity in the region.

J	Kittredge, DB; Finley, AO; Foster, DR				Kittredge, DB; Finley, AO; Foster, DR			Timber harvesting as ongoing disturbance in a landscape of diverse ownership	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Although the northeastern US includes extensive areas of aggrading forest, uncertainty regarding the intensity and pattern of forest harvesting hampers an understanding of important ecological processes and characteristics such as carbon and nitrogen storage, habitat quality, and forest dynamics, and impedes regional conservation and management planning. Due to the complex ownership pattern dominated by thousands of non-industrial private forest (NIPF) owners and the difficulty of detecting selective logging using remote sensing, details of the harvesting regime remain largely unknown to the scientific and policy communities. To examine the value of statewide regulatory data for Massachusetts as a unique source of this critical information, we analyzed 17 years of timber harvest data gathered for regulatory purposes for a 168,000 ha forested landscape in Massachusetts that is the focus of concerted conservation planning and intensive study of landscape and ecosystem pattern and process. The North Quabbin Region is heavily wooded with a complicated ownership pattern dominated by over 2500 NIPF owners, three state agencies, and diverse conservation and municipal holdings. The extent and intensity of harvesting were surprising, with an annual disturbance rate of 1.5% and a mean intensity of 44.7 m(3) ha(-1) (approximately one-fourth of average stand volume). The predominant form of harvesting was selective removal of commercially valuable tree sizes, grades and species (e.g., Quercus rubra and Pinus strobus). The spatial pattern of logging was random with regards to major physical, biological, or cultural factors. However, logging was strongly related to landowner class. NIPF owners control 60% of the forest area and were responsible for 64.1% of harvest area, but the highest logging intensity (volume per area harvested; 69.3 m(3) ha(-1)) among major landowners was conducted by the state agency responsible for managing southern New England's largest conservation property, the watershed of Boston's drinking reservoir. This regime of chronic disturbance is occurring over the entire landscape and exerting a major influence on forest composition, dynamics, and habitat quality. However, dispersed selective harvesting is largely unnoticed by residents, is routinely overlooked by ecologists and conservationists, and would remain unrecognized in the absence of this previously unused regulatory data. These results identify the value of regional regulatory spatial information to estimate ecological trends and to assist in conservation planning. Given similarities among ownership and forest patterns for much of the northeastern US, we expect that the broad findings of this study to have regional application. (C) 2002 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, mapping seagrass beds is indispensable in the management and conservation of sound littoral ecosystems, and in the development of sustainable fisheries in coastal waters. Multi-beam sonar is often used to map bottom topography. We developed a mapping method to quantify the volume of seagrass using a multi-beam sonar. Seagrass beds were scanned with the multi-beam sonar and quadrat sampled to verify the distribution of seagrasses. We used software to discriminate seagrass signals from echoes to obtain a topographic profile of the bottom without seagrass this was then subtracted from the topography including the seagrass. We then mapped seagrass distribution, calculated seagrass volume, and estimated biomass using volume and quadrat samples. We applied these methods to map a seagrass bed of Zostera caulescens in Otsuchi Bay, on the Sanriku Coast of Japan, during the growing season of 2001. A transducer was attached to a boat (one gross ton) equipped with a differential-GPS, a motion sensor, and a gyrocompass. The vessel completed a grid survey scanning whole seagrass bed with an area of 115 m x 156 m at bottom depths between 2 and 8 in within about 40 min when traveling at a speed of 1.5 m s(-1) (3 knots). The multi-beam sonar was able to visualize three-dimensional seagrass distribution without interpolation and easily to estimate area and volume occupied by the seagrass using hydrography software. The results indicated that Z. caulescens was distributed at bottom depths of 6-7 m with a surface area of 3 628 m(2) and a volume of 1 368 m(3). The mean biomass of above- and below-ground parts of seagrass were estimated to be 28.6 gDW m(-2) (range 26.6-30.9) and 15.9 gDW m(-2) (range 14.1-17.7). Our study demonstrated that multi-beam sonar is effective for mapping and quantifying the spatial distribution of seagrass beds, and for visualizing the landscape of the seagrass canopy.

J	Rouget, M				Rouget, M			Measuring conservation value at fine and broad scales: implications for a diverse and fragmented region, the Agulhas Plain	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												This study explores the implications of spatial scale for conservation planning in the Agulhas Plain, South Africa. Regional planning relies on broad-scale data but fine-scale data are usually required for implementation at local level. This study addresses the implications of broad-scale planning for fine-scale implementation. Two original systems of notional reserves were developed for this region using C-plan, a decision support system for systematic conservation planning. The first conservation plan was derived using broad scale data (1:250,000) and consisted of nine broad habitat units (land classes based on topography, geology, and climate), remote sensing mapping of habitat transformation and large-planning units defined by 1/16th degree squares (average size 3900 ha). The second system was identified at a finer scale (1:10,000) using 36 vegetation types (mapped in the field), ground survey mapping of habitat transformation and cadastral boundaries as planning units (average size 252 ha). Using classification trees, this study compared reserve-design efficiency (the area required to achieve conservation targets), the spatial patterns,of conservation value (the irreplaceability value of planning units), biodiversity features, and habitat transformation at both scales. A similar amount of land was required to meet all conservation targets (identified using minimum set analysis) at the broad and fine scale. There was considerable overlap between the two conservation plans as most of fine-scale conservation targets could be achieved under the broad-scale conservation plan. However, irreplaceability values, which measure the likelihood of selecting planning units for achieving representation targets, were much higher at the fine scale. The use of broad-scale biodiversity features underestimated irreplaceability value at a fine scale in heterogeneous and fragmented portions of the landscape. The implications of moving from broad- to fine-scale conservation planning, as well as their respective benefits are discussed. Maximising biodiversity conservation while minimising cost and resources might be achieved by a combination of broad-scale assessments for relatively homogeneous and untransformed areas and fine-scale ones for heterogeneous and fragmented areas.

J	Gonzalez, A; Torruco, D; Liceaga, A; Ordaz, J				Gonzalez, A; Torruco, D; Liceaga, A; Ordaz, J			The shallow and deep bathymetry of the Banco Chinchorro reef in the Mexican Caribbean	BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE												This paper presents the use of two complementary remote sensing techniques in the Banco Chinchorro: satellite image and echosound. A cartographic relation was established between the shallower reef depths recorded by Landsat-MSS and those of greater depth recorded with echosound. A bathymetric map of the shallow lagoon areas and reeferest was generated from the Landsat-MSS image using exponential correspondence between reef depths and corrected digital values in the image. The reef lagoon exhibits a bathymetric gradient from I in in the north to 25 in in the south. The echosound data show a pinnacle with depths greater than 300 m. Largely due to intense coral growth, the most pronounced slopes are found near the leeward reeferest, and the more gradual on the windward margin. The use of these two complementary remote sensing techniques proved an efficient tool for characterizing reef morphology when depth strongly affects the efficacy of one or the other technique. The analytical delimitation of this complex reef is increasingly important because of its recent designation as a biosphere reserve area by the Mexican government. The present study is a pioneering effort that could be used as a pilot in future administrative, conservation, and sustainable management studies.																	0007-4977					JUL	2003	73	1					15	22										WOS:000187322800003						
J	Foody, GM; Cutler, MEJ				Foody, GM; Cutler, MEJ			Tree biodiversity in protected and logged Bornean tropical rain forests and its measurement by satellite remote sensing	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Conservation activities have increasingly focused on issues at the level of the landscape but are constrained by limited data and knowledge relating to biodiversity at this scale. Satellite remote sensing has considerable, but under-exploited, potential as a source of information on biodiversity at the landscape level. Remote sensing has generally been used to assess biodiversity indirectly, using approaches that often fail to fully exploit the information content of the imagery and typically only with regard to the species richness component of biodiversity. The aim of this paper was to assess the potential of remote sensing as a source of information on the richness, evenness and composition of tree species in a tropical rain forest. Location The test site was a c. 225 km(2) region centred on the Danum Valley Field Centre, Borneo. This test site contained regions of undisturbed and differentially logged rain forest. Methods Data on tree biodiversity had been acquired for fifty-two sample plots by standard field survey methods and were used to derive summary indices of biodiversity for seedlings, saplings and mature trees. Differences between logged and unlogged sites were evaluated by comparison of the indices and species accumulation curves. A Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image of the site acquired close to the date of the field survey was obtained and rigorously pre-processed. Feedforward neural networks were used to derive predictions of biodiversity indices from the imagery. A Kohonen self organizing map neural network was used to ordinate the field data to derive classes of forest defined by relative similarity in species composition. The separability of the defined classes in the Landsat TM image was evaluated with a discriminant analysis. Results Analyses of the field data revealed considerable variation in the biodiversity of seedlings, saplings and trees at the site, associated, in part, with differences in logging activities. This variation in biodiversity was manifest in the remotely sensed data. The analyses indicated an ability to (1) predict biodiversity indices, with the highest correlation between predicted and actual index observed for evenness described by Shannon entropy (r = 0.546), but especially to (2) classify nine forest classes defined on the basis of similarity in tree species composition (accuracy 95.8%). Main conclusions Logging activities impacted on biodiversity and the resulting variation in biodiversity was reflected in the remotely sensed imagery. Using methods that exploit more fully the information content of the imagery than those used in other previous studies, a richer representation of biodiversity may be derived. This representation includes estimates of key summary indices of biodiversity, notably richness and evenness, as well as information on species composition. The results indicate that remotely sensed data may be used as a source of information on biodiversity at the landscape scale that may be used to inform conservation science and management.

Predictive models based on underpinning relationships between environmental predictors and the individual organism are likely to require measurement of spatially fine-grained predictor variables. Further, models must show spatial generality if they are to be used to predict the consequences of habitat change over large geographical areas. Remote sensing techniques using airborne scanning laser altimetry (LiDAR) and high resolution multi-spectral imagery allow spatially fine-grained predictor variables to be measured over large geographical areas and thus facilitate testing of the spatial generality of organism-habitat models. These techniques are considered using the skylark as an example species. A range image segmentation system for LiDAR data is described which allows measurement of skylark habitat predictor variables such as within-field vegetation height, boundary height and shape for individual fields within the LiDAR image. Additional variables such as field vegetation type and fractional vegetation ground cover may be obtained from co-registered multi-spectral data. These techniques could have wide application in testing the generality of relationships between populations and habitats, and in ecological monitoring of change in habitat structures and the associated effects on wildlife, over large geographical areas.

J	Gaonac'h, H; Lovejoy, S; Schertzer, D				Gaonac'h, H; Lovejoy, S; Schertzer, D			Resolution dependence of infrared imagery of active thermal features at Kilauea Volcano	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Standard methods for monitoring and analysing thermal volcanic fields have difficulty taking into account the large dynamical range of temperatures and radiative fluxes which occur over enormous ranges of spatial scale. They typically are either qualitative or if quantitative, only in the identification of a small number of 'anomalies' mapped at coarse resolutions. We argue that remote sensing of such fields invariably involves averages over small 'hot spots', and that the results depend sensitively and systematically on the space-time resolutions of the sensors. In order to overcome these difficulties and to provide resolution and hence observer-independent characterizations, we use various statistical scaling analysis techniques. We demonstrate their advantages on images of various volcanic features in the thermal infrared spectral region (8-12 mum) acquired above the active part of Kilauea volcano in December 1995 using a helicopter-borne infrared (IR) camera. We first demonstrate the scaling of the thermal remotely sensed radiances using energy spectra and show they are of the power law form E(k) infinity k-beta, where k is a spatial wavenumber in the image, and beta is a scale-invariant spectral exponent. Over the range of over 10(4) in scale (from 4cm to 775m) and for a variety of volcanic structures, we find betaapproximate to2.0+/-0.1. Moreover, the thermal fields show multiscaling behaviour characterized by universal multifractal parameters; we find the degree of multifractality alphaapproximate to1.7+/-0.2, the codimension of the singularity contributing to the mean C(1)approximate to0.14+/-0.04(characterizing the sparseness of the mean gradients) and finally the conservation parameter H=0.65+/-0.05, which largely determines the roughness (scale by scale) of the radiance field. These three universal multifractal parameters characterize the resolution dependence of both low- and high-radiance regions over the entire range of spatial scales studied. We compare and contrast these parameters with those (found in other studies) of the topography and volcanic albedo. We also propose a new way to enhance the thermal volcanic anomalies of daytime images through filtering. This is done by shifting the H values (power law filtering) to those of the observed night-time images and produces 'simulated' nocturnal images with essentially the same (scale by scale) statistics; it is a kind of scale-invariant contrast enhancement. Finally, we show how knowledge of the scaling statistics can be used to determine the statistical expectation of large-scale thermal fluxes conditioned on the corresponding large-scale temperatures. The multifractal properties demonstrate the necessity of explicitly taking into account the (essentially subjective) sensor resolution when interpreting and modelling active volcanic thermal fields. It underlines the need to properly characterize the non-classical geostatistics of the radiance field before interpreting the latter in terms of temperatures and anomalies.

Research in temperate environments, however, has tended to keep pace with new remote sensing technologies more so than in tropical environments. Here, we identify what we consider to be three priority areas for remote sensing research in Neotropical dry forests. The first priority is the use of improved sensor capabilities, which should allow for better characterization of tropical secondary forests than has been achieved. Secondary forests are of key interest due to their potential for sequestering carbon in relatively short periods of time. The second priority is the need to characterize leaf area index (LAI) and other biophysical variables by means of bidirectional reflectance function models. These biophysical parameters have importance linkages with net primary productivity and may be estimated through remote sensing. The third priority is to identify tree species using hyper-spectral imagery, which represents an entirely new area of research for tropical forests that could have powerful applications in biodiversity conservation.

Such measurements are subject to substantial errors that can be difficult to overcome, but corrected data are readily available and can be of sufficiently high resolution to be integrated into traditional field-based studies.

However, advances in the spatial and spectral resolutions of sensors now available to ecologists are making the direct remote sensing of certain aspects of biodiversity increasingly feasible; for example, distinguishing species assemblages or even identifying species of individual trees. In cases where direct detection of individual organisms or assemblages is still beyond our grasp, indirect approaches offer valuable information about diversity patterns. Such approaches derive meaningful environmental parameters from biophysical characteristics that are revealed by remote sensing.

The indirect driving forces of biodiversity impoverishment listed in the Global Biodiversity Strategy that are particularly effective in and and semi-arid regions are (a) population growth, (b) economic systems and policies that fail to value the environment and its natural resources; (c) inequity in the ownership, management and flow of benefits from both the use and conservation of biological resources;, and (d) weakness in legal and institutional systems. The most effective direct human impacts are (a) habitat destruction and fragmentation, (b) overexploitation of biological resources, (c) biological invasion, and (d) agriculture. The problem in and and semiarid regions, particularly in developing countries, is exacerbated by the lack of knowledge and awareness, the paucity of research, and the diminishing number of competent systematists. This paper discusses the theoretical and practical aspects of each of the indirect driving forces, and the direct human impacts on biodiversity, and reviews case studies related to these impacts, with special reference to those carried out in and and semiarid regions. These studies include monitoring of the human impact on land cover by remote sensing, effects of landuse on species diversity, impact of habitat fragmentation by summer resorts on coastal dunes, consequences of protection from grazing on biodiversity, comparison of biodiversity in nature reserves and the traditional hema system with that of nearby territories, and the impact of desertification on animal life and endangered species. Case studies also include the tools applied for biodiversity conservation in and and semiarid lands with special emphasis on endangered species, restoration of degraded habitats and their biodiversity, the significance of nature reserves and captive breeding, the importance of conserving the populations below the species level throughout their geographical range of distribution, and ecotonal biodiversity.

This wetland is under severe environmental stress due to large-scale land use / land cover conversions that occurred in and around it for the past several decades. Ashtamudi is one of the 21 notified wetlands of paramount importance in India needing special conservation measures. In the present study, land use/ land cover conversions in Ashtamudi wetland region from 1967 to 1997 is quantified using the technique of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS). Survey of India topographic map, hard copies of IRS-1A LISS 11, IRS-1C LISS III images are used in the present work. The study shows that increasing population density, change in family system, extensive coconut husk retting and deposition of husk waste along the margin of the estuary, solid waste deposition from factories, reclamation of the estuary by local population and low profit obtained from paddy cultivation are mainly responsible for the large-scale land use/ land cover conversions in the wetland region. The study tries to correlate unscientific land use/ land cover conversions in the wetland region with its environmental degradation.																	0016-7622					MAY	2003	61	5					573	580										WOS:000182686500008						
J	Vina, A; Peters, AJ; Ji, L				Vina, A; Peters, AJ; Ji, L			Use of multispectral ikonos imagery for discriminating between conventional and conservation agricultural tillage practices	PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING												There is a global concern about the increase in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, One method being discussed to encourage greenhouse gas mitigation efforts is based on a trading system whereby carbon emitters can buy effective mitigation efforts from farmers implementing conservation tillage practices, These practices sequester carbon from the atmosphere, and such a trading system would require a low-cost and accurate method of verification, Remote sensing technology can offer such a verification technique. This paper is focused on the use of standard image processing procedures applied to a multispectral Ikon as image, to determine whether it is possible to validate that farmers have complied with agreements to implement conservation tillage practices. A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed in order to isolate image variance in cropped fields. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) statistical procedures were used to evaluate the capability of each Ikonos band and each principal component to discriminate between conventional and conservation tillage practices. A logistic regression model was implemented on the principal component most effective in discriminating between conventional and conservation tillage, in order to produce a map of the probability of conventional tillage. The Ikonos imagery, in combination with ground-reference information, proved to be a useful tool for verification of conservation tillage practices.

The principle of near-infrared reflectance spectroscopic imaging is explained, and our instrumentation for art examination described. The technique allows the art materials to be distinguished by their composition, and under-drawings revealed. The initial results indicate that even over limited wavelength ranges (650-1040 nm) and with relatively coarse spectral resolution (10 nm) a number of pigments can be distinguished on the basis of variations in spectral properties such as spectral slope and the presence or absence of absorption bands. Software adapted from the remote-sensing image-processing field has been used to successfully map areas of different brown and black pigments across a drawing. Non-destructive identification of pigments can be used to address issues of attribution, age dating, and conservation. An additional advantage of this technique is that it can be performed off-site using portable instrumentation, and under relatively benign lighting conditions. The technique has been applied to the examination of a 15th-century drawing, Untitled (The Holy Trinity), in the collection of the Winnipeg Art Gallery. Multivariate image analysis produced a set of principal component (PC) images highlighting different materials' aspects of the drawing. A color composite image produced from the PC images provided a direct visualization of the compositional characteristics of the work. Features of the under-drawing have been exposed, and its material tentatively identified as charcoal, by comparison with reference data. (C) 2003 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

The precipitation-adjusted curve number and the soil moisture were strongly related (r(2) = 0.70). Remotely sensed soil moisture fields were used to adjust the curve numbers and the runoff estimates for five watersheds, in the Little Washita watershed; the results ranged from 2.8 km(2) to 601.6 km(2). The soil moisture data were applied at two spatial scales, a finer one (806 m) measuring spatial resolution and a coarser one (28 km). The root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE) of the runoff estimated by the standard SCS method was reduced by nearly 50 percent when the 800 in soil moisture data were used to adjust the curve number. The coarser scale soil moisture data also significantly reduced the error in the runoff predictions with 41 percent and 28 percent reductions in MAE and RMSE, respectively. The results suggest that remote sensing of soil moisture, when combined with the SCS method.																	1093-474X					APR	2003	39	2					313	324		10.1111/j.1752-1688.2003.tb04386.x								WOS:000182673600006

However, this biodiversity hot spot is under great peril owing to human-induced disturbance factors. The findings on spatial representation of the habitat at a scale which can be used for conservation planning and rehabilitation are lacking. In this study IRS-1D, LISS-III sensor data have been used to assess the vegetation coupling with RS and GIS techniques in the state. This communication presents an approach for rapid assessment of biodiversity at landscape level using satellite remote sensing, phytosociological data and knowledge base in geospatial model. The geospatial analyses at the landscape level reveal that most of the fertile valleys of the region are occupied by the human activities and possess very low bio-richness. Inverse relationship has been observed with disturbance at landscape level vis-a-vis phytodiversity or richness of the vegetation type/habitat.

We used remote sensing and biological surveys to study the effects of deforestation on populations of endangered large mammals in a Sumatran landscape. We measured forest loss and created a predictive model of deforestation for Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park and an unprotected buffer area based on satellite images between 1985 and 1999. We used automatic cameras to determine the distribution and relative abundance of tigers ( Panthera tigris sumatrae ), elephants ( Elephas maximus ), rhinoceros ( Dicerorhinus sumatrensis ), and tapirs ( Tapir indicus ). Between 1985 and 1999, forest loss within the park averaged 2% per year. A total of 661 km (2) of forest disappeared inside the park, and 318 km (2) were lost in a 10-km buffer, eliminating forest outside the park. Lowland forest disappeared faster than hill/montane forest ( by a factor of 6 ) and forests on gentle slopes disappeared faster than forests on steep slopes ( by a factor of 16 ). Most forest conversion resulted from agricultural development, leading to predictions that by 2010 70% of the park will be in agriculture and that by 2036 lowland forest habitat will be eliminated. Camera-trap data indicated avoidance of forest boundaries by tigers, rhinoceroses ( up to 2 km ), and elephants ( up to 3 km ). Classification of forest into core and peripheral forest based on mammal distribution suggests that, by 2010, core forest area for tigers and rhinoceros will be fragmented and reduced to 20% of remaining forest. Core forest area for elephants will be reduced to 0.5% of remaining forest. Halting forest loss has proven one of the most difficult and complex problems faced by Indonesia's conservation agencies today and will require a mix of enforcement, wise land-use strategies, increased education, capacity to manage, and new financing mechanisms.																	0888-8892					FEB	2003	17	1					245	257		10.1046/j.1523-1739.2003.02040.x								WOS:000180846200029						
J	Smith, JH				Smith, JH			Land-cover assessment of conservation and buffer zones in the BOSAWAS Natural Resource Reserve of Nicaragua	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The BOSAWAS Natural Resource Reserve of Nicaragua was established in 1991, to protect a portion of the remaining tropical rain forest and to promote the sustainable use of the region's resources. Information required to effectively manage the reserve includes the extents and locations of present land-cover types and recent land-cover changes in the management use zones that were delineated by local indigenous communities. These zones include areas designated for conservation, limited resource extraction, agriculture, and watershed protection. Land-cover for 1986 and 1995 was identified for three of the communities from remotely sensed images and then input into a geographic information system database to identify land-cover types within these management use zones. For both dates of the analysis, advanced forest was the dominant land cover, with the conservation zones entirely forested. The amount of both agricultural land and scrub/early secondary forest increased between the two dates, with much of these land-cover classes occurring in the agriculture zones. Conflicts between the land-cover present and designated use were identified in some of the limited-use buffer and watershed protection zones. Changes between 1986 and 1995 were identified by overlaying the two land-cover data sets. Three change processes were identified as occurring: deforestation, reforestation, and reconversion. Changes were concentrated in the agriculture zones but were found to occur in every type of zone, except for conservation. The results of this study will establish baseline information for the future management of the BOSAWAS Reserve, an important component in uniting conservation areas along the Central American isthmus.																	0364-152X					FEB	2003	31	2					252	262		10.1007/s00267-002-2774-8								WOS:000180389100008	12520380

Tincture of Ephedra is used for cardiac and circulatory stimulation. Its demand as medicine has intensified the pressure on landscapes hearing this species. This has necessitated bioprospection and active planning to ensure safe conservation of the existing. gene pool and sustainable utilization of this land resource. On account of its importance, an attempt has been made, using remote sensing and geographical information system to identify and map Ephedra-dominant sites. IRS 1C/1D LISS-III false colour composite has been used for stratification of gerardiana bearing landscape in the present study. Test sites were used to evaluate the napping results and promising accuracy has been achieved. The study highlights the possibility of snapping. gerardiana in complex terrain conditions. Through this study it is also emphasized that the methodology can be used for bioprospection of species in the whole Lahul and Spiti district.																	0011-3891					JAN 25	2003	84	2					208	212										WOS:000180918500031						
J	Nielsen, SE; Boyce, MS; Stenhouse, GB; Munro, RHM				Nielsen, SE; Boyce, MS; Stenhouse, GB; Munro, RHM			Development and testing of phenologically driven grizzly bear habitat models	ECOSCIENCE												We developed and compared three habitat models for estimating the relative probability of occurrence, by month, for grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in Jasper National Park (JNP), Alberta. These models included 1) a habitat map derived from remote sensing Landsat imagery; 2) food-index models generated from the predicted occurrence of bear foods and assigned monthly importance values; and 3) probabilistic food models representing the occurrence of each bear food. Resource selection function (RSF) models for grizzly bears were generated using 3,924 global positioning system (GPS) radiotelemetry locations and the above habitat models. Comparisons were made among RSF models, by month, using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). In all seven months (April to October), food-index models performed poorly. In April and July, the remote-sensing habitat map predicted bears best, while the food-probability models performed best in the remaining five months. Overall, we found substantial improvement by using food-probability models for predicting JNP grizzly bear occurrence. Remote-sensing maps, although predictive, may not reveal underlying mechanisms and fail to recognize the dynamic nature of seasonal grizzly bear habitats. The disconnect between food-index and food-probability models suggests that monthly food importance values require additional parameterization. Development of spatial food models on phenologically important scales more closely matches the resources and temporal scales at which animals perceive and use resources.

This work has focused on two spatial scales of imagery resolution: coarse-resolution NOAA-AVHRR imagery for savanna-wide assessments both of the daily distribution of fires ('hot spots'), and cumulative mapping of burnt areas('fire-scars') over the annual cycle; and fine-resolution Landsat imagery for undertaking detailed assessments of regional fire regimes. Importantly, substantial effort has been given to the validation of fire mapping products at both scales of resolution. At the savanna-wide scale, fire mapping activities have established that: ( 1) contrary to recent perception, from a national perspective the great majority of burning in any one year typically occurs in the tropical savannas; ( 2) the distribution of burning across the savannas is very uneven, occurring mostly in sparsely settled, higher rainfall, northern coastal and subcoastal regions (north-west Kimberley, Top End of the Northern Territory, around the Gulf of Carpentaria) across a variety of major land uses ( pastoral, conservation, indigenous); whereas ( 3) limited burning is undertaken in regions with productive soils supporting more intensive pastoral management, particularly in Queensland; and ( 4) on a seasonal basis, most burning occurs in the latter half of the dry season, typically as uncontrolled wildfire. Decadal fine-resolution fire histories have also been assembled from multi-scene Landsat imagery for a number of fire-prone large properties (e.g. Kakadu and Nitmiluk National Parks) and local regions ( e. g. Sturt Plateau and Victoria River District, Northern Territory). These studies have facilitated more refined description of various fire regime parameters ( fire extent, seasonality, frequency, interval, patchiness) and, as dealt with elsewhere in this special issue, associated ecological assessments. This paper focuses firstly on the patterning of contemporary fire regimes across the savanna landscapes of northern Australia, and then addresses the implications of these data for our understanding of changes in fire regime since Aboriginal occupancy, and implications of contemporary patterns on biodiversity and emerging greenhouse issues.

J	Bowman, DMJS; Zhang, Y; Walsh, A; Williams, RJ				Bowman, DMJS; Zhang, Y; Walsh, A; Williams, RJ			Experimental comparison of four remote sensing techniques to map tropical savanna fire-scars using Landsat-TM imagery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE					Conference on Fire and Savanna Landscapes in Northern Australia	JUL 08-12, 2002	DARWIN, AUSTRALIA	TSCRC, KCTWM				A landscape-scale fire experiment, conducted over two consecutive dry seasons in a large tract of tropical savanna in northern Australia, was used to evaluate four methods to map fire scars apparent on Landsat-TM imagery: (i) systematic visual; (ii) semi-automated; (iii) automated; and (iv) change detection. All of the methods showed rapid fading of the fire scars. Overall, the automated and visual methods were able to discriminate burnt areas for longer than the other methods. However, the automated method also falsely identified fire-scars on between 5 and 20% of the unburnt catchments prior to the experimental late dry season fire treatments. One cause of the fading appears related to the increased flushing of tree canopies on burnt areas, although the spatially patchy recovery within and between catchments points to the importance of other factors such as the recovery of the ground layer. It appears that Landsat-TM imagery cannot be used to reliably determine the spatial extent and timing of fires in environments with rapid post-fire recovery, such as tropical savannas, thereby limiting the utility of this data source for fine-scale ecological studies.

The analysis reveals the main deficits and development needs, and outlines some possible courses for future action. Specific reference is given to the boreal, Atlantic and continental regions of Europe. Especially the operational definition of biodiversity, the selection of the scale and consideration of the most appropriate indicators and data collection methods are of primary importance when defining a monitoring approach. The results of a recent assessment at national scale contribute to an improved understanding, but show some shortcomings with respect to the level of detail. The high variability of the distribution, structure and composition of forests in Europe can be comprised only partially when the monitoring follows national borders. To detect changes in time for corrective measures and to be able to apply appropriate threshold values for biodiversity indicators a more detailed approach, which takes into account different bio-geographical regions and forest ecosystem types, is needed. Technically, this could be based on aggregation national forest inventories or European-wide sampling scheme combined with remote sensing data and distinct forest types or categories.

J	Gowda, PH; Mulla, DJ; Dalzell, BJ				Gowda, PH; Mulla, DJ; Dalzell, BJ			Examining the targeting of conservation tillage practices to steep vs. flat landscapes in the Minnesota River Basin	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Conservation tillage practices are being prescribed as a remedy to reduce soil erosion and phosphorus losses and to increase water-holding capacity of agricultural soils. This study evaluates the targeting of conservation tillage practices to steep vs. flat landscapes in the Minnesota River Basin. Tillage practices were identified using remote sensing techniques in nine subwatersheds of the Lower Minnesota River watershed and analyzed in relation to topography. A Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image acquired during the 1997 planting season was used to identify conventional and conservation tillage practices at a 30 m (33 yd) resolution. Conservation tillage has been adopted on 32% to 54% of the cropland in the subwatersheds studied, while average cropland slope steepness ranges from 1.5% to 2.8%. A linear regression of percent adoption of conservation tillage vs. average slope steepness had a slope of 3.45 and an r(2) of 0.07. This shows that there was no significant targeting of conservation tillage to steeper topography across subwatersheds. Within a subwatershed, however, there was a slight tendency toward greater adoption of conservation tillage on steeper landscapes, up to slope steepnesses of 5%, then a significant decline in the adoption of conservation tillage. Overall, farmers in the Lower Minnesota River watershed seem to be adopting conservation tillage for reasons unrelated to soil conservation.																	0022-4561					JAN-FEB	2003	58	1					53	57										WOS:000181150900014

Increased anthropogenic interventions into. the natural landscape have carved out separate niche in the biosphere by modifying the ecosystems drastically. In the process we have been loosing biodivenity at faster rate than expected. Hence, sustainable management of our biological resources has become key issue for survival of planet earth. Space has provided holistic view to the planet earth. The satellite remote sensing has enabled to map and monitor vegetation resources in varying scale and time. The geographic information system enables to organize the data sets for analysis and decision making process. India has Made significant efforts to build state of art satellite systems and develop applications to manage the natural resources.' Forest vegetation mapping and biodiversity characterisation at landscape level using satellite remote sensing technology is already an operational tool. Under a national scientific initiative India has developed comprehensive data base on vegetation types, fragmentation, disturbance regimes and biological richness at landscape level in the important ecoregions of the country. This has been achieved by integrating the geospatial information on biological, physical, environmental, social and knowledge base. Remote sensing from space has facilitated systematic and hierarchical approach of biodiversity assessment and its monitoring. Hence biodiversity conservation strategy must include the information for defining the action.																	0250-541X						2003	26	7-8					169	184										WOS:000186875500002						
J	Harvey, KR; Hill, GJE				Harvey, KR; Hill, GJE			Mapping the nesting habitats of saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) in Melacca Swamp and the Adelaide River wetlands, Northern Territory: an approach using remote sensing and GIS	WILDLIFE RESEARCH												The utility of integrating remotely sensed data and other spatial information in a geographical information system (GIS) to model habitat suitability for nesting by saltwater crocodiles ( Crocodylus porosus) was investigated in this study. The study areas, Melacca Swamp and the Adelaide River wetlands, are located 50 km east of Darwin, Northern Territory, and encompass areas of suitable nesting habitat for C. porosus. Melacca Swamp is a highly productive nesting area and is managed as a conservation reserve to protect its nesting habitat. Landsat TM, SPOT satellite imagery and large-scale colour aerial photography were evaluated for their utility in mapping habitats preferred for nesting by C. porosus within Melacca Swamp. Satellite imagery was capable of identifying generalised habitat classes used for nesting ( e. g. open swamp with emergent trees). However, it was only with aerial photography that habitats could be discerned ( e. g. sedges with scattered Melaleuca trees). Spatial information derived from satellite imagery and other sources was integrated in a GIS to model potentially suitable nesting habitat along the Adelaide River. This methodology effectively identified known preferred nesting areas of C. porosus on the basis of the analysis of environmental parameters (i.e. distance to water, vegetation type) that have an influence on selection of nesting habitat. The findings of this research demonstrate the utility of remote sensing and GIS for mapping nesting habitat of C. porosus at a range of scales and provide guidelines for application of the approaches used at the regional or State level.																	1035-3712						2003	30	4					365	375		10.1071/WR00008								WOS:000185267400007

A video camera was used to visualize the flow seeded with tracers. Measurements of free surface flow velocities were then made using particle image velocimetry (PIV) techniques. The velocity measurements were used as input to a hydraulic model, which uses kinematic principles (conservation of mass) to derive three-dimensional flow fields for discharge estimation. A survey of five channel cross sections over a 7.15 m length of stream were made to define the channel bathymetry for the hydraulic model. The average channel width was 5.7 m, and the average depth was 0.2 m. The discharge estimate using the video technique (0.183 m(3)/s) compares well with the current meter discharge measurement (0.192 m(3)/s with an estimated standard error of 6.4%). The root-mean square difference of the depth-averaged velocity at the locations of the current meter measurements was 0.032 m/s. Potential applications of the video imagery technique include measurements of flood flows at ungaged sites, river monitoring from a remote site, and estimation of two- and three-dimensional flow components.																	0043-1397					DEC 27	2002	38	12							1315	10.1029/2002WR001317								WOS:000181249200001						
J	Taulman, JF; Smith, KG				Taulman, JF; Smith, KG			Habitat mapping for bird conservation in North America	BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL												In view of the continuing appropriation and conversion of natural land areas in North America for human uses, there is growing concern about the impacts of changing land use on terrestrial bird species. In order to promote conservation of critical remaining habitats for birds, Partners in Flight (PIF) initiated a project in 1997 in which bird conservation plans were prepared by members in each of 60 ecologically defined physiographical areas throughout the United States. Accurate, nationwide information on the location and extent of vegetative cover types, as well as lands under state and federal management, are critically important elements in the creation of effective bird conservation plans. The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) awarded a challenge grant to The Nature Conservancy's (TNC) Wings of the Americas Program to assist Partners in Flight in acquiring land cover data to serve as the foundation of the planning effort. Canon U.S.A., Inc. and the American Bird Conservancy also contributed support toward this goal. The Center for Advanced Spatial Technology at the University of Arkansas was contracted to produce the needed land cover maps and associated tabular products. Digital land cover databases created by the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Geological Survey, the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, the University of California-Santa Barbara Department of Geography, and the U.S. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics were used in this project. The final spatial products were produced during 1998-1999 and are described in this paper. This effort represents the first nationwide habitat mapping project in the United States aimed at supporting and enhancing conservation of terrestrial bird species.																	0959-2709					DEC	2002	12	4					281	309		10.1017/S09592702002186								WOS:000180506600001						
J	Egbert, SL; Park, S; Price, KP; Lee, RY; Wu, JP; Nellis, AD				Egbert, SL; Park, S; Price, KP; Lee, RY; Wu, JP; Nellis, AD			Using conservation reserve program maps derived from satellite imagery to characterize landscape structure	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE					2nd International Conference on Geospatial Information in Agriculture and Forestry	JAN 10-12, 2000	FLORIDA					The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) instituted one of the largest and most rapid land use/land cover conversions in US history. Approximately 14.8 million ha (36.5 million acres) of cropland were converted to grassland, woodland, and other conservation uses between 1986 and 1995. As policy makers continue to evaluate the future of the program and as scientists examine its effects, it is critical that the impact of CRP on landscape structure be considered because of its potential influence on wildlife populations. Utilizing multi-seasonal Landsat thematic mapper imagery in an unsupervised classification technique, we produced highly accurate maps of cropland and grassland for 1987 and 1992 for Finney County, Kansas. Post-classification differencing identified regions of cropland that had been converted to CRP. We then used the Finney County CRP map to examine changes in landscape structure caused by the introduction of CRP. Using the FRAGSTATS spatial pattern analysis program, we calculated the number of patches, mean patch size, patch density, edge density, mean shape index, nearest neighbor distance, and an interspersion/juxtaposition index. In addition, we calculated total grassland area and percent of area in grassland for the pre- and post-CRP enrollment years. We found that the total grassland area and the percent area in grassland in Finney County increased due to CRP and that mean grassland patch size also increased. The total number of grassland patches decreased, however, due to coalescence of smaller grassland patches. Patch density, edge density, mean shape index, nearest neighbor distance, and the interspersion/juxtaposition index all showed relatively small changes. These small changes appear to reflect geographic differences in CRP effects within the county-large aggregating patches in the northeast were offset by a number of isolated patches of CRP in other areas. The implication of these findings for wildlife managers is that, for species that require large areas of grassland habitat, especially habitat that is contiguous, CRP in Finney County represents a substantial increase in potential habitat. This holds for species at all levels of management interest. ranging from economically valuable species to species that are rare. threatened, and endangered.

J	Melesse, AM; Shih, SF				Melesse, AM; Shih, SF			Spatially distributed storm runoff depth estimation using Landsat images and GIS	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE					2nd International Conference on Geospatial Information in Agriculture and Forestry	JAN 10-12, 2000	FLORIDA					The use of geographic information systems (GISs) and remote sensing to facilitate the estimation of runoff from watershed and agricultural fields has gained increasing attention in recent years. This is mainly due to the fact that rainfall-runoff models include both spatial and geomorphologic variations. The US Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service Curve Number (USDA-NRCS-CN) method was used in this study for determining the runoff depth. Runoff curve number was determined based on the factors of hydrologic soil group, land use, land treatment, and hydrologic conditions. GIS and remote sensing were used to provide quantitative measurements of drainage basin morphology for input into runoff models so as to estimate runoff response. The study was conducted on the S-65A sub-basin of the Kissimmee River basin in south Florida. Land use from Landsat images for 1980, 1990 and 2000 were considered in the study. The process of determining Spatially distributed runoff curve numbers from Landsat images is presented in this study using GIS and image processing software. Spatially distributed runoff curve numbers and runoff depth were determined for the watershed for different land use classes. Results of the study show that land use changes determined from Landsat images are useful in studying the runoff response of the basin. It is shown that the S-65A sub-basin has undergone land use and runoff response changes over the 20 years period of time. The area covered by water and wetlands in 2000 is higher than in 1980 and 1990. In 2000 areas having CN of greater than 90 accounted for 3% compared to 0.9 and 0.6% in 1980 and 1990 respectively. This was due to the increase in wetlands and water covered areas attributed to the Kissimmee River restoration work, which started in 1997 and aimed at restoring lost wetlands and floodplains.

J	Chhabra, A; Palria, S; Dadhwal, VK				Chhabra, A; Palria, S; Dadhwal, VK			Spatial distribution of phytomass carbon in Indian forests	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												A spatial analysis of phytomass carbon (C) in Indian forests for the period (1988-94) at the district-level is reported. District-level forest phytomass C (1988,1994) was computed by combining remote sensing-based forest area inventories on 1:250 000 scale, field inventories of growing stock volume by the Forest Survey of India (FSI), and crown density-based biomass expansion factors. The estimates of forest area inventory, forest phytomass C density, and forest phytomass C pools (1988-94) were linked to the district boundary coverage of India in ARC/INFO Geographic Information System (GIS). Of the total 386 districts examined, only 17 districts had more than 75% forest cover (as percent of their geographic area) in 1988. Estimated district-level forest phytomass C densities ranged from 4.3 to 206.8 MgC ha(-1)*. At the national level, forest phytomass C pool was estimated to be 3871.2 and 3874.3 TgC# in 1988 and 1994, respectively. Although the aggregated national estimates were similar, the district-level change analysis indicated a decrease of 77.8 TgC and an increase of 81 TgC (1988-94). The highest decrease of 10.4 TgC was observed in Vishakapatnam district (Andhra Pradesh) while largest increase of 9.8 TgC in Bastar district (Madhya Pradesh) resulting from deforestation and afforestation activities, respectively. At the national level, the total forest cover decreased by similar to0.6 Mha, however, the district-level spatial analysis indicated an increase of 1.07 Mha, and decrease of 1.65 Mha forest cover during 1988-94 period. Although, this is the first district level phytomass C analysis of Indian forests, the aggregated results at state-level were close to the earlier estimates. The spatial analysis identified the districts that have undergone significant changes in their forest phytomass C during the study period. This improved understanding of forest phytomass C pools is important to sustainable development and conservation of forests, mitigation strategies for C sequestration, and accurate estimation of contribution of land use changes to C emission in India.

This article assesses the current state of landscape fragmentation and structure on the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica, using Landsat Multispectral Scanner and Thematic Mapper satellite scenes between 19 79 and 1997. The Osa Peninsula hosts the Corcovado National Park, which contains the only protected region of Tropical Wet forest on the Pacific slopes of Mesoamerica, including a significant number of species that are endemic. threatened, or new to science. The level of isolation of the Corcovado National Park is based on the degree of ecosystem degradation produced by frontal deforestation processes. Our results indicate that the proportion of the Osa Peninsula covered by forest declined from 97% in 1979 to 9196 in 1987 and to 89% by 1997. Total forest area declined from 977 km(2) in 1979 to 896 km(2) by 1997. These results pose significant questions regarding the effectiveness of current conservation efforts in this mountain biodiversity-rich area of Mesoamerica.

J	Sekhar, KR; Rao, BV				Sekhar, KR; Rao, BV			Evaluation of sediment yield by using remote sensing and GIS: a case study from the Phulang Vagu watershed, Nizamabad District (AP), India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The primary objective of this paper is to identify soil erosion zones and to suggest appropriate measures for control of soil erosion using remote sensing, GIS and conventional technique in the Phulang Vagu watershed in the Sriramsagar catchment area of Andhra Pradesh. The digital imagery data of the study area is obtained from the IRS-IC (LISS-III) satellite whereas the toposheets and rainfall data of the study area were obtained from the Survey of India. Satellite images were interpreted to prepare land use/land cover maps by using ERDAS image processing system. Out of 725.983 km(2) of the study area, about 301.435 km(2) is wasteland which is identified as susceptible for soil erosion. Toposheets of the study area were used to prepare drainage and slope maps. Drainage pattern is mainly dendritic with a density of 1.26 km(-1) and the stream slope is 0.00614. The arithmetric average method is used to find average annual rainfall. The above parameters were used to calculate the amount of soil erosion from the catchment area. It was found that 882.389 m(3) km(-2) year(-1) of soil is being eroded from the catchment area which is more than the value adopted in the design of Sriramsagar reservoir. Therefore soil conservation measures such as vegetative cover in the waste land are needed and 12 check dam sites have been proposed by superimposing drainage map and slope map in conjunction with land use/land cover map. With these soil conservation measures, the soil erosion could be kept within the design value of Sriramsagar reservoir.																	0143-1161					OCT 10	2002	23	20					4499	4509		10.1080/01431160110110992								WOS:000178337700021

We also analyzed changes in forest patterns by land ownership for three major river basins within the ecoregion (Eel, Klamath, and Rogue) using FRAGSTATS. Overall, forests covered 66.8% of the ecoregion in 1972 and 62.1% in 1992. Approximately 10.5% of the forest area was disturbed overall, translating into an annual disturbance rate of 0.53%. Although public lands accounted for a slightly higher total area of forest disturbance, private lands were cut at a slightly higher rate. Forest disturbance within fifth level watersheds averaged 13.2%, but reached as high as 93.2%. For the three river basins where spatial pattern of forest disturbance was analyzed, private lands were already more fragmented than public lands in 1972. Over the 20-year time period, forest fragmentation increased on all ownerships. Fragmentation rates on public lands were high for all basins especially the Rogue. Clearcut logging on private lands was generally in larger adjacent tracts, whereas cuts on public lands were generally smaller and more dispersed. Our results illustrate the importance of considering landscape change history when planning for effective biodiversity conservation in forested ecoregions and when formulating ecologically sustainable forest management strategies.																	0921-2973					OCT	2002	17	5					455	470		10.1023/A:1021274701133								WOS:000179388800007

Satellite remote sensing has been effectively used to distinguish relatively intact and degraded forests at a number of scales. However, the utility of remote sensing data for rapid and cost-effective assessments of habitat intactness across large and regions has not been adequately tested. To this end, we tested the ability of TM imagery to rapidly discriminate different levels of habitat degradation across large regions of the Chihuahuan Desert. We were able to identify relatively intact habitat in many cases. However, degraded habitat was often misidentified as relatively intact. The use of both mid- and late-season imagery provides some improvement by highlighting phenological differences among the intactness classes. Overall, low vegetation cover and inter- and intra-seasonal variability diminish the utility of TM imagery for large-scale conservation planning in the Chihuahuan Desert.

J	Biswas, S; Sudhakar, S; Desai, VR				Biswas, S; Sudhakar, S; Desai, VR			Remote sensing and geographic information system based approach for watershed conservation	JOURNAL OF SURVEYING ENGINEERING-ASCE												Conservation of natural resources is essential to sustain any developmental activity, and such measures especially for soil and water carried out on a watershed basis are very useful for watershed management. In this context, prioritization of watersheds is required for different watershed components so as to take any further relevant conservation measures. Recent technological advances have brought remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques to the forefront as tools for recommending these conservation measures. In the present study, the topmost priority subwatershed (i.e., Murli subwatershed in the Subarnarekha Basin) among nine subwatersheds forming a major portion of the Nayagram block in the Midnapore district of West Bengal State in eastern India was considered. This subwatershed was further divided into 44 microwatersheds (with areas less than 10 km(2)), which were prioritized based on morphometric parameters. Accordingly, suitable soil conservation measures were suggested. For the sake of completeness, the number of the microwatersheds in which these proposed check dam sites fall was also identified. From this study, it can be inferred that prioritization of microwatersheds is essential; GIS is handy as well as effective in recommending proper treatment for these microwatersheds.																	0733-9453					AUG	2002	128	3					108	124		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9453(2002)128:3(108)								WOS:000176963900003

This paper describes a system for monitoring carbon in New Zealand's forests and shrublands (6.3 and 2.6 million ha. respectively), which was tested on a 60 km-wide transect across the South Island. A 9 km(2) grid was superimposed onto a land-cover map (SPOT imagery) to obtain 62 ground-sampling points. New permanent plots were established at 43 of these points and 18 existing plots were revisited (one site was inaccessible). On each plot, the dimensions of all trees, shrubs and coarse woody debris (CWD) were measured, and these measurements converted to per-hectare C-stocks using regression relationships. C-stocks in fine litter and mineral soil were quantified using data from New Zealand's national soil-C monitoring system that quantifies national-scale soil-C stocks using a soil-C database stratified by soil type. climate, and land-cover; we used these data to derive values for the transect. The total C-stock in all pools was 290 t/ha in forests and 163 t/ha in shrublands, 58 and 30% of which was living biomass (respectively). The living biomass components had the greatest variances, so precision could be improved by increasing the sample size of trees, particularly large trees. The C-stock of CWD was highly variable among plots, but was a relatively small component of the total C-stock (10% forest and 3% shrubland). For the moment, we know little about the uncertainty associated with measuring C-sequestration (i.e. change in C-stocks over time), but this information will become available when plots are resampled. Our network of permanent plots is designed deliberately to be simple and measurements of interest to conservation biologists, such as species composition and structure are included in the hope of protecting it against inevitable shifts in policy and focus. We discuss methodological issues including generalized allometric relationship, the propagation of errors, and better integration of remote-sensing and ground-based approaches, all of which have been considered in the development of this system.

The data produced from this survey consist of the area containing water on many thousands of wetland basins (i.e., prairie potholes). We propose a two-state model containing wet and dry states. This model provides a concise description of wet probability, i.e., the probability that a basin contains water, and the amount of water contained in wet basins. The two model components are spatially linked through a common latent effect, which is assumed to be spatially correlated. Model fitting and prediction is carried out using 'Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The model primarily facilitates mapping of habitat conditions, which is useful in varied monitoring and assessment capacities. More importantly, the predictive capability of the model provides a rigorous statistical framework for directing management and conservation activities by enabling characterization of habitat structure at any point on the landscape.

J	Qin, ZH; Berliner, P; Karnieli, A				Qin, ZH; Berliner, P; Karnieli, A			Micrometeorological modeling to understand the thermal anomaly in the sand dunes across the Israel-Egypt border	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												A thermal anomaly was observed on the remote sensing images in the sand dunes across the Israel-Egypt border. The Israeli side with more vegetation cover has higher (> 2degreesC) land surface temperature (LST) during the day than the Egyptian side where bare sand prevails. This anomaly is very obvious at about noon in the hot dry summer season. A micrometeorological model has been established in terms of surface energy balance for simulating the surface temperature change and heat flux variation of the region. The purpose of this modeling is to understand the mechanism leading to the occurrence of the thermal anomaly and to reveal the key factors controlling the surface temperature change. The characteristic of the model lies in its coupling soil temperature changing simultaneously with soil moisture movement, described as two differential equations. The methodology for the numerical solution of the model has been developed. The required meteorological data and soil parameters were measured at the study region in the hot summer season for the simulation. Two typical and the most important surface patterns of the region are considered: biogenic crust representing the Israeli side and the bare sand representing the Egyptian side. Results from simulation indicate that surface albedo contributes most to the surface temperature difference between the two typical surfaces, which is followed by sub-soil properties (mainly soil moisture) difference. Biogenic crust has lower surface albedo than bare sand. Consequently, it absorbs much more incident sky radiation. During the hot summer season, the region is very dry and vegetation is in dormancy. The canopy of most shrubs reduces to minimum. Even though the Israeli side has more vegetation, the evapo-transpiration contributed by the vegetation is still very small (< 7%) in comparison with the net radiation. This small latent heat flux has little effect on the surface energy balance process in the and environment. LST change in the desert region is mainly controlled by the amount of incident solar energy absorbed by the ground as soil heat. Therefore, the anomalous LST change and thermal variation on both sides of the region can still be explained as the direct result of the obvious albedo difference on both sides. This albedo difference is mainly caused by the sharp contrast of surface composition especially different biogenic crust and bare sand cover rates on both sides. The overgrazing and other anthropogenic stresses are the direct reasons leading to the bare sand (high albedo) prevalent on the Egyptian side while the conservation policy helps the development of biogenic crust and vegetation (low albedo) on the Israeli side.
