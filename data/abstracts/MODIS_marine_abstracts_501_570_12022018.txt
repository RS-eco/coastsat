Assessment of uncertainty in the ocean reflectance determined by three satellite ocean color sensors (MERIS, SeaWiFS and MODIS-A) at an offshore site in the Mediterranean Sea (BOUSSOLE project)	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The match-up of satellite-derived reflectances with in situ observations is crucial to evaluate their quality and temporal stability. To contribute to this effort, a project has been set up to collect a data set of in situ radiometric and bio-optical quantities, in support to satellite ocean color calibration and validation. The project has been named "BOUSSOLE'', and one of its key elements is a deep-sea optics mooring collecting data on a near-continuous basis since September 2003. This buoy is deployed in the deep clear waters of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, and is visited on a monthly basis for servicing and acquisition of complementary data. The characteristics of the work area establish the site as a satisfactory location for validating satellite ocean color observations. A description of the data processing protocols is provided, followed by an analysis of the uncertainty of the buoy radiometry measurements. The results of a match-up analysis of the marine reflectances, diffuse attenuation coefficients, and chlorophyll concentrations for three major missions, i.e., MERIS, SeaWiFS, and MODIS-A, are then analyzed. They show poor performances for the bluest band (412 nm) of the three sensors, and performances within requirements at 443 and 490 nm for SeaWiFS and MODIS-A. These results suggest that a vicarious calibration should be introduced for the MERIS sensor. This analysis also demonstrates that a major effort is still required to improve atmospheric correction procedures whatever the mission.

J	[Anonymous]				[Anonymous]			Influence of circulation parameters on the AOD variations over the Bay of Bengal during ICARB	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												(Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) level-3 aerosol data, NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction) reanalysis winds and QuikSCAT ocean surface winds were made use of to examine the role of atmospheric circulation in governing aerosol variations over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) during the first phase of the ICARB (Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budget) campaign (March 18-April 12, 2006). An inter-comparison between MODIS level-3 aerosol optical depth (AOD) data and ship-borne MICROTOPS measurements showed good agreement with correlation 0.92 (p 0.0001) and a mean MODIS underestimation by 0.01. During the study period, the AOD over BoB showed high values in the northern/north western regions, which reduced towards the central and southern BoB. The wind patterns in lower atmospheric layers (> 850 hPa) indicated that direct transport of aerosols from central India was inhibited by the presence of a high pressure and a divergence over BoB in the lower altitudes. On the other hand, in the upper atmospheric levels, winds from central and northern India stretched south eastwards and converged over BoB with a negative vorticity indicative of a downdraft. These wind patterns pointed to the possibility of aerosol transport from central India to BoB by upper level winds. This mechanism was further confirmed by the significant correlations that AOD variations over BoB showed with aerosol flux convergence and flux vorticity at upper atmospheric levels (600-500 hPa). AOD in central and southern BoB away from continental influences displayed an exponential dependence on the QuikSCAT measured ocean surface wind speed. This study shows that particles transported from central and northern India by upper atmospheric circulations as well as the marine aerosols generated by ocean surface winds contributed to the AOD over the BoB during the first phase of ICARB.																	0253-4126					JUL	2008	117				1		353	360										WOS:000258534800012

Analysis of marine aerosol optical depth retrieved from IRS-P4 OCM sensor and comparison with the aerosol derived from SeaWiFS and MODIS sensor	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												Aerosol optical depth is regularly derived from SeaWiFS and MODIS sensor and used by the scientific community in various climatic studies. In the present study an attempt has been made to retrieve the aerosol optical depth using the IRS-P4 OCM sensor data and a comparison has been carried out using few representative datasets. The results show that the IRS-P4 OCM retrieved aerosol optical depth is in good agreement with the aerosols retrieved from SeaWiFS as well as MODIS. The RMSE are found to be +/- 0.0522 between OCM and SeaWIFS and +/- 0.0638 between OCM and MODIS respectively. However, IRS-P4 OCM sensor retrieved aerosol optical depth is closer to SeaWiFS (correlation = 0.88, slope = 0.96 and intercept = -0.013) compared to MODIS (correlation = 0.75, slope = 0.91 and intercept = 0.0198). The mean percentage difference indicates that OCM retrieved AOD is +12% higher compared to SeaWiFS and +8% higher compared to MODIS. The mean absolute percentage between OCM derived AOD and SeaWiFS is found to be less (16%) compared to OCM and MODIS (20%).

J	Radi, T; de Vernal, A				Radi, Taoufik; de Vernal, Anne			Dinocysts as proxy of primary productivity in mid-high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere	MARINE MICROPALEONTOLOGY												In order to explore the potential of dinocyst assemblages in marine sediment as a proxy for primary productivity, we analyzed a reference "modern" database including 1171 sites from the North Atlantic Ocean (n = 483), the Arctic Ocean (n = 401) and the North Pacific Ocean (n = 287). We compiled two sets of primary productivity data derived from satellite observations: (1) The dataset from the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) program applied to observations from 1978 to 1989 and (2) the data set from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) program using observations from 2002 to 2005. We performed canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) on a data matrix that included 62 dinocyst taxa and eight sea-surface parameters (winter and summer salinity, winter and summer temperature, sea-ice cover, summer, winter and annual primary productivity). CCA results show that primary productivity is a determinant parameter of dinocyst assemblages (including both phototrophic and heterotrophic taxa) in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and at hemispheric scale. In the North Pacific, the relationship between productivity and dinocyst assemblages is particularly strong. We tested the modern analogue technique to reconstruct productivity using the North Atlantic, North Pacific, Arctic and hemispheric dinocyst data sets. With the exception of the Arctic Ocean alone, which is characterized by overall low productivity, productivity Can be estimated with an accuracy (Root Mean Square Error = RMSE) of +/- 11-25%. The best performance is obtained for reconstruction of winter productivity from the MODIS data. It is noteworthy that the RMSE for all estimated productivity parameters is narrower than the mean differences between productivity data derived from the MODIS and CZCS data sets. Therefore, we conclude that dinocysts can be used to reconstruct productivity with an accuracy equivalent to that of primary productivity estimated from satellite observations. Application of the approach in a sedimentary core from the northwest North Atlantic (core HU 91-045-094) revealed large amplitude variations of productivity over the last 25,000 years. The use of both MODIS and CZCS datasets indicate generally low productivity during the glacial stage, the Younger Dryas and Heinrich events, with annual productivity of less than 100 gC m(-2). The reconstructions also suggest higher productivity during the early Holocene, especially based on the MODIS data that suggest annual values of up to 350 gC m(-2). (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Open cellular structure in marine stratocumulus sheets	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Geostationary and Sun-synchronous satellite data and in situ observations from ship cruises are used to investigate the formation of open cellular structure in marine stratocumulus clouds over the southeast Pacific (SEP). Open cellular convection either forms spontaneously as pockets of open cells (POCs) within overcast stratocumulus, or is advected into the region from midlatitude regions. POC formation occurs most frequently during the latter part of the night, demonstrating that this transition is not caused by solar absorption-driven decoupling. The transition preferentially occurs in clouds with low 11-3.9 mu m nighttime brightness temperature difference (BTD) which is found to be well correlated with both in situ measured accumulation mode aerosol concentration and cloud droplet concentration estimates derived from MODIS. Besides indicating that nighttime BTD is an excellent proxy for stratocumulus cloud droplet concentration N-d, this also suggests that low aerosol concentrations favor POC formation. Indeed, extremely low accumulation mode aerosol concentrations are found during the passage of open cell events over the ship. Free-tropospheric moisture is not found to be an important factor in POC formation. Significant subseasonal variability occurs in the fractional coverage of open cellular convection over the broader SEP. This coverage is well correlated with a MODIS-derived drizzle proxy (MDP) proportional to the ratio of liquid water path (LWP) to N-d for predominantly overcast regions. Both LWP and N-d variability influences the MDP. Periods of low MDP have significant positive large-scale N-d anomalies and are preceded by offshore winds at 850 hPa, which suggests a potential continental influence upon open cell formation over the SEP. Together, the results suggest important two-way interactions between aerosols and drizzle in marine stratocumulus and a role for drizzle in modulating the large-scale albedo of these cloud systems.

Phytoplankton are the base of the ecosystem food chain for many higher trophic organisms, so identifying phytoplankton biomass distribution is the first step in understanding the dynamic environment for effective management of the GMR. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and hyperspectral surface acquisition system derived chlorophyll, in-situ chlorophyll fluorescence, nitrate, salinity, and temperature were collected from March 2005 to the onset of a mild El Nino in November 2006. Islands in the eastern GMR, such as San Cristobal and Espanola, are the first to experience impacts of El Nino and southern migration of the Equatorial Front. Productive habitats were defined as surface waters with salinities > 34, temperatures < 24 degrees C, and chlorophyll a > 0.4 mg m(-3). Six temporally variable productive habitats identified were: west of Isabela Island, southwest of Floreana Island, south of Santa Cruz, between Santiago and Santa Cruz Islands, and on the eastern side near San Cristobal Island. Model results coupled with surface acquisition system derived chlorophyll indicated productive habitats may also occur for short periods and at a distance from islands such as when the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) and South Equatorial Current (SEC) collide over the seamounts north of Isabela Island. All productive habitats were related to topographic upwelling from the EUC into surface waters. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A SAR observation and numerical study on ocean surface imprints of Atmospheric Vortex Streets	SENSORS												The sea surface imprints of Atmospheric Vortex Street (AVS) off Aleutian Volcanic Islands, Alaska were observed in two RADARSAT-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images separated by about 11 hours. In both images, three pairs of distinctive vortices shedding in the lee side of two volcanic mountains can be clearly seen. The length and width of the vortex street are about 60-70 km and 20 km, respectively. Although the AVS's in the two SAR images have similar shapes, the structure of vortices within the AVS is highly asymmetrical. The sea surface wind speed is estimated from the SAR images with wind direction input from Navy NOGAPS model. In this paper we present a complete MM5 model simulation of the observed AVS. The surface wind simulated from the MM5 model is in good agreement with SAR-derived wind. The vortex shedding rate calculated from the model run is about 1 hour and 50 minutes. Other basic characteristics of the AVS including propagation speed of the vortex, Strouhal and Reynolds numbers favorable for AVS generation are also derived. The wind associated with AVS modifies the cloud structure in the marine atmospheric boundary layer. The AVS cloud pattern is also observed on a MODIS visible band image taken between the two RADARSAT SAR images. An ENVISAT advance SAR image taken 4 hours after the second RADARSAT SAR image shows that the AVS has almost vanished.

J	Gasso, S				Gasso, Santiago			Satellite observations of the impact of weak volcanic activity on marine clouds	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Because emissions from weak volcanic eruptions tend to remain in the low troposphere, they may have a significant radiative impact through the indirect effect on clouds. However, this type of volcanic activity is underreported and its global impact has been assessed only by model simulations constrained with very limited observations. First observations of the impact of high- latitude active volcanoes on marine boundary layer clouds are reported here. These observations were made using a combination of standard derived products and visible images from the MODIS, AMSR- E and GOES detectors. Two distinctive effects are identified. When there is an existing boundary layer cloud deck, an increase in cloud brightness and a decrease in both cloud effective radius and liquid water content were observed immediately downwind of the volcanoes. The visible appearance of these "volcano tracks'' resembles the effect of man-made ship tracks. When synoptic conditions favor low cloudiness, the volcano plume ( or volcano cloud) increases significantly the cloud cover downwind. The volcano cloud can extend for hundreds of kilometers until mixing with background clouds. Unlike violent eruptions, the volcano clouds reported here ( the Aleutian Islands in the North Pacific and the South Sandwich Islands in the South Atlantic) have retrieved microphysical properties similar to those observed in ship tracks. However, when comparing the volcano clouds from these two regions, liquid water content can decrease, increase or remain unchanged with respect to nearby unperturbed clouds. These differences suggest that composition at the source, type of eruption and meteorological conditions influence the evolution of the cloud.

The impact of high-resolution sea surface temperatures on the simulated nocturnal Florida marine boundary layer	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												High- and low-resolution sea surface temperature (SST) analysis products are used to initialize the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model for May 2004 for short-term forecasts over Florida and surrounding waters. Initial and boundary conditions for the simulations were provided by a combination of observations, large-scale model output, and analysis products. The impact of using a l-km Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) SST composite on subsequent evolution of the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) is assessed through simulation comparisons and limited validation. Model results are presented for individual simulations, as well as for aggregates of easterly- and westerly-dominated low-level flows. The simulation comparisons show that the use of MODIS SST composites results in enhanced convergence zones, earlier and more intense horizontal convective rolls, and an increase in precipitation as well as a change in precipitation location. Validation of 10-m winds with buoys shows a slight improvement in wind speed. The most significant results of this study are that 1) vertical wind stress divergence and pressure gradient accelerations across the Florida Current region vary in importance as a function of flow direction and stability and 2) the warmer Florida Current in the MODIS product transports heat vertically and downwind of this heat source, modifying the thermal structure and the MABL wind field primarily through pressure gradient adjustments.

Two stations (D1 and D2) were sampled on June 24, and D2 was resampled 6 days later; chlorophyll-a concentration had decreased by about one half. LAC MODIS-Chla images were obtained and showed the spread of the bloom on the day after sampling. The phytoplankton community consisted primarily of dinoflagellate temporary cysts, mainly at the surface and at 5 m in station D1. Two Pseudo-nitzschia species (P. australis, P. seriata) were also very abundant. Samples from the bloom had a specific phytoplankton absorption coefficient (a*(ph)(lambda)) lower than the rest of the samples. Values varied from 0.0186 to 0.0455 m(2) mg(-1) for a*(ph)(440) and from 0.0092 to 0.0294 m(2) mg(-1) for a*(ph) (675), with ratios a*(ph)(440): a*(ph)(675) ranging from 0.99 to 2.20. These low ratios were associated with the combined effect of packaging, and with the relatively high ratios of fucoxanthin, peridinin, diadinoxanthin and chlorophyll-c2 to TChla. Samples from the surface and 5 m depth at station D1 had higher ratios of Perid:TChla (0.12-0.32) than the rest of the samples, suggesting that cysts have similar Perid:TChla as free-living dinoflagellates. An unusual absorption spectrum with a broad maximum around 480-500 nm was associated with the high proportion of cysts and diatoms. The slope of the spectra between 443 and 488 nm was a good index to differentiate bloom samples containing high proportions of dinoflagellate temporary cysts. Further investigation of the absorption properties of dinoflagellate cysts is needed in order to detect these waters by remote sensing. Although much work is still necessary to understand and explain the bio-optical properties of a bloom, the present study is the first assessment off the Baja California coast to simultaneously consider aspects such as absorption properties, pigment composition and to include a spatial evaluation of the extension of a bloom with satellite images.

In this study, cases of positive correlation were found over certain portions of the world by analyzing the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite products, together with a general finding that DER may increase or decrease with aerosol loading depending on environmental conditions. The slope of the correlation between DER and AOD is driven primarily by water vapor amount, which explains 70% of the variance in our study. Various potential artifacts that may cause the positive relation are investigated including the effects of aerosol swelling, partially cloudy, atmospheric dynamics, cloud three-dimensional (3-D) and surface influence effects. None seems to be the primary cause for the observed phenomenon, although a certain degree of influence exists for some of the factors. Analyses are conducted over seven regions around the world representing different types of aerosols and clouds. Only two regions show positive dependence of DER on AOD, near coasts of the Gulf of Mexico and South China Sea, which implies physical processes may at work. Using a 2-D Goddard Cumulus Ensemble model (GCE) with spectral-bin microphysics which incorporated a reformulation of the Kohler theory, two possible physical mechanisms are hypothesized. They are related to the effects of slightly soluble organics (SSO) particles and giant cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Model simulations show a positive correlation between DER and AOD, due to a decrease in activated aerosols with an increasing SSO content. Addition of a few giant CCNs also increases the DER. Further investigations are needed to fully understand and clarify the observed phenomenon.

Evaluation of MODIS ocean colour products at a northeast United States coast site near the Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) marine and atmospheric products were evaluated using match- ups of MODIS and in situ measurements collected by an above- water radiometric system, the SeaWiFS Photometer Revision for Incident Surface Measurements ( SeaPRISM), deployed near the Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory from 2004 to 2005.

With a restricted match- up criterion, the result shows that the MODIS- retrieved Lwn at 488, 531 and 551nm agree very well with SeaPRISM measurements, giving mean per cent differences d(%) of 37%, absolute mean per cent differences | d|(%) of,16%, and coefficient of determination R 2 of 0.84- 0.88. However, the MODIS- retrieved Lwn at 412nm are underestimated significantly with d(%), | d|(%) and R 2 of 235%, 57% and 0.32, respectively, corresponding to a consistent overestimation and underestimation for the MODIS- retrieved ta( 870) and a( 531), respectively.

Interannual variability of smoke and warm cloud relationships in the Amazon as inferred from MODIS retrievals	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Aerosol and cloud data from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Earth Observing System (EOS) Aqua are used to investigate interannual variability of smoke and warm cloud relationships during the dry-to-wet transition season (August-October) over the Amazon for two years and its association with meteorological conditions. In one year (2003), smoke aerosols are associated with an increase of cloud fraction and a decrease of cloud effective radius. These effects amplify the cooling at the surface and at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) caused by the aerosol extinction. However, in another year (2002) the cloud fraction decreases with increasing aerosol optical depth. Such a decrease of cloud fraction could offset the effect of increased reflection of solar radiation by the aerosols both at the surface and at TOA. The changes in radiative fluxes between these years would contribute to interannual changes of surface energy fluxes and radiative balance at the top of the atmosphere and influence variability of the wet season onset in the basin. In 2003, the atmosphere was more humid and less stable. These conditions may be relatively favorable for the activation of aerosol particles into cloud condensation nuclei and hence cloud droplets. In 2002, the clouds were less extensive and thinner in a relatively dry atmosphere and presumably dissipated more easily. This study suggests that the aerosol-cloud relation can be influenced by atmospheric structure and convective motions, in addition to changes in aerosols properties. An adequate characterization of aerosol-cloud relationship would require a longer time series of data that includes a variety of climate conditions. The caveat of this analysis is that differences in aerosol absorption and its vertical distribution may have contributed to the observed interannual change of smoke-cloud relationship but could not be determined due to lack of adequate measurements.

Although a regional Arctic OC4L algorithm was designed to be applicable to high northern latitudes, its applicability remains uncertain. To examine these issues, we investigated the light absorption coefficients of phytoplankton, non-algal particles (NAP), and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and remote sensing reflectance, R-rs(lambda), covering most of the western Arctic Ocean. A higher pigment packaging effect was identified relative to that at lower latitudes. The CDOM absorption dominated and accounted for 76% of the total non-water absorption at 443 nm and did not covary with variations in chla. This absorption is significantly higher than those in other marine environments. We also examined the backscattering coefficient of particles obtained from the inversion of R-rs(lambda) and found that it covaried well with variation in NAP absorption. Our evaluation shows that when turbid waters (R-rs(670) > 0.00042 sr(-1)) are excluded, the performance of the OC4L is good and much better than that of the sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS) OC4V4 and the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) OC3M (root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.13, 0.21, and 0.22, respectively). The reason why the OC4L performs well despite strong CDOM absorption is discussed.

MODIS observations of ship tracks in summertime stratus off the west coast of the United States	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												Three years of I-km Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations for morning (Terra) and afternoon (Aqua) summertime marine stratus off the west coast of the United States were analyzed to determine the response of the clouds to aerosols in the plumes of underlying ships. The polluted clouds were identified in pixels with elevated 2.1-mu m reflectivities and 3.7-mu m radiances when compared with nearby pixels that contained unpolluted clouds. An automated routine was developed to identify which of the pixels contained clouds polluted by underlying ships and then to select unpolluted control pixels on both sides of the ship track as near as was feasible to the polluted clouds, often with a separation of as little as 1 pixel. While no requirements were placed on the cloud cover fraction-within the selected pixels, to facilitate comparisons with an earlier study based on 1-km Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery, the results presented here are restricted to 20-pixel segments along the ship tracks in which all of the pixels identified as polluted and all of the pixels selected as controls on both sides of the tracks were found to be overcast. The pollution caused about a 20% reduction in droplet radius in both the MODIS and the AVHRR observations. In the MODIS observations, the increase in optical depth was about 15% and statistically significant at a confidence level greater than 99.5%. These changes were much larger than the 2% and statistically negligible increases found for the AVHRR observations. Like the AVHRR observations, the MODIS observations indicated that the majority of clouds (60%) lost liquid water when polluted, but consistent with the different outcomes for the optical depths, the losses for the MODIS observations were about half the nearly 20% loss found in the AVHRR observations. Cloud altitudes were unaffected by the pollution for both the MODIS and the AVHRR observations. For both morning and afternoon clouds, those with the largest increases in albedo in response to the pollution also showed the largest increases in cloud liquid water amount. The changes in droplet radii and liquid water amounts retrieved using the MODIS observations suggested that droplet growth was suppressed in the polluted clouds and that the rate of growth from cloud base to cloud top was also reduced when compared with nearby unpolluted clouds.																	0022-4928					DEC	2007	64	12					4330	4345		10.1175/2007JAS2308.1								WOS:000251896400009

MODIS derived fine mode fraction characteristics of marine, dust, and anthropogenic aerosols over the ocean, constrained by GOCART, MOPITT, and TOMS	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												One year (December 2003 to November 2004) of Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS), and Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) data over the open ocean are used in conjunction with the Goddard Chemistry Transport Model (GOCART) to characterize differing aerosol types as a function of satellite observable parameters. GOCART model output is used to select regions that are dominated (at least 80% of the total aerosol optical thickness from a single aerosol species) by anthropogenic (black carbon + organic carbon + sulfate), dust (DU) and sea salt regions (SS). Aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and fine mode fraction (FMF) retrieved from MODIS are averaged for each aerosol species region at 1 month intervals to examine the observational differences among each aerosol species. Anthropogenic (AN) aerosols are further separated into those produced primarily from biomass burning (BB) versus those from combustion and industrial pollution (PO). TOMS ultraviolet absorbing aerosol index (AI) in conjunction with MOPITT carbon monoxide (CO) data sets on Terra are used to contrast the differences between BB and PO aerosol properties. Annually averaged estimates for SS, DU, and AN MODIS FMF are 0.25 +/- 0.07, 0.45 +/- 0.05, and 0.84 +/- 0.04, respectively, in agreement with or slightly lower than previous estimates. However, FMF values were observed to change substantially as a function of space and time as regions dominated by single aerosol types shrink, expand, and move around from month to month. The greatest variability in FMF was observed for SS and DU aerosols. SS are associated with regions of high near-surface wind speeds in the Southern Hemisphere, which have large temporal and spatial variations. Dust transport off of the Saharan Desert is maximized in the Northern Hemisphere summer, increasing the area of predominately dust aerosols. MODIS aerosol effective radius for each aerosol type also showed a similar trend with SS, DU, and AN values of 1.03, 0.68, and 0.32 mu m. TOMS-AI values for DU exceeded SS and AN values up to 100% between April and October 2004 in association with the greatest dust concentrations in the North Atlantic. For BB and PO components of AN aerosols, no significant difference in MODIS FMF were observed; however, substantial differences in TOMS-AI and MOPITT values were observed between BB and PO aerosols, especially between June and November. For both TOMS-AI and MOPITT CO, BB aerosols are generally associated with higher values than are PO aerosols. The use of GOCART to constrain regions where a dominant aerosol species exists has allowed a comprehensive analysis of the satellite observed properties of various aerosol species.

In overcast conditions, the microwave and optical estimates are comparable; however, as cloud fraction decreases microwave retrievals strongly and increasingly overestimate optical ones. This positive microwave bias cannot be explained neither by the elimination of negative values in the operational Wentz dataset, nor by the somewhat reduced sensitivity of MODIS cloud detection to small clouds.

River plume patterns and dynamics within the Southern California Bight	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Stormwater river plumes are important vectors of marine contaminants and pathogens in the Southern California Bight. Here we report the results of a multi-institution investigation of the river plumes across eight major river systems of southern California. We use in situ water samples from multi-day cruises in combination with MODIS satellite remote sensing, buoy meteorological observations, drifters, and HF radar current measurements to evaluate the dispersal patterns and dynamics of the freshwater plumes. River discharge was exceptionally episodic, and the majority of storm discharge occurred in a few hours. The combined plume observing techniques revealed that plumes commonly detach from the coast and turn to the left, which is the opposite direction of Coriolis influence. Although initial offshore velocity of the buoyant plumes was similar to 50 cm/s and was influenced by river discharge inertia (i.e., the direct momentum of the river flux) and buoyancy, subsequent advection of the plumes was largely observed in an alongshore direction and dominated by local winds. Due to the multiple day upwelling wind conditions that commonly follow discharge events, plumes were observed to flow from their respective river mouths to down-coast waters at rates of 20-40 km/d. Lastly, we note that suspended-sediment concentration and beam-attenuation were poorly correlated with plume salinity across and within the sampled plumes (mean r(2) = 0.12 and 0.25, respectively), while colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) fluorescence was well correlated (mean r(2) = 0.56), suggesting that CDOM may serve as a good tracer of the discharged freshwater in subsequent remote sensing and monitoring efforts of plumes.

Examining the consistency of products derived from various ocean color sensors in open ocean (Case 1) waters in the perspective of a multi-sensor approach	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												During its lifetime, a space-borne ocean color sensor provides world-wide information about important biogeochemical properties of the upper ocean every 2 to 4 days in cloudless regions. Merging simultaneous or complementary data from such sensors to obtain better spatial and temporal coverage is a recurring objective, but it can only be reached if the consistency of the sensor-specific products, as delivered by the various Space Agencies, has first been carefully examined. The goal of the present study is to provide a procedure for establishing a coherency of open ocean (Case-1 waters) data products, for which the various data processing methods are sufficiently similar. The development of the procedure includes a detailed comparison of the marine algorithms used (after atmospheric corrections) by space agencies for the production of standard products, such as the chlorophyll concentration, [Ch1], and the diffuse attenuation coefficient, K-d. The MODIS-Aqua, SeaWiFS and MERIS [Ch1] products agree over a wide range, between similar to 0.1 and 3 mg m(-3), whereas increasing divergences occur for oligotrophic waters ([Ch1] (from 0.02 to 0.09 mg m(-3)). For the K-d(490) coefficient, different algorithms are in use, with differing results. Based on a semi-analytical reflectance model and hyperspectral approach, the present work proposes a harmonization of the algorithms allowing the products of the various sensors to be comparable, and ultimately, meaningfully merged (the merging procedures themselves are not examined). Additional potential products, obtained by using [Ch1] as an intermediate tool, are also examined and proposed. These products include the thickness of the layer heated by the sun, the depth of the euphotic zone, and the Secchi disk depth. The physical limitations in the predictive skill of such downward extrapolations, made from information concerning only the upper layer, are stressed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Melin, F; Zibordi, G; Berthon, JF				Melin, Ferderic; Zibordi, Giuseppe; Berthon, Jean-Francois			Assessment of satellite ocean color products at a coastal site	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												A comprehensive set of bio-optical measurements collected at the Acqua Alta Oceanographic Tower site in the northern Adriatic Sea is used to assess satellite derived optical properties and concentrations of optically significant constituents. These include normalized water leaving radiance spectra L-WN, absorption spectra due to phytoplankton, non-pigmented particles and chromophoric dissolved organic matter, back-scattering spectra, concentrations of chlorophyll a, Chla, and total suspended matter, TSM, and diffuse attenuation coefficients, K-d, obtained with a diverse set of algorithms. A total of 81 and 21 match-ups are found for SeaWiFS and MODIS L-WN, respectively. For both sensor products, the match-ups show mean absolute percentage differences of approximately 30% at 412 nm, 20% at 443 nm, and 14% from 490 to 555 nm. Some dependence of these differences has been found with respect to the aerosol optical thickness and the single scattering albedo associated with the in-water constituents. However, the performance of the atmospheric correction scheme appears relatively robust with respect to angular and environmental conditions. The different Chla products generally show quite large uncertainties whereas a TSM product shows encouraging results. Three algorithms produce Kd (490) with a RMS uncertainty of 0.13 for log-transformed data. The comparison between in situ data and satellite derived absorption values yields varying levels of uncertainties for the three bio-optical algorithms considered here and for the different wavelengths. Preliminary improvements could be reached by reducing biases affecting the total absorption coefficient at various wavelengths. Another general result is that the bio-optical models are able to represent a larger part of the observed variability for phytoplankton absorption than for the absorption by dissolved and non-pigmented particulate matter. The assumed spectral shape of the latter absorption term appears logically as a strong determinant of the partition of the total absorption. The three sets of satellite derived back-scattering spectra compare favorably with in situ optical measurements, with mean RMS differences between 0.12 and 0.18. Importantly, the uncertainties obtained here for satellite match-ups of absorption coefficients are comparable to published estimates of the inherent uncertainties associated with the bio-optical algorithms.

In situ and remote-sensing measurements of the mean microphysical and optical properties of industrial pollution aerosol during ADRIEX	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												We present a summary of the principal physical and optical properties of aerosol particles using the FAAM BAE-146 instrumented aircraft during ADRIEX between 27 August and 6 September 2004, augmented by sunphotometer, lidar and satellite retrievals. Observations of anthropogenic aerosol, principally from industrial sources, were concentrated over the northern Adriatic Sea and over the Po Valley close to the aerosol sources. An additional flight was also carried out over the Black Sea to compare east and west European pollution. Measurements show the single-scattering albedo of dry aerosol particles to vary considerably between 0.89 and 0.97 at a wavelength of 0.55 mu m, with a campaign mean within the polluted lower free troposphere of 0.92. Although aerosol concentrations varied significantly from day to day and during individual days, the shape of the aerosol size distribution was relatively consistent through the experiment, with no detectable change observed over land and over sea. There is evidence to suggest that the pollution aerosol within the marine boundary layer was younger than that in the elevated layer. Trends in the aerosol volume distribution show consistency with multiple-site AERONET radiometric observations. The aerosol optical depths derived from aircraft measurements show a consistent bias to lower values than both the AERONET and lidar ground-based radiometric observations, differences which can be explained by local variations in the aerosol column loading and by some aircraft instrumental artefacts. Retrievals of the aerosol optical depth and fine-mode (<0.5 mu m radius) fraction contribution to the optical depth using MODIS data from the Terra and Aqua satellites show a reasonable level of agreement with the AERONET and aircraft measurements.

I. Analytic Jacobians from the linearized CAO-DISORT model	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER												In this paper and the sequel, we investigate the application of classic inverse methods based on iterative least-squares cost-function minimization to the simultaneous retrieval of aerosol and ocean properties from visible and near infrared spectral radiance measurements such as those from the SeaWiFS and MODIS instruments. Radiance measurements at the satellite are simulated directly using an accurate coupled atmosphere-ocean-discrete-ordinate radiative transfer (CAO-DISORT) code as the main component of the forward model. For this kind of cost-function inverse problem, we require the forward model to generate weighting functions (radiance partial derivatives) with respect to the aerosol and marine properties to be retrieved, and to other model parameters which are sources of error in the retrievals. In this paper, we report on the linearization of the CAO-DISORT model. This linearization provides a complete analytic differentiation of the coupled-media radiative transfer theory, and it allows the model to generate analytic weighting functions for any atmospheric or marine parameter. For high solar zenith angles, we give an implementation of the pseudo-spherical (P-S) approach to solar beam attenuation in the atmosphere in the linearized model. We summarize a number of performance enhancements such as the use of an exact single-scattering calculation to improve accuracy. We derive inherent optical property inputs for the linearized CAO-DISORT code for a simple 2-parameter bio-optical model for the marine environment coupled to a 2-parameter bimodal atmospheric aerosol medium.

Global assessment of marine boundary layer cloud droplet number concentration from satellite	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Global satellite data are used to infer the droplet number concentration of marine boundary layer clouds. In a first step, two and a half years (July 2002 to December 2004) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, on board NASA's Aqua satellite) level 3 data estimates of cloud effective radius and optical thickness are used to derive cloud droplet number concentration N and cloud geometrical thickness H under the assumption of adiabatically stratified clouds. Theoretical error estimates show that for a liquid water path higher than 30 g/m(2) and a cloud fraction higher than 0.8, H (N) can be derived with a relative uncertainty of better than 20% (80%). To further validate the estimates of N and H, cloud liquid water path is calculated and compared to independent observations of cloud liquid water path from the passive microwave Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E), also on board Aqua. Good agreement between the two different data sets is found. In a second step, the global distribution of cloud droplet number concentration in stratiform boundary layer clouds is evaluated. The data are separated into observations that are likely to be drizzling and drizzle- free using published relations between drizzle rate and N and H. It is found that the mean droplet number concentration over remote Northern Hemisphere oceans is higher than over the southern oceans (64-89 cm(-3) in the Northern Hemisphere and 40-67 cm(-3) in the Southern Hemisphere). Leeward of the major continents cloud droplet number concentration is generally high with maximum values close to the coasts. On the Southern Hemisphere, especially over the east Pacific Ocean, microphysical conditions were almost constant through the entire observation period. Over the southeast Atlantic Ocean, the cloud microphysical variability appears to be strongly influenced by the dry biomass burning season in Africa.

Physical and optical aerosol properties at the Dutch North Sea coast based on AERONET observations	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Sun photometer measurements at the AERONET station at the North Sea coast in The Hague (The Netherlands) provide a climatology of optical and physical aerosol properties for the area. Results are presented from the period January 2002 to July 2003. For the analysis and interpretation these data are coupled to chemical aerosol data from a nearby station of the Dutch National Air Quality Network. This network provides PM10 and black carbon concentrations. Meteorological conditions and air mass trajectories are also used. Due to the location close to the coast, the results are strongly dependent on wind direction, i.e. air mass trajectory. In general the aerosol optical properties are governed by industrial aerosol emitted form various industrial, agricultural and urban areas surrounding the site in almost all directions over land. For maritime air masses industrial aerosols are transported from over the North Sea, whereas very clean air is transported from the NW in clean polar air masses from the North Atlantic. In the winter the effect of the production of sea salt aerosol at high wind speeds is visible in the optical and physical aerosol data. In these cases fine and coarse mode radii are similar to those reported in the literature for marine aerosol. Relations are derived between the angstrom ngstrom coefficients with both the fine/coarse mode fraction and the ratio of black carbon and PM10.																	1680-7316	1680-7324					2007	7	13					3481	3495		10.5194/acp-7-3481-2007								WOS:000248733000007

Assessing post-tsunami effects on ocean colour at eastern Indian Ocean using MODIS Aqua satellite	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami had been reported to cause vast destruction on marine environment, but its effect on the primary production and upwelling event was unknown. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua ocean colour imageries were used to assess the tsunami effects on the chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and turbidity variations. Chlorophyll-a and normalized water leaving radiance at 551 nm (nLw 551) before and after the tsunami event were processed using SeaWiFS data analysis system (SeaDAS), and the variations were examined. Results showed a sudden increase of chl-a and nLw 551 at the north-western Sumatra and middle of Malacca Straits (MS) after the tsunami. At western Sumatra, high sedimentation caused by the backwash resulted in overestimation of the chl-a values. However, the chl-a in the upwelling area in the northern MS did not exhibit any significant changes. The chl-a variation in the northern MS was found to be related to the monsoon wind with about one week time lag. At the seriously eroded coastline along western Sumatra, continuous sedimentation was observed. The sedimentation problem became more severe during higher rainfall periods in April 2005. We strongly suggest a long term monitoring of this sedimentation problem.

This connection between R-rs and C is used to construct a chlorophyll concentration retrieval algorithm that yields reliable results for a large range of chlorophyll concentrations. The overall performance of a MODIS/VIIRS chlorophyll concentration retrieval algorithm is found to be less satisfactory. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Springtime coupling between chlorophyll a, sea ice and sea surface temperature in Disko Bay, West Greenland	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Alterations in sea ice and primary production are expected to have cascading influences on the food web in high Arctic marine ecosystems. This study spanned four years and examined the spring phytoplankton production bloom in Disko Bay, West Greenland (69 degrees N, 53 degrees W) (using chlorophyll a concentrations as a proxy) under contrasting sea ice conditions in 2001 and 2003 (heavy sea ice) and 2002 and 2004 (light sea ice). Satellite-based observations of chlorophyll a, sea ice and sea surface temperature were used together with in situ depth profiles of chlorophyll a fluorescence collected at 24 sampling stations alone the south coast of Disko Island (5-30 km offshore) in May 2003 and 2004. Chlorophyll a and sea surface temperatures were also obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS: EOS-Terra and AQUA satellites) between March 2001 and July 2004. Daily SMMR/SSMI sea ice data were obtained in the same years. An empirical regional algorithm was developed to calibrate ratios of remotely sensed measurements of water leaving radiance with in situ chlorophyll a fluorescence. The optimal integration depth was 0-4 m, explaining between 70% and 91% of the variance. The spatial development of the phytoplankton bloom showed that the southwestern corner of the study area had the earliest and the largest spring phytoplankton bloom. The eastern part of Disko Bay, influenced by meltwater outflow from the glaciers, shows no signs of an early phytoplankton bloom and followed the general pattern of an accelerated bloom soon after the disappearance of sea ice. In all four years the coupling between phytoplankton and sea ice was bounded by average open water between 50% and 80%, likely due to the combined availability of light and stable open water. The daily incremental growth in both mean chlorophyll a density (chlorophyll a per volume water, mu g l(-1)) and abundance (density of chlorophyll a extrapolated to ice free areas, tons) estimated by linear regression (chlorophyll a vs. day) between I April and 15 May was highest in 2002 and 2004 (light ice years) and lowest in 2001 and 2003 (heavy ice years). In years with late sea ice retreat the chlorophyll a attained only slightly lower densities than in years with early sea ice retreat. However, the abundance of chlorophyll a in light ice years was considerably larger than in heavy ice years, and there was an obvious effect of more open water for light-induced stimulation of primary production. This observation demonstrates the importance of estimating chlorophyll a abundance rather than density in sea ice covered areas. This study also presents the first regional calibration of MODIS chlorophyll a data for Arctic waters. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Satellite observations were made with the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) on the Envisat satellite launched by the European Space Agency, and subsequently with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) launched on both the Terra and Aqua satellites by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Both instruments cover wide swaths, providing near-daily images. Both have optical spectral bands in the range 670 to 750 nm, which detect the chlorophyll red-edge characteristic of land and marine vegetation, but only MERIS has a band at 709 nm, which was critical to the initial discovery. The combined satellite data from both sensors show the seasonal cycle of weed density in different areas of the Gulf. A wider ranging study is now needed to map its occurrence in other areas, including the Sargasso Sea (named for the weed, but not so far covered in our survey). The satellite observations suggest that Sargassum biomass is greater than previously estimated, and hence plays a more important part in oceanic productivity.				hu, chuanmin/J-5021-2012													0196-2892	1558-0644				DEC	2006	44	12					3619	3625		10.1109/TGRS.2006.882258								WOS:000242390700015

Aerosol optical properties during the 2004 New England Air Quality Study - Intercontinental Transport and Chemical Transformation: Gulf of Maine surface measurements - Regional and case studies	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												We report results from the 2004 New England Air Quality Study - Intercontinental Transport and Chemical Transformation ( NEAQS-ITCT) based on measurements of aerosol optical properties in the marine boundary layer of the Gulf of Maine. The in situ data collected on board the NOAA research vessel Ronald H. Brown includes extensive properties of aerosol scattering coefficient, absorption coefficient, and optical depth at multiple wavelengths in the visible. From these, intensive properties were derived, including the Angstrom exponent of scattering, single scattering albedo, and submicrometer fraction of scattering. The optical particle properties were sorted by time and location on the basis of aerosol source regions and air mass back trajectories. The results indicate a large degree of temporal and spatial variability in the observed parameters: up to 80% in the scattering and absorption coefficients, 55% in the Angstrom exponent, 16% in the single scattering albedo, and 25% in the submicrometer fraction of scattering. The variability is mainly due to the multitude of aerosol sources and transport pathways in the study area. During NEAQS 2004 the mean scattering coefficients were about 20 to 40% lower than those measured during NEAQS 2002 but showed a similar variability. The mean absorption coefficient for the aerosol during NEAQS 2002 was about 80% larger than that measured during NEAQS 2004. The modal parameters of the volume-size distributions and refractive index and density of the particles were consistent with the aerosol models used in the MODIS land and ocean aerosol retrieval algorithms.

Satellite monitoring of the first indirect aerosol effect: Retrieval of the droplet concentration of water clouds	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												A model for the vertical variation of microphysical and optical properties of single-layer water clouds is used to design a procedure to obtain cloud droplet concentration from satellite cloud optical thickness/effective radius retrievals. The model allows for smooth vertical variations in microphysical variables including droplet concentration and liquid water content. The procedure is applied to data from the MODIS instrument aboard the EOS-TERRA satellite platform over a region near Cape Grim, Tasmania, over the Southern Ocean. At this unpolluted location, there are seasonally repeated well-described variations in cloud condensation nucleus concentration. The satellite observations show that there is a factor 2.5 difference in retrieved droplet concentration between the summer and winter seasons as measured over the 4 year period (July 2000 to July 2004). Comparison of these results with cloud condensation nuclei concentrations observed at Cape Grim showed good agreement. Furthermore, for a fixed solar zenith angle cos (45 degrees) cloud albedo varied between 0.45 and 0.55 and exhibited a clear correlation with the retrieved droplet concentration (correlation coefficient R = 0.80). Such correlation was absent between albedo and the second retrieval product, namely the cloud depth.																	2169-897X					NOV 18	2006	111	D22							D22208	10.1029/2005JD006838								WOS:000242176200005

This paper is an illustration of how these measurements can be used to investigate whether 'state-of-the-art' atmospheric models are capable of adequately representing clouds. Here, we focus on shallow low-level clouds with a substantial amount of liquid water. In situ, ground-based and satellite remote sensing measurements were compared with the output of three non-hydrostatic regional models (Lokal-Modell, LM.- M&so-NH: fifth-generation Mesoscale Model, MM5) and two hydrostatic regional climate models (Regional Atmospheric Climate Model version 2, RACMO2; Rossby Centre Atmospheric Model, RCA). For the two selected days, Meso-NH and MM5 reproduce the measured vertical extent of the shallow clouds, but the liquid water content of the clouds is generally overestimated. In LM and the climate models the inversion is too weak and located at a level too close to the surface resulting in an overestimation of the vertical extent of the clouds. A sensitivity integration with RACM02 shows that the correspondence between model output and measurements can be improved by a doubling of the vertical resolution; this induces an increase in the modelled inversion strenath and cloud top pressure. LM and Meso-NH underestimate the lifetime of clouds. A comparison between model output and cloud cover derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) indicates that this deficiency is not due to advection of too small cloud systems,- it is rather due to an overestimation of the variability in the vertical velocity. All models overestimate the specific humidity near the surface and underestimate it at higher atmospheric levels, indicating that the models underestimate the mixing of moisture in the boundary layer. This deficiency is slightly reduced by inclusion of parameterised shallow convection in the non-hydrostatic models, which enhances the mixing of heat and moisture in the boundary layer. Consequently, the explicitly resolved updrafts weaken resulting in reduced condensation rates and lower liquid water path. The temporal variability of cloud occurrence is hardly affected by inclusion of parameterised shallow convection. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The datasets used were the daily level-3 binned data of chlorophyll-a from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on the Aqua satellite over the year 2003, which is the first common full year of operation. Since they represent input for both approaches, matchups between the satellite and the in situ data from the SeaWiFS Bio-optical Archive and Storage System and the Atlantic Meridional Transect were first studied to compute a spatial map of the root mean-square error and of the bias. Because of the log distribution of the chlorophyll fields, each approach was applied to untransformed and log-transformed values. The application of the weighted averaging to log-transformed values does not show significant differences in comparison to its application to untransformed values. This is not the case, however, for the objective analysis that gives better results when applied to log-transformed values. Both approaches give combined chlorophyll data of equivalent quality, although the objective analysis could be improved with a better statistical characterization of noise and signal covariance. The main advantage of the objective analysis is its ability to interpolate in space (and time) by taking into account the characteristic scales of chlorophyll-a. As a result, the spatial coverage of the combined data is at least twice as large in the case of objective analysis than weighted averaging.																	0196-2892	1558-0644				NOV	2006	44	11	2				3436	3451		10.1109/TGRS.2006.878441								WOS:000241933600022

Impact of ship emissions on the microphysical, optical and radiative properties of marine stratus: a case study	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Modifications of existing clouds by the exhaust of ships are well-known but inadequately quantified impacts, which could contribute to climate change. The perturbation of a cloud layer by ship-generated aerosol changes the cloud reflectivity and is identified by long curves in satellite images, known as ship tracks. As ship tracks indicate a pollution of a very clean marine environment and also affect the radiation budget below and above the cloud, it is important to investigate their radiative and climatic effects. Satellite-data from MODIS on Terra are used to examine a scene from 10 February 2003 where ship tracks were detected close to the North American West-Coast. The cloud optical and microphysical properties are derived using a semi-analytical retrieval technique combined with a look-up-table approach. An algorithm is presented to distinguish ship-track-pixels from the unperturbed cloud pixels in the scene and from this the optical properties of the former are compared to those of the latter. Within the ship tracks a significant change in the droplet number concentration, the effective radius and the optical thickness are found compared to the unaffected cloud. The resulting cloud properties are used to calculate the radiation budget below and above the cloud. Assuming a mean solar zenith angle of 63 degrees for the selected scene, the mean solar surface radiation below the ship track is decreased by 43.2 Wm(-2) and the mean reflectance at top of atmosphere ( TOA) is increased by 40.8 Wm(-2). For the entire analyzed scene the ship emission decreases the solar radiation at the surface by 2.1 Wm(-2) and increases the backscattered solar radiation at TOA by 2.0 Wm(-2), whereas no significant effect on thermal radiation was detected.

Part I: Path radiance	APPLIED OPTICS												A vector version of the 6S (Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum) radiative transfer code (6SV1), which enables accounting for radiation polarization, has been developed and validated against a Monte Carlo code, Coulson's tabulated values, and MOBY (Marine Optical Buoy System) water-leaving reflectance measurements. The developed code was also tested against the scalar codes SHARM, DISORT, and MODTRAN to evaluate its performance in scalar mode and the influence of polarization. The obtained results have shown a good agreement of 0.7% in comparison with the Monte Carlo code, 0.2% for Coulson's tabulated values, and 0.001-0.002 for the 400-550 nm region for the MOBY reflectances. Ignoring the effects of polarization led to large errors in calculated top-of-atmosphere reflectances: more than 10% for a molecular atmosphere and up to 5% for an aerosol atmosphere. This new version of 6S is intended to replace the previous scalar version used for calculation of lookup tables in the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) atmospheric correction algorithm.

Satellite-based assessment of marine low cloud variability associated with aerosol, atmospheric stability, and the diurnal cycle	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												This study examines variability in marine low cloud properties derived from semiglobal observations by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite, as linked to the aerosol index (AI) and lower-tropospheric stability (LTS). AI is derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (Terra MODIS) sensor and the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transportation (GOCART) model and is used to represent column-integrated aerosol concentrations. LTS is derived from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis and represents the background thermodynamic environment in which the clouds form. Global statistics reveal that cloud droplet size tends to be smallest in polluted (high-AI) and strong inversion (high-LTS) environments. Statistical quantification shows that cloud droplet size is better correlated with AI than it is with LTS. Simultaneously, the cloud liquid water path (CLWP) tends to decrease as AI increases. This correlation does not support the hypothesis or assumption that constant or increased CLWP is associated with high aerosol concentrations. Global variability in corrected cloud albedo (CCA), the product of cloud optical depth and cloud fraction, is very well explained by LTS, while both AI and LTS are needed to explain local variability in CCA. Most of the local correlations between AI and cloud properties are similar to the results from the global statistics, while weak anomalous aerosol-cloud correlations appear locally in the regions where simultaneous high (low) AI and low (high) LTS compensate each other. Daytime diurnal cycles explain additional variability in cloud properties. CCA has the largest diurnal cycle in high-LTS regions. Cloud droplet size and CLWP have weak diurnal cycles that differ between clean and polluted environments. The combined results suggest that investigations of marine low cloud radiative forcing and its relationship to hypothesized aerosol indirect effects must consider the combined effects of aerosols, thermodynamics, and the diurnal cycle.

Satellite-based assessment of top of atmosphere anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing over cloud-free oceans	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Most assessments of the direct climate forcing (DCF) of anthropogenic aerosols are from numerical simulations. However, recent advances in remote sensing techniques allow the separation of fine mode aerosols ( anthropogenic aerosol is mostly fine aerosol) from coarse mode aerosols ( largely marine and dust, which are mostly natural) from satellite data such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging SpectroRadiometer ( MODIS). Here, by combining MODIS narrowband measurements with broadband radiative flux data sets from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES), we provide a measurement-based assessment of the global direct climate forcing ( DCF) of anthropogenic aerosols at the top of atmosphere (TOA) only for cloud free oceans. The mean TOA DCF of anthropogenic aerosols over cloud-free oceans [60N - 60S] is - 1.4 +/- 0.9 Wm(-2), which is in excellent agreement ( mean value of - 1.4 Wm(-2)) with a recent observational study by Kaufman et al.

The algorithm described is applicable to ocean colour satellite measurements (e.g., SeaWiFS). In situ measurements of inherent and apparent optical properties were made at 19 coastal stations off the north coast of New Zealand's South Island in December 2001. These measurements were used to parameterise a bio-optical model that estimates remote sensing reflectance from concentrations of water constituents. The model generated a large number (5000) of modelled ocean colour reflectance spectra that represented a greater range of biogeochemical conditions than were measured in the study area. These modelled values spanned a wide range of chlorophyll concentrations (0.1-10 mg m(-3)), total suspended particulate material concentrations (0.1-50 g m(-3)), and dissolved yellow substance absorptions (0.01-3m(-1)). The modelled spectra were then used to test the performance of the algorithm. The median ratio of algorithm values to target values was 0.84 (absorption), and 0.80 (backscatter), and the median absolute errors were 33% (absorption) and 36% (backscatter) across two orders of magnitude. The r(2) values between target and algorithm values of inherent optical properties in log-log space were 0.89 for backscatter, and varied with wavelength for absorption from 0.79 (412 nm), 0.72 (443 nm), 0.63 (490 nm), 0.55 (510 nm), and 0.21 (555 nm).				oubelkheir, kadija/H-3843-2011; Boyd, Philip/J-7624-2014	Boyd, Philip/0000-0001-7850-1911; Lavender, Samantha/0000-0002-5181-9425; Moore, Gerald/0000-0001-6170-6646												0028-8330					JUN	2006	40	2					227	247		10.1080/00288330.2006.9517417								WOS:000239326700002						
J	Wood, R; Hartmann, DL				Wood, R; Hartmann, DL			Spatial variability of liquid water path in marine low cloud: The importance of mesoscale cellular convection	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Liquid water path (LWP) mesoscale spatial variability in marine low cloud over the eastern subtropical oceans is examined using two months of daytime retrievals from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the NASA Terra satellite. Approximately 20 000 scenes of size 256 km X 256 km are used in the analysis. It is found that cloud fraction is strongly linked with the LWP variability in the cloudy fraction of the scene. It is shown here that in most cases LWP spatial variance is dominated by horizontal scales of 10-50 km, and increases as the variance-containing scale increases, indicating the importance of organized mesoscale cellular convection (MCC). A neural network technique is used to classify MODIS scenes by the spatial variability type (no MCC, closed MCC, open MCC, cellular but disorganized). It is shown how the different types tend to occupy distinct geographical regions and different physical regimes within the subtropics, although the results suggest considerable overlap of the large-scale meteorological conditions associated with each scene type. It is demonstrated that both the frequency of occurrence, and the variance-containing horizontal scale of the MCC increases as the marine boundary layer (MBL) depth increases. However, for the deepest MBLs, the MCC tends to be replaced by clouds containing cells but lacking organization. In regions where MCC is prevalent, a lack of sensitivity of the MCC type (open or closed) to the large-scale meteorology was found, suggesting a mechanism internal to the MBL may be important in determining MCC type. The results indicate that knowledge of the physics of MCC will be required to completely understand and predict low cloud coverage and variability in the subtropics.

The problem is especially acute in the Baltic Sea where cyanobacterial blooms occur every summer covering areas of more than 100 000 km(2). It has been shown that quantitative mapping of cyanobacteria during bloom conditions is possible with hyperspectral instruments. These sensors, however, cannot provide synoptic spatial coverage and high revisit times needed for near real-time monitoring of potentially harmful blooms. The aim was to estimate whether spectral resolution of multispectral sensors, which can provide needed coverage, is adequate for quantitative mapping of cyanobacteria and whether it is possible to separate potentially harmful blooms of cyanobacteria from waters dominated by algae using ocean colour satellites. The modelling results show that multispectral sensors like ALI, Landsat or MODIS are not capable of separating waters dominated by cyanobacteria from waters dominated by other algae species, as their spectral band configuration does not allow detecting absorption features caused by phycocyanin (present primarily in cyanobacteria) or any other spectral features that are characteristic to cyanobacteria only. MERIS bands 6 and 7 allow detecting phycocyanin absorption feature near 630 nm and a small peak in reflectance spectra near 650 nm characteristic to only cyanobacteria. Thus, MERIS can be used in detecting cyanobacteria if they are present in relatively high quantities. Unfortunately it is not possible to use MERIS for early warning of emerging potentially harmful blooms as the minimum biomass needed to cause features in reflectance spectra typical to cyanobacteria is higher than the biomass already considered as a bloom in the Baltic Sea.

We show that at high wind speeds, sea-salt contributes 81% to the coarse mode and 42% to the composite AOD in the southern AS. In contrast to this, over the northern AS, share of sea-salt to coarse mode and composite optical depth is only 35% and 16% respectively. Comparison of the sea-salt optical depth and coarse mode optical depth ( MODIS) showed excellent agreement. The sea-salt optical depth over AS at moderate to high wind speed is comparable to the anthropogenic AOD reported for this region during winter.					Moorthy, K.

The aerosol data, collected using ship-borne and island platforms (for 8 years from 1995 to 2002) along with MODIS (onboard TERRA satellite) data (from 2000 to 2003) have been used to evolve a comprehensive characterisation of the spatial and temporal variation in the physical, chemical, and radiative properties of aerosols over the Arabian Sea. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) was found to increase with latitude between the equator and 12 degrees N. Over the northern Arabian Sea (regions lying north of 12 degrees N), AODs do not show significant latitudinal variations; the average aerosol optical depth for this region was 0.29 +/- 0.12 during winter monsoon season (WMS; November to March) and 0.47 +/- 0.14 during summer monsoon season (SMS; April/May to September). The corresponding Angstrom exponents were 0.7 +/- 0.12 and 0.3 +/- 0.08, respectively. The low values of the exponent during SMS indicate the dominance of large aerosols (mainly dust particles >1 mu m). The latitudinal gradient in AOD in the southern Arabian Sea is larger during SMS compared to WMS. The size distribution of aerosols shows two well-defined modes, one in the accumulation size regime and the other in the coarse size regime. During WMS, a third mode (nucleation) also appears in the sub micron range below similar to 0.1 mu m. The single scattering albedo does not show significant seasonal variations (remains within similar to 0.93 to 0.98 through out the year). During WMS (SMS), top of the atmosphere diurnally averaged aerosol forcing remains around -6.1 (-14.3) W m(-2) over the northern Arabian Sea up to around 12 degrees N and decreases southwards till it attains a value of -3.8 (-3.4) W m(-2) at the equator. The surface forcing remains around -16.2 (-15.2) W m(-2) over the northern Arabian Sea up to 12 degrees N and decreases southwards to a value of -5.5 (-3.5) W m(-2) at the equator. Over the north Arabian Sea, instantaneous forcing (flux change) at the surface can be as high as -50 W m(-2). The instantaneous forcing decreases with latitude in the southern Arabian Sea at a rate of similar to 3 W m(-2) deg(-1).

A ratio technique using the defined envelope showed that a good relationship exists between the ratio of the reflectance R667/R678 and surface chlorophyll concentrations. The global data set for MODIS 3 Used in this study data has a 4.89-km pixel resolution that is mapped 6 a cylindrical equidistant map projection.

The two selected ratios indicate the response of provinces according to the depth location of absorbing pigments as well overall response to integrated concentrations of pigments in the euphotic zone.

The target clouds are marine stratus and stratocumulus. They appeared over the Amami-Oshima Island, and off the south coast of Kyushu island. The principal goals of the comparison are to understand the characteristics of data obtained from each observing platform, and investigate the potentiality of synergistic use of multi platform data. The liquid water paths obtained from satellite (MODIS) observation by using the GLI cloud retrieval algorithm were compared with the ground-based measurements (microwave radiometer). The correlation coefficient and the root mean square error between ground and satellite liquid water path was 0.87 and 61.9 g/m(2). The satellite-retrieved cloud effective radius agreed with those from the aircraft measurements (FSSP) around the top of the cloud.

J	Luderer, G; Coakley, JA; Tahnk, WR				Luderer, G; Coakley, JA; Tahnk, WR			Using sun glint to check the relative calibration of reflected spectral radiances	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY												Observations of sunlight reflected from regions of sun glint are used to check the relative calibration of spectral radiances obtained with imaging radiometers. Reflectances at different wavelengths for sun-glint regions are linearly related. Provided that the atmosphere is reasonably transparent at the wavelengths, the aerosol burden is reasonably light, 0.64-mu m optical depth less than 0.2; the particles constituting the aerosol are reasonably large, as is the case for marine aerosols; and the solar zenith angle is less than about 35, the linear relationships between reflectances at different wavelengths are rather insensitive to the factors that govern the reflectances themselves. The relationships are remarkably insensitive to atmospheric composition, surface wind speed and direction, illumination, and viewing geometry. The slopes and offsets of the linear relationships are used to assess the relative accuracies of the calibrations of the different channels. Such assessments would appear to be attractive for checks on the in-flight performance of aircraft-borne imaging radiometers. Here, observations of reflectances at 0.64, 0.84, 1.6, and 2.1 mu m for regions of sun glint obtained with the Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments are shown to be consistent with each other. Observations of the 0.64- and 1.6-mu m reflectances for the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) instrument are shown to be inconsistent with the MODIS observations, the VIRS 1.6-mu m gain appearing to be too low by 9%. The 0.64-, 0.84-, and 1.6-mu m reflectances obtained with the NOAA-16 and NOAA-17 Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers (AVHRRs) for December 2002 are shown to be inconsistent with each other and inconsistent with the MODIS observations. Based on observations of the extensive ice sheets of Antarctica, the NOAA-16 0.64-mu m gain is found to be too low by 5% and that for the 0.84-mu m reflectance is too low by 12%; the NOAA-170.64-mu m gain is found to be accurate (within 2%), but the 0.84-mu m gain is too low by 15%. With the gains adjusted, the 0.64- and 0.84-Am reflectances obtained for regions of sun glint with the AVHRRs are consistent with each other and consistent with the Terra and Aqua MODIS observations. These results suggest that the gain for the NOAA-16 AVHRR 1.6-mu m reflectance is accurate (within 1%) and that for the NOAA-17 AVHRR is too low by 5%. All of the observations were made with the AVHRR in the low-reflectance (high gain) mode. The accuracy of these assessments is expected to be about 5%.

Satellite data product validation and algorithm development activities both require the substantial accumulation of high-quality in-situ observations. The NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group maintains a local repository of in-situ marine bio-optical data, the SeaWiFS Biooptical Archive and Storage System (SeaBASS), to facilitate their ocean color satellite validation analyses. Data were acquired from SeaBASS and used to compile a large set of coincident radiometric observations and phytoplankton pigment concentrations for use in biooptical algorithm development. This new data set, the NASA bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Data set (NOMAD), includes over 3400 stations of spectral water-leaving radiances, surface irradiances, and diffuse downwelling attenuation coefficients, encompassing chlorophyll a concentrations ranging from 0.012 to 72.12 mg m(-3). Metadata, such as the date, time, and location of data collection, and ancillary data, including sea surface temperatures and water depths, accompany each record. This paper describes the assembly and evaluation of NOMAD, and further illustrates the broad geophysical range of stations incorporated into NOMAD. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This property may lead to suppression of precipitation and longer cloud lifetime. Absorption of incoming solar radiation by aerosols, however, can reduce the cloud cover. The net aerosol effect on clouds is currently the largest uncertainty in evaluating climate forcing. Using large statistics of 1-km resolution MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer) satellite data, we study the aerosol effect on shallow water clouds, separately in four regions of the Atlantic Ocean, for June through August 2002: marine aerosol (30 degrees S-20 degrees S), smoke (20 degrees S-5 degrees N), mineral dust (5 degrees N-25 degrees N), and pollution aerosols (30 degrees N160 degrees N). All four aerosol types affect the cloud droplet size. We also find that the coverage of shallow clouds increases in all of the cases by 0.2-0.4 from clean to polluted, smoky, or dusty conditions. Covariability analysis with meteorological parameters associates most of this change to aerosol, for each of the four regions and 3 months studied. In our opinion, there is low probability that the net aerosol effect can be explained by coincidental, unresolved, changes in meteorological conditions that also accumulate aerosol, or errors in the data, although further in situ measurements and model developments are needed to fully understand the processes. The radiative effect at the top of the atmosphere incurred by the aerosol effect on the shallow clouds and solar radiation is -11 +/- 3 W/m(2) for the 3 months studied; 2/3 of it is due to the aerosol-induced cloud changes, and 1/3 is due to aerosol direct radiative effect.

We show that artifacts such as cloud contamination or adjacency effect contribute to the majority of the relationship in clean marine conditions. This cloud fraction effect could result in a 10 - 20% overestimation in monthly mean aerosol optical depth or aerosol direct forcing values that are derived using MODIS aerosol products over cloud free oceans. It may also explain some of the high optical depth values derived in the mid-latitude southern oceans. We also suggest that covariances of meteorological phenomenon such as wind or humidity in cloudy regions while logical might only account for a minor portion of the ensemble relationship.

We tested this algorithm using ship-derived and satellite-derived results from a variety of marine environments. From this validation work we calculated the overall accuracy of the satellite-based PIC estimates, assuming different timescales and space scales for binning. After performing the validation work we applied the two-band algorithm to water-leaving radiance data from 2002, sampled by Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS)/Terra ( a 36-band satellite spectrometer designed to observe land, ocean, and atmosphere), and we derived seasonal, global maps of the standing stock of pelagic PIC as well as particulate organic carbon (POC). These data, along with limited observations on the turnover time of calcium carbonate coccoliths in the euphotic zone, provide some new insights into global rates of pelagic calcite production.																	0148-0227					JUL 2	2005	110	C7							C07001	10.1029/2004JC002560								WOS:000230482400001						
J	Palmer, PI; Shaw, SL				Palmer, PI; Shaw, SL			Quantifying global marine isoprene fluxes using MODIS chlorophyll observations	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												We report global distributions of marine isoprene flux, whose source is estimated by combining an empirical relationship for isoprene production rate with MODIS satellite chlorophyll observations from 2001. We use a steady-state water column model including losses to chemistry, bacteria, and air-sea exchange. Physical mixing is a negligible sink. Flux estimates range from 10(7) 10(9) molecules cm(-2) s(-1), with considerable spatial and temporal variability, resulting in a global annual total of 0.1 Tg C/yr. Air-sea exchange is the dominant isoprene sink in the surface oceans, with bacteria the second largest, but much less important, sink. The reported fluxes represent a small loss of OH in the remote marine boundary layer (MBL) compared to other oxidants. Application of our approach to other reactive compounds may improve a priori flux estimates for coupled atmosphere-ocean biogeochemistry inverse model studies.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provides a large-scale regional view of the aerosol during the ACE-Asia time period. Focusing only on aerosol retrievals over ocean, MODIS data show latitudinal and longitudinal variation in the aerosol characteristics. Typically, aerosol optical depth (tau(alpha)) values at 0.55 mu m are highest in the 30 degrees-50 degrees latitude band associated with dust outbreaks. Monthly mean tau(alpha) in this band ranges similar to 0.40-70, although large differences between monthly mean and median values indicate the periodic nature of these dust outbreaks. The size parameters, fine mode fraction (eta), and effective radius (r(eff)) vary between monthly mean values of eta = 0.47 and r(eff) = 0.75 mu m in the cleanest regions far offshore to approximately eta = 0.85 and r(eff) = 0.30 mu m in near-shore regions dominated by biomass burning smoke. The collocated MODIS retrievals with airborne, ship-based, and ground-based radiometers measurements suggest that MODIS retrievals of spectral optical depth fall well within expected error (Delta tau(alpha) = +/- 0.03 +/- 0.05 tau(alpha)) except in situations dominated by dust, in which cases MODIS overestimate both the aerosol loading and the aerosol spectral dependence. Such behavior is consistent with issues related to particle nonsphericity. Comparisons of MODIS-derived r(eff) with AERONET retrievals at the few occurrences of collocations show MODIS systematically underestimates particle size by 0.2 mu m. Multiple-year analysis of MODIS aerosol size parameters suggests systematic differences between the year 2001 and the years 2000 and 2002, which are traced to instrumental electronic cross talk. Sensitivity studies show that such calibration errors are negligible in tau(alpha) retrievals but are more pronounced in size parameter retrievals, especially for dust and sea salt.

A new airborne downward looking multispectral ( 490 - 2200 nm) micropolarimeter (MICROPOL) is used to derive the aerosol optical thickness and effective radius. We present two case studies corresponding to the observations performed during a mineral dust transport from the Sahara to Europe and to an undisturbed marine boundary layer. The dust plume is associated with aerosol optical thickness above 0.2 ( at 865 nm), whereas relatively low loading conditions are observed in the maritime case ( down to 0.1). The MICROPOL-derived aerosol optical thickness is in an excellent agreement with coincident Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) retrievals for both days. The effective radius retrieved by MICROPOL is also in a good agreement with the one from MODIS in the dust case. In the pure maritime case, this parameter is significantly underestimated by MICROPOL compared to MODIS retrieval. The vertical distribution of aerosol optical parameters is derived from combined two-wavelength backscattering airborne lidar observations and MICROPOL passive measurements. As expected in the case of a long-range transport, the aerosol effective radius within the dust layer is rather constant as a function of the altitude. A surprising low lidar depolarization factor of about 4% is retrieved within the dust plume, suggesting a major contribution of spherical particles. No significant depolarization has been observed in the marine boundary layer. For the given geometry of observation the retrieved aerosol models, which are based on the Mie theory, reproduce the MICROPOL polarized measurements within 5 - 8% in the dust and maritime case. The use of a nonspherical model increases by a factor of 2 the residual fitting error in polarization in the case of the dust observation. This result is confirmed by the lidar depolarization ratio and indicates that a large part of particles in the dust plume are spherical.																	2169-897X	2169-8996				MAR 26	2005	110	D10							D10S10	10.1029/2004JD004839								WOS:000228154400003

This paper extends their application to the retrieval of cloud droplet number concentration, cloud geometrical thickness, and liquid water path in shallow convective clouds, using an algorithm that was previously tested with airborne measurements of cloud radiances and validated against in situ measurements of the same clouds. The retrieval is based on a stratified cloud model of liquid water content and droplet spectrum. Radiance measurements in visible and near-infrared channels of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which is operated from the NASA platforms Terra and Aqua, are analyzed. Because of uncertainties in the simulation of the continental surface reflectance, the algorithm is presently limited to the monitoring of the microphysical structure of boundary layer clouds over the ocean. Two MODIS scenes of extended cloud fields over the North Atlantic Ocean trade wind region are processed. A transport and dispersion model (the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model, HYSPLIT4) is also used to characterize the origin of the air masses and hence their aerosol regimes. One cloud field formed in an air mass that was advected from southern Europe and North Africa. It shows high values of the droplet concentration when compared with the second cloud system, which developed in a more pristine environment. The more pristine case also exhibits a higher geometrical thickness and, thus, liquid water path, which counterbalances the expected cloud albedo increase of the polluted case. Estimates of cloud liquid water path are then compared with retrievals from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I). SSM/I-derived liquid water paths are in good agreement with the MODIS-derived values.

J	Coakley, JA; Friedman, MA; Tahnk, WR				Coakley, JA; Friedman, MA; Tahnk, WR			Retrieval of cloud properties for partly cloudy imager pixels	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY												Retrievals of cloud properties from satellite imagery often invoke the assumption that the fields of view are overcast when cloud-contaminated, even though a significant fraction are only partially cloud-covered. The overcast assumption leads to biases in the retrieved cloud properties: cloud amounts and droplet effective radii are typically overestimated, while visible optical depths, cloud altitudes, cloud liquid water amounts, and column droplet number concentrations are typically underestimated. In order to estimate these biases, a retrieval scheme was developed to obtain the properties of clouds for partially covered imager fields of view. The partly cloudy pixel retrieval scheme is applicable to single-layered cloud systems and invokes the assumption that clouds that only partially cover a field of view are at the same altitude as nearby clouds from the same layer that completely cover imager pixels. The properties of the retrieval are illustrated through its application to 2-km Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) for a marine stratocumulus scene. The scene was chosen because the cloud properties are typical of such systems based on an analysis of VIRS data for February and March 1998. Comparisons of properties for clouds in partly cloudy pixels and those for clouds in nearby overcast pixels reveal that the optical depths and droplet effective radii are generally smaller for the clouds in the partly cloudy pixels. In addition, for pixel-scale cloud fractions between 0.2 and 0.8, optical depth, droplet effective radius, and column droplet number concentration decrease slowly with decreasing cloud cover fraction. The changes are only about 20%-30%, while cloud cover fraction changes by 80%. For comparison, changes in optical depth and column number concentration retrieved using a threshold method decrease by 80%-90%. As long as the cloud cover in partly cloudy pixels is greater than about 0.1, uncertainties in the estimates of the cloud altitudes and of the radiances for the cloud-free portions of the fields of view give rise to uncertainties in the retrieved cloud properties that are comparable to the uncertainties in the properties retrieved for overcast pixels.																	0739-0572					JAN	2005	22	1					3	17		10.1175/JTECH-1681.1								WOS:000227006800001						
J	Wood, R; Bretherton, CS				Wood, R; Bretherton, CS			Boundary layer depth, entrainment, and decoupling in the cloud-capped subtropical and tropical marine boundary layer	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Estimates of marine boundary layer (MBL) depth and degree of decoupling for two regions of the subtropical and tropical east Pacific are presented using satellite observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI). These data are combined in a novel way with NCEP reanalysis data and a mixing line parameterization to estimate the mean entrainment rate w(e) over the two regions. Mean entrainment rates vary geographically and have maxima just downwind of the Californian coast ((w(e)) over bar approximate to 4-5 mm s(-1)), and also in the core of the equatorial east Pacific cold tongue where mean w(e) exceeds 6 mm s(-1). Entrainment exceeds subsidence by 30% or less in the subtropical stratocumulus regions. North of the equatorial cold tongue entrainment greatly exceeds subsidence, producing a rapid deepening of the MBL as air flows over a marked SST gradient. Shallow MBLs (z(i) < 500 - 700 m) are found to be well mixed in general. The decoupling increases markedly for deeper boundary layers and is well parameterized as a function of the thickness of the layer extending from the top of the surface mixed layer to the MBL inversion. This study demonstrates new ways in which large-scale observational and reanalysis datasets may be used to aid understanding of MBL boundary layer and cloud systems.

Cruises were undertaken in 2002 and 2003 in phytoplankton dominated open ocean waters of the Celtic Sea and optically complex waters of the Western English Channel (WEC) and North Sea. For all environments, Chla concentrations varied from 0.4 to 7.8 mg m(-3), TSM from 0.2 to 6.0 mg l(-1) and a(CDOM) at 440 nm from 0.02 to 0.30 m(-1). SeaWiFS OC4v4, with the Remote Sensing Data Analysis Service (RSDAS) atmospheric correction for turbid waters, showed the most accurate retrieval of in situ Chla (RMS = 0.24; n = 26), followed by MODIS chlor_a_3 (RMS = 0.40; n = 26). This suggested that improving the atmospheric correction over optically complex waters results in more accurate Chla concentrations compared to those obtained using more complicated Chla algorithms. We found that the SeaWiFS OC4v4 and the MODIS chlor_a_2 switching band ratio algorithms, which mainly use longer wavebands than 443 nm, were less affected by CDOM. They were both more accurate than chlor-MODIS in the higher CDOM waters of the North Sea. Compared to MODIS the absorption model was better at retrieving a(total) (RMS = 0.39; n = 78) and a(CDOM) (RMS 0.79; n = 12) in all study areas and TSM in the WEC (RMS = 0.04; n 10) but it underestimated Chla concentrations (RMS = 0.45; n = 26). The results are discussed in terms of atmospheric correction, sensor characteristics and the functioning and performance of Chla algorithms.

J	Haywood, JM; Osborne, SR; Abel, SJ				Haywood, JM; Osborne, SR; Abel, SJ			The effect of overlying absorbing aerosol layers on remote sensing retrievals of cloud effective radius and cloud optical depth	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												Two types of partially absorbing aerosol are included ill calculations that are based on intensive aircraft observations: biomass burning aerosol characterized during the Southern AFricAn Regional science Initiative (SAFARI 2000) and mineral dust aerosol characterized during the SaHAran Dust Experiment (SHADE). Measurements during SAFARI 2000 reveal that the biomass burning aerosol layer is advected over the South Atlantic ocean at elevated altitudes above the marine boundary layer which is capped by semi-permanent stratocumulus Cloud sheets. Similarly. the mineral dust is measured at elevated altitudes during SHADE resulting in transport above Cloud for distances of several thousands of kilometres. We perforin theoretical calculations of the effect of these partially absorbing aerosol layers on satellite retrievals of cloud effective radius and cloud optical depth. and show that. in these cases. retrievals Of Cloud optical depth or liquid water path are likely to be subject to systematic low biases. The theoretical calculations suggest that the cloud effective radius relay be subject to a significant low bias for Moderate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) retrievals that rely on the 0.86 and 1.63 mum radiance pair for an overlying aerosol layer of either biomass burning aerosol or mineral dust. Conversely, the Cloud effective radius may be Subject to a significant high bias for Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometel or MODIS retrievals that rely on the 0.63 and 3.7 mum radiance pair for an overlying aerosol layer of mineral dust. Analysis of I kin resolution MODIS data for the SAFARI 2000 period suggests that the effective radius derived from the 0.86 and 1.63 pin radiance pair is, indeed, subject to a low bias in the presence of overlying biomass burning aerosol. These results show the difficulties associated with remote sensing retrievals, which must be kept in mind when attempting to assess any potential indirect effect.

CALIPSO will be launched in the fall of 2004 and will provide, for the first time, a global picture of the profile of atmospheric scattering layers using an onboard lidar radiated at 0.532 and 1.064 mum. CALIPSO will fly in an orbital formation with passive radiometers, such as the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectrometer ( MODIS) and the Polarization and Directionality of Earth's Reflectance ( POLDER) instruments, that monitor Earth's atmosphere. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the improvement in retrieval capabilities of profiles of aerosol optical properties using a synergy between passive and active ( lidar) remote sensing techniques. Aerosol properties derived from the MODIS spectroradiometer are used to constrain the inversion of the lidar signal in terms of aerosol optical thickness and effective radius. We use the lidar spectral backscattering coefficient between 0.532 and 1.064 mm to determine the profile of backscatter-to-extinction ratio. The effective radius of an assumed bimodal aerosol size distribution is then retrieved as a function of the altitude. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates the robustness of the inversion procedure in case of noise detection and calibration error. The algorithm has been tested during the Saharan dust experiment, which took place in the northeastern tropical Atlantic in September 2000. The vertical profile of extinction compares well with in situ measurements of the aerosol extinction. Profiles derived from lidar measurements on 25 September highlight the presence of the Saharan air layer located between 2.2 and 4.5 km with particle effective radii of 1.19 +/- 0.6 mm. Another dust layer within the sub-Saharan transition layer over the marine boundary layer is also observed, with particle radii significantly smaller than within the Saharan air layer.																	2169-897X	2169-8996				SEP 8	2003	108	D18							8575	10.1029/2002JD002774								WOS:000189017200001

These measurements are currently used in the calibration and validation of satellite ocean color measurement instruments such as the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS). MOS was designed to be deployed from a ship for single measurements and also integrated into the Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY) for longer time series datasets. Measurements with the two spectrographs in the MOS systems can be compared in the spectral interval from about 580 to 630 nm. In this spectral range, they give different values for Lu or Ed at a common wavelength. To better understand the origin of this observation and the sources of uncertainty in the calibration of MOBY, an MOS bench unit was developed for detailed radiometric characterization and calibration measurements in a laboratory setting. In the work reported here, a novel calibration approach is described that uses a tunable-laser-based, monochromatic, spatially uniform, Lambertian, large area integrating sphere source (ISS). Results are compared with those obtained by a conventional approach using a lamp-illuminated ISS. Differences in the MOS bench unit responsivity between the two calibration approaches were observed and attributed to stray light. A simple correction algorithm was developed for the lamp-illuminated ISS that greatly improves the agreement between the two techniques. Implications for water-leaving radiance measurements by MOS are discussed.																	0739-0572					MAR	2003	20	3					383	391		10.1175/1520-0426(2003)020<0383:RCAACO>2.0.CO;2								WOS:000181175900005						
J	Gasso, S; Hegg, DA				Gasso, S; Hegg, DA			On the retrieval of columnar aerosol mass and CCN concentration by MODIS	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												A parameterization is introduced for the derivation of columnar aerosol mass concentration (AMC) and cloud condensation nucleus concentration (CCNC) from the primary aerosol products of Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The method relies on the scaling between AMC and optical depth with a proportionality constant dependent on MODIS-derived r(eff), eta (contribution of the accumulation mode radiance to the total radiance), ambient RH, and an assumed constant aerosol composition. The CCNC is derived from a parameterization of concentration as a function of the retrieved aerosol volume. By comparing with in situ data, it is shown that retrievals in dry ambient conditions (dust) are improved when using a proportionality constant dependent on r(eff) and eta obtained in the same pixel. In high-humidity environments, the improvement in the new method is inconclusive because of the difficulty in accounting for the uneven vertical distribution of relative humidity. Additionally, two detailed comparisons of AMC and CCNC retrieved by the MODIS Airborne Simulator (MAS) algorithm and the new method are shown. The new method and MAS retrievals of AMC are within the same order of magnitude with respect to the in situ measurements of aerosol mass. However, the proposed method is closer to the in situ measurements than the MODIS retrievals. The retrievals of CCNC are also within the same order of magnitude for both methods. Finally, the new method is applied to an actual MODIS retrieval. Although no in situ data is available for comparison, it is shown that the proposed method yields more credible values than the MODIS retrievals.

J	Chang, FL; Li, ZQ				Chang, FL; Li, ZQ			Estimating the vertical variation of cloud droplet effective radius using multispectral near-infrared satellite measurements	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												[1] This paper presents a satellite-based retrieval method for inferring the vertical variation of cloud droplet effective radius (DER) by utilizing multispectral near-infrared (NIR) measurements at 1.25, 1.65, 2.15, and 3.75 mum, available from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) satellite observations. The method is based on the principle that these multispectral NIR measurements convey DER information from different heights within a cloud, which is sufficient to allow for the retrieval of a linear DER vertical profile. The method is applicable to low-level, nonprecipitating, stratiform clouds as their DER often increases monotonically from cloud bottom to cloud top. As such, an optimum linear DER profile can be derived by comparing multispectral NIR measurements to corresponding model values generated for a large set of linear DER profiles. The retrieval method was evaluated and compared to the conventional 3.7-mum retrieval method by applying both methods to some marine stratocumulus clouds with in situ observations of microphysical profiles. Capable of capturing the DER variation trend, the retrieved linear DER profiles showed large improvement over the conventional 3.75-mum m retrievals. Mean differences between the linear DER retrievals and observed profiles were generally small for both cloud top and bottom (<1.0 &mu;m m), whereas the conventional retrievals are prone to systematic overestimation near cloud bottom. The sensitivities of the linear DER retrieval to various parameters, as well as the error analyses, were also investigated extensively.

Continuous underway measurements allowed simultaneous mapping of the dispersal pattern of riverine organic material and Chl a on the shelf. We used two fluorescence emission ratios to differentiate between riverine and marine COM. The data showed unusually high concentrations of COM offshore. These were attributed to an offshore extension of the Mississippi River plume. Comparisons between in situ Chl a concentrations measured with the SAFIre and Chl a values obtained from the sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS) satellite data using OC4 and MODIS algorithms showed that, although both algorithms overestimated Chi a, MODIS performed better than OC4, particularly in areas with high COM concentrations. Analysis of the relationship between Chl a and COM concentrations within the study area showed regional variability probably caused by differences in river source.

J	Simpson, JJ; McIntire, TJ; Stitt, JR; Hufford, GL				Simpson, JJ; McIntire, TJ; Stitt, JR; Hufford, GL			Improved cloud detection in AVHRR daytime and night-time scenes over the ocean	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Accurate cloud detection is a requirement of many geophysical applications that use visible and infrared satellite data (e.g. cloud climatologies, multichannel sea surface temperature (MCSST)). Unfortunately, a significant source of residual error in such satellite-based products is undetected cloud. Here. a new, computationally efficient cloud detection procedure for both daytime and nighttime Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data is developed. It differs substantially from our prior related work. First, a new clustering procedure is used, which produces more homogeneous and distinct clusters than those produced by either our previous work or the ISODATA algorithm of Ball and Hall. Second, the input information vector is reduced in size, incorporates both radiance and spatial components and each component is normalized. These changes improve the clustering/subsequent classification, tend to decrease execution time. and simplify post-processing of the classified (cloud, clear ocean) data to remove any residual outliers. Third, the enhanced performance makes possible the use of a multipass procedure which is very effective in identifying the complex multilayer cloud structures common in satellite data. Validation with independent lidar observations confirms the accuracy of the new procedure. Marine low stratiform clouds (LSCs-fog, stratus and stratocumulus) are also detected effectively. This advance is important because LSCs are a major source of residual cloud contamination in contemporary sea surface temperature (SST) products. Finally, the method is sufficiently general that it can be adapted to other sensors (e.g. the Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)).																	0143-1161					SEP 10	2001	22	13					2585	2615		10.1080/01431160119916								WOS:000170557000010						
J	Shifrin, KS				Shifrin, KS			An algorithm for determining the radiance reflected from the rough sea surface using MODIS-N satellite radiometer data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												A new algorithm is suggested for determining the radiance B-r (theta, phi) reflected from the rough sea surface. The knowledge of B-r (theta, phi) is needed for excluding the reflected solar radiation from the signal at the space receiver. Information on the reflected radiance is also required when estimating the state of the sea surface from space, The information (on reflected radiance) is important for problems such as estimating the chlorophyll concentration in sea water. The suggested algorithm was constructed based on direct measurements of the radiance coefficient rho published in [1], [14]. The experimental results show that the slope distribution of sea surface elements depends not only on the wind speed near the sea surface but also on the stability of the lower part of the marine atmospheric boundary layer. It is shown that the failure to account for this effect causes an error of +/- 30% when estimating B-r (theta, phi).																	0196-2892					MAR	2001	39	3					677	681		10.1109/36.911124								WOS:000167628100019

Here we present an analysis of in situ aerosol iron data obtained from a wide variety of marine locations to quantify the seasonal Fe inputs to the global ocean. When extrapolated to the global ocean, our results indicate strong seasonal variations in aeolian Fe fluxes in different oceanic basins. The predominant fraction of the Fe inputs enters the oceans in the Northern Hemisphere, with the summer flux rates ca. twice those of winter. The high Fe fluxes in the Northern Hemisphere are concentrated in low and mid-latitudes. With the promising new data from MODIS aboard the Terra satellite, the linkage between Fe fluxes and phytoplankton biomass and productivity may be soon further quantified.																	0094-8276					JAN 1	2001	28	1					29	32		10.1029/2000GL011926								WOS:000166291200009

The data were collected by the University of Washington passive humidigraph (UWPH) mounted on the Pelican research aircraft. Concurrently, particle size distributions, absorption coefficients and aerosol optical depth were measured throughout 17 flights. A parameterization of sigma(sp) as a function of RH was utilized to assess the impact of aerosol hydration on the upwelling radiance (normalized to the solar constant and cosine of zenith angle). The top of the atmosphere radiance signal was simulated at wavelengths corresponding to visible and near-infrared bands of the EOS-AM ("Terra") detectors, MODIS and MISR. The UWPH measured sigma(sp) at 2 RHs, one below and the other above ambient conditions. Ambient sigma(sp) was obtained by interpolation of these 2 measurements. The data were stratified in terms of 3 types of aerosols: Saharan dust, clean marine (marine boundary layer background) and polluted marine aerosols (i.e., 2- or 1-day old polluted aerosols advected from Europe). An empirical relation for the dependence of sigma(sp) on RH, defined by sigma(sp) (RH) = k. (1 - RH/100)(-gamma), was used with the hygroscopic exponent gamma derived from the data. The following gamma values were obtained for the 3 aerosol types: gamma(dust) = 0.23 +/- 0.05, gamma(clean marine) = 0.69 +/- 0.06 and gamma(polluted marine) = 0.57 +/- 0.06. Based on the measured gamma's, the above equation was utilized to derive aerosol models with different hygroscopicities. The satellite simulation signal code 6S was used to compute the upwelling radiance corresponding to each of those aerosol models at several ambient humidities. For the prelaunch estimated precision of the sensors and the assumed viewing geometry of the instrument, the simulations suggest that the spectral and angular dependence of the reflectance measured by MISR is not sufficient to distinguish aerosol models with various different combinations of values for dry composition, gamma and ambient RH. A similar behavior is observed for MODIS at visible wavelengths. However, the 2100 nm band of MODIS appears to be able to differentiate between at least same aerosol models with different aerosol hygroscopicity given the MODIS calibration error requirements. This result suggests the possibility of retrieval of aerosol hygroscopicity by MODIS.

This fully modeled inversion algorithm is then simplified to yield a hybrid modeled-unmodeled inversion algorithm in which the phycoerythrin (PE) absorption coefficient is retrieved as unmodeled 488-nm absorption (which exceeds the modeled phytoplankton and the CDOM-detritus absorption coefficients). Each algorithm was applied to water-leaving radiances, but only hybrid modeled-unmodeled inversions yielded viable retrievals of the PE absorption coefficient. Validation of the PE absorption coefficient retrieval was achieved by relative comparison with airborne laser-induced FEB fluorescence. The modeled-unmodeled retrieval of four inherent optical properties by direct matrix inversion is rapid and well conditioned, but the accuracy is strongly Limited by the accuracy of the three principal inherent optical property models across all four spectral bands. Several research areas are identified to enhance the radiance-model-based retrievals: (ai improved FEB and PUB absorption coefficient models, (b) PE spectral shifts induced by PUB chromophore substitution at chromophore binding sites, (c) specific absorption-sensitive phytoplankton absorption modeling, (d) total constituent backscattering modeling, (e) unmodeled carotinoid and phycocyanin absorption that are not now accounted for in the chlorophyll-dominated phytoplankton absorption coefficient model, and (f) iterative inversion techniques to solve for six constituents with only live radiances. Although considerable progress has been made toward the satellite recovery of PE absorption, the maturity of the retrieval is presently insufficient for routine global application. Instead it must currently be used on a regional basis where localized ship and aircraft, validation can be made available. The algorithm was developed for the MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor but is applicable to any sensor having comparable band locations.

J	Ignatov, A				Ignatov, A			Estimation of the aerosol phase function in backscatter from simultaneous satellite and sun-photometer measurements	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY												The backscatter part of the aerosol phase function P-A(chi), where chi is the scattering angle, is difficult to measure from the ground. Experimental data for chi > 120 degrees are not reported in the literature. Customarily, P-A(chi) is calculated from Mie theory using an aerosol size distribution either prescribed or estimated by inversion of spectral or almucantar/aureole measurements. These results clearly require validation using direct measurements. In this paper, an empirical phase function of atmospheric aerosol over the ocean is estimated in backscatter (chi > 130 degrees) from coincident measurements of upward radiance in channel 1 (0.63 mu m) of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on board National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellites and sun-photometer aerosol optical thickness, delta(SP)(A). This study uses 31 sun-photometer measurements, collected during two oceanic cruises over the North Atlantic in 1989 and 1991. The accuracies of both satellite radiances and sun-photometer delta(SP)(A) are well documented. The Linearized form of the single-scattering approximation for the radiative transfer equation is used, with some adjustments to account approximately for multiple scattering effects, The newly estimated empirical phase function shows variability from one point to another, but on the average, is close to that expected for maritime aerosols as found in the literature. The results of the present study may be used to constrain the range of variability of the aerosol phase function in real marine atmospheres, which is important for aerosol retrieval from historical Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS), present (AVHRR), and future satellite sensors Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR), and Sea-Viewing-Wide-Field-of-View-Sensor (SeaWiFS).

MODIS consists of two separate instruments that scan a swath width sufficient to provide nearly complete global coverage every 2 days from a polar-orbiting, sun-synchronous, platform at an altitude of 705 km. MODIS-N (nadir) will provide images in 36 spectral bands between 0.415 and 14.235-nu-m with spatial resolutions of 250 m (2 bands), 500 m (5 bands), and 1000 m (29 bands). These bands have been carefully selected to enable advanced studies of land, ocean, and atmospheric processes. In this paper we describe the status of MODIS-N and its companion instrument MODIS-T (tilt), a tiltable cross-track scanning spectrometer with 32 uniformly spaced channels between 0.410 and 0.875-nu-m. In addition, we review the various methods being developed for the remote sensing of atmospheric properties using MODIS, placing primary emphasis on the principal atmospheric applications of determining the optical, microphysical, and physical properties of clouds and aerosol particles from spectral reflection and thermal emission measurements. In addition to cloud and aerosol properties, MODIS-N will be used for determining the total precipitable water vapour and atmospheric stability. The physical principles behind the determination of each of these atmospheric products will be described herein, together with an example of their application to aircraft and/or satellite measurements. Extensions of these and related methods to MODIS observations pose an extraordinary challenge as well as a unique opportunity to enhance our understanding of the earth-atmosphere-ocean system.
