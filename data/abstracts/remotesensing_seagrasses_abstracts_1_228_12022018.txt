J	Beck, MW; Hagy, JD; Le, CF				Beck, Marcus W.; Hagy, James D., III; Le, Chengfeng			Quantifying Seagrass Light Requirements Using an Algorithm to Spatially Resolve Depth of Colonization	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Depth of colonization (Z (c)) is a useful seagrass growth metric that describes seagrass response to light availability. Similarly, percent surface irradiance at Z (c) (% SI) is an indicator of seagrass light requirements with applications in seagrass ecology and management. Methods for estimating Z (c) and % SI are highly variable making meaningful comparisons difficult. A new algorithm is presented to compute maps of median and maximum Z (c), Z (c,med), and Z (c,max), respectively, for four Florida coastal areas (Big Bend, Tampa Bay, Choctawhatchee Bay, Indian River Lagoon). Maps of light attenuation (K (d)) based on MODIS satellite imagery, PAR profiles, and Secchi depth measurements were combined with seagrass growth estimates to produce maps of % SI at Z (c,med) and Z (c,max). Among estuary segments, mean Z (c,med) varied from (+/- SE) 0.80 +/- 0.13 m for Old Tampa Bay to 2.33 +/- 0.26 m for Western Choctawhatchee Bay. Standard errors for Z (c,med) were 1-10% of the segment means. Percent SI at Z (c,med) averaged 18% for Indian River Lagoon (range = 9-24%), 42% for Tampa Bay (37-48%), and 58% for Choctawhatchee Bay (51-75%). Estimates of % SI were significantly lower in Indian River Lagoon than in the other estuaries, while estimates for Tampa Bay and Choctawhatchee Bay were higher than the often cited estimate of 20%. Spatial gradients in depth of colonization and % SI were apparent in all estuaries. The analytical approach could be applied easily to new data from these estuaries or to other estuaries and could be incorporated routinely in assessments of seagrass status and condition.

In situ Rrs measurements validation results show that this model performs well in distinguishing cyanobacterial bloom from floating leaf vegetation in Lake Taihu. We apply this model to 52 remote sensing images from the Medium-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) from 2003 to 2011. Using two different accuracy evaluation methods, we find an average recognition accuracy of more than 80% for cyanobacterial bloom and floating leaf vegetation when using optimal index thresholds. Using an average index threshold to extract cyanobacterial bloom and floating leaf vegetation from the images, the relative accuracies are 78.8% and 74.6%, respectively. If more efficiency is desired, these average thresholds can be used, which is convenient for batch processing and automated extraction of cyanobacterial bloom and floating leaf vegetation from remote sensing data. The overall distribution of cyanobacterial bloom and floating leaf vegetation in Lake Taihu from 2003 to 2011 is determined by overlapping the distribution maps from individual images, and the results of our analysis are consistent with previously published results. In addition, our analysis shows that this model is immune to perturbations from thin clouds and aerosols.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				JAN	2018	11	1					34	44		10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2757006								WOS:000422950700004						
J	Hamylton, SM				Hamylton, Sarah M.			Mapping coral reef environments: A review of historical methods, recent advances and future opportunities	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Coral reef environments support high levels of marine biodiversity, they are important sites for coastal habitation and they provide a range of goods and ecosystem services such as nearshore fisheries, economic revenue from tourism and breeding sites for seabirds and turtles. Mapping is a fundamental activity that underpins our understanding of coral reef environments and helps to shape policies in resource management and conservation. This is particularly the case for quantifying the area of landcover types associated with reef environments, including coral patches, seagrasses and mangroves, but also for monitoring how these change over time and modelling how spatial patterns apparent on reefs are related to environmental drivers. Field techniques and aerial photography have historically played a crucial role in mapping coral reef environments, which has recently seen a transition toward the processing of satellite remote sensing images. This paper examines a series of maps produced of Low Isles, the most mapped island on the Great Barrier Reef, to review historical methods for mapping coral reefs because of the critical importance of understanding how past maps were made, which determines appropriate uses to which they can be put. Recent advances and future opportunities for the application of mapping technologies to coral reefs are also evaluated, including the use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms for airborne surveys, delivery of information through web-based platforms and improvements in the quality of information for making and presenting maps. Maps have transformed the way we have responded to both historic and contemporary coral reef problems. This timely review communicates how maps, and the fast growing technologies that are employed to produce them, are central to our understanding of coral reef environments. Recent advances that may drive exciting new environmental management tools are identified.																	0309-1333	1477-0296				DEC	2017	41	6					803	833		10.1177/0309133317744998								WOS:000418042100006						
J	Eugenio, F; Marcello, J; Martin, J; Rodriguez-Esparragon, D				Eugenio, Francisco; Marcello, Javier; Martin, Javier; Rodriguez-Esparragon, Dionisio			Benthic Habitat Mapping Using Multispectral High-Resolution Imagery: Evaluation of Shallow Water Atmospheric Correction Techniques	SENSORS												Remote multispectral data can provide valuable information for monitoring coastal water ecosystems. Specifically, high-resolution satellite-based imaging systems, as WorldView-2 (WV-2), can generate information at spatial scales needed to implement conservation actions for protected littoral zones. However, coastal water-leaving radiance arriving at the space-based sensor is often small as compared to reflected radiance. In this work, complex approaches, which usually use an accurate radiative transfer code to correct the atmospheric effects, such as FLAASH, ATCOR and 6S, have been implemented for high-resolution imagery. They have been assessed in real scenarios using field spectroradiometer data. In this context, the three approaches have achieved excellent results and a slightly superior performance of 6S model-based algorithm has been observed. Finally, for the mapping of benthic habitats in shallow-waters marine protected environments, a relevant application of the proposed atmospheric correction combined with an automatic deglinting procedure is presented. This approach is based on the integration of a linear mixing model of benthic classes within the radiative transfer model of the water. The complete methodology has been applied to selected ecosystems in the Canary Islands (Spain) but the obtained results allow the robust mapping of the spatial distribution and density of seagrass in coastal waters and the analysis of multitemporal variations related to the human activity and climate change in littoral zones.

Nevertheless, this type of research is scarce, as the required databases are often unavailable. The objectives of this study are to create a method for mapping the seagrass Zostera noltei using remote sensing techniques, and to apply it to the characterization of the meadows' extension trend and the potential drivers of change. A time series was created using a novel method based on remote sensing techniques that proved to be adequate for mapping the seagrass in the emerged intertidal. The meadows seem to have a decreasing trend between 1984 and the early 2000s, followed by an increasing tendency that represents a recovery in the extension area of the species. This 30-year analysis demonstrated the Z noltei's recovery in the study site, similar to that in other estuaries nearby and contrary to the worldwide decreasing behavior of seagrasses.

Multiple stressors threaten the imperiled coastal foundation species eelgrass (Zostera marina) in Chesapeake Bay, USA	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Interactions among global change stressors and their effects at large scales are often proposed, but seldom evaluated. This situation is primarily due to lack of comprehensive, sufficiently long-term, and spatially extensive datasets. Seagrasses, which provide nursery habitat, improve water quality, and constitute a globally important carbon sink, are among the most vulnerable habitats on the planet. Here, we unite 31 years of high-resolution aerial monitoring and water quality data to elucidate the patterns and drivers of eelgrass (Zostera marina) abundance in Chesapeake Bay, USA, one of the largest and most valuable estuaries in the world, with an unparalleled history of regulatory efforts. We show that eelgrass area has declined 29% in total since 1991, with wide-ranging and severe ecological and economic consequences. We go on to identify an interaction between decreasing water clarity and warming temperatures as the primary drivers of this trend. Declining clarity has gradually reduced eelgrass cover the past two decades, primarily in deeper beds where light is already limiting. In shallow beds, however, reduced visibility exacerbates the physiological stress of acute warming, leading to recent instances of decline approaching 80%. While degraded water quality has long been known to influence underwater grasses worldwide, we demonstrate a clear and rapidly emerging interaction with climate change. We highlight the urgent need to integrate a broader perspective into local water quality management, in the Chesapeake Bay and in the many other coastal systems facing similar stressors.

This phenomenon is due to the effect of the degradation of water environment. Turbidity is one of the most important water quality parameters directly related to underwater light penetration which affects the primary productivity. This study aims to investigate spatiotemporal variation of turbidity in the waters with major factors affecting its patterns using remote sensing data. An algorithm for turbidity retrieval was developed based on the correlation between in situ measurements and a red band of Landsat 8 OLI with R-2 = 0.84 (p < 0.05). Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) model was used to compute bed shear stress, a major factor affecting turbidity in shallow waters. In addition, the relationships between turbidity and rainfall, and bed shear stress induced by wind were analyzed. It was found that: (1) In the dry season, turbidity was low at the middle of the bay while it was high in shallow waters nearby coastlines. Resuspension of bed sediment was a major factor controlling turbidity during time with no rainfall. (2) In the rainy season or for a short time after rainfall in the dry season, turbidity was high due to a large amount of runoff entering into the study area.																	2073-4441					AUG	2017	9	8							570	10.3390/w9080570								WOS:000408729200017

Comparing Automated Classification and Digitization Approaches to Detect Change in Eelgrass Bed Extent during Restoration of a Large River Delta	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												Native eelgrass (Zostera marina) is an important contributor to ecosystem services that supplies cover for juvenile fish, supports a variety of invertebrate prey resources for fish and waterbirds, provides substrate for herring roe consumed by numerous fish and birds, helps stabilize sediment, and sequesters organic carbon. Seagrasses are in decline globally, and monitoring changes in their growth and extent is increasingly valuable to determine impacts from large-scale estuarine restoration and inform blue carbon mapping initiatives. Thus, we examined the efficacy of two remote sensing mapping methods with high-resolution (0.5 m pixel size) color near infrared imagery with ground validation to assess change following major tidal marsh restoration. Automated classification of false color aerial imagery and digitized polygons documented a slight decline in eelgrass area directly after restoration followed by an increase two years later. Classification of sparse and low to medium density eelgrass was confounded in areas with algal cover, however large dense patches of eelgrass were well delineated. Automated classification of aerial imagery from unsupervised and supervised methods provided reasonable accuracies of 73% and hand-digitizing polygons from the same imagery yielded similar results. Visual clues for hand digitizing from the high-resolution imagery provided as reliable a map of dense eelgrass extent as automated image classification. We found that automated classification had no advantages over manual digitization particularly because of the limitations of detecting eelgrass with only three bands of imagery and near infrared.																	0029-344X	2161-9859				AUG	2017	91	3					272	282		10.3955/046.091.0307								WOS:000408014800005						
J	Foster, NR; Fotheringham, DG; Brock, DJ; Waycott, M				Foster, Nicole R.; Fotheringham, Douglas G.; Brock, Daniel J.; Waycott, Michelle			A resourceful and adaptable method to obtain data on the status of seagrass meadows	AQUATIC BOTANY												Coastline degradation, as well as subsequent ecosystem loss, has long been attributed to anthropogenic stress and is an all too familiar issue affecting coastal habitats. Should management and conservation efforts fail to improve the quality of coastal ecosystems and the services they provide, they may be irrevocably damaged. A significant limitation to conservation efforts is often the ability to track change in seagrass meadows due to the significant time and cost of monitoring efforts in underwater habitats. Remote sensing is often a tool used to improve our knowledge of habitat status, however, ground-truthing remote sensing results is difficult when historical data is required. We apply an innovative and resourceful approach to the attainment of data to check the status of seagrass meadows from resources that are available in many areas due to the collection of other data sets. We employ the use of underwater digital photographs originally taken for monitoring sediment movement patterns. We were successfully able to develop a method to critically and easily evaluate these photographs for habitat status, enabling the generation of a data set unable to be obtained in other ways. This method can further be utilised in a citizen science project, for other underwater digital photographs, to support the assessment of coastal submerged ecosystem habitat status.																	0304-3770	1879-1522				JUL	2017	141						17	21		10.1016/j.aquabot.2017.04.006								WOS:000404320800003

Coastal zones that are increasingly impacted by anthropogenic development have experienced substantial declines in seagrass abundance around the world. Australia, which has some of the world's largest seagrass meadows and is home to over half of the known species, is not immune to these losses. In 1999 a review of seagrass ecosystems knowledge was conducted in Australia and strategic research priorities were developed to provide research direction for future studies and management. Subsequent rapid evolution of seagrass research and scientific methods has led to more than 70% of peer reviewed seagrass literature being produced since that time. A workshop was held as part of the Australian Marine Sciences Association conference in July 2015 in Geelong, Victoria, to update and redefine strategic priorities in seagrass research. Participants identified 40 research questions from 10 research fields (taxonomy and systematics, physiology, population biology, sediment biogeochemistry and microbiology, ecosystem function, faunal habitats, threats, rehabilitation and restoration, mapping and monitoring, management tools) as priorities for future research on Australian seagrasses. Progress in research will rely on advances in areas such as remote sensing, genomic tools, microsensors, computer modeling, and statistical analyses. A more interdisciplinary approach will be needed to facilitate greater understanding of the complex interactions among seagrasses and their environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In recent years, methods based on radiative transfer model inversion have shown promising results for extracting information about seabed type, bottom depth and water constituents from hyperspectral imagery. However, low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) due to low water-leaving radiance combined with environmental variability make it very difficult to design an optimal processing algorithm. Here, we selected a state-of-the-art, forward semi-analytical model in which we included a mixing model of four seabed albedo, namely sand, corals, algae and seagrass. The purpose of this paper was then to compare different setups of the inversion scheme, each one having its own theoretical strengths and weaknesses regarding the different confounding factors. Six inversion setups were implemented, corresponding to the combinations between (i) three cost functions: least square (LS), spectral angle mapper (SAM) and least square on spectral derivative (LSD), and (ii) two physical constraints imposed on the seabed type retrieval: abundance sum-to-one constraint (ASC) and a relaxed version (RASC). Performances of bathymetry and seabed type retrieval were evaluated on hyperspectral data acquired in a coral reef environment in Reunion Island. Our results showed that the accuracy and robustness of the bathymetric estimation were greatly influenced by the choice of the inversion setup. RASC-LSD produced the overall best performances even if SAM-based inversion setups showed particularly low error dispersion with respect to Lidar derived bathymetry. RASC-LSD also produced the most accurate results in terms of spatial coverage of benthic components on a very shallow area (inner part of a fringing reef). The results on our study areas clearly highlighted the interest of relaxing the ASC when the bottom depth is shallow. In deeper areas, ASC versions of LS- and LSD-based inversion setups produced the best seabed type mapping results. Only broad seabed types could be retrieved in areas deeper than 10 m.

Trade-offs between data resolution, accuracy, and cost when choosing information to plan reserves for coral reef ecosystems	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Conservation planners must reconcile trade-offs associated with using biodiversity data of differing qualities to make decisions. Coarse habitat classifications are commonly used as surrogates to design marine reserve networks when fine-scale biodiversity data are incomplete or unavailable. Although finely-classified habitat maps provide more detail, they may have more misclassification errors, a common problem when remotely-sensed imagery is used. Despite these issues, planners rarely consider the effects of errors when choosing data for spatially explicit conservation prioritizations. Here we evaluate trade-offs between accuracy and resolution of hierarchical coral reef habitat data (geomorphology and benthic substrate) derived from remote sensing, in spatial planning for Kubulau District, Fiji. For both, we use accuracy information describing the probability that a mapped habitat classification is correct to design marine reserve networks that achieve habitat conservation targets, and demonstrate inadequacies of using habitat maps without accuracy data. We show that using more detailed habitat information ensures better representation of biogenic habitats (i.e. coral and seagrass), but leads to larger and more costly reserves, because these data have more misclassification errors, and are also more expensive to obtain. Reduced impacts on fishers are possible using coarsely-classified data, which are also more cost-effective for planning reserves if we account for data collection costs, but using these data may under-represent reef habitats that are important for fisheries and biodiversity, due to the maps low thematic resolution. Finally, we show that explicitly accounting for accuracy information in decisions maximizes the chance of successful conservation outcomes by reducing the risk of missing conservation representation targets, particularly when using finely classified data.

Potential impacts of land use change dynamics and submarine groundwater discharge on fringing reefs of Kuroshima Island, Japan	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												The land based sources of pollution are major threat to the reef ecosystems; therefore, it is important to ascertain the temporal and spatial change pattern of coral cover at local scale to understand the causal links between reef degradation and ground discharge impact with changing land use practices. The land use change dynamics and its impacts on surrounding reefs were investigated using aerial photographs of 1977, 1994 and 2005 of Kuroshima Island, Japan by integrating remote sensing and GIS (Geographic Information System) approach. And the impact of groundwater associated nutrient discharge was estimated using Rn-222(radon) as an SGD (submarine groundwater discharge) tracer. Findings indicate that the land used for grazing has increased (597%) during the study period and most of this increase has been at the expense of forest and shrub land. The landscape development intensity (LDI) index, was used to evaluate the impact of land driven activities on coral assemblages. LDI results infer that north-eastern watershed (2.84), south-eastern watershed (3.02) and north-western watersheds (2.75 to 2.88) are most critical watersheds with higher LDI in comparison to other watersheds due to the enormous increase in pasture land. The benthic cover change analysis indicates the overgrowth of seagrass (99.5%) and microalgal productivity (99.6%) especially in the northern, western and southeastern part of the Island during 1977 to 2005. The groundwater discharge with high concentration of land-derived nutrients was observed as the main source for the reduction in coral cover around Kuroshima island.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				FEB	2017	21	1					245	254		10.1007/s11852-017-0495-7								WOS:000399030200022						
J	Pu, R; Bell, S				Pu, Ruiliang; Bell, Susan			Mapping seagrass coverage and spatial patterns with high spatial resolution IKONOS imagery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Seagrass habitats in subtidal coastal waters provide a variety of ecosystem functions and services and there is an increasing need to acquire information on spatial and temporal dynamics of this resource. Here, we explored the capability of IKONOS (IKO) data of high resolution (4m) for mapping seagrass cover [submerged aquatic vegetation (%SAV) cover] along the mid-western coast of Florida, USA. We also compared seagrass maps produced with IKO data with that obtained using the Landsat TM sensor with lower resolution (30m). Both IKO and TM data, collected in October 2009, were preprocessed to calculate water depth invariant bands to normalize the effect of varying depth on bottom spectra recorded by the two satellite sensors and further the textural information was extracted from IKO data. Our results demonstrate that the high resolution IKO sensor produced a higher accuracy than the TM sensor in a three-class % SAV cover classification. Of note is that the OA of %SAV cover mapping at our study area created with IKO data was 5-20% higher than that from other studies published. We also examined the spatial distribution of seagrass over a spatial range of 4-240 m using the Ripley's K function [L(d)] and IKO data that represented four different grain sizes [4 m (one IKO pixel), 8 m (2 x 2 IKO pixels), 12 m (3 x 3 IKO pixels), and 16 m (4 x 4 IKO pixels)] from moderate-dense seagrass cover along a set of six transects. The Ripley's K metric repeatedly indicated that seagrass cover representing 4m x 4m pixels displayed a dispersed (or slightly dispersed) pattern over distances of <4-8 m, and a random or slightly clustered pattern of cover over 9-240m. The spatial pattern of seagrass cover created with the three additional grain sizes (i.e., 2 x 24m IKO pixels, 3 x 34m IKO pixels, and 4 x 4m IKO pixels) show a dispersed (or slightly dispersed) pattern across 4-32 m and a random or slightly clustered pattern across 33-240m. Given the first report on using satellite observations to quantify seagrass spatial patterns at a spatial scale from 4m to 240m, our novel analyses of moderate-dense SAV cover utilizing Ripley's K function illustrate how data obtained from the IKO sensor revealed seagrass spatial information that would be undetected by the TM sensor with a 30 m pixel size. Use of the seagrass classification scheme here, along with data from the IKO sensor with enhanced resolution, offers an opportunity to synoptically record seagrass cover dynamics at both small and large spatial scales.(C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A pushbroom hyperspectral imager was used to calculate bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) signatures. Hyperspectral signatures of different water types and bottom habitats such as submerged seagrasses, drift algae and algal bloom waters were scanned using a high spectral and digital resolution solid state spectrograph WorldView-3 satellite imagery with minimal water wave sun glint effects was used to demonstrate the ability to detect bottom features using a derivative reflectance spectroscopy approach with the 1.3 m GSD multispectral satellite channels centered at the solar induced fluorescence band. The hyperspectral remote sensing data collected from the Banana River and Indian River Lagoon watersheds represents previously unknown signatures to be used in satellite and airborne remote sensing of water in turbid waters along the US Atlantic Ocean coastal region and the Florida littoral zone.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-1309-6; 978-1-5106-1308-9				2017	10422								UNSP 104220E	10.1117/12.2288511								WOS:000418795400008

This paper presents the spectral reflectance response of several tropical seagrass species. These species are Enhalus acoroides (Ea), Thalassia hemprichii (Th) and Cymodocea rotundata (Cr). Spectral reflectance response of healthy seagrass, epiphyte-covered seagrass, and damaged seagrass leaves for each species were measured using Jaz EL-350 field spectrometer ranged from 350 - 1100 nm. Repeated measurements were performed above water on harvested seagrass leaves. The results indicate that there is a change in spectral reflectance response of damaged or epiphyte-covered seagrass leaves compared to the healthy leaves. The results show similar pattern for the three species, where the peak reflectance in visible wavelengths shifted toward longer wavelengths on damaged seagrass leaves. The results of this research open up a possibility of mapping seagrass health condition using remote sensing image.

Genetic Description and Remote Sensing Techniques as Management Tools for Zostera noltii Seagrass Populations along the Atlantic Moroccan Coast	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Seagrass meadows provide an essential ecological service in coastal ecosystems worldwide, although they are sensitive to many human factors, as a serious global regression has been documented. During sampling along the Atlantic Moroccan coast, five coastal lagoons were found characterized by the presence of intertidal monospecific seagrass Zostera noltii meadows (from south to north, Nayla, Oualidia, Sidi Moussa, Moulay Bousselham, and Larache). Two descriptive methods used to characterize Z. noltii populations could be used as management tools for future monitoring implementations: (1) the estimation of surface area covered by Z. noltii meadows using remote sensing techniques and in situ field surveys, and (2) the genetic characterisation of Z. noltii populations using simple sequence repeats (microsatellites) as molecular markers. Results revealed that the Nayla lagoon showed the largest area covered by Z. noltii (26,9,868 m(2)) and the highest coverage rate (5.19%), while presenting the lowest genetic/genotypic diversity values (T = 36, (A) over cap =3.58, G=50; R=0.544; H-e=0.43). On the other hand, northern populations displayed lower rates of seagrass coverage (similar to 1%) and higher values of genetic/genotypic diversity. Further genetic characterization also revealed that Z. noltii populations seem to be highly isolated in three geographically independent regions: northern Morocco (R1, Larache and Moulay Bousselham), central Morocco (R2, Oualidia and Sidi Moussa), and southern Morocco (R3, Nayla), which should be considered independent management units. Both seagrass coverage rate and the genetic description of seagrass populations along the Atlantic Moroccan coast seem to be useful management tools that could be used to evaluate changes in seagrass meadows over time to further establish appropriate conservation strategies.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JAN	2017	33	1					78	87		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-15-00111.1								WOS:000394926100006						
J	Baumstark, R; Duffey, R; Pu, RL				Baumstark, Rene; Duffey, Renee; Pu, Ruiliang			Mapping seagrass and colonized hard bottom in Springs Coast, Florida using WorldView-2 satellite imagery	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The offshore extent of seagrass habitat along the West Florida (USA) coast represents an important corridor for inshore-offshore migration of economically important fish and shellfish. Surviving at the fringe of light requirements, offshore seagrass beds are sensitive to changes in water clarity. Beyond and intermingled with the offshore seagrass areas are large swaths of colonized hard bottom. These offshore habitats of the West Florida coast have lacked mapping efforts needed for status and trends monitoring. The objective of this study was to propose an object-based classification method for mapping offshore habitats and to compare results to traditional photo-interpreted maps. Benthic maps were created from WorldView-2 satellite imagery using an Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) method and a visual photo interpretation method. A logistic regression analysis identified depth and distance from shore as significant parameters for discriminating spectrally similar seagrass and colonized hard bottom features. Seagrass, colonized hard bottom and unconsolidated sediment (sand) were mapped with 78% overall accuracy using the OBIA method compared to 71% overall accuracy using the photo-interpretation method. This study suggests an alternative for mapping deeper, offshore habitats capable of producing higher thematic and spatial resolution maps compared to those created with the traditional photo interpretation method.

Remote-Sensed Mapping of Sargassum spp. Distribution around Rottnest Island, Western Australia, Using High-Spatial Resolution WorldView-2 Satellite Data	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Satellite remote sensing is one of the most efficient techniques for marine habitat studies in shallow coastal waters, especially in clear waters where field observations can be easily carried out. However, such in situ observations have certain limitations: they are time consuming, have a limited ability to capture spatial variability, and require an interdisciplinary approach between marine biologists and remote-sensing specialists. The main objective of this study was to survey and map Sargassum beds around Rottnest Island, Western Australia, through a combination of high spatial resolution WorldView-2 imagery, using a validated depth invariant index model for water-column correction, and in-field observations. The combination of field survey data and four classification methods resulted in highly accurate classification outcomes that showed the distribution patterns of Sargassum spp. around Rottnest Island during the austral spring season (October 2013). Overall, the minimum distance and Mahalanobis classifiers yielded the highest overall accuracy rates of 98.32% (kappa coefficient, kappa = 0.96) and 98.30% (kappa = 0.96), respectively. The K-means classification method gave the lowest accuracy percentage of 42.50% (kappa = 0.22). Thus, the primary results of this study provide useful baseline information that is necessary for marine-conservation strategic planning and the sustainable utilization of brown macroalgae resources around the Western Australian coast.

Its habitats are highly productive and harbour high standing stocks and densities of benthic species, well adapted to the demanding environmental conditions. Therefore, the Wadden Sea is one of the most important areas for migratory birds in the world and thus protected by national and international legislation, which amongst others requires extensive monitoring. Due to the inaccessibility of major areas of the Wadden Sea, a classification approach based on optical and radar remote sensing has been developed to support environmental monitoring programmes. In this study, the general classification framework as well as two specific monitoring cases, mussel beds and seagrass meadows, are presented. The classification of mussel beds profits highly from inclusion of radar data due to their rough surface and achieves agreements of up to 79 % with areal data from the regular monitoring programme. Classification of seagrass meadows reaches even higher agreements with monitoring data ( up to 100 %) and furthermore captures seagrass densities as low as 10 %. The main classification results are information on area and location of individual habitats. These are needed to fulfil environmental legislation requirements. One of the major advantages of this approach is the large areal coverage with individual satellite images, allowing simultaneous assessment of both accessible and inaccessible areas and thus providing a more complete overall picture.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				OCT	2016	188	10							595	10.1007/s10661-016-5591-x								WOS:000384330800053	27681444

M.; van Gils, Jan A.; van der Heide, Tjisse			Drought, Mutualism Breakdown, and Landscape-Scale Degradation of Seagrass Beds	CURRENT BIOLOGY												In many marine ecosystems, biodiversity critically depends on foundation species such as corals and seagrasses that engage in mutualistic interactions [1-3]. Concerns grow that environmental disruption of marine mutualisms exacerbates ecosystem degradation, with breakdown of the obligate coral mutualism ("coral bleaching") being an iconic example [2, 4, 5]. However, as these mutualisms are mostly facultative rather than obligate, it remains unclear whether mutualism breakdown is a common risk in marine ecosystems, and thus a potential accelerator of ecosystem degradation. Here, we provide evidence that. drought triggered landscape-scale seagrass degradation and show the consequent failure of a facultative mutualistic feedback between seagrass and sulfide-consuming lucinid bivalves that in turn appeared to exacerbate the observed collapse. Local climate and remote sensing analyses revealed seagrass collapse after a summer with intense low-tide drought stress. Potential analysis a novel approach to detect feedback-mediated state shifts-revealed two attractors (healthy and degraded states) during the collapse, suggesting that the drought disrupted internal feedbacks to cause abrupt, patch-wise degradation. Field measurements comparing degraded patches that were healthy before the collapse with patches that remained healthy demonstrated that bivalves declined dramatically in degrading patches with associated high sediment sulfide concentrations, confirming the breakdown of the mutualistic seagrass-lucinid feedback. Our findings indicate that drought triggered mutualism breakdown, resulting in toxic sulfide concentrations that aggravated seagrass degradation. We conclude that external disturbances can cause sudden breakdown of facultative marine mutualistic feedbacks. As this may amplify ecosystem degradation, we suggest including mutualisms in marine conservation and restoration approaches.				van der Geest, Matthijs/A-4744-2013; Olff, Han/A-8516-2008; Smolders, Alfons/H-2583-2012; Lamers, Leon/A-8718-2012; van der Heide, Tjisse/M-3000-2013; van Gils, Jan/B-5544-2008; Christianen, Marjolijn/B-8847-2011	van der Geest, Matthijs/0000-0002-9837-3803; Olff, Han/0000-0003-2154-3576; Lamers, Leon/0000-0003-3769-2154; van Gils, Jan/0000-0002-4132-8243; Christianen, Marjolijn/0000-0001-5839-2981; van Belzen, Jim/0000-0003-2099-1545												0960-9822	1879-0445				APR 25	2016	26	8					1051	1056		10.1016/j.cub.2016.02.023								WOS:000375339700023	26972316

In this study, Worldview-2 (WV-2) imagery was combined with field sampling to demonstrate the capability of mapping species type, percentage cover, and above-ground biomass of seagrasses in monsoonal southern Thailand. A high accuracy positioning technique, involving the Real Time Kinematic (RTK) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), was used to record field sample data positions and reduce uncertainties in matching locations between satellite and field data sets. Our results showed high accuracy (90.67%) in mapping seagrass distribution and moderate accuracies for mapping percentage cover and species type (73.74% and 75.00%, respectively). Seagrass species type mapping was successfully achieved despite discrimination confusion among Halophila ovalis, Thalassia hemprichii, and Enhalus acoroides species with greater than 50% cover. The green, yellow, and near infrared spectral channels ofWV-2 were used to estimate the above-ground biomass using a multiple linear regression model (RMSE of +/- 10.38 g.DW/m(2), R = 0.68). The average total above-ground biomass was 23.95 +/- 10.38 g.DW/m(2). The seagrass maps produced in this study are an important step towards measuring the attributes of seagrass biodiversity and can be used as inputs to seagrass dynamic models and conservation efforts.

J	Uhrin, AV; Townsend, PA				Uhrin, Amy V.; Townsend, Philip A.			Improved seagrass mapping using linear spectral unmixing of aerial photographs	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Mapping of seagrass is challenging, particularly in areas where seagrass cover ranges from extensive, continuous meadows to aggregations of patchy mounds often no more than a meter across. Manual delineation of seagrass habitat polygons through visual photointerpretation of high resolution aerial imagery remains the most widely adopted approach for mapping seagrass extent but polygons often include unvegetated gaps. Although mapped polygon data exist for many estuaries, these are likely insufficient to accurately characterize spatial pattern or estimate area actually occupied by seagrass. We evaluated whether a linear spectral unmixing (LSU) classifier applied to manually-delineated seagrass polygons clipped from digital aerial images could improve mapping of seagrass in North Carolina. Representative seagrass endmembers were chosen directly from images and used to unmix image-clipped polygons, resulting in fraction planes (maps) of the proportion of seagrass present in each image pixel. Thresholding was used to generate seagrass maps for each pixel proportion from 0 (no thresholding, all pixel proportions included) to 1 (only pixels having 100% seagrass) in 0.1 increments. The optimal pixel proportion for identifying seagrass was assessed using Euclidean distance calculated from Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and overall thematic accuracy calculated from confusion matrices. We assessed overall classifier performance using Kappa statistics and Area Under the (ROC) Curve (AUC). We compared seagrass area calculated from each threshold map to the total area of the corresponding manually-delineated polygon. LSU effectively classified seagrass and performed better than a random classification as indicated by high values for both Kappa statistics (0.72-98) and AUC (0.80-0.99). The LSU classifier effectively distinguished between seagrass and bare substrate resulting in fine-scale sea grass maps with overall thematic accuracies that exceeded our expected accuracy target of 85% (range: 86.3-99.0%) and were comparable to those reported from previous seagrass mapping studies utilizing aerial image spectral data. The pixel proportion producing seagrass maps with highest accuracy varied among sites (range: 0 to 0.5). The optimal pixel proportion determined from Euclidean distance varied among sites (range: 0.2 to 0.6) and differed from those having highest accuracy. Importantly, the classifier identified small patches of seagrass, resulting in seagrass area estimates that were 2-94% lower than the area of the corresponding habitat polygon. We conclude that where seagrass polygon data exist, LSU can be used together with photointerpretation to generate spatially resolved maps suitable for analysis of seagrass spatial configuration and provide improved estimates of actual seagrass acreage.

J	Misbari, S; Hashim, M				Misbari, Syarifuddin; Hashim, Mazlan			Change Detection of Submerged Seagrass Biomass in Shallow Coastal Water	REMOTE SENSING												Satellite remote sensing is an advanced tool used to characterize seagrass biomass and monitor changes in clear to less-turbid waters by analyzing multi-temporal satellite images. Seagrass information was extracted from the multi-temporal satellite datasets following a two-step procedure: (i) retrieval of substrate-leaving radiances; and (ii) estimation of seagrass total aboveground biomass (STAGB). Firstly, the substrate leaving radiances is determined by compensating the water column correction of the pre-processed data because of the inherent errors associated with the geometric and radiometric fidelities including atmospheric perturbations. Secondly, the seagrass leaving radiances were correlated to the corresponding in situ STAGB to predict seagrass biomass. The relationship between STAGB and cover percentage was then established for seagrass meadows occurring in Merambong, Straits of Johor, Malaysia. By applying the above-mentioned approach on Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) acquired in 2009 and Operational Land Imager (OLI) data acquired in 2013, the resulting maps indicated that submerged STAGB in less clear water can be successfully quantified empirically from Landsat data, and can be utilized in STAGB change detection over time. Data validation showed a good agreement between in situ STAGB and Landsat TM (R-2 = 0.977, p < 0.001) and OLI (R-2 = 0.975, p < 0.001) derived water leaving radiances for the studied seagrass meadows. The STAGB was estimated as 803 +/- 0.47 kg in 2009, while it was 752.3 +/- 0.34 kg in 2013, suggesting a decrease of 50.7 kg within the four-year interval. This could be mainly due to land reclamation in the intertidal mudflat areas performed, with a view to increase port facilities and coastal landscape development. Statistics on dugong sightings also supports changes in STAGB.

Remote sensing monitoring products have been developed to map the spatial extent, composition and frequency of occurrence of river plumes in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. There is, however, a need to incorporate these monitoring products into Risk Assessment Frameworks as management decision tools. A simple Satellite Risk Framework has been recently proposed to generate maps of potential risk to seagrass and coral reef ecosystems in the GBR focusing on the Austral tropical wet season. This framework was based on a "magnitude x likelihood" risk management approach and GBR plume water types mapped from satellite imagery. The GBR plume water types (so called "Primary" for the inshore plume waters, "Secondary" for the midshelf-plume waters and "Tertiary" for the offshore plume waters) represent distinct concentrations and combinations of land-sourced and marine contaminants. The current study aimed to test and refine the methods of the Satellite Risk Framework. It compared predicted pollutant concentrations in plume water types (multi-annual average from 2005-2014) to published ecological thresholds, and combined this information with similarly long-term measures of seagrass and coral ecosystem health. The Satellite Risk Framework and newly-introduced multi-annual risk scores were successful in demonstrating where water conditions were, on average, correlated to adverse biological responses. Seagrass meadow abundance (multi-annual change in % cover) was negatively correlated to the multi-annual risk score at the site level (R-2 = 0.47, p < 0.05). Relationships between multi-annual risk scores and multi-annual changes in proportional macroalgae cover (as an index for coral reef health) were more complex (R-2 = 0.04, p > 0.05), though reefs incurring higher risk scores showed relatively higher proportional macroalgae cover. Multi-annual risk score thresholds associated with loss of seagrass cover were defined, with lower risk scores (<= 0.2) associated with a gain or little loss in seagrass cover (gain/-12%), medium risk scores (0.2-0.4) associated with moderate loss (-12/-30%) and higher risk scores (>0.4) with the greatest loss in cover (>-30%). These thresholds were used to generate an intermediate river plume risk map specifically for seagrass meadows of the GBR. An intermediate river plume risk map for coral reefs was also developed by considering a multi-annual risk score threshold of 0.2-above which a higher proportion of macroalgae within the algal communities can be expected. These findings contribute to a long-term and adaptive approach to set relevant risk framework and thresholds for adverse biological responses in the GBR. The ecological thresholds and risk scores used in this study will be refined and validated through ongoing monitoring and assessment. As uncertainties are reduced, these risk metrics will provide important information for the development of strategies to manage water quality and ecosystem health.

A total of 232 ground sample plots were used to estimate the biomass distribution in the Nakdong River estuary. Field data were overlain and correlated with digital values from an atmospherically corrected multispectral image (Landsat 8). The AGB distribution was derived using empirical models trained with field-measured AGB data. The final regression model for AGB estimation was composed using the OLI3, OLI4, and OLI7 spectral bands. The Pearson correlation between the observed and predicted biomass was significant (R = 0.84, p < 0.0001). OLI3 made the largest contribution to the final model (relative coefficient value: 53.4%) and revealed a negative relationship with the AGB biomass. The total distribution area of B. planiculmis was 1,922,979 m(2). Based on the model estimation, the total AGB had a dry weight (DW) of approximately 298.2 tons. The distribution of high biomass stands (> 200 kg DW/900 m(2)) constituted approximately 23.91% of the total vegetated area. Our findings suggest the expandability of remotely sensed products to understand the distribution pattern of estuarine plant productivity at the landscape level.

In this paper we present a method for mapping water depth and the leaf area index (LAI, ratio of leaf area to substrate area) of Thalassia testudinum meadows, based on radiative transfer model inversion using an embedded three-dimensional aquatic canopy model. Variations in reflectance due to leaf length, leaf position, sediment coverage on leaves, water depth and solar zenith angle were included in the model to parameterise uncertainty propagation. The model revealed canopy reflectance as a function of LAI decreases exponentially at all wavelengths up to an LAI around four, beyond which increasing canopy density cannot be determined from reflectance. In addition, sediment coverage on leaves has surprisingly little effect on the reflectance of sparse canopies because shading is also a contributor to darkening. The capability of the method for image based mapping was assessed through sensitivity analyses and by application to hyperspectral airborne imagery of Florida Bay collected by the Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer (PRISM), with the uncertainty propagation providing per-pixel confidence intervals on all the estimated parameters. Results were consistent across the sensitivity and image analyses and the agreement with field data was good, given the challenges in validation of submerged pixels at metre scale. Uncertainties were high for LAIs greater than two in water of depth 8 m, but lower for sparse canopies and shallower water. For water depths approaching 10 in the pixel-to-pixel variation arising from processes at the water surface upwards was greater than the uncertainties arising from the canopy or water column. The physics-based model inversion approach is readily adaptable to any sensor configuration and to different seagrass species and canopy morphologies. No site-specific in situ data is required and the uncertainty estimates can provide an objective basis for interpreting apparent changes in the distribution of seagrasses over time and space, as revealed by remote sensing techniques.

Characterization of Available Light for Seagrass and Patch Reef Productivity in Sugarloaf Key, Lower Florida Keys	REMOTE SENSING												Light availability is an important factor driving primary productivity in benthic ecosystems, but in situ and remote sensing measurements of light quality are limited for coral reefs and seagrass beds. We evaluated the productivity responses of a patch reef and a seagrass site in the Lower Florida Keys to ambient light availability and spectral quality. In situ optical properties were characterized utilizing moored and water column bio-optical and hydrographic measurements. Net ecosystem productivity (NEP) was also estimated for these study sites using benthic productivity chambers. Our results show higher spectral light attenuation and absorption, and lower irradiance during low tide in the patch reef, tracking the influx of materials from shallower coastal areas. In contrast, the intrusion of clearer surface Atlantic Ocean water caused lower values of spectral attenuation and absorption, and higher irradiance in the patch reef during high tide. Storms during the studied period, with winds >10 ms(-1), caused higher spectral attenuation values. A spatial gradient of NEP was observed, from high productivity in the shallow seagrass area, to lower productivity in deeper patch reefs. The highest daytime NEP was observed in the seagrass, with values of almost 0.4 gO(2)m(-2)h(-1). Productivity at the patch reef area was lower in May than during October 2012 (mean = 0.137 and 0.177 gO(2)m(-2)h(-1), respectively). Higher photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) levels measured above water and lower light attenuation in the red region of the visible spectrum (similar to 666 to similar to 699 nm) had a positive correlation with NEP. Our results indicate that changes in light availability and quality by suspended or resuspended particles limit benthic productivity in the Florida Keys.

Modelling the spatial distribution of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica along the North African coast: Implications for the assessment of Good Environmental Status	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile, 1813 is a seagrass species endemic to the Mediterranean Sea, which is considered as an indicator of environment quality in coastal areas. This species forms large meadows, which are sensitive to several anthropogenic pressures and the decrease in their extension is considered a priority issue for the Mediterranean Sea. The aim of this study was to develop a Species Distribution Model for P. oceanica, to be applied to the Mediterranean North African coast, in order to obtain an estimation of the potential distribution of this species in the region. The Species Distribution Model was calibrated using high resolution data from 4 Mediterranean sites, located in Italy and Spain, as the study area is a data-poor zone with regard to seagrass distribution (i.e. only for some areas detailed distribution maps are available). The model was then validated using available data concerning the North African coast. The probability of presence of the species in a given area was modelled using a binomial generalized linear model as a function of the bathymetry and water transparency, dissolved organic matter, sea surface temperature and salinity, mainly obtained from satellite data. Model selection procedure suggests that water transparency plays a major role, but also other variables, such as salinity and sea surface temperature, are important at larger spatial scales in explaining meadows distribution. The availability of high resolution time-series of input data allowed us to apply the validated model to the whole North African coast. Suitable areas are strongly related to the coastal realm, and cover a large portion of North African coasts, with Tunisian and Lybian ones being the most relevant zones for this species. In particular, the shelf of the Gulf of Gabes includes large areas with environmental conditions suitable for the species. Based on model predictions, we developed a robust indicator of potential habitat suitability, which could be used for the assessment of Good Environmental Status, as requested by the Ecosystem Based Approach, to be implemented at the scale of the whole Mediterranean basin in the framework of the Barcelona Convention.

This enables investigation of the extent to which seagrass coverage and bay turbidity are, and have been, sensitive to river discharge and suspended solids or climatic fluctuations. Furthermore, the use of remote sensing to derive physical parameters that can be used to calibrate a hydrodynamic model is a new and novel approach, compared with the more traditional methods of model calibration using in-situ measurements. Based on the relationship between the satellite derived reflectance and the inherent optical properties of the water column, semi-empirical algorithms can be derived for these optically complex waters to provide estimates of substrate composition and water quality information. The application of these methods for multispectral satellite imagery analysis has several limitations, however, the benefit of the hyperspectral models have been found to produce better results compared with alternative methods. Multi-temporal data from the Australian Geoscience Data Cube (AGDC) when combined with the optical modelling approach, enables consistent large scale spatio-temporal analysis of seagrass extent and of coastal water quality. These analyses are used in support of analysis of turbidity sources, hydrodynamic modelling and seagrass modelling activities, which are reported in separate abstracts.

Understanding the magnitude and dynamics of catchment impacts on coastal water quality is vital to help inform catchment management priorities, and to assess potential responses including potential time lags. We used 14 years of turbidity monitoring in rivers draining to Western Port to estimate suspended sediment load time-series. We investigated the magnitude and timescales of linkage between river loads and a remote sensing record of coastal water quality. Results were evaluated in the context of knowledge about long-term sediment sources to, and storage volumes within, the bay. The findings will help to guide priorities for protecting bay ecosystems and for managing erosion in the catchments and within the bay. The efficiency of sediment delivery to the bay, historical changes in seagrass extent within the bay, and conceptual modelling of seagrass responses to sediment inputs are considered in companion papers.

Sand dunes and coastal forests received direct impacts from the tsunami, while some new hygrophyte communities were generated from buried seeds in the remains of rice paddies. Although natural recoveries of vegetation (e.g., from open water to wet grassland) were observed at some areas, artificial impacts such as reconstruction projects turned wetland plant communities into artificial bare land. Some places (e.g., reclaimed lake) were turned back to original environment by the comparison with the land cover of 100 years before the earthquake. Many shorelines that had receded due to erosion accompanied with the tsunami had made early recovery except for some river mouth bars and pocket beaches. Distribution of seaweed (Phaeophyceae spp.) seemed to have little impacts. On the other hand, seagrass (Zostera spp.), which generally grow on the sediment of sand and silt, had heavy impact because the tsunami swiped the sediment away although many cases of recovery of seagrass beds were observed 4 years after the earthquake. Moreover, fauna and flora survey in key sites and monitoring on pre-surveyed sites of tidal flats, seagrass beds, seaweed beds, and seabird breeding sites have been conducted. According to the series of the surveys, the living organisms were seemed to be adapted to the natural disturbance although some were still in the middle of recovery process. All of the data of these survey results were archived and are disclosed at "Shiokaze Natural Environment Log" <http://www.shiokaze.biodic.go.jp/>.																	2191-0707		978-4-431-56448-5; 978-4-431-56446-1				2016							395	410		10.1007/978-4-431-56448-5_23	10.1007/978-4-431-56448-5							WOS:000402094400024

MAPPING OF THE SEAGRASS COVER ALONG THE MEDITERRANEAN COAST OF TURKEY USING LANDSAT 8 OLI IMAGES	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VIII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				Benthic habitat is defined as ecological environment where marine animals, plants and other organisms live in. Benthic habitat mapping is defined as plotting the distribution and extent of habitats to create a map with complete coverage of the seabed showing distinct boundaries separating adjacent habitats or the use of spatially continuous environmental data sets to represent and predict biological patterns on the seafloor. Seagrass is an essential endemic marine species that prevents coast erosion and regulates carbon dioxide absorption in both undersea and atmosphere. Fishing, mining, pollution and other human activities cause serious damage to seabed ecosystems and reduce benthic biodiversity. According to the latest studies, only 5-10% of the seafloor is mapped, therefore it is not possible to manage resources effectively, protect ecologically important areas. In this study, it is aimed to map seagrass cover using Landsat 8 OLI images in the northern part of Mediterranean coast of Turkey. After pre-processing (e.g. radiometric, atmospheric, water depth correction) of Landsat images, coverage maps are produced with supervised classification using in-situ data which are underwater photos and videos. Result maps and accuracy assessment are presented and discussed.

Nowadays, overseas researchers are mainly applied an inversion method for accurately estimating water depth. It is able to gain not only water depth, but also benthic spectral reflection and inherent optical properties (IOPs) at the same time, based on physics-based radiative transfer theory for hyperspectral data. It is highly significant to understand the possibility to develop the application in future for coastal zone of main island, which is a common water quality in Japan, but there is not any case study applied this method in Japan. The study site of Yamada bay in Iwate Prefecture is located in northeast of Japan. An existed analytical model was optimized for mapping water depth in Yamada bay using airborne hyperspectral image and ground survey data which were simultaneously acquired in December, 2015. The retrieved remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs) is basically qualitatively appropriate result. However, when compared with all ground survey points, the retrieved water depth showed low correlation, even though ground points which are selected sand bottom indicates high relationship. Overall, we could understand the inversion method is applicable in Japan. However, it needs to challenge to improve solving error-caused problems.																	2194-9034						2016	41	B7					61	64		10.5194/isprsarchives-XLI-B7-61-2016								WOS:000393155900010

Comparisons between predicted and measured bottom reflectance signatures are obtained using measured hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance signatures, water depth and water column constituent concentrations. Analytical solutions and algorithms are used to generate synthetic signatures of different bottom types. The analytical methodology used to simulated bottom reflectance contains offset and bias that can be corrected using spectral window based corrections. Example results are demonstrated for application to coral species, submerged aquatic vegetation and a sand bottom type. Spectral windows are identified for predicting the above bottom types. Sensitivity analysis of predicted bottom reflectance signatures is conducted by varying water depth, chlorophyll, dissolved organic matter and total suspended mater concentrations. The protocol can be applied to shallow subsurface geospatial mapping using sensor based water surface reflectance based upon an analytical model solution derived from primitive radiative transfer theory.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0402-5; 978-1-5106-0403-2				2016	9999								UNSP 99990N	10.1117/12.2241547								WOS:000391353700017						
J	Wicaksono, P				Wicaksono, Pramaditya			Improving the accuracy of Multispectral-based benthic habitats mapping using image rotations: the application of Principle Component Analysis and Independent Component Analysis	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The low number of water penetration bands in multispectral images limits the maximum descriptive resolution and the accuracy of the resulting benthic habitats maps, especially at higher levels of benthic habitats scheme complexities. This research aimed at improving the accuracy of benthic habitats mapping by exploiting the spectral performance of multispectral images using image rotation techniques, which is very beneficial for fast, accurate, and repeatable mapping. Kemujan Island as part of the Karimunjawa archipelago in Indonesia is selected as the study area. Principle Component Analysis ( PCA) and Independent Component Analysis ( ICA) were applied on Worldview-2 prior to image classification. The inputs for PCA and ICA are deglint bands and water column-corrected bands. Field benthic data collected from photo-transect technique were used to train the rotated datasets in the classification process and to assess the accuracy of the resulting benthic habitat maps. Three levels of benthic habitats classification schemes were constructed based on the variation of benthic habitats insitu, which covers the variations of coral reefs, seagrass, macro algae, and bare substratum. The results show that the application of image rotations on Worldview-2 improves the overall accuracy of benthic habitats mapping and become more effective as the classification scheme complexities increase. In the absence of water column correction, PCA and ICA become the best option to assist benthic habitats mapping.

For centuries, the Rufiji resources have been utilized sustainably by coastal people for food, firewood and building materials. However, in recent decades, the Estuary has been severely affected by a complexity of both climate change factors and anthropogenic pressures. A WWF/GEF Coastal Resilience to Climate Change Project was conducted between 2007 and 2009, involving repeated quantitative ecological plot assessment, rapid assessment, remote sensing (based on satellite images taken in 1991 and 2000) and recording indigenous knowledge through social science methods. Change analysis showed several definite trends. Along exposed seaward edges (not sheltered by reefs or islands), there was drastic erosion and mangrove loss attributed to increased wave activity and sea level rise, with over 25 m of coastline being lost along sections of the estuary over a two-year period. Along other seaward edges, some accretion and mangrove growth occurred due to being sheltered from wave action and having adequate sediment load from Bumba channel, which has received the main flow of Rufiji since the shift of the river in 1978. The 1998 El-Nino flooding event caused drastic mangrove loss in riverine areas. On several landward edges of the delta, migration of mangroves inland was detected. Overall, however, losses of mangroves in the Rufiji were clearly greater than gains. Anthropogenic pressures include deforestation in the watershed area and large scale cutting of mangroves for timber and conversion to rice farms. Recommended mitigation and adaptive management strategies include the establishment of buffer zones, mangrove planting, awareness raising and enforcement.																	2214-1553		978-3-319-25370-1; 978-3-319-25368-8				2016							183	207		10.1007/978-3-319-25370-1_12	10.1007/978-3-319-25370-1							WOS:000382769000016

Remote Sensing of Submerged Aquatic Vegetation	SEAFLOOR MAPPING ALONG CONTINENTAL SHELVES: RESEARCH AND TECHNIQUES FOR VISUALIZING BENTHIC ENVIRONMENTS	Coastal Research Library											Submerged Aquatic Vegetation (SAV), such as eelgrass, provides important ecological functions including food and habitat for ducks, geese, crabs, fish, clams, and other species. SAV also filters out excess nutrients from storm water that runs off into coastal waters, thus improving water quality. Eelgrass meadows can decrease the damaging effects of waves and reduce shoreline erosion. To protect these vital ecosystems, scientists need to monitor coastal vegetation changes as the sea level continues to rise and the coastal population keeps expanding. New satellites, sensors and data analysis techniques are providing remotely sensed data that are effective for monitoring coastal features and processes. Multispectral and hyperspectral imagers, LiDAR and radar systems are available for mapping coastal marshes, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), coral reefs, beach profiles, water turbidity, chlorophyll concentration and eutrophication. Since coastal ecosystems, such as SAV beds, have high spatial complexity and temporal variability, they must be observed with high spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions. New satellites, carrying sensors with fine spatial (0.4-4 m) or spectral (200 narrow bands) resolution are now more accurately detecting changes in salt marsh and SAV extent, health, productivity and habitat quality. Using time-series of images enables scientists to study the health of SAV and other coastal ecosystems and to determine long-term trends and short-term changes.																	2211-0577		978-3-319-25121-9; 978-3-319-25119-6				2016	13						125	140		10.1007/978-3-319-25121-9_5	10.1007/978-3-319-25121-9							WOS:000376129800006

Short-term changes of remote sensing reflectance in a shallow-water environment: observations from repeated airborne hyperspectral measurements	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												An atmospheric correction algorithm has been developed for the Airborne Imaging Spectrometer for Applications (AISA) imagery over optically shallow waters in Sugarloaf Key of the Florida Keys. The AISA data were collected repeatedly during several days in May 2012, October 2012, and May 2013. Non-zero near-infrared (NIR) remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs) was accounted for through iterations, based on the relationship of field-measured R-rs between the NIR and red wavelengths. Validation showed mean ratios of 0.94-1.002 between AISA-retrieved and in situ R-rs in the blue to red wavelengths, with uncertainties generally <0.003 sr(-1). Such an approach led to observations of short-term changes in AISA-retrieved R-rs from repeated measurements over waters with bottom types of seagrass meadow, sand, and patch reef. Some of these changes are larger than twofold the R-rs uncertainties from AISA retrievals, therefore representing statistically significant changes that can be well observed from airborne measurements. Through radiative transfer modelling, we demonstrated that short-term R-rs changes within 1 hour resulted primarily from sediment resuspension, while tides played a relatively minor role due to the small variation in tidal heights. A sensitivity analysis indicated that although R-rs generally increases with decreasing tide height but increasing suspended sediments, more changes were observed over sandy bottom than over seagrass. The case study suggests that repeated airborne measurements may be used to study short-term changes in shallow-water environments, and such a capacity may be enhanced with future geostationary satellite missions specifically designed to observe coastal ecosystems.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2016	37	7					1620	1638		10.1080/01431161.2016.1159746								WOS:000373986700008

Despite the existence of very high-resolution remote sensing technology for nearly two decades, comprehensive assessment of coral reef habitats at national to regional spatial scales and at very high spatial resolution is still scarce. Here, we develop benthic habitat maps at a sub-national scale by analyzing large multispectral QuickBird imagery dataset covering similar to 686 km(2) of the main shallow coral fringing reef along the southern border with Tanzania (4.68 degrees S, 39.18 degrees E) to the reef end at Malindi, Kenya (3.2 degrees S, 40.1 degrees E). Mapping was conducted with a user approach constrained by ground-truth data, with detailed transect lines from the shore to the fore reef. First, maps were used to evaluate the present management system's effectiveness at representing habitat diversity. Then, we developed three spatial prioritization scenarios based on differing objectives: (i) minimize lost fishing opportunity; (ii) redistribute fisheries away from currently overfished reefs; and (iii) minimize resource use conflicts. We further constrained the priority area in each prioritization selection scenario based on optionally protecting the least or the most climate exposed locations using a model of exposure to climate stress. We discovered that spatial priorities were very different based on the different objectives and on whether the aim was to protect the least or most climate-exposed habitats. Our analyses provide a spatially explicit foundation for large-scale conservation and management strategies that can account for ecosystem service benefits.

Few attempts have been made to find relations between spatiotemporal changes within seagrass habitats and their surrounding environment in the mapping efforts. In this study, issues of spatiotemporal changes in seagrass habitat including water quality, and causes and processes of seagrass degradation were addressed through assessing the ability of integrated manual enhancement and seed pixel growing techniques on multi-date Landsat images for mapping and monitoring seagrass resources. This integrated approach was tested on a total of forty-nine Landsat 5, 7 and 8 images of the seagrass meadow spatial distribution and cover change analysis for Punag-Sari estuary (Lawas), Pengkalan Nangka (Kelantan) lagoon, and Paka (Terengganu) lagoon of Malaysia. The resulted maps demonstrated the ability of Landsat images for producing spatially extensive maps and allowed quantitative estimation of seagrass coverage, accretion/erosion, and describe changes in noticeable areas. The findings indicated that a noticeable loss of seagrass habitats at varying magnitude occurred between 2000 and 2014 for Punang-Sari, between 1998 and 2014 for Pegkalan Nangka, and between 1988 and 2014 for Paka. The natural event mainly sand shifting was the main cause of seagrass habitat loss for Punang-Sari Lawas. Coastline change was identified as the most significant factor that caused seagrass spatial cover loss of the Pengkalan Nangka lagoon. The seagrass meadows of Pengkalan Nangka and Paka were greatly affected by natural events including floods, and local human-induced interferences such as dredging, and sand mining. The mapping approach and the map products presented in this paper will be a useful information source for the coastal management agencies involved in monitoring and management programs.

Amongst nearshore ecosystems, seagrass beds play a major role enhancing biodiversity and water quality. Consequently, the development of new approaches to create extensive and high-resolution habitat maps is required not only to implement conservation, restoration and management plans, but also to establish adaptation plans to face climate change impacts. This study particularly assesses the capability of hyperspectral airborne imagery acquired with Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) to discriminate and map estuarine habitats, with special focus on Zostera noltii seagrass meadows. To this end, 13 habitats were defined along the supralittoral, intertidal and subtidal zones of an estuary, including Z noltii seagrass meadows. The CASI sensor was configured to acquire 25 bands in the visible and near infrared wavelengths with a ground sampling distance of 2 m. Spectral bands were selected for species discrimination based on the spectral signature of the different habitat classes. Six different band combinations were tested applying maximum likelihood classification algorithm. The most accurate classification was obtained with 10 band combination (a mean producer accuracy 92% and a mean user accuracy 94%). The classification of Z noltii beds has been found to be restricted to moderate and high dense meadows, however a vegetation index has been defined which could be applied for mapping Z noltii meadow cover. These results highlight the value of CASI data to discriminate and map estuarine habitats, providing key information to be used in supporting the implementation of environmental legislation, protection and conservation of coastal habitats.

J	Visser, F; Buis, K; Verschoren, V; Meire, P				Visser, Fleur; Buis, Kerst; Verschoren, Veerle; Meire, Patrick			Depth Estimation of Submerged Aquatic Vegetation in Clear Water Streams Using Low-Altitude Optical Remote Sensing	SENSORS												UAVs and other low-altitude remote sensing platforms are proving very useful tools for remote sensing of river systems. Currently consumer grade cameras are still the most commonly used sensors for this purpose. In particular, progress is being made to obtain river bathymetry from the optical image data collected with such cameras, using the strong attenuation of light in water. No studies have yet applied this method to map submergence depth of aquatic vegetation, which has rather different reflectance characteristics from river bed substrate. This study therefore looked at the possibilities to use the optical image data to map submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) depth in shallow clear water streams. We first applied the Optimal Band Ratio Analysis method (OBRA) of Legleiter et al. (2009) to a dataset of spectral signatures from three macrophyte species in a clear water stream. The results showed that for each species the ratio of certain wavelengths were strongly associated with depth. A combined assessment of all species resulted in equally strong associations, indicating that the effect of spectral variation in vegetation is subsidiary to spectral variation due to depth changes. Strongest associations (R-2-values ranging from 0.67 to 0.90 for different species) were found for combinations including one band in the near infrared (NIR) region between 825 and 925 nm and one band in the visible light region. Currently data of both high spatial and spectral resolution is not commonly available to apply the OBRA results directly to image data for SAV depth mapping. Instead a novel, low-cost data acquisition method was used to obtain six-band high spatial resolution image composites using a NIR sensitive DSLR camera. A field dataset of SAV submergence depths was used to develop regression models for the mapping of submergence depth from image pixel values. Band (combinations) providing the best performing models (R-2-values up to 0.77) corresponded with the OBRA findings. A 10% error was achieved under sub-optimal data collection conditions, which indicates that the method could be suitable for many SAV mapping applications.

Cumulative pressures from extreme weather with a high frequency of large scale flooding in recent years has been linked to the large scale reported decline in the health of inshore seagrass systems and coral reefs in the central areas of the GBR, with concerns for the recovery potential of these impacted ecosystems. Management authorities currently rely on remotely-sensed (RS) and in situ data for water quality monitoring to guide their assessment of water quality conditions in the GBR. The use of remotely-sensed satellite products provides a quantitative and accessible tool for scientists and managers. These products, coupled with in situ data, and more recently modelled data, are valuable for quantifying the influence of river plumes on seagrass and coral reef habitat in the GBR. This article reviews recent remote sensing techniques developed to monitor river plumes and water quality in the GBR. We also discuss emerging research that integrates hydrodynamic models with remote sensing and in situ data, enabling us to explore impacts of different catchment management strategies on GBR water quality.

A Method to Analyze the Potential of Optical Remote Sensing for Benthic Habitat Mapping	Remote Sensing												Quantifying the number and type of benthic classes that are able to be spectrally identified in shallow water remote sensing is important in understanding its potential for habitat mapping. Factors that impact the effectiveness of shallow water habitat mapping include water column turbidity, depth, sensor and environmental noise, spectral resolution of the sensor and spectral variability of the benthic classes. In this paper, we present a simple hierarchical clustering method coupled with a shallow water forward model to generate water-column specific spectral libraries. This technique requires no prior decision on the number of classes to output: the resultant classes are optically separable above the spectral noise introduced by the sensor, image based radiometric corrections, the benthos' natural spectral variability and the attenuating properties of a variable water column at depth. The modeling reveals the effect reducing the spectral resolution has on the number and type of classes that are optically distinct. We illustrate the potential of this clustering algorithm in an analysis of the conditions, including clustering accuracy, sensor spectral resolution and water column optical properties and depth that enabled the spectral distinction of the seagrass Amphibolis antartica from benthic algae.

Hyperspectral discrimination of floating mats of seagrass wrack and the macroalgae Sargassum in coastal waters of Greater Florida Bay using airborne remote sensing	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Floating mats of vegetation serve to transfer biomass, nutrients and energy across marine habitats and alter the spectral properties of the sea surface. Here, spectral measurements from the airborne Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer (PRISM) imagery at 1-m resolution and experimental mesocosms were used to assess the hyperspectral properties of the macroalgae Sargassum and aggregations of the seagrass Syringodium filiforme wrack in Greater Florida Bay. A simple Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) effectively discriminated the presence of vegetation floating on the sea surface. The Sargassum Index derived from reflectance ratios at 650 and 630 nm was used to effectively discriminate Sargassum from Syringodium wrack. Mesocosm spectral measurements revealed an initial lowering of wrack reflectance over the first 3 days followed by a subsequent increase in reflectance over the next 8 days. The age of the wrack estimated from 2 to 5 days was best characterized using narrowband indices of the water absorption feature at 930 and 990 nm potentially from increasing water content in wrack leaves over time. Hyperspectral imagery (<10 nm) was necessary to differentiate between these two types of floating vegetation and assess age of the wrack. PRISM imagery revealed seagrass wrack organized in 5-35 m spaced windrows caused by Langmuir circulation. Wrack was only detectable at 60 m pixel resolution when densities were high and individual windrows were in close proximity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The degradation introduced by their use in scientific applications is concerning to Landsat users. SLC-off data gaps cause problems in many applications of ETM+ images, but no literature reported the problem in seagrass mapping. To investigate the impact of SLC-off data loss on the seagrass information extraction, two types of data were compared: (a) data with interpolation after the SLC anomaly, termed the BInterpolation ON (ION)", and (b) the data without interpolation, termed the BInterpolation OFF (IOFF)" image, for the Sungai Pulai estuary seagrass meadows of Malaysia. Additionally, the random shifting of SLC- off stripes was tested by swipe analysis of SLC-off image pairs. Overall, the SLC- off scene analysis suggests that a gradual increase of data gaps from the central part toward the edge may cause a cumulative error of 2 % based on an object's distance from the nadir path. The random shifting of SLC-off stripes may be completely invisible if a single SLC-off stripe passes over a targeted small seagrass meadow such as the Tanjung Adang Laut shoal, which has a spatial extent of 11.07 ha. The data gaps eventually lead to misinterpretations and produce erroneous seagrass distribution maps. The co-existence of SLC-off stripes and their random shifting phenomenon have caused nonoverlapping regions between SLC-off scenes acquired on different dates. Future research should develop suitable methods for gap-filling and resolve aquatic remote sensing mapping issues by using knowledge from the present research.

Pollutant tracking for 3 Western North Atlantic sea grasses by remote sensing: Preliminary diminishing white light responses of Thalassia testudinum, Halodule wrightii, and Zostera marina	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Sea grasses are foundation species for estuarine ecosystems. The available light for sea grasses diminishes rapidly during pollutant spills, effluent releases, disturbances such as intense riverine input, and tidal changes. We studied how sea grasses' remote-sensing signatures and light-capturing ability respond to short term light alterations. In vivo responses were measured over the entire visible-light spectra to diminishing white-light on whole-living-plants' spectral reflectance, including 6 h of full oceanic-light fluences from 10% to 100%. We analyzed differences by various reflectance indices. We compared the sea grasses species responses of tropical vs. temperate and intertidals (Halodule wrightii, and Zostera marina) vs. subtidal (Thalassia testudinum). Reflectance diminished with decreasing light intensity that coincided with greater accessory pigment stimulation (anthocyanin, carotenoids, xanthins). Chlorophyll a and Chlorophyll b differed significantly among species (Thalassia vs. Halodule). Photosynthetic efficiency diminished at high light intensities. The NDVI index was inadequate to perceive these differences. Our results demonstrate the leaf-level utility of data to remote sensing for mapping sea grass and sea grass stress.

Here, we (1) review the current status of the diversity and distribution of coastal ecosystems in BCS, (2) assess the composition and coverage of these ecosystems in PNAs, and (3) identify coastal ecosystems of special interest for conservation. The combination of spatial analysis techniques was carried out using LandSat TM images and GIS processing, considering ecoregions and ecosystems in the coastal zone, as well as through the application of an ecosystem diversity index. In the BCS coastal zone, 11 ecosystems were identified: scrub, coastal water body, riparian, bare soil, halophyte, beach, salt flat, mangrove, salt marsh, coral reef, and seagrass. The ecosystem diversity in BCS results from the coastal features that differentiate the Pacific and the Gulf coasts. PNAs include 17 % of coastal ecosystems. Bahia Magdalena (Pacific) and Bahia Concepcin (Gulf of California), which are key for conservation (including mangroves and seagrasses), should be considered either for classification as PNAs or for inclusion in coastal management programs. The combination of remote sensing and GIS with biogeographic and ecosystemic approaches in our study enabled to determine ecosystem diversity and set coastal conservation priorities in Baja California Sur, Mexico. Specifically, coastal ecosystems that are not currently included within PNAs and which should be considered as conservation priorities were identified.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				AUG	2015	19	4					609	619		10.1007/s11852-015-0411-y								WOS:000362017900015

Catastrophic shifts between states can be induced by gradual environmental change or by disturbance events. These feedbacks and outcomes are key to the sustainability and resilience of vegetated coastlines, especially as modulated by human activity, sea level rise, and climate change. Whereas multiple stable state theory has been invoked to model salt marsh responses to sediment supply and sea level change, there has been comparatively little empirical verification of the theory for salt marshes or other coastal wetlands. Especially lacking is long-term evidence documenting if or how stable states are established and maintained at ecosystem scales. Laboratory and field-plot studies are informative, but of necessarily limited spatial and temporal scope. For the purposes of long-term, coastal-scale monitoring, remote sensing is the best viable option. This review summarizes the above topics and highlights the emerging promise and challenges of using remote sensing-based analyses to validate coastal wetland dynamic state theories. This significant opportunity is further framed by a proposed list of scientific advances needed to more thoroughly develop the field.

FORMATION, MOVEMENT, AND RESTORATION OF DEAD INTERTIDAL OYSTER REEFS IN CANAVERAL NATIONAL SEASHORE AND MOSQUITO LAGOON, FLORIDA	JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH												Globally, 85% of shellfish reefs have been lost during the past century. The severe loss of the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica has encouraged different types of restoration efforts in the United States. In Mosquito Lagoon (ML), a shallow-water estuary on the east coast of central Florida, restoration focuses on providing additional substrate for larval recruitment via deployment of stabilized oyster shell. To assess the current number and area of natural, dead, and restored oyster reefs within ML, aerial photographs from 2009 were digitized using ArcGIS software. All reefs were screen digitized using a reef "signature" to estimate the surface area of each reef type. The maps from 2009 were then used as a guide to digitizing the historical aerial photographs (1943, 1951, 1967, 1971, 1984, 1995, and 2006). Oyster habitat within ML has decreased by almost 15 hectares between 1943 and 2009, which constitutes 24% of the 1943 lagoon-wide coverage. The impacts were greater in Canaveral National Seashore, which covers the southern ML; 40% of the oyster coverage within the park has been lost since 1943. Dead reefs were found adjacent to important boating channels. Tracked dead reefs exhibited a continuous migration into the mangrove islands located landward of the original live reefs, with some dead reefs completely washing up into the marsh. Restoration of dead reefs with stabilized oyster shells has added nearly 1 hectare of live oyster habitat to ML as of January 2009. This research demonstrates that dead reefs are increasing in number and coverage within ML, but this trend can be reversed with restoration.																	0730-8000	1943-6319				AUG	2015	34	2					251	258		10.2983/035.034.0206								WOS:000360410500006						
J	Eugenio, F; Marcello, J; Martin, J				Eugenio, Francisco; Marcello, Javier; Martin, Javier			High-Resolution Maps of Bathymetry and Benthic Habitats in Shallow-Water Environments Using Multispectral Remote Sensing Imagery	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												Coastlines, shoals, and reefs are some of the most dynamic and constantly changing regions of the globe. The emergence of high-resolution satellites with new spectral channels, such as the WorldView-2, increases the amount of data available, thereby improving the determination of coastal management parameters. Water-leaving radiance is very difficult to determine accurately, since it is often small compared to the reflected radiance from other sources such as atmospheric and water surface scattering. Hence, the atmospheric correction has proven to be a very important step in the processing of high-resolution images for coastal applications. On the other hand, specular reflection of solar radiation on nonflat water surfaces is a serious confounding factor for bathymetry and for obtaining the seafloor albedo with high precision in shallow-water environments. This paper describes, at first, an optimal atmospheric correction model, as well as an improved algorithm for sunglint removal based on combined physical and image processing techniques. Then, using the corrected multispectral data, an efficient multichannel physics-based algorithm has been implemented, which is capable of solving through optimization the radiative transfer model of sea-water for bathymetry retrieval, unmixing the water intrinsic optical properties, depth, and seafloor albedo contributions. Finally, for the mapping of benthic features, a supervised classification methodology has been implemented, combining seafloor-type normalized indexes and support vector machine techniques. Results of atmospheric correction, remote bathymetry, and benthic habitat mapping of shallow-water environments have been validated with in situ data and available bionomic profiles providing excellent accuracy.

The capacity to quantify biomass in seagrass ecosystems is both critical and urgent, yet no methods exist to perform this at the large spatial scale required for management (e.g. regional/continental). We built linear model relationships between in situ above-ground biomass and seagrass percentage cover per seagrass species to esti mate biomass from both point-based and landscape scale (>100 km(2)) seagrass data. First we used a set of linear models to estimate the biomass component of each seagrass species in over 20 000 benthic photos. We then adapted this approach to estimate biomass from a time-series of remote sensing derived seagrass percentage cover and dominant species maps. We demonstrate accurate estimation of above-ground biomass using a set of methods that is not only more time and resource efficient than existing methods, but is sufficiently robust and generalisable for application at large spatial or temporal scales. Our method allows for quantification of above-ground biomass in seagrass ecosystems over spatial scales larger than can be tractably assessed using current site-and point-based measurement approaches, and at scales that are required to understand and manage seagrass systems to tackle anthropogenic climate change and other impacts.

J	Sagawa, T; Komatsu, T				Sagawa, Tatsuyuki; Komatsu, Teruhisa			Simulation of seagrass bed mapping by satellite images based on the radiative transfer model	OCEAN SCIENCE JOURNAL												Seagrass and seaweed beds play important roles in coastal marine ecosystems. They are food sources and habitats for many marine organisms, and influence the physical, chemical, and biological environment. They are sensitive to human impacts such as reclamation and pollution. Therefore, their management and preservation are necessary for a healthy coastal environment. Satellite remote sensing is a useful tool for mapping and monitoring seagrass beds. The efficiency of seagrass mapping, seagrass bed classification in particular, has been evaluated by mapping accuracy using an error matrix. However, mapping accuracies are influenced by coastal environments such as seawater transparency, bathymetry, and substrate type. Coastal management requires sufficient accuracy and an understanding of mapping limitations for monitoring coastal habitats including seagrass beds. Previous studies are mainly based on case studies in specific regions and seasons. Extensive data are required to generalise assessments of classification accuracy from case studies, which has proven difficult. This study aims to build a simulator based on a radiative transfer model to produce modelled satellite images and assess the visual detectability of seagrass beds under different transparencies and seagrass coverages, as well as to examine mapping limitations and classification accuracy. Our simulations led to the development of a model of water transparency and the mapping of depth limits and indicated the possibility for seagrass density mapping under certain ideal conditions. The results show that modelling satellite images is useful in evaluating the accuracy of classification and that establishing seagrass bed monitoring by remote sensing is a reliable tool.																	1738-5261	2005-7172				JUN	2015	50	2					335	342		10.1007/s12601-015-0031-3								WOS:000357691000022

Because conventional research methods were not practical for this purpose due to the lack of a geospatial perspective, we attempted to develop a research method integrating visual fish observation with a seabed habitat map and to expand knowledge to a two-dimensional scale. WorldView-2 satellite imagery of Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia obtained in September 2012 was analyzed and classified into four typical substrates: live coral, dead coral, seagrass and sand. Overall classification accuracy of this map was 81.3% and considered precise enough for subsequent analyses. Three sub-areas (CC: continuous coral reef, BC: boundary of coral reef and FC: few live coral zone) around reef slopes were extracted from the map. Visual transect surveys for several fish species were conducted within each sub-area in June 2013. As a result, Mean density (Ind. / 300 m(2)) of Chaetodon octofasciatus, known as an obligate feeder of corals, was significantly higher at BC than at the others (p < 0.05), implying that this species' density is strongly influenced by spatial configuration of its habitat, like the "edge effect." This indicates that future conservation procedures for coral reef fishes should consider not only coral cover but also its spatial configuration. The present study also indicates that the introduction of a geospatial perspective derived from remote sensing has great potential to progress conventional ecological studies on coral reef fishes.																	1738-5261	2005-7172				JUN	2015	50	2					343	352		10.1007/s12601-015-0032-2								WOS:000357691000023

For this study, a framework was designed for automated benthic habitat mapping by combining multiple data sources (hyperspectral, aerial photography, and bathymetry data) and four contemporary imagery processing techniques (data fusion, Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA), machine learning, and ensemble analysis). In the framework, 1-m digital aerial photograph was first merged with 17-m hyperspectral imagery and 10-m bathymetiy data using a pixel/feature-level fusion strategy. The fused dataset was then preclassified by three machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and k-Nearest Neighbor). Final object-based habitat maps were produced through ensemble analysis of outcomes from three classifiers. The framework was tested for classifying a group-level (3-class) and code-level (9-class) habitats in a portion of the Florida Keys. Informative and accurate habitat maps were achieved with an overall accuracy of 88.5% and 83.5% for the group-level and code-level classifications, respectively.

J	Pu, RL; Bell, S; English, D				Pu, Ruiliang; Bell, Susan; English, David			Developing Hyperspectral Vegetation Indices for Identifying Seagrass Species and Cover Classes	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Seagrass habitats are characteristic features of shallow waters worldwide and provide a variety of ecosystem functions. To date, few studies have evaluated the efficiency of spectral vegetation indices (VIs) for characterizing aquatic plants. Here we evaluate the use of in situ hyperspectral data and hyperspectral VIs for distinguishing among seagrass species and levels of percentage submerged aquatic vegetation (%SAV) cover in a subtropical shallow water setting. Analysis procedures include (1) retrieving bottom reflectance, (2) calculating correlation matrices of VIs with %SAV cover and F value matrices from analysis of variance among species, (3) testing the difference of VIs between levels of %SAV cover and between species, and (4) discriminating levels of %SAV cover and species by using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and classification and regression trees (CART) classifiers with selected VIs as input. The experimental results indicated that (1) the best VIs for discriminating the four levels of %SAV cover were simple ratio (SR) VI, normalized difference VI (NDVI), modified simple ratio VI, and NDVI x SR, whereas the best VIs for distinguishing the three seagrass species included the weighted difference VI, soil-adjusted VI (SAW), SAW x SR and transformed SAW; (2) the optimal central wavelengths for constructing the best VIs were 460, 500, 610, 640, 660, and 690 nm with spectral regions ranging from 3 to 20 nm at band width 3 nm, most of which were associated with absorption bands by photosynthetic and other accessory pigments in the visible spectral range. Compared with LDA, CART performed better in discriminating the four levels of %SAV cover and identifying the three seagrass species.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				MAY	2015	31	3					595	615		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12-00272.1								WOS:000354074400008

In this study, satellite data were used to identify the method for detecting seagrass beds in turbid bay waters and describing temporal changes over the past 24 years. Moreover, we found the cause of seagrass die-off phenomenon by observing the long-term satellite images and evaluating the impact of the typhoon on seagrass beds. All seagrass spectra from different sensors (Landsat TM/ETM+, Aster, Spot-4, and Kompsat-2) have low reflectance in green and high in NIR regions, whereas unvegetated seawater has the opposite spectrum features. A training area in the green band and Mahalanobis Distance Classification algorithm was adopted for classification and mapping of seagrass beds. The error matrix using the in situ reference data for Kompsat-2 image classification was 72.9% accurate. The average area of seagrass beds was 4.6 km(2) from May 1990 to January 2012, and it was consistently >4.0 km(2). A die-off of seagrass beds was observed in September 2012 after Typhoon Bolaven, Tembin, and Sanba consecutively passed the study site. When Typhoon Sanba passed the study site, it had sustained maximum wind speed (147.6 km h(-1)) during low tide, unlike the other typhoons. We found that the water column buffer did not have any effect on resistance of seagrass bed to disturbance, which led to greater damage. Additionally, the three sequential typhoons that passed through during the short time probably produced a cumulative effect. These results allow an understanding of past changes, and reveal the sudden and influential changes in seagrass distribution. As seagrass removal might have negative effect on other associated communities, comprehensive monitoring is required to ensure that disturbed seagrass habitats is recovered naturally.

J	Yang, CY; Yang, DT				Yang, Chaoyu; Yang, Dingtian			An Improved Empirical Model for Retrieving Bottom Reflectance in Optically Shallow Water	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												Satellite remote sensing has become an essential observing system to obtain comprehensive information on the status of coastal habitats. However, a significant challenge in remote sensing of optically shallow water is to correct the effects of the water column. This challenge becomes particularly difficult due to the spatial and temporal variability of water optical properties. In order to model the light distribution for optically shallow water and retrieve the bottom reflectance, a parameterized model was proposed by introducing an important adjusted factor g. The synthetic data sets generated by HYDROLIGHT were utilized to train a neural network (NN) and then to derive the adjustable parameter values. The parameter g was found to vary with water depth, water optical properties, and bottom reflectance. Specifically, it revealed two obvious patterns among the different benthic habitat types. In coral reef, seagrass, and macrophyte habitats, g exhibited a remarkable peak at about 550 nm. The peak has a value of about 2.47-2.49. In white sand or hardpan habitats, g spectra are relatively flat. The semi-empirical model was applied to calculate the bottom reflectance from the new weighting factor, the downward diffuse attenuation coefficient, and the irradiance reflectance just below the sea surface collected in Sanya Bay in 2008 and 2009. Good agreement between the predicted and measured values demonstrated that the weighting factor g is an effective tool to modify the model for interpreting and predicting bottom reflectance without the need for any localized input (R-2 > 0.79).																	1939-1404	2151-1535				MAR	2015	8	3					1266	1273		10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2398898								WOS:000352279200030

Spatial and temporal variability of seagrass at Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef	BOTANICA MARINA												Increasing threats to natural ecosystems from local and global stressors are reinforcing the need for baseline data on the distribution and abundance of organisms. We quantified spatial and/or temporal patterns of seagrass distribution, shoot density, leaf area index, biomass, productivity, and sediment carbon content in shallow water (0-5 m) at Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia, in field surveys conducted in December 2011 and October 2012. Seagrass meadows were mapped using satellite imagery and field validation. A total of 18.3 ha of seagrass, composed primarily of Thalassia hemprichii and Halodule uninervis, was mapped in shallow water. This was 46% less than the area of seagrass in the same region reported in 1995, although variations in mapping methods may have influenced the magnitude of change detected. There was inter-annual variability in shoot density and length, with values for both higher in 2011 than in 2012. Seagrass properties and sediment carbon content were representative of shallow-water seagrass meadows on a mid-shelf Great Barrier Reef island. The data can be used to evaluate change, to parameterize models of the impact of anthropogenic or environmental variability on seagrass distribution and abundance, and to assess the success of management actions.

BENTHIC HABITAT MAPPING AND BIODIVERSITY ANALYSIS IN THE PRIMEIRAS AND SEGUNDAS ARCHIPELAGO RESERVE	36TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				36th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment	MAY 11-15, 2015	Berlin, GERMANY					The Primeiras and Segundas Archipelago Reserve is a recently established marine protected area, the largest in Africa, located in the waters of Northern Mozambique. This protected area is of significant local economic importance and global ecological relevance, containing the southernmost coral reefs in Eastern Africa. However, information related to the marine ecosystem, notably benthic habitat is very scarce. Twelve atolls were mapped in the region using object-based image classification of very-high resolution satellite imagery (IKONOS, Quickbird, and WorldView-2). Geographically referenced data on benthic cover and depth were gathered in the course of three fieldwork expeditions covering a total of four atolls and two shallow reef structures in the Segundas Archipelago. The resulting map allows the estimation of three distinct types of coral cover (field, patches, spurs and grooves); the differentiation of sand, rubble and rock substrate; and the detection of seagrass and brown macroalgae, identifying up to 24 benthic habitats. Average overall accuracy was above 50%. The high variability of the optical properties on the reef systems, in large due to the connectivity with the mainland via plumes, while interesting from an ecological perspective increases the challenges for remote sensing of bottom cover. New information indicates the presence of deep benthic cover extending from the atolls, suggesting the need for further research on Coastal Eastern African corals, namely on their resilience and connectivity, and supporting current knowledge of the existence of an almost continuous coral reef from Kenya to Mozambique. Coral and fish biodiversity data have been analysed together with the satellite-derived maps. Results support the local perception that ecosystems are in decline and uncover new information about biodiversity's spatial patterns. Our work provides a detailed depiction of marine habitats that may aid the management of the protected area, namely in the definition of fishing zones and coral cover monitoring.																	2194-9034						2015	47	W3					1009	1016		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-7-W3-1009-2015								WOS:000380531900150

Recently, remote sensing techniques have been successfully applied in marine benthic mapping in coastal waters. However, the majority of these techniques have focused on either seagrasses meadows or coral reefs. There are a few studies that have been published validating a methodology for mapping SAV on brown macroalgae (Sargassum spp., Ecklonia spp.), seagrasses, and/or other macroalgae groups by spectral response from remote sensing. Hence, we studied the in-situ optical properties of living macroalgae, seagrasses, and rubble. The spectral characteristics of varied SAV groups were measured using the high resolution FieldSpec (R) 4 Hi-Res portable spectroradiometer. The study site selected was the Shoalwater Islands Marine Park, Rockingham, Western Australia as it is one of the fifteen biodiversity hotspots in Australia. Correlation and Principle Component Analysis were employed to evaluate the differences between SAV groups. The results have documented the spectral features of SAV and their associated habitats in Shoalwater Islands Marine Park, Western Australia, and developed a spectral library to distinguish among seagrass species and algae groups (green, red, and brown benthic macroalgae). The implications of this study will contribute to estimate and detect the distribution and seasonal variation of SAV on a broader scale.																	0197-7385		978-0-933957-43-5				2015																		WOS:000380550000227

Posidonia oceanica, a species endemic to the Mediterranean Sea, is of particular interest because of the constitution of a particular structure, the matte, which enables the sequestration of carbon over long periods of time (carbon sink). This significant long-term carbon stock, accumulated by the Posidonia oceanica ecosystem, is of great interest with regard to the mitigation of global climate change. An initial assessment of the stocks of carbon sequestrated within the matte has been undertaken in two sectors of the NATURA 2000 site, Grand Herbier de la Plaine Orientale (Corsica, North-Western Mediterranean). The surface area of the meadow has been measured by means of the combined use of aerial remote sensing (shallow zone) and side-scan sonar (deep zone). The thickness of the matte has been assessed by means of seismic reflection using a 2.5 KHz sediment probe and a sparker. The calibration of the seismic data was performed by scuba diving at the level of intermatte cliffs, clearly visible on the seismic profiles. The seagrass meadow at the NATURA 2000 site extends from 3 to 41 m depth and covers an estimated total area of 22 667 ha, or 52.4% of the bottom between 0 and 50 m depth. The speed of propagation within the matte (celerity), estimated by comparison of the field data (intermatte) and the seismic profiles, generally ranges from 1 600 to 1 700 m.s(-1). The thickness of the matte, estimated on the basis of the mean celerity, is on average 2.7 m for the northern sector (Biguglia) where it may locally exceed 8 m; it is on average 3.2 m for the southern sector (Aleria) where it may exceed 13 m, in particular off the mouth of a coastal lagoon (Diana). The presence of matte beneath the sediment should also be noted in patches of sand within the meadow and also beyond the lower limit. The quantity of carbon sequestered at this NATURA 2000 site may exceed 60 million tons. However, it would be necessary to determine the thickness of the matte for the whole site and to carry out coring within the matte, in several representative sectors, in order to assess more accurately the amounts of carbon sequestered.																			978-605-85652-3-4				2015							231	238										WOS:000377577200023

In this complex scenario we have developed a mapping methodology that involves the precise application of pre-processing techniques and the use of efficient classification algorithms. In particular, after a detailed assessment, support vector machines achieved the best performance using the appropriate kernel and parameters.

J	Barrell, J; Grant, J; Hanson, A; Mahoney, M				Barrell, Jeffrey; Grant, Jon; Hanson, Alan; Mahoney, Matthew			Evaluating the complementarity of acoustic and satellite remote sensing for seagrass landscape mapping	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Accurate maps representing seagrass spatial distribution are essential components for effective monitoring and management of coastal vegetated habitats. Satellite and acoustic remote sensing provide valuable spatial data for seagrass mapping, though few studies have evaluated the complementarity of these methods. In this study, the complementarity of seagrass mapping was assessed through comparison of acoustic and satellite remote-sensing data sets. QuickBird (R) satellite imagery representing the seagrass landscape of the Richibucto estuary, New Brunswick, Canada, was classified through an object-based procedure and evaluated against a single-beam sonar data set. Acoustic percentage cover values were classified into binary presence/absence format through the application of a decision threshold, allowing comparison with satellite data using the error matrix and derived metrics. Though the binary satellite classification resulted in relatively high accuracy compared with independent ground reference data, agreement between satellite and acoustic data sets was limited. Local differences in seagrass prevalence and patchiness affected classification accuracy, highlighting the potential for under-or overestimating seagrass cover when applying bay-scale classification to areas with different landscape structure. These results emphasize the importance of landscape context in seagrass mapping. Satellite and acoustic remote sensing were seen to fundamentally differ in their depiction of the landscape. Comparison of multiple remote-sensing methods allowed for assessment of complementarity as well as ecologically relevant insight to seagrass spatial dynamics, with implications for mapping and monitoring of seagrass habitats.

Stratigraphic architecture and evolution of a barrier seagrass bank in the mid-late Holocene, Shark Bay, Australia	MARINE GEOLOGY												Within the Faure Sill complex (Shark Bay, Western Australia), a combination of remote sensing analysis, seismic stratigraphy and cores to ground truth, together with radiocarbon dating, demonstrate the interconnection between sediment body morphologies, seagrass related substrates and pre-existing topography and reveal the system as a channel-bank complex. Sea level fluctuations appear to have largely controlled the hydrodynamic conditions of the bank, contributing to each stage of its evolution. 1) Not earlier than 8.5-8.0 ka BP, in a lowstand period, after an erosive event of underlying palaeosurfaces, seagrass establishment progressively contributed to initiating bank growth. 2) Around 6800 years BP, bank accumulation reached its apex, in conjunction with a rapid sea transgression. 3) During the Late Holocene, succeeding a slow decline to present sea level, bank growth continued to fill available accommodation space and a number of hiatuses, indicating temporal and spatial discontinuities within the process of bank building, are recognised. Average depositional rates of bank building (1.3 m/ka) conform to previous estimates derived for seagrass banks but rates are strongly fades dependent, attesting to the dynamic nature of this channel-bank complex. The extensive seagrass meadows are essential for a wide range of aspects of the environment of the Shark Bay area. Not only are they particularly important for the entire shallow benthic ecosystem, but they also had a major role in the partial closure of the southern basins and hence determining the development of hypersaline conditions and associated oolitic microbial and evaporitic fades in Hamelin Pool and L'Haridon Bight. Moreover, this system has a critical role in producing, sequestering and storing organic carbon. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A critical review of 195 studies revealed that, in the past four decades, advances in the application of RS methods, notably using Landsat imagery, are identified for seagrass detection, assessment of areal coverage, distribution and abundance mapping, and the detection of extent and biomass changes, as illustrated in peer-reviewed literature. Rapid technological and methodological advances have occurred in the acquisition and interpretation of optical and acoustic data for the mapping of seagrass habitats. The methods have been tested to segment, classify, and combine RS data with biological field or ground truth sample data. There is no single technology or approach that is suitable for and capable of measuring all seagrass parameters (presence/absence, cover, species, and biomass) and assessing change. Integration of field, imagery, and mapping approaches is therefore required. Further research is required for continued improvements in understanding of theoretical and methodological aspects of seagrass RS.

Worldwide declines in the distribution and abundance of seagrasses and increased threats to coastal ecosystems from climate change have prompted a need to acquire baseline data for monitoring and protecting these important habitats. We assessed the distribution and abundance of eelgrass (Zostera marina) along nearly 1200 km of shoreline on the lower Alaska Peninsula, a region of expansive eelgrass meadows whose status and trends are poorly understood. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a multi-scale approach by using Landsat satellite imagery to map the total areal extent of eelgrass while integrating field survey data to improve map accuracy and describe the physical and biological condition of the meadows. Innovative use of proven methods and processing tools was used to address challenges inherent to remote sensing in high latitude, coastal environments. Eelgrass was estimated to cover similar to 31,000 ha, 91% of submerged aquatic vegetation on the lower Alaska Peninsula, nearly doubling the known spatial extent of eelgrass in the region. Mapping accuracy was 80%-90% for eelgrass distribution at locations containing adequate field survey data for error analysis.																	2072-4292					DEC	2014	6	12					12447	12477		10.3390/rs61212447								WOS:000346795300035						
J	Vandermeulen, H				Vandermeulen, Herb			Bay-scale assessment of eelgrass beds using sidescan and video	HELGOLAND MARINE RESEARCH												The assessment of the status of eelgrass (Zostera marina) beds at the bay-scale in turbid, shallow estuaries is problematic. The bay-scale assessment (i.e., tens of km) of eelgrass beds usually involves remote sensing methods such as aerial photography or satellite imagery. These methods can fail if the water column is turbid, as is the case for many shallow estuaries on Canada's eastern seaboard. A novel towfish package was developed for the bay-scale assessment of eelgrass beds irrespective of water column turbidity. The towfish consisted of an underwater video camera with scaling lasers, sidescan sonar and a transponder-based positioning system. The towfish was deployed along predetermined transects in three northern New Brunswick estuaries. Maps were created of eelgrass cover and health (epiphyte load) and ancillary bottom features such as benthic algal growth, bacterial mats (Beggiatoa) and oysters. All three estuaries had accumulations of material reminiscent of the oomycete Leptomitus, although it was not positively identified in our study. Tabusintac held the most extensive eelgrass beds of the best health. Cocagne had the lowest scores for eelgrass health, while Bouctouche was slightly better. The towfish method proved to be cost effective and useful for the bay-scale assessment of eelgrass beds to sub-meter precision in real time.																	1438-387X	1438-3888				DEC	2014	68	4					559	569		10.1007/s10152-014-0412-5								WOS:000344559500011

Evaluating Light Availability, Seagrass Biomass, and Productivity Using Hyperspectral Airborne Remote Sensing in Saint Joseph's Bay, Florida	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Seagrasses provide a number of critical ecosystem services, including habitat for numerous species, sediment stabilization, and shoreline protection. Ariel photography is a useful tool to estimate the areal extent of seagrasses, but recent innovations in radiometrically calibrated sensors and algorithm development have allowed identification of benthic types and retrieval of absolute density. This study demonstrates the quantitative ability of a high spatial resolution (1 m) airborne hyperspectral sensor (3.2 nm bandwidth) in the complex coastal waters of Saint Joseph's Bay (SJB). Several benthic types were distinguished, including submerged and floating aquatic vegetation, benthic red algae, bare sand, and optically deep water. A total of 23.6 km(2) of benthic vegetation was detected, indicating no dramatic change in vegetation area over the past 30 years. SJB supported high seagrass density at depths shallower than 2 m with an average leaf area index of 2.0 +/- 0.6 m(2) m(-2). Annual seagrass production in the bay was 13,570 t C year(-1) and represented 41 % of total marine primary production. The effects of coarser spatial resolution were investigated and found to reduce biomass retrievals, underestimate productivity, and alter patch size statistics. Although data requirements for this approach are considerable, water column optical modeling may reduce the in situ requirements and facilitate the transition of this technique to routine monitoring efforts. The ability to quantify not just areal extent but also productivity of a seagrass meadow in optically complex coastal waters can provide information on the capacity of these environments to support marine food webs.																	1559-2723	1559-2731				NOV	2014	37	6					1467	1489		10.1007/s12237-013-9764-3								WOS:000343722700012

Sargassum beds play a range of ecological roles in coastal waters, but their sustainability is threatened by pollution and reclamation within ASEAN countries with rapid economic growth. Before conservation initiatives can be implemented, it is necessary to establish their present distribution. These beds can be mapped using the noncommercial satellite, ALOS, which can provide multiband images using high spatial resolution optical sensors (sensitive to 10 m(-2) plots), AVNIR-2. These images are of sufficient quality for examining coastal ecosystems and, in this study, for mapping the Sargassum beds in the waters off the coast of Sattahip, Chon Buri Province, Thailand. This coastal zone is a natural marine park reserve and protected from human activities such as fishery and reclamation. Biomass data were obtained in January, February, March, and December 2009 from quadrat sampling. The biomass of Sargassum aquifolium (Turner) C. Agardh at a bottom depth of 1 m and 1.5-2 m was determined to be 7.73 and 92.75 g dw m(-2), while that of Sargassum oligocystum Montagne was found to be 44.05 and 87.97 g dw m(-2), respectively. Ground truth data were obtained in February and October 2012 from serial images taken by manta tow. Supervised classification is a procedure for identifying spectrally similar areas on an image by identifying "training" sites of known targets and then extrapolating those spectral signatures to other areas of unknown targets. By applying this methodology, the Sargassum beds off Sattahip can be detected with an accuracy of about 70%. It is estimated that the error is caused by mixel effects of the bottom substrates in individual pixels, each of which covers an area of 10 x 10 m. Our results indicate that the images captured by ALOS AVNIR-2 are informative and useful for mapping the -Sargassum beds in Southeast Asia.																	0006-8055	1437-4323				OCT	2014	57	5					367	377		10.1515/bot-2014-0015								WOS:000343111500004						
J	Pu, RL; Bell, S; Meyer, C				Pu, Ruiliang; Bell, Susan; Meyer, Cynthia			Mapping and assessing seagrass bed changes in Central Florida's west coast using multitemporal Landsat TM imagery	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Some seagrass meadows in coastal shallow waters have displayed large scale changes in seagrass spatial extent and hurricanes and/or tropical storms have been suggested as factors responsible for reduction in coverage. Taking advantage of the incidence of three tropical storms passing near a study site along the central west Florida coast within a two-month period in 2004, we evaluated whether satellite remote sensing techniques (Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery) are useful for assessing dynamics of seagrass (=submerged aquatic vegetation: SAV) cover/abundance in response to these multiple disturbances. We also examined whether an image preprocessing procedure, which included water column correction, applied to the Landsat TM images could further improve the classification and mapping of detailed SAV coverage. We compared a historical set of Landsat TM images, acquired in Fall 2003 and Fall and late Summer 2005, which were processed to classify %SAV cover into five classes using a maximum likelihood classifier. Importantly, our experimental results demonstrated that the application of the image preprocessing procedures led to an overall accuracy 2-14% improvement in SAV classification due to water column correction compared to that currently reported in the literature when similar Landsat TM data are utilized. Based upon the classification results mapped from the TM images and as well as a similar classification of SAV interpreted from aerial photographs collected before and after the passage of these same storms, SAV coverage over the study areas was found to increase about 6% (integrating SAV losses and gains) by 2005/2006 in comparison to cover levels present prior to the repeated storm activity. We conclude that heavy rains during 2004 along with physical disturbance from gale force winds from the tropical storms/hurricanes did not produce any SAV bed loss at the study site that was sustained for more than one year after multiple storm passage.

Dinesh			Environmental characteristics of tropical coral reef-seagrass dominated lagoons (Lakshadweep, India) and implications to resilience to climate change	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Environmental characteristics of the coral reef-seagrass ecosystem of selected Lakshadweep Islands (India) were assessed with a view to understanding the future climate change scenario in the region. Images obtained from the Indian remote sensing satellite (IRS P6) were used to identify the different zones such as the corals, the seagrass and the sandy region. The pH (7.6-8.6) of sediment was relatively high in the coral reef compared to the seagrass area, possibly indicating a climate shift-induced coral bleaching. The water quality and sediment texture generally showed marked intra-and inter-island variations illustrating that these coral reef ecosystems are highly vulnerable to climate change brought about by increased human interventions. Future research should therefore explore the habitat and resource connections, to predict their restoring capabilities for a sustainable exploitation. With an alarming increase in the population and associated developmental activities, the island ecosystems are expected to respond severely to the climate change, which may eventually lead to mass mortality of corals due to bleaching.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				AUG	2014	72	4					1025	1037		10.1007/s12665-013-3020-9								WOS:000341084400006

Multi-temporal mapping of seagrass cover, species and biomass: A semi-automated object based image analysis approach	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The spatial and temporal dynamics of seagrasses have been studied from the leaf to patch (100 m(2)) scales. However, landscape scale (>100 km(2)) seagrass population dynamics are unresolved in seagrass ecology. Previous remote sensing approaches have lacked the temporal or spatial resolution, or ecologically appropriate mapping, to fully address this issue. This paper presents a robust, semi-automated object-based image analysis approach for mapping dominant seagrass species, percentage cover and above ground biomass using a time series of field data and coincident high spatial resolution satellite imagery. The study area was a 142 km(2) shallow, clear water seagrass habitat (the Eastern Banks, Moreton Bay, Australia). Nine data sets acquired between 2004 and 2013 were used to create seagrass species and percentage cover maps through the integration of seagrass photo transect field data, and atmospherically and geometrically corrected high spatial resolution satellite image data (World View-2, IKONOS and Quickbird-2) using an object based image analysis approach. Biomass maps were derived using empirical models trained with in-situ above ground biomass data per seagrass species. Maps and summary plots identified inter- and intra-annual variation of seagrass species composition, percentage cover level and above ground biomass. The methods provide a rigorous approach for field and image data collection and pre-processing, a semi-automated approach to extract seagrass species and cover maps and assess accuracy, and the subsequent empirical modelling of seagrass biomass. The resultant maps provide a fundamental data set for understanding landscape scale seagrass dynamics in a shallow water environment. Our findings provide proof of concept for the use of time-series analysis of remotely sensed seagrass products for use in seagrass ecology and management (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

J	Petus, C; Collier, C; Devlin, M; Rasheed, M; McKenna, S				Petus, Caroline; Collier, Catherine; Devlin, Michelle; Rasheed, Michael; McKenna, Skye			Using MODIS data for understanding changes in seagrass meadow health: A case study in the Great Barrier Reef (Australia)	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Stretching more than 2000 km along the Queensland coast, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBR) shelters over 43,000 square km of seagrass meadows. Despite the status of marine protected area and World Heritage listing of the GBR, local seagrass meadows are under stress from reduced water quality levels; with reduction in the amount of light available for seagrass photosynthesis defined as the primary cause of seagrass loss throughout the GBR. Methods have been developed to map GBR plume water types by using MODE quasi-true colour (hereafter true colour) images reclassified in function of their dominant colour. These data can be used as an interpretative tool for understanding changes in seagrass meadow health (as defined in this study by the seagrass area and abundance) at different spatial and temporal scales. We tested this method in Cleveland Bay, in the northern GBR, where substantial loss in seagrass area and biomass was detected by annual monitoring from 2007 to 2011. A strong correlation was found between bay-wide seagrass meadow area and biomass and exposure to turbid Primary (sediment-dominated) water type. There was also a strong correlation between the changes of biomass and area of individual meadows and exposure of seagrass ecosystems to Primary water type over the 5-year period. Seagrass meadows were also grouped according to the dominant species within each meadow, irrespective of location within Cleveland Bay. These consolidated community types did not correlate well with the exposure to Primary water type, and this is likely to be due to local environmental conditions with the individual meadows that comprise these groupings. This study proved that remote sensing data provide the synoptic window and repetitivity required to investigate changes in water quality conditions over time. Remote sensing data provide an opportunity to investigate the risk of marine-coastal ecosystems to light limitation due to increased water turbidity when in situ water quality data is not available or is insufficient.

J	Lathrop, RG; Haag, SM; Merchant, D; Kennish, MJ; Fertig, B				Lathrop, Richard G., Jr.; Haag, Scott M.; Merchant, Daniel; Kennish, Michael J.; Fertig, Benjamin			Comparison of remotely-sensed surveys vs. in situ plot-based assessments of sea grass condition in Barnegat Bay-Little Egg Harbor, New Jersey USA	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												With the increasing appreciation that sea grass habitats are in global decline, there is a great need to be able to efficiently and effectively assess and characterize the status and trends of sea grass in our coastal ecosystems. This paper examines the utility of remotely sensed vs. in situ plot-based monitoring using the Barnegat Bay-Little Egg Harbor (BB-LEH), New Jersey, USA estuarine system as a case study. Eelgrass (Zostera marina) is the dominant species, while widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima) is also common in lower salinity regions of the BB-LEH. Aerial imagery collected during the months of July and August 2009 was interpreted and mapped using object based image analysis techniques, similar to techniques used in the 2003 mapping survey of this system. Boat-based in situ monitoring data were collected concurrently with the aerial photography to assist the image interpretation and for an independent accuracy assessment. We compared the remotely-sensed mapping of sea grass cover change (in 2003 vs. 2009) vs. in situ plot-based monitoring conducted from 2004 through 2009. Comparison of the remotely-sensed vs. the in situ plot-change analysis suggests that the two methodologies had broadly similarly results, with the percent area showing declines in sea grass cover greater than those that exhibited increases. In conclusion, the two studies provide corroborating evidence that sea grass has declined in percent cover in the BB-LEH system during the decade of the 2000's. While remotely-sensed surveys provide synoptic information for a "big picture" view on sea grass distribution, site specific in situ sampling is required to determine other aspects of sea grass status, e.g. above vs. below-ground biomass, blade length, shoot density, epiphytic loading, etc. Either method alone gives an incomplete picture. As demonstrated in this study, to fully characterize the spatial extent, health, and density of sea grass meadows across the entire estuary, combining remote sensing surveys concomitantly with comprehensive in situ assessment provides the most robust approach.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				JUN	2014	18	3					299	308		10.1007/s11852-014-0319-y								WOS:000336739500014						
J	Lee, ZP; Shang, SL; Hu, CM; Zibordi, G				Lee, Zhongping; Shang, Shaoling; Hu, Chuanmin; Zibordi, Giuseppe			Spectral interdependence of remote-sensing reflectance and its implications on the design of ocean color satellite sensors	APPLIED OPTICS												Using 901 remote-sensing reflectance spectra (R-rs (lambda),sr(-1),. from 400 to 700 nm with a 5 nm resolution), we evaluated the correlations of (rs) (lambda) between neighboring spectral bands in order to characterize (1) the spectral interdependence of R-rs (lambda) at different bands and (2) to what extent hyperspectral R-rs (lambda) can be reconstructed from multiband measurements. The 901 R-rs spectra were measured over a wide variety of aquatic environments in which water color varied from oceanic blue to coastal green or brown, with chlorophyll-a concentrations ranging from similar to 0.02 to > 100 mg m(-3), bottom depths from similar to 1 m to > 1000 m, and bottom substrates including sand, coral reef, and seagrass. The correlation coefficient of R-rs (lambda) between neighboring bands at center wavelengths lambda(k) and lambda(I), r(Delta lambda)(lambda(k,)lambda(I)), was evaluated systematically, with the spectral gap (Delta lambda = lambda(i) - lambda(k)) changing between 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 nm, respectively. It was found that r(Delta lambda) decreased with increasing Delta(lambda) but remained > 0.97 for Delta(lambda)<= 20 nm for all spectral bands. Further, using 15 spectral bands between 400 and 710 nm, we reconstructed, via multivariant linear regression, hyperspectral R-rs (lambda) (from 400 to 700 nm with a 5 nm resolution). The percentage difference between measured and reconstructed R-rs for each band in the 400-700 nm range was generally less than 1%, with a correlation coefficient close to 1.0. The mean absolute error between measured and reconstructed R-rs was about 0.00002 sr(-1) for each band, which is significantly smaller than the R-rs uncertainties from all past and current ocean color satellite radiometric products. These results echo findings of earlier studies that Rrs measurements at similar to 15 spectral bands in the visible domain can provide nearly identical spectral information as with hyperspectral (contiguous bands at 5 nm spectral resolution) measurements. Such results provide insights for data storage and handling of large volume hyperspectral data as well as for the design of future ocean color satellite sensors.

Detecting trend and seasonal changes in bathymetry derived from HICO imagery: A case study of Shark Bay, Western Australia	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) aboard the International Space Station has offered for the first time a dedicated space-borne hyperspectral sensor specifically designed for remote sensing of the coastal environment. However, several processing steps are required to convert calibrated top-of-atmosphere radiances to the desired geophysical parameter(s). These steps add various amounts of uncertainty that can cumulatively render the geophysical parameter imprecise and potentially unusable if the objective is to analyze trends and/or seasonal variability. This research presented here has focused on: (1) atmospheric correction of HICO imagery; (2) retrieval of bathymetry using an improved implementation of a shallow water inversion algorithm; (3) propagation of uncertainty due to environmental noise through the bathymetry retrieval process; (4) issues relating to consistent geo-location of HICO imagery necessary for time series analysis, and; (5) tide height corrections of the retrieved bathymetric dataset The underlying question of whether a temporal change in depth is detectable above uncertainty is also addressed. To this end, nine HICO images spanning November 2011 to August 2012, over the Shark Bay World Heritage Area, Western Australia, were examined. The results presented indicate that precision of the bathymetric retrievals is dependent on the shallow water inversion algorithm used. Within this study, an average of 70% of pixels for the entire HICO-derived bathymetry dataset achieved a relative uncertainty of less than +/- 20%. A per-pixel t-test analysis between derived bathymetry images at successive timestamps revealed observable changes in depth to as low as 0.4 m. However, the present geolocation accuracy of HICO is relatively poor and needs further improvements before extensive time series analysis can be performed.

The sensor incorporates several technologies that are demonstrated for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, in a working system in order to achieve a high performance level in terms of uniformity, signal-to-noise ratio, low polarization sensitivity, low stray light, and high spatial resolution. The instrument covers the 350-1050 nm spectral range with a 2.83 nm sampling per pixel, and a 0.88 mrad instantaneous field of view, with 608 cross-track pixels in a pushbroom configuration. Two additional infrared channels (1240 and 1610 nm) are measured by a spot radiometer housed in the same head. The spectrometer design is based on an optically fast (F/1.8) Dyson design form coupled to a wide angle two-mirror telescope in a configuration that minimizes polarization sensitivity without the use of a depolarizer. A grating with minimum polarization sensitivity and broadband efficiency was fabricated as well as a slit assembly with black (etched) silicon surface to minimize backscatter. First flight results over calibration sites as well as Monterey Bay in California have demonstrated good agreement between in situ and remotely sensed data, confirming the potential value of the sensor to the coastal ocean science community.

However, lack of proper management has resulted in the closure of various fisheries, such as the Calico scallop, Argopecten ventricosus, in 1994. One of the main challenges for the management of coastal resources is the selection of critical habitats for conservation considering the economic activities of the communities associated with them. This study used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing to assess the roll of rhodoliths and Sargassum spp. as critical habitats in Bahia Concepcion for endangered and commercial species. Underwater surveys, on 72 randomly selected sites within the bay, were conducted to characterize the shallow benthic habitats, fish and invertebrate species abundance and richness during the spring of 2011. Analyses show that rhodoliths are important for the invertebrate assemblages and for at least 4 species protected under the Mexican law, NOM-059, for threatened species. Sargassum spp. and seagrass beds are also relevant for diversity but their annual life cycle limits the time when these are available as habitat for other species. GIS tools proved an innovative and effective method to provide essential information to protect critical habitats such as rhodoliths, Sargassum spp. and seagrasses, for the recovery and conservation of diversity.																	0181-1568	1776-0984				FEB	2014	35	1					49	65		10.7872/crya.v35.iss1.2014.49								WOS:000338762100005

The newly launched Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager band 2, 3 and 4 were used and applied in Merambong Shoals located in Straits of Johore, Malaysia that have various density of seagrass coverage in the region. The results indicated good agreement with in-situ verifications. The seagrass occurrence areas were classified at 90 percent overall classification accuracy (khat statistics=0.87) whilst the seagrass aboveground biomass was succesfully modelled agianst the in-situ observations (R-2=0.9, p<0.0001, n=1200). It is then extended to fully map the above seagrass biomass for the large coverage with good accuracy (RMSE+ 1.75g/m(2)).

The first step is to classify image pixels into scar and non-scar categories based on a sparse coding algorithm. The first step produces an initial scar map in which false positive scar pixels may be present. In the second step, local orientation of each detected scar pixel is computed using the morphological directional profile, which is defined as outputs of a directional filter with a varying orientation parameter. The profile is then utilized to eliminate false positives and generate the final scar detection map. We applied the algorithm to a panchromatic image captured at the Deckle Beach, Florida using the WorldView2 orbiting satellite. Our results show that the proposed method can achieve >90% accuracy on the detection of seagrass scars.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-303-8				2014	9240								UNSP 92400G	10.1117/12.2069325								WOS:000348196100011

This chapter reviews effects of typhoons, hurricane and cyclone on seagrass distribution variation in the world, with much attention to China. The 5 major issues have been investigated : (1) Increased turbulence generated by cyclone and hurricane can result in direct physical damage; (2) Sediments resuspended by huge waves and coastal land use change decreased water transparency correspondingly decreased the efficiency of photosynthesis; (3) Hurricane, cyclone and typhoon increased the rainfall, which decreased nearshore and river mouth water salinity, correspondingly changed seagrass growth environment; (4) New species brought in by Hurricane, cyclone and typhoon, changed the composition of seagrass.

There were five classes in the study site: natural forest, Melaleuca forest, agriculture, peat and built-up areas. Agricultural land and Melaleuca forest changing into built-up areas constituted approximately 51.13% of the total area changing. The benthic seagrass habitat increased dramatically from 2001 to the end of 2010. Besides, marine culture has been concerned to cage culture which is one of the sources directly affecting aquatic life and water quality in coastal environment. Cage culture locations were detected using high-resolution imagery as THEOS data for image fusion and Object-based Image Analysis methods. Water quality criteria including nitrogen, phosphorus and chlorophyll-a concentrations were determined by interpolation method, and the spatial distribution of these parameters showed a concentration in the study area in the range from 0.17 to 0.49 mg/L, 0.012 to 0.073 mg/L and 0.26 to 1.046 g/L, respectively.																	1010-6049	1752-0762					2014	29	5					486	506		10.1080/10106049.2013.798358								WOS:000340104200003

Lake Eymir in Ankara (Turkey) was the study site. In order to generate the bathymetric map of the lake, image and data processing, and modelling were applied. First, the bands that would be used in depth prediction models were determined through statistical and multicollinearity analyses. Then, data screening was performed based on the standard deviation of standardized residuals (SD_SR) of depth values determined through preliminary linear regression models. This analysis indicated the sampling points utilized in depth modelling. Finally, linear and non-linear regression models were developed to predict the depths in Lake Eymir based on remotely sensed data. The non-linear regression model performed slightly better compared to the linear one in predicting the depths in Lake Eymir. Coefficients of determination (R-2) up to 0.90 were achieved. In general, the bathymetric map was in agreement with observations except at re-suspension areas. Yet, regression models were successful in defining the shallow depths at shore, as well as at the inlet and outlet of the lake. Moreover, deeper locations were successfully identified.

For non-interrupted observations, only the Landsat series have the potential to detect major water quality events since the 1980s. However, such ability is hindered by the unknown data quality or consistency through time. Here, using the Florida Keys as a case study, we demonstrate an approach to identify historical water quality events through improved atmospheric correction of Landsat data and cross-validation with concurrent MODIS data. After aggregation of the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) 30-m pixels to 240-m pixels (to increase the signal-to-noise ratio), a MODIS-like atmospheric correction approach using the Landsat shortwave-infrared (SWIR) bands was developed and applied to the entire Landsat-5 TM data series between 1985 and 2010. Remote sensing reflectance (Res) anomalies from Landsat (2 standard deviations from a pixel-specific monthly climatology) were found to detect MODIS Res anomalies with over 90% accuracy for all three bands for the same period of 2002-2010. Extending this analysis for the entire Landsat-5 time-series revealed Res anomaly events in the 1980s and 1990s, some of which are corroborated by known ecosystem changes due in part to changes in local freshwater flow. Indeed, TM Res anomalies were shown to be useful in detecting shifts in seagrass density, turbidity increases, black water events, and phytoplankton blooms. These findings have large implications for ongoing and future water quality assessment in the Florida Keys as well as in many other coastal regions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Monitoring of seagrass by lightweight AUV: A Posidonia oceanica case study surrounding Murter Island of Croatia	2014 22ND MEDITERRANEAN CONFERENCE ON CONTROL AND AUTOMATION (MED)	Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation				22nd Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation (MED)	JUN 16-19, 2014	Univ Palermo, Palermo, ITALY		Univ Palermo			Posidonia oceanica (Neptune Grass) is an endemic species to the Mediterranean Sea. It forms dense and extensive green underwater meadows which provide important ecological functions and services and harbour highly diverse communities; as such it is identified as a priority habitat type for conservation under the EU Habitats Directive (Dir 92/43/CEE). Over the last decades many Posidonia oceanica meadows have disappeared or have been altered. Efficient monitoring is the key of the ecosystem conservation. Monitoring of vast areas covered by Posidonia oceanica is extremely difficult, costly and time consuming and generates pronounced need for new methods and tools. This case study presents potential and promote use of lightweight autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) with the remote sensing payload as the environmentally non-destructive monitoring method. The study was performed from 2011 to 2013 on the Croatian island Murter during the "Breaking the Surface" - international interdisciplinary field training of marine robotics and applications. Four AUVs equipped with different payloads were performing the missions in the study area. This paper presents results and analysis of different aspects important for the monitoring such as compliance with the existing monitoring indicators and descriptors used to assess the conservation status of P. oceanica, performance of the AUVs and their sensor sets, cost and time efficiency of the monitoring and geographical-localisation accuracy of the data collected.																	2325-369X		978-1-4799-5901-3				2014							758	763										WOS:000400962700127						
J	Barrell, J; Grant, J				Barrell, Jeffrey; Grant, Jon			Detecting hot and cold spots in a seagrass landscape using local indicators of spatial association	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Eelgrass (Zostera marina) is an important feature of coastal ecosystems in Atlantic Canada, providing a suite of valuable ecosystem services. These services, and its sensitivity to stressors, have prompted efforts to characterize the spatial and temporal dynamics of eelgrass landscapes in order to facilitate management and monitoring of coastal ecosystem health. Current methods for broad-scale mapping of eelgrass rely on aerial remote sensing and may not be appropriate in certain types of landscapes, particularly in turbid waters and areas lacking distinct boundaries. This study takes a novel approach to the quantification and analysis of seagrass landscape structure at multiple spatial scales using acoustic data and local spatial statistics. Data from a single-beam acoustic survey in Richibucto, New Brunswick, Canada were analyzed with geostatistical techniques and the Getis-Ord G (i) (*) local spatial statistic in order to detect statistically significant zones of high and low cover in an estuarine seagrass bed. Results showed distinct and significant patterns in seagrass cover at multiple spatial scales within a region of apparently continuous spatial cover. Boundaries between areas of high and low cover were also detected. This study demonstrates how acoustic data and local spatial statistics can be used to quantify landscape pattern and to further the application of landscape techniques in the marine environment.

Comparable assessments of seagrass distribution over time are often lacking as the information is present for separate dates, or created following different mapping approaches, and this makes it difficult to conduct quantitative comparisons. We provide an assessment of available data sets and approaches, and their suitability for monitoring and quantifying change in seagrass percentage cover and extent for a large coastal embayment (Moreton Bay, Australia, 1582 km(2)). Seagrass percentage cover maps were created for 2011 and 2004 and compared to map and measure the extent of seagrass percentage cover change, and changes in the extent of seagrass environments. Total extent of seagrass was shown to be higher in 2011 compared to 2004. Potential sources of these differences may be: mapping inaccuracy; actual change in extent and cover; and, monthly to seasonal variations in seagrass cover. A qualitative comparison of the 2004 and 2011 maps was performed against maps of seagrass extent maps from 1975, 1986 and 1999, which were created using a range of different methods and data. The output maps show changes in seagrass extent, but a lack of detail arising from variable mapping methods and differing mapping extents prevented a reliable comparison. We conclude that robust mapping of seasonal and inter-annual variation in seagrass percentage cover distribution or extent, as well as impacts of episodic and stochastic disturbance events, requires a thorough understanding of the mapping approaches used so that data sets can be compared. Additional complimentary information is required to help understand the drivers of changes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Cannizzaro, JP; Carlson, PR; Yarbro, LA; Hu, CM				Cannizzaro, Jennifer P.; Carlson, Paul R., Jr.; Yarbro, Laura A.; Hu, Chuanmin			Optical variability along a river plume gradient: Implications for management and remote sensing	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Effective assessment and management of seagrass distributions require a thorough understanding of the water environment, in particular the inherent optical properties (lops) of the water column, and the linkage with environmental forcing such as coastal run-off. Coastal waters off the Suwannee and Steinhatchee rivers in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico where seagrass is abundant were sampled regularly in 2010 and 2011 during periods ranging from normal spring flooding to record-low flow conditions associated with widespread drought. Relationships between surface salinities, chlorophyll a concentrations (Chl-a), and IOPs were examined to characterize the optical variability of this region as well as its connection with river discharge and wind forcing. Significant spatial and temporal variability was observed for Chl-a (0.285-14.4 mg m(-3)), colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption at 443 nm, a(CDOM)(443), (0.042-7.53 m(-1)), and particulate backscattering at 660 nm, b(bp)(660), (0.002-0.067 m(-1)) with gradients evident between nearshore (riverine) and offshore (oceanic) waters. Overall, CDOM was the dominant optically significant constituent (OSC), contributing similar to 74-75 +/- 11% to total (non-water) absorption at 443 nm and 555 nm. CDOM was mainly controlled by river flow, with an inverse correlation observed between a(CDOM)(443) and salinity (r(2) = 0.66). Chl-a showed less direct dependence on flow, exhibiting elevated concentrations (>5 mg m(-3)) mainly during the summer. Particulate backscattering in this region was relatively low and largely controlled by non-algal particles, as was evident by the strong relationship between b(bp)(660) and detrital absorption at 443 nm, a(d)(443) (r(2) = 0.71). Compared with other coastal waters in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, a(CDOM)(443) was similar to 3-5 times higher and b(bp)(660) was similar to 50% lower, making the study region very dark. Given that the optical properties of coastal waters in this region are strongly influenced by CDOM derived from terrestrial discharge, remote-sensing algorithms for determining long-term Chl-a trends should focus on utilizing wavebands less influenced by CDOM.

In this context we present a methodology for effective monitoring and mapping of Posidonia oceanica (PO) meadows in turbid waters using remote sensing techniques tested by means of LAI (Leaf Area Index) point sea truth measurements. Preliminary results using Daedalus airborne sensor are reported referring to the PO meadows at Civitavecchia site (central Tyrrhenian sea) where vessel traffic due to presence of important harbors and huge power plant represent strong impact factors. This coastal area, 100 km far from Rome (Central Italy), is characterized also by significant hydrodynamic variations and other anthropogenic factors that affect the health of seagrass meadows with frequent turbidity and suspended sediments in the water column. During 2011-2012 years point measurements of several parameters related to PO meadows phenology were acquired on various stations distributed along 20 km of coast between the Civitavecchia and S. Marinella sites. The Daedalus airborne sensor multispectral data were preprocessed with the support of satellite (MERIS) derived water quality parameters to obtain here improved thematic maps of the local PO distribution. Their thematic accuracy was then evaluated as agreement (R-2) with the point sea truth measurements and regressive modeling using an on purpose developd method.

The goal of this study was to examine the resilience and stability of Cymodocea nodosa-dominated seagrass meadows in Urbino lagoon (Corsica, Mediterranean Sea) by characterizing the spatio-temporal dynamics of seagrass meadows over a 40-year period and comparing (anthropogenic and climatic) environmental fluctuations. The spatio-temporal evolution of seagrass meadows was investigated using previous maps (1973, 1979, 1990, 1994, 1996, 1999) and a 2011 map realized by aerial photography-remote sensing combined with GIS technology. Environmental fluctuation was investigated via physical-chemical parameters (rainfall, water temperature, salinity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen) and human-impact changes (aquaculture, artificial channel). The results showed a severe decline (estimated at -49%) in seagrass meadows between 1973 and 1994 followed by a period of strong recovery (estimated to +42%) between 1994 and 2011. Increased turbidity, induced either by rainfall events, dredging or phytoplankton growth, emerged as the most important driver of the spatio-temporal evolution of Cymodocea nodosa-dominated meadows in Urbino lagoon over the last four decades. Climate events associated to increased turbidity and reduced salinity and temperature could heavily impact seagrass dynamics. This study shows that Urbino lagoon, a system relatively untouched by human impact, shelters seagrass meadows that exhibit high resilience and stability. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Until now, reports on damages caused by storms and hurricanes on seagrass beds are uncommon and highly variable. The seagrass meadows of the East end of Jardines de la Reina archipelago were surveyed from Nov. 29th to Dec. 5th of 2008, in order to determinate the effects from the passing of Hurricane Paloma: a category three storm on the Saffir-Simpsom scale. A rapid field assessment of the affected areas was carried out using the manta tow technique. In six sites, seagrass was quantitatively evaluated using a 15cm diameter core (four sampling units per site) and shoot density was calculated. Remote sensing techniques were used to estimate seagrass cover. To estimate the percentage of affected areas, a Region of Interest (ROI) was first created over a Landsat image. The percentage of seagrass affected within the ROI was estimated through direct georeferentiation of the contours of the damaged area and with a comparison to the total seagrass extension. To find possible explanations for damages, a false colour image was created using the near infrared band, to highlight the differences between emerged and submerged zones. The direction of winds was estimated using ArcGis 9.2 creating circular buffers, from the centre of the hurricane and generating lines tangent to the buffers. Seagrass in the region was dominated by the angiosperm Thalassia testudinum. Regional mean density was 1 321 +/- 721 shoots/m(2), a value regarded as high for the Caribbean area. Seagrass meadows were partly affected by sediment accumulation on the shoots of T testudinum and uprooting rhizomes. The 7.6km(2) disturbed area represented 1% of the total seagrass area. Other sites, closer to the centre of the hurricane, did not show any damages on the marine vegetation. The keys location with respect to the hurricane track was the most likely cause of the effects. To the North of the affected area there is an opening among the keys where the generation of waves, currents and turbulence could have occurred. Three years after the hurricane event, both vegetation cover loss and silt re-colonization by macroalgae species were observed within the affected area, by showing a patchily-vegetated landscape. This site is currently undergoing a temporal succession whose assessment demands a monitoring scheme, that will provide interesting information to document its future evolution and responsiveness against upcoming natural or anthropogenic events.																	0034-7744					SEP	2013	61	3					1425	1432										WOS:000324509200033	24027933					
J	Pu, RL; Bell, S				Pu, Ruiliang; Bell, Susan			A protocol for improving mapping and assessing of seagrass abundance along the West Central Coast of Florida using Landsat TM and EO-1 ALI/Hyperion images	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Seagrass habitats are characteristic features of shallow waters worldwide and provide a variety of ecosystem functions. Remote sensing techniques can help collect spatial and temporal information about seagrass resources. In this study, we evaluate a protocol that utilizes image optimization algorithms followed by atmospheric and sunglint corrections to the three satellite sensors [Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) Advanced Land Imager (ALI) and Hyperion (HYP)] and a fuzzy synthetic evaluation technique to map and assess seagrass abundance in Pinellas County, FL, USA. After image preprocessed with image optimization algorithms and atmospheric and sunglint correction approaches, the three sensors' data were used to classify the submerged aquatic vegetation cover (%SAV cover) into 5 classes with a maximum likelihood classifier. Based on three biological metrics [%SAV, leaf area index (LA!), and Biomass] measured from the field, nine multiple regression models were developed for estimating the three biometrics with spectral variables derived from the three sensors' data. Then, five membership maps were created with the three biometrics along with two environmental factors (water depth and distance-to-shoreline). Finally, seagrass abundance maps were produced by using a fuzzy synthetic evaluation technique and five membership maps. The experimental results indicate that the HYP sensor produced the best results of the 5-class classification of %SAV cover (overall accuracy = 87% and Kappa = 0.83 vs. 82% and 0.77 by ALI and 79% and 0.73 by TM) and better multiple regression models for estimating the three biometrics (R-2 = 0.66, 0.62 and 0.61 for %SAV, LAI and Biomass vs. 0.62, 0.61 and 0.55 by ALI and 0.58, 0.56 and 0.52 by TM) for creating seagrass abundance maps along with two environmental factors. Combined our results demonstrate that the image optimization algorithms and the fuzzy synthetic evaluation technique were effective in mapping detailed seagrass habitats and assessing seagrass abundance with the 30-m resolution data collected by the three sensors.

Coastal retreat and improved water quality mitigate losses of seagrass from sea level rise	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												The distribution and abundance of seagrass ecosystems could change significantly over the coming century due to sea level rise (SLR). Coastal managers require mechanistic understanding of the processes affecting seagrass response to SLR to maximize their conservation and associated provision of ecosystem services. In Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia, vast seagrass meadows supporting populations of sea turtles and dugongs are juxtaposed with the multiple stressors associated with a large and rapidly expanding human population. Here, the interactive effects of predicted SLR, changes in water clarity, and land use on future distributions of seagrass in Moreton Bay were quantified. A habitat distribution model of present day seagrass in relation to benthic irradiance and wave height was developed which correctly classified habitats in 83% of cases. Spatial predictions of seagrass and presence derived from the model and bathymetric data were used to initiate a SLR inundation model. Bathymetry was iteratively modified based on SLR and sedimentary accretion in seagrass to simulate potential seagrass habitat at 10 year time steps until 2100. The area of seagrass habitat was predicted to decline by 17% by 2100 under a scenario of SLR of 1.1m. A scenario including the removal of impervious surfaces, such as roads and houses, from newly inundated regions, demonstrated that managed retreat of the shoreline could potentially reduce the overall decline in seagrass habitat to just 5%. The predicted reduction in area of seagrass habitat could be offset by an improvement in water clarity of 30%. Greater improvements in water clarity would be necessary for larger magnitudes of SLR. Management to improve water quality will provide present and future benefits to seagrasses under climate change and should be a priority for managers seeking to compensate for the effects of global change on these valuable habitats.

Seasonal spectral variation of Zostera noltii and its influence on pigment-based Vegetation Indices	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												The influence of phenological variations on the reflectance of the intertidal marine angiosperm Zostera noltii was studied using spectroradiometry and pigment analysis. Leaves were sampled each month from March to November and spectral reflectance was measured in the 400-900 nm wavelength range in the laboratory for increasing biomass. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was used to assess the pigment composition and concentration of the leaves and their epiphytes. Several vegetation indices (VIs) were tested for their sensitivity to seasonal variations, from NDVI-like ratios to indices based on derivative analysis. Pigment concentration showed a seasonal effect, with the highest concentrations observed in summer, synchronous with the above-ground biomass peak. The seasonal variations were clearly visible in the leaf reflectance spectrum, showing for the same amount of vegetation, lower reflectance in summer for the visible wavelengths and a higher near-infrared (NIR) plateau compared to the other months. Indices based on the difference between the red and NIR reflectance values, typically all the NDVI-like ratios, were the most sensitive to seasonal variations in pigment concentration. In fact, seasonal effects were systematically reduced for VIs including a blue band correction, namely the modified Specific Ratio (mSR((705))), the modified Normalized Difference (mND((705))), the modified NDVIs for Landsat FORMOSAT and narrow band NDVI (mNDVI((673))) as well as the Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI). However, these indices showed a faster saturation for increasing seagrass biomass, except for the mSR((705)), which was the least sensitive to biomass saturation. The interesting properties of this index suggest that it should now be tested for airborne or satellite remote sensing mapping of Z. noltii beds but it requires a high spectral resolution and cannot be applied to multispectral satellite images.

The large number of people who live close to the coast and rely directly on marine resources for food and income paradoxically increases the value of, but also the threats to, these ecosystems. A key strategy of the Coral Triangle Initiative is to protect shallow coastal ecosystems through the design and implementation of resilient networks of marine protected areas (MPAs). This strategy requires accurate spatial data on the distribution and extent of coastal habitats (coral reef, seagrass and mangrove) at scales which match conservation planning decisions. In the Coral Triangle, seagrass distribution maps are not readily available at ecoregional scales. The Lesser Sunda ecoregion, extending from Bali, Indonesia to Timor-Leste, is one of 11 ecoregions of the Coral Triangle and a high priority for conservation and sustainable management of marine resources. To support the design of a resilient MPA network for the Lesser Sunda ecoregion, a seagrass distribution map was generated based on Landsat imagery, literature review and groundtruth data. Seagrass beds were estimated to cover an area of 273 km(2) at an overall accuracy of 78%. Use of the seagrass distribution map in the MPA design improved the habitat representation and connectivity - key criteria for resilient MPA design. The final MPA design included 80 km(2) of seagrass beds, with more than half the beds adjacent to coral reefs and mangroves. This study demonstrates the effective use of Landsat imagery and remote sensing techniques to derive ecoregional scale seagrass maps supporting MPA network design. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this context, taking into account the recent advances in the fields of high-resolution (HR) satellite/airborne remote-sensing and genetics laboratory analysis techniques, we propose this integrated methodology for monitoring changes in transplanted meadows in regard to perspective to provide support in the assessment of the entire local PO and seagrass population dynamic. According to specific information requirements in terms of radiometric and spectral/spatial resolution, the multispectral data currently available from the QuickBird polar satellite's four-band (red, green, and blue visible and near-infrared) HR sensor were exploited for methodology implementation using a practical image-based' approach to account for atmospheric and water column turbidity typical of this mid-coastal Mediterranean region. First, the extents and types of seagrass cover were suitably mapped, and then also the distributions of specific vegetation parameters related to PO dynamics and health were assessed by exploiting the remotely sensed satellite-derived radiance signals and point sea-truth calibration measurements of the bio-genetic parameters. In particular, we implemented maps of leaf area index, genetic similarity, and density Giraud indices corresponding to distributions of PO patches using multivariate and data-mining models (artificial neural network) based on appropriately preprocessed radiometric and auxiliary (bathymetry) input variables.

If remote sensing methods have been applied with reasonable success in terrestrial environment, their use in aquatic ecosystems still remained challenging. In the present study we combined hyperspectral remote sensing and boosted regression tree modelling (BTR), an ensemble method for statistical techniques and machine learning, in order to test their applicability in predicting macrophyte and invertebrate species cover in the optically complex seawater of the Baltic Sea. The BRT technique combined with remote sensing and traditional spatial modelling succeeded in identifying, constructing and testing functionality of abiotic environmental predictors on the coverage of benthic macrophyte and invertebrate species. Our models easily predicted a large quantity of macrophyte and invertebrate species cover and recaptured multitude of interactions between environment and biota indicating a strong potential of the method in the modelling of aquatic species in the large variety of ecosystems.

Even small natural or anthropogenic disturbances can cause severe changes in the distributional pattern of seagrass meadows. Satellite imageries provide a suitable means to detect and assess such changes in space and time in remote and inaccessible areas. Present study aims to understand the distribution pattern of seagrasses after the Indian Ocean Tsunami in 2004 with the help of Indian Remote Sensing satellite data and in situ ground surveys with hand held GPS. As no geospatial data bases were available for the pre-tsunami period, the changes in seagrass cover were compared with the ground estimates available in the literature and also using pre-tsunami satellite data sets. The study found severe loss of seagrasses in the northern Andaman particularly in the Interview and North reef islands and in the Nicobar group of islands including Great Nicobar and Trinket islands. The investigation revealed the presence of 2,943.38 ha of seagrass covering the entire Andaman and Nicobar islands, and that 1,619.41 ha of seagrasses had been denuded during this period. The earthquake and subsequent tsunami in 2004 was the major reason for the loss of seagrasses in these islands. The seagrass spatial map generated in the present study can be used for the development of conservation and management plans and also to restore the denuded seagrasses of this region.																	1738-5261	2005-7172				JUN	2013	48	2					173	181		10.1007/s12601-013-0014-1								WOS:000335400200003						
J	Lee, ZP; Weidemann, A; Arnone, R				Lee, Zhongping; Weidemann, Alan; Arnone, Robert			Combined Effect of Reduced Band Number and Increased Bandwidth on Shallow Water Remote Sensing: The Case of WorldView 2	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												WorldView 2 (WV2), launched in September 2009, is a satellite with hyperspatial resolution (similar to 0.5-2 m) capability for Earth surface observation. It has eight spectral bands with enhanced signal-to-noise ratio to cover the visible-to-near-infrared (V-NIR) domain, thus providing a great potential for remote sensing of coastal ecosystem, in particular, the aquatic environments with shallow bottoms (e. g., coral reefs and seagrass beds). Traditionally, it requires similar to 15 spectral bands in the V-NIR domain for reliable analytical retrieval of bottom properties (e. g., bathymetry) from remotely observed radiance spectrum. Data from WV2, however, have eight bands, and the width of each band is quite wide (similar to 50 nm or more). Thus, the spectral configuration of WV2 is far from optimal for spectral remote sensing of various complex shallow environments, and it is important and necessary to know how such a band setting affects the reliability of remote-sensing retrievals. Here, we applied a hyperspectral optimization scheme [hyperspectral optimization processing exemplar (HOPE)] to a simulated shallow-bottom data set (sandy bottom) and compared retrievals from both hyperspectral and WV2 spectral settings. Retrieved results suggest that, for bottom contribution making up 40% or more of the measured signal, the depths derived from both hyperspectral and WV2 settings are generally consistent for waters shallower than 5 m. However, depths derived with WV2 setting have greater uncertainty and, in general, are shallower than those derived from the hyperspectral setting, particularly for waters deeper than 10 m. Options to produce higher confident properties from such band settings are discussed.																	0196-2892					MAY	2013	51	5	1				2577	2586		10.1109/TGRS.2012.2218818								WOS:000318428700008

Identifying the affected marine areas and the scale of influence on ecosystems is critical to assess the impacts of degraded water quality and to inform planning for catchment management and marine conservation. Studies using remotely-sensed data have contributed to our understanding of the occurrence and influence of river plumes, and to our ability to assess exposure of marine ecosystems to land-based pollutants. However, refinement of plume modeling techniques is required to improve risk assessments. We developed a novel, complementary, approach to model exposure of coastal-marine ecosystems to land-based pollutants. We used supervised classification of MODIS-Aqua true-color satellite imagery to map the extent of plumes and to qualitatively assess the dispersal of pollutants in plumes. We used the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), the world's largest coral reef system, to test our approach. We combined frequency of plume occurrence with spatially distributed loads (based on a cost-distance function) to create maps of exposure to suspended sediment and dissolved inorganic nitrogen. We then compared annual exposure maps (2007-2011) to assess inter-annual variability in the exposure of coral reefs and seagrass beds to these pollutants. We found this method useful to map plumes and qualitatively assess exposure to land-based pollutants. We observed inter-annual variation in exposure of ecosystems to pollutants in the GBR, stressing the need to incorporate a temporal component into plume exposure/risk models. Our study contributes to our understanding of plume spatial-temporal dynamics of the GBR and offers a method that can also be applied to monitor exposure of coastal-marine ecosystems to plumes and explore their ecological influences.

Towards understanding temporal and spatial dynamics of seagrass landscapes using time-series remote sensing	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The spatial and temporal dynamics of seagrasses have been well studied at the leaf to patch scales, however, the link to large spatial extent landscape and population dynamics is still unresolved in seagrass ecology. Traditional remote sensing approaches have lacked the temporal resolution and consistency to appropriately address this issue. This study uses two high temporal resolution time-series of thematic seagrass cover maps to examine the spatial and temporal dynamics of seagrass at both an inter- and intra-annual time scales, one of the first globally to do so at this scale. Previous work by the authors developed an object-based approach to map seagrass cover level distribution from a long term archive of Landsat TM and ETM+ images on the Eastern Banks (approximate to 200 km(2)), Moreton Bay, Australia. In this work a range of trend and time-series analysis methods are demonstrated for a time-series of 23 annual maps from 1988 to 2010 and a time-series of 16 monthly maps during 2008-2010. Significant new insight was presented regarding the inter- and intra-annual dynamics of seagrass persistence over time, seagrass cover level variability, seagrass cover level trajectory, and change in area of seagrass and cover levels over time. Overall we found that there was no significant decline in total seagrass area on the Eastern Banks, but there was a significant decline in seagrass cover level condition. A case study of two smaller communities within the Eastern Banks that experienced a decline in both overall seagrass area and condition are examined in detail, highlighting possible differences in environmental and process drivers. We demonstrate how trend and time-series analysis enabled seagrass distribution to be appropriately assessed in context of its spatial and temporal history and provides the ability to not only quantify change, but also describe the type of change. We also demonstrate the potential use of time-series analysis products to investigate seagrass growth and decline as well as the processes that drive it. This study demonstrates clear benefits over traditional seagrass mapping and monitoring approaches, and provides a proof of concept for the use of trend and time-series analysis of remotely sensed seagrass products to benefit current endeavours in seagrass ecology.

Assessment of the hyperspectral sensor CASI-2 for macroalgal discrimination on the Ria de Vigo coast (NW Spain) using field spectroscopy and modelled spectral libraries	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Hyperspectral remote sensing from aircraft and satellite sensors is an important tool for mapping shallow benthic habitats in areas where high spectral and spatial resolutions are needed e.g. spatially heterogeneous coastal environments. However, the acquisition of hyperspectral images sometimes involves a high economic investment and there is no prior guarantee of their utility. Physics-based methods like bio-optical models are an alternative to assess sensors without purchasing the images. In this study we used a simple bio-optical model that simulates reflectance spectra for waters with variable depth and benthic macroalgal cover. The modelled spectral library was used to assess the capability of CASI-2 sensor to recognise different benthic macroalgal species. Reflectance spectra of 17 macroalgal species were used in the model simulations. Uni- and multi-variate statistical analyses were used to evaluate the spectral differences between several species. The results show that only a few species seem to be clearly differentiable: Codium tomentosum, Laminaria saccharina and Corallina officinalis. Therefore, further bio-optical modelling was applied at the level of taxonomic groups rather than species level. Emerged green, brown and red macroalgae as well as sand can be differentiated from each other when using the CASI-2 sensor. The bio-optical simulations showed that the three macroalgal groups can be separated from each other in waters shallower than 4 m when CASI-2 is used. Green and brown macroalgae can be differentiated from deep water if the water depth does not exceed 6 m whereas red macroalgae can be optically separated from deep water when the water depth is less than 5 m. Sea-beds covered with the three macroalgal groups are separable from sandy sea-beds in waters shallower than 10 m. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Possible Return of Acropora cervicornis at Pulaski Shoal, Dry Tortugas National Park, Florida	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Lidz, B.H. and Zawada, D.G., 2013. Possible return of Acropora cervicornis at Pulaski Shoal, Dry Tortugas National Park, Florida. Journal of Coastal Research, 29(2), 256-271. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Seabed classification is essential to assessing environmental associations and physical status in coral reef ecosystems. At Pulaski Shoal in Dry Tortugas National Park, Florida, nearly continuous underwater-image coverage was acquired in 15.5 hours in 2009 along 70.2 km of transect lines spanning similar to 0.2 km(2). The Along-Track Reef-Imaging System (ATRIS), a boat-based, high-speed, digital imaging system, was used. ATRIS-derived benthic classes were merged with a QuickBird satellite image to create a habitat map that defines areas of senile coral reef, carbonate sand, seagrasses, and coral rubble. This atypical approach of starting with extensive, high-resolution in situ imagery and extrapolating between transect lines using satellite imagery leverages the strengths of each remote-sensing modality. The ATRIS images also captured the spatial distribution of two species once common on now-degraded Florida Caribbean coral reefs: the stony staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis, a designated threatened species, and the long-spined urchin Diadema antillarum. This article documents the utility of ATRIS imagery for quantifying number and estimating age of A. cervicornis colonies (n = 400, age range, 5-11 y) since the severe hypothermic die-off in the Dry Tortugas in 1976-77. This study is also the first to document the largest number of new colonies of A. cervicornis tabulated in an area of the park where coral-monitoring stations maintained by the Fish and Wildlife Research Institute have not been established. The elevated numbers provide an updated baseline for tracking revival of this species at Pulaski Shoal.																	0749-0208					MAR	2013	29	2					256	271		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12-00078.1								WOS:000316162400002

To better assess the submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) habitat of coastal Pinellas County, Florida, USA, using Hyperion images, two operational image optimization algorithms, vertical radiance correction (VRadCor) for destripe and spectral recognition spatial smooth hyperspectral filter (SRSSHF) for denoise, were modified for use in the shallow coastal waters and then compared to other methods. The VRadCor compresses the cross-track radiance abnormity addressing both the along-track cambering effect with low frequency and the stripe effect with high frequency by estimating both the additive and the multiplicative correction factors. The experimental results show that VRadCor more effectively removes stripes from Hyperion images in comparison to other traditional algorithms. Application of SRSSHF, a special adaptive filter model that compresses the noise by using both spectral and spatial features, was effective for denoising for inner patch areas while retaining (or enhancing) subtle edges between different patches. The use of VRadCor and SRSSHF significantly improves the quality of images of coastal waters while retaining the spectral features of water/SAV. The optimization of the images may lead to improved feature classification or increased accuracy for parameter extraction.																	0196-2892					FEB	2013	51	2					1025	1036		10.1109/TGRS.2012.2205262								WOS:000314019500024

Overview of hyperspectral remote sensing for mapping marine benthic habitats from airborne and underwater sensors	IMAGING SPECTROMETRY XVIII	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Imaging Spectrometry XVIII	AUG 26-27, 2013	San Diego, CA	SPIE				The seafloor, with its diverse and dynamic benthic habitats varying on meter to centimeter scales, is difficult to accurately monitor with traditional techniques. The technology used to build imaging spectrometers has rapidly advanced in recent years with the advent of smaller sensors and better signal-to-noise capabilities that has facilitated their use in mapping fine-scale benthic features. Here, the use of such sensors for hyperspectral remote sensing of the seafloor from both airborne and underwater platforms is discussed. Benthic constituents provide a so-called optical fingerprint with spectral properties that are often too subtle to be discerned with simple color photographs or multi-channel spectrometers. Applications include the recent field validation of the airborne Portable Remote Imaging SpectroMeter (PRISM), a new imaging sensor package optimized for coastal ocean processes in Elkorn Slough California. In these turbid sediment-laden waters, only subtle spectral differences differentiate seafloor with sediment from that with eelgrass. The ultimate goal is to provide robust radiometric approaches that accurately consider light attenuation by the water column and are able to be applied to diverse habitats without considerable foreknowledge.																	0277-786X		978-0-8194-9720-8				2013	8870								88700L	10.1117/12.2026529								WOS:000326705200017

Here, we develop and validate modeling and sampling methodology for detecting and characterizing seagrass beds by analyzing GPS telemetry records from radio-tagged manatees. Between October 2002 and October 2005, 14 manatees were tracked in the Ten Thousand Islands (TTI) in southwest Florida (USA) using Global Positioning System (GPS) tags. High density manatee use areas were found to occur off each island facing the open, nearshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico. We implemented a spatially stratified random sampling plan and used a camera-based sampling technique to observe and record bottom observations of seagrass and macroalgae presence and abundance. Five species of seagrass were identified in our study area: Halodule wrightii, Thalassia testudinum, Syringodium filiforme, Halophila engelmannii, and Halophila decipiens. A Bayesian model was developed to choose and parameterize a spatial process function that would describe the observed patterns of seagrass and macroalgae. The seagrasses were found in depths <2 m and in the higher manatee use strata, whereas macroalgae was found at moderate densities at all sampled depths and manatee use strata. The manatee spatial data showed a strong association with seagrass beds, a relationship that increased seagrass sampling efficiency. Our camera-based field sampling proved to be effective for assessing seagrass density and spatial coverage under turbid water conditions, and would be an effective monitoring tool to detect changes in seagrass beds.

Worldview-2 offers an increased number of spectral bands for high-resolution image, from the traditional 4bands to 8 bands. It boasts of the ability to enhance mapping and monitoring of benthic habitats with the addition of the Coastal Band. This was investigated in this research using a Worldview-2 image of Bolinao, Pangasinan acquired on March 2010. The study site, Bolinao, has the highest single concentration of seagrass in the northern part of the Philippines. To achieve more accurate results, geometric, atmospheric and water column corrections were applied to the images. For geometric correction, a Differential Global Positioning System Topcon Hiper Ga model receiver was used to obtain highly accurate ground control points. Atmospheric correction was performed in ENVI using the Fast Line-of-Sight Atmospheric Analysis (FLAASH) model. Three water column correction models were applied and compared in this research, Lyzenga's Optical Model, Stumpf's Ratio Model and Simple Radiative Transfer Model. A spectral library was created using in situ reflected spectral radiances on both submerged and emerged vegetation to aid in image classification. Different benthic covers, seagrass, sand, corals and rocks are significantly separable spectrally based on spectral signatures obtained on field using a USB 4000 Fiber Optic Spectrometer. Maximum likelihood supervised classification in ENVI 4.8 is utilized for mapping. Using Worldview 2's coastal, green, yellow and red bands and applying the Simple Radiative Transfer Model produced the highest overall accuracy (88.3%) among the classification results. Using the same bands, Stumpf's Ratio Model produced 87.84% overall accuracy while Lyzenga's optical model achieved 75.54%. Moran's I spatial autocorrelation was implemented to increase the classification accuracy. Using lag 1 slightly increased Stumpf's Model's overall accuracy, from 87.84% to 88.08% while using lags 5 and 10 decreased the overall accuracy with 83.91% and 84.25% respectively.																	2153-6996		978-1-4799-1114-1				2013							1579	1582		10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6723091								WOS:000345638901176

J	Pu, RL; Bell, S; Meyer, C; Baggett, L; Zhao, YC				Pu, Ruiliang; Bell, Susan; Meyer, Cynthia; Baggett, Lesley; Zhao, Yongchao			Mapping and assessing seagrass along the western coast of Florida using Landsat TM and EO-1 ALI/Hyperion imagery	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Seagrass habitats provide a variety of ecosystem functions thus monitoring of seagrass habitat is a priority of coastal management. Remote sensing techniques can provide spatial and temporal information about seagrass habitats. Given the availability and accessibility of Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and the advanced nature of Earth Observing-1 Advanced Land Imager (ALI) and Hyperion (HYP), we compared the capability of the three 30 m resolution satellite sensors and tested regression models based on two seagrass metrics [percent cover of submerged aquatic vegetation (%SAV) and leaf area index (LAI)] for mapping and assessing seagrass habitats within a shallow coastal area along the central western coast of FL, USA. We also evaluated a water depth correction approach to create water depth-invariant bands calculated from the three sensors' data. Then a maximum likelihood classifier was used to classify the %SAV cover into two classification schemes (3-class and 5-class). Based upon the two seagrass metrics measured in the field, six multiple regression models were developed and %SAV and LAI were estimated with spectral variables derived from the three sensors to assess the seagrass habitats in mapped units. Our results indicate that the HYP sensor produced the best seagrass cover maps in the two classification schemes: 3-class [overall accuracy (OA) = 95.9%] and 5-class (OA = 78.4%) and the best % SAV and LAI estimation models [R-2 = 0.78 and 0.59, and cross-validation (CV) = 18.1% and 1.40 for %SAV and LAI, respectively] for assessing seagrass habitats. These results are likely due to the many narrow bands in the visible spectral range and rich subtle spectral information available in the HYP hyperspectral data. ALI outperformed TM (OA = 94.6% vs. 92.5% for the 3-class scheme, and OA = 77.8% vs. 66.0% for the 5-class scheme) for mapping %SAV likely due to its higher radiometric resolution. Our findings also demonstrate that the water depth correction approach was effective in mapping the detailed seagrass habitats with the data from the three sensors.

Seagrass-Sediment Feedback: An Exploration Using a Non-recursive Structural Equation Model	ECOSYSTEMS												The reciprocal effects between sediment texture and seagrass density are assumed to play an important role in the dynamics and stability of intertidal-coastal ecosystems. However, this feedback relationship has been difficult to study empirically on an ecosystem scale, so that knowledge is mainly based on theoretical models and small-scale (experimental) studies. In this paper we apply a non-recursive structural equation model (SEM) to empirically investigate, at large spatial scale, the mutual dependence between seagrass (Zostera noltii) density and sediment texture, on the pristine, seagrass-dominated, intertidal mudflats of the Banc d'Arguin, Mauritania. The non-recursive SEM allows consistent estimation and testing of a direct feedback between sediment and seagrass whilst statistically controlling for the effects of nutrients and abiotic stress. The resulting model is consistent with the hypothesized negative feedback: grain size decreases with seagrass density, whereas fine grain size has a negative impact on seagrass density because it decreases pore water exchange which leads to hypoxic sediment conditions. Another finding is that seagrass density increases with sediment organic material content up to a threshold level beyond which it levels off. In combination with decreasing grain size, accumulation of organic matter creates hypoxic sediment conditions which lead to the production of toxic hydrogen sulfide which slows down seagrass growth. The negative feedback loop implies that intertidal Z. noltii modifies its own environment, thus controlling its growing conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate a direct negative feedback relationship in ecosystems by means of a non-recursive SEM.

Discrimination of seagrass species and cover classes with in situ hyperspectral data. Journal of Coastal Research, 28(6), 1330-1344. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Seagrass habitats support a variety of ecosystem functions and an increasing interest has emerged for utilizing remote sensing to acquire information on the spatial extent and abundance of seagrass vegetation. Here we report on hyperspectral data collected from a combined laboratory and field-based study to examine the spectral qualities of seagrass species and evaluate whether seagrass species and levels of seagrass cover could be distinguished using true in situ hyperspectral data collected by a spectrometer overlying sea-grass-dominated vegetation in a shallow water setting in the central west coast of Florida. We also analyzed hyperspectral data measured in the lab to compare with those from in situ collections. Using a set of 97 field measurements we compared spectra qualities for different seagrass species, levels of seagrass cover, water depths, and substrate types over wavelengths 400-800 nm, using spectral data preprocessing and data transformation. Optimal wavelengths for identifying seagrass species and levels of seagrass cover were determined by two-sample t-tests. We also utilized principal component analysis (PCA) on spectra to evaluate if a set of first five PCs could be used to discriminate effectively among seagrass species and levels of seagrass cover. The experimental results indicate that the best accuracies for identifying species were produced with the data set of the second -derivative normalized spectra. The optimal wavelengths were 450, 500, 520, 550, 600, 620, 680, and 700 nm, most of which are related to the peaks of reflectance and absorption bands by photosynthetic and accessory pigments. A set of five optimal bands produced higher accuracies for identifying seagrass species (overall accuracy = 73% and average accuracy = 75%) compared with those from use of PCA. Data preprocessing techniques were demonstrated to be effective for improving discriminant accuracies of species and levels of seagrass cover.																	0749-0208					NOV	2012	28	6					1330	1344		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-11-00229.1								WOS:000311873100002						
J	Houser, C				Houser, Chris			Feedback between ridge and swale bathymetry and barrier island storm response and transgression	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The shoreface of Santa Rosa Island in northwest Florida is characterized by a ridge and swale bathymetry that forces an alongshore variation in beach and dune morphology. The alongshore variation in dune morphology in turn controls the modern island response to and recovery from tropical storms and hurricanes, and is therefore, an important control on island transgression with relative sea-level rise. Field sampling and remote sensing are used in the present study to describe the geologic framework of Santa Rosa Island, and to elucidate on the origins of the shore-attached ridge and swale bathymetry. Vibracores and seismic and GPR surveys were completed along 42 cross-shore transects and 3 shore-parallel transects to examine the structure of the 21 ridge and swale structures found along Santa Rosa Island. The shore-parallel seismic surveys reveal strong near-horizontal reflectors through the ridges at depths consistent with thick back-barrier muds extracted from vibracores taken across and along the ridges. Near-horizontal reflectors are identified in ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveys between the ridges and cuspate spits along the back-barrier shoreline, but are not present in the narrow sections of the island landward of the swales. Continuation of the seismic surveys in the back-barrier also reveals near-horizontal reflectors at the cuspate spits that are characterized by seagrass beds, salt marsh and maritime forest. Consistent with the GPR survey, there is an absence of horizontal reflectors between cuspate spits where the washover deposits extend to the back-barrier shoreline. It is argued that the ridge and swale bathymetry is a transgressive surface and the remnants of cuspate spits that are present along the back-barrier shoreline. In this respect, the cuspate spits had to first develop along the back-barrier shoreline and eventually evolve into the mud-cored ridges as the island transgressed with relative sea-level rise. Once the ridge and swale bathymetry emerged on the Gulf of Mexico shoreface it was able to reinforce the alongshore variation in dune height and storm response. It is further argued that the cuspate spits are reinforced by the shoreface ridges through alongshore transport of sediment from adjacent washover fans although the ridge orientation suggests that the spits have migrated westward by similar to 750 m. In this respect, the alongshore variation in beach and dune morphology on this island is the expression of this large-scale feedback and suggests a top-down model in which meso-scale processes and landforms depend on the geologic context.

This study aimed to assess the change in benthic cover as influenced by terrestrial loadings from the 14 adjoining agriculturally dominated (especially sugarcane) coastal watersheds using remote sensing, a geographic information system (GIS), and a physically based, distributed hydrological model. An integrated modeling framework with land-use change was constructed to simulate the runoff, sediment yield, and nutrient discharge using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The impact of terrestrial discharge on the coastal ecosystem was investigated by spatio-temporal analysis (1992-2007) of the benthic cover using Landsat TM/ETM+ data. Due to the cropland expansion, a significant amount of surface runoff and sediment and nutrient discharge was generated during 1992-2007 from the steeply sloping watersheds. The hydrological response results from areas with different land-use conditions (1992-2007) revealed that the conversion of forestland (7.88%) and shrubland (7.59%) into agricultural (10.04%) and barren land (3.06%) had the greatest impact on the potential risk of surface runoff. To understand the discharge behavior of the watersheds and its impact on coastal ecosystems, we examined three hydrological response assessment indices, namely, the annual average, wet season average, and monthly maximum index. A change in the benthic community composition was observed as an increase in algae (139.3%), sea grass (70.6%), and degraded reef area (59.39%) around these coastal watersheds due to the increased sediments and nutrients, mainly from the sugarcane fields.																	0749-0208					SEP	2012	28	5					1225	1235		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-11-00149.1								WOS:000308774400023

Estimation of the Aerial Cover of Seagrasses of Lakshadweep Islands (India) Using Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS P6 LISS IV)	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Seagrasses ecosystems are fragile yet highly productive ecosystems of the world showing declining trend throughout the world due to natural and anthropogenic pressures. Effective conservation and management plan is thus required to protect these resources, to aid with conservation need mapping and monitoring of seagrasses using high resolution remote sensing data is very much required. Hence, the present study was made to record the seagrass aerial cover in the Lakshadweep islands using IRS P6 LISS IV satellite data. The suitability of LISS IV sensor for seagrass mapping was tested for the first time with an overall accuracy of 73.16%. The study found an area of 2590.2 ha of seagrasses in Lakshadweep islands with 1310.8 ha and 1279.4 ha dense and sparse seagrass cover respectively. The study recommends the use of LISS IV data for mapping the shallow water seagrasses, as mapping efficiency increases nearly 4 times more than the LISS III data, as the former (LISS IV) picks up the small patches of seagrasses and delineates the coral and reef vegetation patches from seagrass class.																	0255-660X					SEP	2012	40	3					467	481		10.1007/s12524-011-0179-y								WOS:000305983300012

Long term land cover and seagrass mapping using Landsat and object-based image analysis from 1972 to 2010 in the coastal environment of South East Queensland, Australia	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Long term global archives of high-moderate spatial resolution, multi-spectral satellite imagery are now readily accessible, but are not being fully utilised by management agencies due to the lack of appropriate methods to consistently produce accurate and timely management ready information. This work developed an object-based remote sensing approach to map land cover and seagrass distribution in an Australian coastal environment for a 38 year Landsat image time-series archive (1972-2010). Landsat Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) imagery were used without in situ field data input (but still using field knowledge) to produce land and seagrass cover maps every year data were available, resulting in over 60 map products over the 38 year archive. Land cover was mapped annually using vegetation, bare ground, urban and agricultural classes. Seagrass distribution was also mapped annually, and in some years monthly, via horizontal projected foliage cover classes, sand and deep water. Land cover products were validated using aerial photography and seagrass maps were validated with field survey data, producing several measures of accuracy. An average overall accuracy of 65% and 80% was reported for seagrass and land cover products respectively, which is consistent with other studies in the area. This study is the first to show moderate spatial resolution, long term annual changes in land cover and seagrass in an Australian environment, created without the use of in situ data; and only one of a few similar studies globally. The land cover products identify several long term trends; such as significant increases in South East Queensland's urban density and extent, vegetation clearing in rural and rural-residential areas, and inter-annual variation in dry vegetation types in western South East Queensland. The seagrass cover products show that there has been a minimal overall change in seagrass extent, but that seagrass cover level distribution is extremely dynamic; evidenced by large scale migrations of higher seagrass cover levels and several sudden and significant changes in cover level. These mapping products will allow management agencies to build a baseline assessment of their resources, understand past changes and help inform implementation and planning of management policy to address potential future changes.

Evidence for the southward migration of mud banks in Florida Bay	MARINE GEOLOGY												The latticework of shallow polygonal mud banks encircling deeper ponds is a key morphological characteristic of Florida Bay. Composed of lime mud produced largely by calcareous algae and epibionts, these banks limit water exchange between the interior Bay and ocean waters from both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic. They also influence salinity and benthic habitat distribution. It has been proposed that the position of mud banks may be dynamic, migrating southwards with time, but no long-term study has examined the spatial arrangement of banks within Florida Bay over sufficiently long timescales to ascertain movement. Using time-separated bathymetry surveys and aerial photography datasets spanning a period of many decades, this study establishes that indeed the bank positions are temporally dynamic. The work was conducted using geographic information systems (GIS), with all data referenced to the position of relatively stable islands. The analysis reveals a southward migration trend (headings ranging from 280 degrees to 240 degrees) with rates averaging 1.27 m/year. For the first time in Florida Bay, the migration and vector of movement for mud banks have been documented. Despite the southward movement, mud bank morphology remained consistent. It is speculated that strong winter winds out of the north/northeast provide the mechanism for such migration. The southward migration of fine-grained, biogenic mud banks in Florida Bay demonstrates how change-detection remote sensing can be used to audit a geological process operating at time-scales of centuries. Though the available data may be unusually rich for Florida Bay, the study shows how the dynamics of other coastal systems may be accessed using a comparable work-flow. Similarly, the results here have implications for the geologic record and reevaluating paleo-landscapes where mudrock shoals have been identified. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Spectral response of the seagrass Zostera noltii with different sediment backgrounds	AQUATIC BOTANY												The efficiency of vegetation indices (VIs) to estimate the above-ground biomass of the seagrass species Zostera noltii Hornem. from remote sensing was tested experimentally on different substrata, since terrestrial vegetation studies have shown that VIs can be adversely influenced by the spectral properties of soils and background surfaces. Leaves placed on medium sand, fine sand and autoclaved fine sand were incrementally removed, and the spectral reflectance was measured in the 400-900 nm wavelength range. Several VIs were evaluated: ratios using visible and near infrared wavelengths, narrow-band indices, indices based on derivative analysis and continuum removal. Background spectral reflectance was clearly visible in the leaf reflectance spectra, showing marked brightness and spectral contrast variations for the same amount of vegetation. Paradoxically, indices used to minimize soil effects, such as the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and the Modified second Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI(2)) showed a high sensitivity to background effects. Similar results were found for the widely used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and for Pigment Specific Simple Ratios (PSSRs). In fact, background effects were most reduced for VIs integrating a blue band correction, namely the modified specific ratio (mSR((705))), the modified Normalized Difference (mND((705))). and two modified NDVIs proposed in this study. However, these indices showed a faster saturation for high seagrass biomass. The background effects were also substantially reduced using Modified Gaussian Model indices at 620 and 675 nm. The blue band corrected VIs should now be tested for air-borne or satellite remote sensing applications, but some require sensors with a hyperspectral resolution. Nevertheless, this type of index can be applied to analyse broad band multispectral satellite images with a blue band. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

IRS ID and IRS P6 LISS III having spatial resolution of 23.5 m with lower cost compared to all other contemporary satellites with the same spatial resolution have not been widely used for monitoring the changes in seagrass cover. In this context, the present study attempted to explore the effectiveness of LISS III data for mapping seagrasses and to inform the international community about the usefulness of these low-cost imageries for coastal resource monitoring. Supervised classification and change detection studies found a significant decrease in seagrass cover of 73.03 ha in the Lakshadweep group of islands. An overall accuracy of 67.5% was obtained for the change maps, and seagrass cover and its changes vary at different islands.																	1010-6049						2012	27	8					647	660		10.1080/10106049.2012.665501								WOS:000314596800004

Hanging basket oyster farming: assessing effects on seagrass using aerial photography	AQUACULTURE ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS												Hanging baskets are rapidly being adopted in many parts of the world to grow shellfish, especially oysters. The adoption of this method is opening up new areas for aquaculture development. However, expansion into areas that have previously been unusable has been controversial, due to concerns about farms being established in areas with particularly high ecological values and sensitivity. This study investigated the impact of establishing a hanging basket oyster farm in the Kaipara Harbour in northern New Zealand on seagrass. Aerial photographs were analysed with a geographical imaging software in combination with field sampling to detect potential impacts. The hanging basket oyster farm technology was found to have no significant overall impact on seagrass beneath the farm. However, field sampling found a narrow band directly beneath the oyster farm growout lines of less than 5% of the farm area that had lower seagrass densities and abundance compared to adjacent control zones sampled within the farm. This area was obscured in aerial photographs by farm structures. This highly localised impact is likely due to shading or scour caused by farm structures. Overall, the results indicate that hanging basket technology for shellfish aquaculture has minimal environmental impact on underlying seagrass, representing an improvement over traditional culture technologies. Furthermore, the results confirm that remote sensing methods are useful tools for examining aquaculture impacts on seagrass communities, but only when combined with field sampling.

However, a collection of sightings at Aldabra Atoll, a World Heritage Site in the Seychelles, has renewed interest in dugong distribution in the western Indian Ocean. This article consolidates the records of dugong sightings held in the Aldabra Research Station library and explores their spatial patterning. The locations of sightings (2001-2009) are plotted onto a high-resolution benthic habitat map of the Aldabra lagoon created by classifying a QuickBird satellite remote-sensing image in January 2009. A spatial cluster detection procedure is applied to point records of sightings to reveal a statistically significant cluster of sightings in the north-west of the lagoon, at Bras Monsieur Clairemont, suggesting a mutual co-existence of dugongs and seagrass beds. A habitat suitability model combines the point data set of dugong sightings within the continuous benthic habitat map and identifies the central western area as containing the most suitable habitat for dugong inside the Aldabra lagoon.

Here we present a spatially explicit prediction for coral reef fish diversity index, as well as habitat classification according to reef fish diversity index values in Chinchorro Bank Biosphere Reserve, one of the most important plain/atoll type reef systems in the Caribbean. We have used extensive ecological data on depth, fish and habitat characteristics to perform such prediction. Fish species assemblages and different biotic variables of benthic organisms were characterized using visual censuses and video-transects, respectively at 119 sampling stations. The information was integrated in a GIS, along with satellite imagery (LANSDAT 7 ETM+) and a digital bathymetric model. From the recorded data and a hierarchical classification procedure, we obtained nine different classes of habitats. We used a generalized regression analysis and spatial prediction methodology to create predictive maps (GIS layers) of the different reef benthic components, and a second modeling run produced predictive maps of coral reef fish diversity index. Predictive accuracy of the diversity index map presented a good correlation coefficient (r = 0.87), with maximum diversity index values en reefscapes composed of aggregation of coral colonies with seagrass beds. The implementation of our application was successful for the prediction of fish diversity hot spots and surrogate habitats.

The temporal availability of the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery provided a suitable option to detect and assess damage of the submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV). This study examined Landsat TM imagery classification techniques to create two-class (SAV presence/absence) and three-class (SAV estimated coverage) SAV maps of the seagrass resource. The Mahalanobis Distance method achieved the highest overall accuracy (86%) and validation accuracy (68%) for delineating the seagrass resource (two-class SAV map). The Maximum Likelihood method achieved the highest overall accuracy (74%) and validation accuracy (70%) for delineating the seagrass resource three-class SAV map. The Landsat 5 TM imagery classification provided a seagrass resource map product with similar accuracy to the aerial photointerpretation maps (validation accuracy 71%). The results support the application of remote sensing methods to analyze the spatial extent of the seagrass resource.																	0167-6369					JAN	2012	184	2					1131	1143		10.1007/s10661-011-2028-4								WOS:000298505400037	21487716

The use of remote sensing and linear wave theory to model local wave energy around Alphonse Atoll, Seychelles	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												This paper demonstrates a practical step-wise method for modelling wave energy at the landscape scale using GIS and remote sensing techniques at Alphonse Atoll, Seychelles. Inputs are a map of the benthic surface (seabed) cover, a detailed bathymetric model derived from remotely sensed Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) data and information on regional wave heights. Incident energy at the reef crest around the atoll perimeter is calculated as a function of its deepwater value with wave parameters (significant wave height and period) hindcast in the offshore zone using the WaveWatch III application developed by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. Energy modifications are calculated at constant intervals as waves transform over the forereef platform along a series of reef profile transects running into the atoll centre. Factors for shoaling, refraction and frictional attenuation are calculated at each interval for given changes in bathymetry and benthic coverage type and a nominal reduction in absolute energy is incorporated at the reef crest to account for wave breaking. Overall energy estimates are derived for a period of 5 years and related to spatial patterning of reef flat surface cover (sand and seagrass patches). (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Shallow water substrate mapping using hyperspectral remote sensing	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												During April 2004 the airborne hyperspectral sensor, HyMap, collected data over a shallow coastal region of Western Australia. These data were processed by inversion of a semi-analytical shallow water optical model to classify the substrate. Inputs to the optical model include water column constituent specific inherent optical properties (SIOPs), view and illumination geometry, surface condition (based on wind speed) and normalised reflectance spectra of substrate types. A sub-scene of the HyMap data covering approximately 4 km(2) was processed such that each 3 x 3 m(2) pixel was classed as sand, seagrass, brown algae or various mixtures of these three components. Coincident video data were collected and used to estimate substrate types. We present comparisons of the habitat classifications determined by these two methods and show that the percentage validation of the remotely sensed habitat map may be optimised by selection of appropriate optical model parameters. The optical model was able to retrieve classes for approximately 80% of all pixels in the scene, with validation percentages of approximately 50% for sand and seagrass classification, and 90% for brown algae classification. The semi-analytical model inversion approach to classification can be expected to be applied to any shallow water region where substrate reflectance spectra and SIOPs are known or can be inferred.

J	Andrade, F; Ferreira, MA				Andrade, Francisco; Ferreira, Maria Adelaide			A method for monitoring shallow seagrass meadows (Zostera spp.) using terrestrial oblique large-scale photography	AQUATIC BOTANY												Different monitoring methodologies are available to quantify the spatial distribution of seagrass beds, but repeated coverage over short time intervals is usually expensive or impossible. Sampling resolution is also a limiting factor, due to costs and manpower. We propose a low-cost alternative that allows for the free definition of sampling frequency and resolution. Since January 2006, a shallow seagrass meadow (Zostera spp.) (Sado estuary, Portugal), has been monitored using true color large-scale oblique terrestrial photographs taken monthly during low-water spring tides, from a fixed elevated point. To rectify the images and create an orthogonal view, a set of ground control points (GCPs) were taken in and around the meadow, each coupled with a photograph. The photo-coordinates of each GCP were matched to its geographic coordinates, and a 2nd degree polynomial adjustment was used, to rectify every subsequent monthly photograph (RMS error of 0.7 m and final resolution of 0.5 m). An unsupervised classification was performed on the rectified images to map and quantify the meadow area. The meadow showed a seasonal cycle typical of temperate areas, in response to the annual cycle of solar radiation, with maximum coverage (similar to 1 ha) in late summer/early fall, and minimum areas (similar to 0.5 ha) in late winter/early spring. A marked shift in the meadow distribution was also found, with similar to 25% average annual change (Index of relative change) and similar to 43% change over the 4-year period studied. These results suggest that the method performed consistently, over time and over a range of varying environmental conditions, its main limitation being the need for an elevated point overlooking the area of interest. Whenever elevated viewpoints exist overlooking seagrass meadows or other intertidal or shallow subtidal coastal habitats, this methodology, may constitute a viable and economically advantageous alternative to other more costly approaches, e.g. aerial photography.

Detection of seagrass in optical shallow water with Quickbird in the Xincun Bay, Hainan province, China	IET IMAGE PROCESSING												Different substrate types, such as seagrass, sand, stone and silt, can be identified by detecting substrate reflectivity. In this study, high-resolution remote sensing data of Quickbird were used to map seagrass distribution in the northeast coast of the Xincun Bay. Radiance transfer model in optical shallow water was used to retrieve bottom reflectivity; relationship between hyperspectral band and leaf area index (LAI) was used for processing satellite remote sensing data to retrieve distribution and density of submerged seagrass. Hyperspectral results showed that spectral bands at 550, 650 and 675 nm were sensitive to LAI. Based on the relationship between LAI and hyperspectral bands, Bands 2 and 3 of Quickbird could be used for retrieving seagrass distribution. Satellite results showed that seagrass was mainly distributed in clusters in the northeast coast of the Xincun Bay, tens of metres away from the bank. Density gradient was very clear, with coverage between 40 and 60% occupied by a great part of seagrass bed and with coverage greater than 80% distributed in stripe pattern in the main seagrass bed. The accuracy of seagrass retrieval was more than 80%, and the density of seagrass could also be distinguished evidently.																	1751-9659					AUG	2011	5	5					363	368		10.1049/iet-ipr.2009.0392								WOS:000292960800003

In order to improve the accuracy of coastal ocean monitoring where optical properties are complex, optical property of shallow water at Sanya Bay and the suitable water column correction algorithms were studies in the present paper. The authors extracted the bottom reflectance without water column effects by using a water column correction algorithm which is based on the simulation of the underwater light field in idealized water. And we compared the results which were calculated by the model and Christian's model respectively. Based on a detailed analysis, we concluded that; Because the optical properties of Sanya Bay are complex and vary greatly with location, Christian's model lost its advantage in the area. Conversely, the bottom reflectance calculating by the algorithm based on the simulation of the underwater light field in idealized water agreed well with in situ measured bottom reflectance, although the reflectance was lower than in situ measured reflectance value between 400 and 500 nm. So, it is reasonable to extract bottom information by using the water column correction algorithm in local bay area where optical properties are complex.																	1000-0593					JUL	2011	31	7					1912	1916		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2011)07-1912-05								WOS:000292575600039						
J	Yamakita, T; Watanabe, K; Nakaoka, M				Yamakita, Takehisa; Watanabe, Kentaro; Nakaoka, Masahiro			Asynchronous local dynamics contributes to stability of a seagrass bed in Tokyo Bay	ECOGRAPHY												It is known that asynchronous temporal variations in local populations can contribute to the stability of metapopulations. However, studies evaluating the hierarchical organization of multiple spatial scales are rare for continuous marine landscapes, especially for marine vegetation such as seagrass beds. In this study, long-term observation (26 yr) of temporal changes and nested spatial analyses were combined for an extensive seagrass meadow in Tokyo Bay, Japan, using remote sensing and geographic information system technologies. We examined how the dynamics at the whole-bed scale (similar to 1 km2) are related to those at a local scale (0.04 km2), and investigated the relationship between the seagrass dynamics and long-term changes in environmental conditions using data on oceanography, water quality, and sediment dynamics. The seagrass bed size fluctuated between a maximum of 1.28 km2 (in 1987) and a minimum of 0.39 km2 (in 2001), with an average of 0.90 km2. The temporal variation in seagrass bed size at the whole-bed scale correlated with sand movement within the seagrass bed related to changes in the position of a sandbar. Seagrass bed size fluctuated asynchronously at a local scale. Multivariate analyses recognized clusters of local areas showing similar patterns of fluctuation. Temporal patterns in the various clusters responded differently to changes in environmental factors, e.g. the position of the sandbar was highly correlated with seagrass bed size in shallow habitats but not in deeper areas. The magnitudes of the temporal variations for the local clusters were greater than that of the entire bed, suggesting that asynchronous fluctuation in different areas of the bed plays an important role in the overall stability of the seagrass bed. The results of the present study also highlight the importance of physical processes in regulating the temporal dynamics of seagrass beds in shallow sedimentary landscapes.																	0906-7590					JUN	2011	34	3					519	528		10.1111/j.1600-0587.2010.06490.x								WOS:000291228300017

However, anthropogenic pressures have caused its populations to decline worldwide. Delineation and continuous monitoring of eelgrass distribution is an integral part of understanding these pressures and providing effective coastal ecosystem management. A proposed tool for such spatial monitoring is remote imagery, which can cost-and time-effectively cover large and inaccessible areas frequently. However, to effectively apply this technology, an understanding is required of the spectral behavior of eelgrass and its associated substrates. In this study, in situ hyperspectral measurements were used to define key spectral variables that provide the greatest spectral separation between Z. marina and associated submerged substrates. For eelgrass classification of an in situ above water reflectance dataset, the selected variables were: slope 500-530 nm, first derivatives (R') at 566 nm, 580 nm, and 602 nm, yielding 98% overall accuracy. When the in situ reflectance dataset was water-corrected, the selected variables were: 566:600 and 566:710, yielding 97% overall accuracy. The depth constraint for eelgrass identification with the field spectrometer was 5.0 to 6.0 m on average, with a range of 3.0 to 15.0 m depending on the characteristics of the water column. A case study involving benthic classification of hyperspectral airborne imagery showed the major advantage of the variable selection was meeting the sample size requirements of the more statistically complex Maximum Likelihood classifier. Results of this classifier yielded eelgrass classification accuracy of over 85%. The depth limit of eelgrass spectral detection for the AISA sensor was 5.5 m.																	2072-4292					MAY	2011	3	5					975	1005		10.3390/rs3050975								WOS:000306749500008

Geomorphological modelling of tropical marine landscapes: Optical remote sensing, patches and spatial statistics	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The relation of structural responses to underlying functional processes at the landscape scale helps develop our understanding of geomorphological phenomena at the coastline. This paper demonstrates how a habitat map derived from remotely sensed imagery was used as the basis for the development of an explanatory model to investigate factors influencing the linearity of alternating carbonate sand and seagrass patches on a reef flat in the Seychelles, western Indian Ocean. In combination with techniques established in landscape ecology for interrogating broad scale processes and spatial statistical procedures that bring geography explicitly into the analysis, an emergent framework for the quantification and investigation of geomorphological processes is illustrated. The combined influence of adjacent spur and groove amplitude and incident wave power accounted for 81% of the variation in sand and seagrass patch linearity across the habitat map. A series of steps in model development are examined, including observation, measurement, experimentation and interpretation. These steps both define and permit an empirical approach to geomorphology and the case study highlights how each can be achieved by adopting an interdisciplinary framework. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Remote sensing with SPOT-4 for mapping kelp forests in turbid waters on the south European Atlantic shelf	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Remote sensing has become an increasingly used technique for the thematic mapping of large marine areas. In recent years, many researchers have successfully applied these techniques in different places for benthic mapping in clear waters: however, areas with turbid waters present important limitations that are gradually being solved by recent technological advances. In this context, the main objective of the present study is to develop and validate a methodology for mapping intertidal and subtidal kelp forests in the Galician coast (NW Spain), based on images from SPOT-4 (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre). Three analysis methods have been applied: visual analysis and interpretation, unsupervised classification (cluster) and supervised classification (angular classification and maximum likelihood classification). Classification percentages higher than 70% in all substrates were obtained both using visual analysis and interpretation and maximum likelihood classification. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Heumann, BW				Heumann, Benjamin W.			Satellite remote sensing of mangrove forests: Recent advances and future opportunities	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Mangroves are salt tolerant woody plants that form highly productive intertidal ecosystems in tropical and subtropical regions. Despite the established importance of mangroves to the coastal environment, including fisheries, deforestation continues to be a major threat due to pressures for wood and forest products, land conversion to aquaculture, and coastal urban development. Over the past 15 years, remote sensing has played a crucial role in mapping and understanding changes in the areal extent and spatial pattern of mangrove forests related to natural disasters and anthropogenic forces. This paper reviews recent advancements in remote-sensed data and techniques and describes future opportunities for integration or fusion of these data and techniques for large-scale monitoring in mangroves as a consequence of anthropogenic and climatic forces. While traditional pixel-based classification of Landsat, SPOT, and ASTER imagery has been widely applied for mapping mangrove forest, more recent types of imagery such as very high resolution (VHR), Polarmetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR), hyperspectral, and LiDAR systems and the development of techniques such as Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA), spatial image analysis (e.g. image texture), Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR), and machine-learning algorithms have demonstrated the potential for reliable and detailed characterization of mangrove forests including species, leaf area, canopy height, and stand biomass. Future opportunities include the application of existing sensors such as the hyperspectral HYPERION, the application of existing methods from terrestrial forest remote sensing, investigation of new sensors such as ALOS PRISM and PALSAR, and overcoming challenges to the global monitoring of mangrove forests such as wide-scale data availability, robust and consistent methods, and capacity-building with scientists and organizations in developing countries.																	0309-1333	1477-0296				FEB	2011	35	1					87	108		10.1177/0309133310385371								WOS:000287779900005						
J	Lyons, M; Phinn, S; Roelfsema, C				Lyons, Mitchell; Phinn, Stuart; Roelfsema, Chris			Integrating Quickbird Multi-Spectral Satellite and Field Data: Mapping Bathymetry, Seagrass Cover, Seagrass Species and Change in Moreton Bay, Australia in 2004 and 2007	REMOTE SENSING												Shallow coastal ecosystems are the interface between the terrestrial and marine environment. The physical and biological composition and distribution of benthic habitats within these ecosystems determines their contribution to ecosystem services and biodiversity as well as their connections to neighbouring terrestrial and marine ecosystem processes. The capacity to accurately and consistently map and monitor these benthic habitats is critical to developing and implementing management applications. This paper presents a method for integrating field survey data and high spatial resolution, multi-spectral satellite image data to map bathymetry and seagrass in shallow coastal waters. Using Quickbird 2 satellite images from 2004 and 2007, acoustic field survey data were used to map bathymetry using a linear and ratio algorithm method; benthic survey field data were used to calibrate and validate classifications of seagrass percentage cover and seagrass species composition; and a change detection analysis of seagrass cover was performed. The bathymetry mapping showed that only the linear algorithm could effectively and accurately predict water depth; overall benthic map accuracies ranged from 57-95%; and the change detection produced a reliable change map and showed a net decrease in seagrass cover levels, but the majority of the study area showed no change in seagrass cover level. This study demonstrates that multiple spatial products (bathymetry, seagrass and change maps) can be produced from single satellite images and a concurrent field survey dataset. Moreover, the products were produced at higher spatial resolution and accuracy levels than previous studies in Moreton Bay. The methods are developed from previous work in the study area and are continuing to be implemented, as well as being developed to be repeatable in similar shallow coastal water environments.

Interpretation of seafloor topologies based on IKONOS satellite imagery of a shallow-marine carbonate platform: Florida Bay to the Florida Reef Tract. Journal of Coastal Research, SI 64 (Proceedings of the 11th International Coastal Symposium), 825 - 830. Szczecin, Poland, ISSN 0749-0208 The shallow low-energy waters of the extensive coastal zone in sub-tropical south Florida permits the discrimination of seabed features and benthic covers acquired from remotely sensed data. A benthic environments classification system is devised from digital interpretations of multi-spectral IKONOS satellite imagery for 1,360 km(2) of the carbonate platform and presented in a comprehensive digitized map. The classification scheme is designed as a 7th order hierarchical structure that integrates 5 Physiographic Realms, 17 Morphodynamic Zones, 11 Geoforms, 38 Landforms, 6 dominant surface sediment types, 9 dominant biological covers and 3 densities of biological covers for the description of benthic environments. Digital analysis of the high-resolution (4 m) IKONOS imagery employed ESRI's ArcMap to manually digitize 412 mapping units at a scale of 1:6,000. Digital classification of environments is executed by the analyst contingent with the grouping of relative spectral reflectance, color tone variations, and the texture and pattern of the benthic unit. The mapping area incorporates a large diversity of geomorphic forms that range from coastal plains in the southern Florida Peninsula to coral reef formations along the Florida Reef Tract (FRT). The context of each Morphodynamic Zone is characterized by the content and areal distribution (in km(2)) of geomorphic forms and biological covers. Florida Bay is the most widely distributed Realm and is largely characterized by polygonal lattices of salient sediment banks and sediment flats. Over 58% of the mapping area is occupied by sediment flats, and seagrasses are colonized in almost 80% of the topologies.																	0749-0208						2011			1		64		825	830										WOS:000302824900169						
J	Yang, DT; Huang, DJ				Yang Dingtian; Huang Daojian			Impacts of Typhoons Tianying and Dawei on seagrass distribution in Xincun Bay, Hainan Province, China	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												More than 50% of the typhoons landing in China have landed on the southeast coast, where they have caused great pressure on the coastal environment. Seagrass, one of the most important constituents of coastal ecosystems, is also greatly affected by typhoons. In order to clarify how seagrass distribution variation is affected by typhoons in coastal areas in southeast China, data of Typhoons Dawei and Tianying (category 4 and category 2 respectively, which just ran through the southern part of Hainan province) have been studied. In situ observation and satellite remote sensing data (CBERS-China Brazil Earth Resources Satellite) in 2004 and 2006 were used to retrieve seagrass distribution in Xincun Bay, Hainan province. In situ observations showed that leaf length, stem biomass and above ground biomass on average showed evidence of reduction after Typhoons Tianying and Dawei. However, seagrass density showed no evidence of reduction after typhoon Tianying and Dawei passed by and increased rapidly in January 2006. From results of satellite remote sensing data, seagrass distribution can be detected with high accuracy, and the area of seagrass distribution on the south coast of Xincun Bay in 2006 after the typhoon passed by was smaller than that in 2004 in region A and B. However, in region C, area of seagrass coverage under 20% increased. These results demonstrated that typhoons Tianying and Dawei damaged seagrass bed and helped seagrass to get rid of aged and dead leaves, and this correspondingly facilitated seagrass growth.																	0253-505X					JAN	2011	30	1					32	39		10.1007/s13131-011-0088-5								WOS:000289699600005						
J	Wedding, LM; Lepczyk, CA; Pittman, SJ; Friedlander, AM; Jorgensen, S				Wedding, Lisa M.; Lepczyk, Christopher A.; Pittman, Simon J.; Friedlander, Alan M.; Jorgensen, Stacy			Quantifying seascape structure: extending terrestrial spatial pattern metrics to the marine realm	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Spatial pattern metrics have routinely been applied to characterize and quantify structural features of terrestrial landscapes and have demonstrated great utility in landscape ecology and conservation planning. The important role of spatial structure in ecology and management is now commonly recognized, and recent advances in marine remote sensing technology have facilitated the application of spatial pattern metrics to the marine environment. However, it is not yet clear whether concepts, metrics, and statistical techniques developed for terrestrial ecosystems are relevant for marine species and seascapes. To address this gap in our knowledge, we reviewed, synthesized, and evaluated the utility and application of spatial pattern metrics in the marine science literature over the past 30 yr (1980 to 2010). In total, 23 studies characterized seascape structure, of which 17 quantified spatial patterns using a 2-dimensional patch-mosaic model and 5 used a continuously varying 3-dimensional surface model. Most seascape studies followed terrestrial-based studies in their search for ecological patterns and applied or modified existing metrics. Only 1 truly unique metric was found (hydrodynamic aperture applied to Pacific atolls). While there are still relatively few studies using spatial pattern metrics in the marine environment, they have suffered from similar misuse as reported for terrestrial studies, such as the lack of a priori considerations or the problem of collinearity between metrics. Spatial pattern metrics offer great potential for ecological research and environmental management in marine systems, and future studies should focus on (1) the dynamic boundary between the land and sea; (2) quantifying 3-dimensional spatial patterns; and (3) assessing and monitoring seascape change.																	0171-8630						2011	427						219	232		10.3354/meps09119								WOS:000289489800017

Historical changes in seagrass coverage on the Mississippi barrier islands, northern Gulf of Mexico, determined from vertical aerial imagery (1940-2007)	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL												Vertical aerial image data were used with an edge-detection procedure and visual image interpretation to determine yearly to decadal changes in seagrass (predominantly Halodule wrightii Ascherson) coverage on the Mississippi barrier islands. On Horn Island, seagrass coverage declined from 77 ha in 1940 to 19 ha in 1971, but returned to its 1940 value by 2006. Coverage on Petit Bois declined from 54 ha in 1940 to 8-19 ha from 1952 through 2007. On East Ship, seagrass coverage varied at 2-19 ha from 1963 to 2007. On West Ship, coverage dropped to zero in 2003, but by 2007 it had increased to approximate its 1975 value of 1.8 ha. On Cat Island, coverage increased from 22 ha in 2003 to 71 ha in 2007. There was no apparent negative impact of Hurricane Camille or Hurricane Katrina on seagrass coverage, which could vary annually by a factor of two or more.

Considered to be a challenging environment to map, this area is characterized by a diverse mix of inter- and subtidal habitat types. Our mapped distribution of seagrasses corresponded well to field data, although the total seagrass area was underestimated due to spectral confusion and misclassification of areas with sparse seagrass patches as sparse coral and algae-covered limestone rock. Seagrass biomass was also accurately estimated (r2 = 0.83), except in areas with Thalassodendron ciliatum (r2 = 0.57), as the stems of T. ciliatum change the relationship between light interception and biomass from that of other species in the area. We recommend the use of remote sensing over field-based methods for seagrass mapping because of the comprehensive coverage, high accuracy and ability to estimate biomass. The results obtained with IKONOS imagery in our complex study area are encouraging, and support the use of this data source for seagrass mapping in similar areas.

Optical properties of canopies of the tropical seagrass Thalassia testudinum estimated by a three-dimensional radiative transfer model	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Three-dimensional models of seagrass canopies were constructed by treating leaves as flexible strips that fall under their own weight into naturalistic canopy structures. Canopy structures incorporated shoot density, canopy height, and physical and along-length optical characteristics of leaves from an empirical data set of six seagrass canopies from a reef lagoon in Puerto Morelos, Mexico. Multiple runs of a radiosity method radiative transfer model elucidated the dependence of various canopy optical properties on incident radiance zenith angle, such as within-canopy diffuse attenuation, the absorption of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) by different canopy-complex components, along-leaf variation in PAR absorption, and canopy bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs). Intersite variation in mean PAR absorption by green leaf sections was primarily associated with leaf area index (LAI). Variation in PAR absorption with incident radiance angle was generally small for incident angles within Snell's window (< 49 degrees). Within canopies, absorption by water itself had a negligible effect. Canopy BRDFs were not Lambertian and exhibited features related to canopy architecture. Model outputs validated well in terms of energy conservation and empirical measurements of within-canopy PAR attenuation. The model framework has clear applications to improve understanding of seagrass canopy light harvesting and photosynthetic carbon fixation and to aid the development of quantitative biooptical remote sensing methods for seagrass beds.

J	Lauer, M; Aswani, S				Lauer, Matthew; Aswani, Shankar			Indigenous Knowledge and Long-term Ecological Change: Detection, Interpretation, and Responses to Changing Ecological Conditions in Pacific Island Communities	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												When local resource users detect, understand, and respond to environmental change they can more effectively manage environmental resources. This article assesses these abilities among artisanal fishers in Roviana Lagoon, Solomon Islands. In a comparison of two villages, it documents local resource users' abilities to monitor long-term ecological change occurring to seagrass meadows near their communities, their understandings of the drivers of change, and their conceptualizations of seagrass ecology. Local observations of ecological change are compared with historical aerial photography and IKONOS satellite images that show 56 years of actual changes in seagrass meadows from 1947 to 2003. Results suggest that villagers detect long-term changes in the spatial cover of rapidly expanding seagrass meadows. However, for seagrass meadows that showed no long-term expansion or contraction in spatial cover over one-third of respondents incorrectly assumed changes had occurred. Examples from a community-based management initiative designed around indigenous ecological knowledge and customary sea tenure governance show how local observations of ecological change shape marine resource use and practices which, in turn, can increase the management adaptability of indigenous or hybrid governance systems.																	0364-152X					MAY	2010	45	5					985	997		10.1007/s00267-010-9471-9								WOS:000277771400009	20336296					
J	Roelfsema, C; Phinn, S				Roelfsema, Chris; Phinn, Stuart			Integrating field data with high spatial resolution multispectral satellite imagery for calibration and validation of coral reef benthic community maps	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Our ability to map coral reef environments using remote sensing has increased through improved access to: satellite images and field survey data at suitable spatial scales, and software enabling the integration of data sources. These data sets can be used to provide validated maps to support science and management decisions. The objective of this paper was to compare two methods for calibrating and validating maps of coral reef benthic communities derived from satellite images captured over a variety of Coral Reefs The two methods for collecting georeferenced benthic field data were: 1), georeferenced photo transects and 2), spot checks. Quickbird imagery was acquired for three Fijian coral reef environments in: Suva, Navakavu and Solo. These environments had variable water clarity and spatial complexity of benthic cover composition. The two field data sets at each reef were each split, and half were used for training data sets for supervised classifications, and the other half for accuracy assessment. This resulted in two maps of benthic communities with associated mapping accuracies, production times and costs for each study-site. Analyses of the spatial patterns in benthic community maps and their Overall and Tau accuracies revealed that for spatially complex habitats, the maps produced from photo transect data were twice as accurate as spot check based maps. In the context of the reefs examined, our results showed that the photo- transect method was a robust procedure which could be used in a range of coral reef environments to map the benthic communities accurately. In contrast, the spot check method is a fast and low cost approach, suitable for mapping benthic communities which have lower spatial complexity. Our findings will enable scientists, technicians and managers to select appropriate methods for collecting field data to integrate with high spatial resolution multi-spectral imagery to create validated coral reef benthic community maps.

Christopher; Lee, Rosalynn; Vahatalo, Anssi; Zepp, Richard G.; Bartels, Erich			Production of chromophoric dissolved organic matter from mangrove leaf litter and floating Sargassum colonies	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) strongly absorbs solar radiation in the blue-green and serves as the primary attenuator of water column ultraviolet radiation (UV-R). CDOM interferes with remote sensing of ocean chlorophyll and can control UV-R-induced damage to light-sensitive organisms including corals. We used laboratory incubations to evaluate CDOM production from senescing Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove) leaf litter (yellow, orange, and brown) and floating Sargassum colonies. Mangroves exist at the land-ocean interface near coral reefs in sub-tropical and tropical regions while floating Sargassum colonies tend to congregate in sub-tropical ocean gyres. CDOM production (similar to 48 h) from mangrove leaves collected during a dry period in June 2004 (0.17 +/- 0.11 m(-1) g(-1) l h(-1)) was lower than production from leaves collected during a wet period in September 2003 (0.57 +/- 0.42 m(-1) g(-1) l h(-1)) suggesting that CDOM production from leaf litter fluctuates in response to environmental factors. CDOM production was greatest for the mid-senescence orange leaves and lowest for the severely senesced brown leaves in both experiments. Along the sub-tropical Florida Keys coral reef ecosystem, the primary source of CDOM is discharge from the shallow seagrass-dominated Florida Bay as evidenced by a strong correlation between field CDOM measurements and previously reported Florida Bay discharge volumes. However, field observations provide evidence that large expanses of red mangroves throughout the Keys could be important CDOM sources to the region's coral reefs during periods of reduced Florida Bay discharge. Floating Sargassum colonies also readily produced CDOM in laboratory incubations, but at much more variable rates than mangrove leaves. However, our calculations indicate that large mats of floating Sargassum could provide important CDOM quantities to oligotrophic oceanic waters including the Gulf of Mexico and North Atlantic.

Six SPOT satellite images acquired at low tide were calibrated using in situ spectroradiometric data and processed with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). A steady and linear increase in meadow areas was observed between 1991 and 2005 with total surfaces colonized by Z. noltii increasing from 208 to 586 ha, respectively. A greater increase in the densest part of the meadow (NDVI > 0.4) was also observed: it represented only 15% of total meadow surfaces in 1991 vs. 35% in 2005. The seagrass expansion took place mainly towards the lower part of the intertidal zone, while in the upper intertidal zone the meadow appeared strictly limited by the +4 m (Lowest Astronomical Tide) bathymetric level. The influence of Z. noltii above-ground biomass variations on spectral reflectance was analyzed experimentally by spectrometry. Z. noltii displays a characteristic steep slope from 700 to 900 nm, increasing with increasing biomass. A quantitative relationship obtained experimentally between NDVI and the dry weight of leaves was used to produce a biomass distribution map. The distribution of Bourgneuf Bay intertidal seagrass beds is certainly constrained by the water turbidity and we suggest that tidal flat accretion could be a significant variable explaining the observed expansion downwards. With very limited spatial interactions, oyster aquaculture cannot be considered as a threat, while a recent increase in recreational hand fishing of Manila clams within the beds could become problematic.

The study was conducted in Mar Menor, SE Spain, where the expansion of Caulerpa prolifera has contributed to the silting up of the superficial sediments. A direct relationship was identified between algal biomass and sediment-fines content. Acoustic information on sediment grain size and data on algal biomass were obtained in muddy and sandy sediments, including vegetated and non-vegetated seabed. Non-vegetated muddy areas were created by diving and handpicking the algae. The multivariate acoustic data were analysed under the null hypotheses that there were no acoustic differences between bare seabeds with contrasting superficial sediment types or among low, medium, and high algal-biomass areas, having in mind that grain size can act as a confounding factor. Both null hypotheses were rejected, and the results showed that 200 kHz was better than 50 kHz in distinguishing cover levels of algal biomass. The relationship between the 200-kHz acoustic data and algal biomass suggests utility in modelling the latter using the former.

Even though there has been progress recently, there is still a great deal of research needed to gain a better understanding of seagrass. In this article we review and discuss the advances in seagrass research in China from two aspects: (1) seagrass species and their distribution; (2) seagrass research in China, including studies on their taxonomy, ecology, photosynthesis, applications in aquaculture, salt-tolerance mechanisms and other research topics. A total of 18 seagrass species belonging to 8 genera are distributed in nine provinces and regions in China (including Hong Kong and Taiwan), as well as the Xisha and Nansha Archipelagos. They can be divided into two groups: a North China Group and a South China Group. Based on the seagrass distribution, the Chinese mainland coast can be divided into three sections: North China Seagrass Coast, Middle China Seagrass Coast, and South China Seagrass Coast. Ecological studies include research on seagrass communities, nutrient cycling in seagrass ecosystems, genetic diversity, pollution ecology and research in the key regions of Shandong, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan. Seagrass species and their locations, community structure, ecological evaluation, epiphytes, ecological functions and threats in the key regions are also summarized. Other studies have focused on remote sensing of seagrass, threatened seagrass species of China, and pollen morphology of Halophila ovalis.																	0254-4059					MAR	2010	28	2					329	339		10.1007/s00343-010-9183-2								WOS:000275781400019

Lyzenga's model has been traditionally used to explain the relationship between bottom surface reflectance and the radiance level measured by satellite. Due to its central assumption, this model lacks accuracy compared with the other radiative transfer models. Nonetheless, it enables, with a single and simple equation, representation of the multiple optical processes taking place in coastal areas. Mapping processes associated with this model may include radiometric correction, a technique previously pointed out as a major driver of mapping accuracy. Radiometric correction is generally based on a depth-invariant index, efficient for clear waters (Jerlov water type I to II) but largely unsuitable when transparency decreases (Jerlov water type II to III). In order to overcome this problem, we developed a new index for radiometric correction, which combines bathymetry data with attenuation coefficients. The improved efficiency of our model with regard to the traditional depth invariant index was demonstrated through two case studies: Funakoshi Bay (Japan; Jerlov water type II) and the Gabes Gulf part located off Mahares (Tunisia; Jerlov water type II to III).																	0143-1161						2010	31	12					3051	3064	PII 924588757	10.1080/01431160903154341								WOS:000280153800001

Ravi			Analysis of seagrass reflectivity by using a water column correction algorithm	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING					9th Biennial Pan Ocean Remote Sensing Conference (PORSEC)	DEC, 2008	Guangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA					Seagrass in optically shallow water can generate optical signals that can be tracked remotely. Unfortunately the signals from the bottom are relatively weak and can be affected by the water column when concentrations of suspended particles, chlorophyll and coloured dissolved organic matter are high. An optical model simulating the propagation of light for retrieving the bottom reflectance was developed. Implementation of the method was found to be effective for improving the accuracy of coastal habitat maps, and essential for deriving empirical relationships between remotely sensed data and interesting features in the marine environment. The appropriate wavebands for seagrass mapping, which generally lay between 500 and 630 nm and 680 and 710 nm, were obtained by means of full visual inspection and analysis of the correct spectra. Additionally, a strong relationship between the reflectance value at 715 nm and Leaf Area Index was found, with a correlation coefficient of 0.99.

The regional land use is dominated by sugarcane cultivation, beef grazing and urban uses. The high nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) fluxes from these land uses via river runoff produced a massive phytoplankton bloom in the GBR lagoon, which, after 9 days, had spread 150 km offshore. The plume and algal bloom surrounded inner-shelf reefs of the GBR such as Brampton Island Reef and its spread was tracked with a variety of satellite sensors including MODIS, SeaWiFS and Landsat over the 9-day period. The ability to be able to access imagery from a large number of satellite sensors allowed almost daily estimates of the extent of plume to be made, despite periods of cloud. Analysis of water samples from the plume revealed elevated (2-50 times higher) concentrations of Chlorophyll a (and hence phytoplankton biomass), up to 50 times higher than in non-flood conditions, nutrients (2-100 times higher) and herbicide residues (10-100 times higher) compared with GBR lagoon waters in non-discharge conditions. The concentration data from the samples and estimated exposure periods from the satellite images allowed estimates of the exposure of GBR marine ecosystems (coral reefs, the pelagic community, seagrass beds and mangrove forests) to the terrestrial contaminants to be made.

Here we used ocean color remote sensing techniques to map different major groups of primary producers and estimate net primary productivity (NPP) across Great Bahama Bank (GBB). Field investigations on the northern portion of the GBB in 2004 revealed 3 dominant types of benthic primary producers: seagrass, benthic macroalgae, and microalgae attached to sediment. Laboratory measurements of NPP ranged from barely net autotrophic for grapestone sediment with thin microalgal biofilm to highly productive for dense accumulations of brown macroalgae. A logarithmic relationship between NPP and green seafloor reflectance described the general trend in NPP across various benthic constituents. Using a radiative transfer-based approach, satellite-derived estimates of NPP for the region totaled similar to 2 x 10(13) gC yr(-1) across the GBB. The prevailing benthic habitat was mapped as sediment with little to no microalgal biofilm. Moderate to dense seagrass meadows of Thalassia testudinum were the dominant primary producers and contributed over 80% of NPP in the region. If the vast majority of seagrass leaves decompose in the primarily carbonate sediments, carbonate dissolution processes associated with this decomposition may result in sequestration of seagrass above- and below-ground carbon into the bicarbonate pool (2.4 x 10(13) gC yr(-1)), where it has a residence time on the order of tens of thousands of years.

J	Cho, HJ; Lu, DJ				Cho, Hyun Jung; Lu, Duanjun			A water-depth correction algorithm for submerged vegetation spectra	REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												The substantial difference between the reflectance values at the red and the near-infrared (NIR) regions has been used to develop vegetation indices for remote sensing of green plants. These spectral indices, however, may not effectively be used for underwater plants because the overlying water interferes with the upwelling vegetation signals. We empirically separated the energy absorbed by water and scattered from the water column using an indoor water tank with hypothetical surfaces that either reflect or absorb all the incoming light. Using the experimental data, a function was developed to correct reflectance measured from a shallow water body for the water effects. When applied to independently measured reflectance of underwater vegetation, the algorithm significantly enhanced vegetation signals, especially in the NIR region. This experimentally driven algorithm can improve mapping capabilities of seagrass beds and invasive aquatics in shallow water bodies.																	2150-704X	2150-7058					2010	1	1					29	35		10.1080/01431160903246709								WOS:000292871800005

An Integrated Field and Remote Sensing Approach for Mapping Seagrass Cover, Moreton Bay, Australia	JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE												Creating accurate maps of seagrass cover is a challenging procedure in coastal waters with variable water clarity and depths. This paper presents an approach for mapping seagrass cover from data sources commonly collected by natural resource management agencies responsible for coastal environments. The aim of the study was to develop an approach for mapping classes of seagrass cover from field and/or image data for an area with variable water clarity and depths. The study was carried out in Moreton Bay in eastern Australia. A Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper satellite image was acquired for the same area in August 2004. The image data were used to map seagrass cover in the exposed inter-tidal and clear shallow water areas to depths of 3 in. Field Survey data were collected, in July - August 2004, to map deep (> 3 m) and turbid sub-tidal areas, using: real time video, snorkeller observations and transect Surveys. The resulting maps were combined into a single layer of polygons, with the same seagrass cover classes used as existing mapping programs and with each polygon assigned to one of five cover classes (0 %, 1-25 %, 25-50 %, 50-75 %, 75-100 %). As independent field data were not available for accuracy assessment, a reliability assessment indicated that > 75 percent of the Bay was mapped with high categorical reliability. Most previously published seagrass mapping projects covered areas < 400 km(2), were based on single data sets, and lacked assessment of accuracy or reliability. Our approach and methods address this gap and present guidelines for a generally applicable method to integrate image and field data sets over large areas (> 1000 km(2)) commonly used for monitoring and management.

Moreover, in a context of current global environmental changes, new methods allowing long-term monitoring are increasingly required. Various methods have been used to map seafloors, primarily benthic macrofauna and sediment sampling along regular grids or transects, and remote sensing methods. These methods map very different things, do not have the same accuracy levels, and have different costs in time and money. Furthermore, such methods often require the competencies of highly skilled scientists and exclude non-specialists otherwise best placed to perform them. In this paper, we test a method based on Direct Field Observations ('DFO method'), which can be used by non-specialists, and assess if it is sufficient for mapping and monitoring intertidal habitats. We further compare this method with other conventional ones. The results show that such a simple method is relatively rapid and inexpensive given the results obtained. Moreover, it is particularly suitable for highly fragmented intertidal landscapes where other methods are often very limited. In consequence, in areas such as the European coasts, it can be used by non-specialists, such as protected-area managers, and because it is an inexpensive and quick method long-term monitoring is also possible.

Laboratory investigation of the acoustic response of seagrass tissue in the frequency band 0.5-2.5 kHz	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												Previous in situ investigations of seagrass have revealed acoustic phenomena that depend on plant density, tissue gas content, and free bubbles produced by photosynthetic activity, but corresponding predictive models that could be used to optimize acoustic remote sensing, shallow water sonar, and mine hunting applications have not appeared. To begin to address this deficiency, low frequency (0.5-2.5 kHz) acoustic laboratory experiments were conducted on three freshly collected Texas Gulf Coast seagrass species. A one-dimensional acoustic resonator technique was used to assess the biomass and effective acoustic properties of the leaves and rhizomes of Thalassia testudinum (turtle grass), Syringodium filiforme (manatee grass), and Halodule wrightii (shoal grass). Independent biomass and gas content estimates were obtained via microscopic cross-section imagery. The acoustic results were compared to model predictions. based on Wood's equation for a two-phase medium. The effective sound speed in the plant-filled resonator was strongly dependent on plant biomass, but the Wood's equation model (based on tissue gas content alone) could not predict the effective sound speed for the low irradiance conditions of the experiment, in which no free bubbles were generated by photosynthesis. The results corroborate previously published results obtained in situ for another seagrass species, Posidonia oceanica. (C) 2009 Acoustical Society of America.

This paper discusses the integration of high resolution aerial color film photography, color space transformation, pixel threshold models, and geographic information system technology to detect, assess, and monitor 1-m ground feature changes and disturbance areas within a Texas, United States, shallow seagrass bed over 3 site years. The procedure entails transforming digitized, aerial color film transparencies from red, green, and blue color space to intensity, hue, and saturation color space; analyzing the saturation and/or intensity imagery and their histograms to identify bare areas; and developing threshold models to separate bare areas from vegetated areas employing the results obtained in the previous step. Maps created with this semiautomated approach had classification accuracies ranging from 75% to 100%. We used geographic information system tools to quantify landscape feature changes occurring at the shallow test site for 3 consecutive years. The overall findings indicate that the semiautomated approach described in this study can be used as an efficient protocol to accurately map changes in bare and vegetated areas within this Texas seagrass bed, and suggest that the techniques would have high potential for other similar seagrass areas.																	0749-0208					MAR	2009	25	2					500	506		10.2112/07-0882.1								WOS:000265124400022						
J	Yang, DT; Yang, CY				Yang, Dingtian; Yang, Chaoyu			Detection of Seagrass Distribution Changes from 1991 to 2006 in Xincun Bay, Hainan, with Satellite Remote Sensing	SENSORS												Seagrass distribution is a very important index for costal management and protection. Seagrass distribution changes can be used as indexes to analyze the reasons for the changes. In this paper, in situ hyperspectral observation and satellite images of QuickBird, CBERS (China Brazil Earth Resources Satellite data) and Landsat data were used to retrieve bio-optical models and seagrass (Enhalus acoroides, Thalassia hemperichii) distribution in Xincun Bay, Hainan province, and seagrass distribution changes from 1991 to 2006 were analyzed. Hyperspectral results showed that the spectral bands at 555, 635, 650 and 675 nm are sensitive to leaf area index (LAI). Seagrass detection with QuickBird was more accurate than that with Landsat TM and CBERS; five classes could be classified clearly and used as correction for seagrass remote sensing data from Landsat TM and CBERS. In order to better describe seagrass distribution changes, the seagrass distribution area was divided as three regions: region A connected with region B in 1991, however it separated in 1999 and was wholly separated in 2001; seagrass in region C shrank gradually and could not be detected in 2006. Analysis of the reasons for seagrass reduction indicated it was mainly affected by aquaculture and typhoons and in recent years, by land use changes.																	1424-8220					FEB	2009	9	2					830	844		10.3390/s90200830								WOS:000263823500008	22399941

These marine plant species are concentrated in specific tidal zones along sheltered intertidal coastlines in association with estuaries and lagoons; mangroves fringe the coastline encroaching into the lower intertidal region, whereas seagrasses populate the adjacent deeper water. In most cases, the distribution of mangroves and seagrasses does not overlap. It is important to monitor the geographic extent and health of mangrove forests and seagrass beds, which serve as an important habitat for juvenile marine species. Remote-sensing data for the Khor A1 Bazam area in the vicinity of Abu Dhabi, UAE, covering the years of 1994, 2000, and 2003, were used to determine the change in mangrove and seagrass cover. Since 1994, there has been an increase in mangrove cover, likely because of plantation activity, the closure of nearby shipyards, and an increase in public awareness regarding mangrove preservation. Although more difficult to determine, a combination of remote sensing and ground-truthing indicates that the seagrass beds within the study area have likely increased in real extent over the same time period.																	0749-0208					JAN	2009	25	1					48	56		10.2112/07-0867.1								WOS:000262698900005

Regional estimates of reef carbonate dynamics and productivity using Landsat 7 ETM+, and potential impacts from ocean acidification	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Using imagery at 30 m spatial resolution from the most recent Landsat satellite, the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), we scale up reef metabolic productivity and calcification from local habitat-scale (10(-1) to 10(0) km(2)) measurements to regional scales (10(3) to 10(4) km(2)). Distribution and spatial extent of the North Florida Reef Tract (NFRT) habitats come from supervised classification of the Landsat imagery within independent Landsat-derived Millennium Coral Reef Map geomorphologic classes. This system minimizes the depth range and variability of benthic habitat characteristics found in the area of supervised classification and limits misclassification. Classification of Landsat imagery into 5 biotopes (sand, dense live cover, sparse live cover, seagrass, and sparse seagrass) by geomorphologic class is >73 % accurate at regional scales. Based on recently published habitat-scale in situ metabolic measurements, gross production (P=3.01 x 10(9) kg C yr(-1)), excess production (E = -5.70 x 10(8) kg C yr(-1)), and calcification (G = -1.68 x 10(6) kg CaCO3 yr(-1)) are estimated over 2711 km(2) of the NFRT. Simple models suggest sensitivity of these values to ocean acidification, which will increase local dissolution of carbonate sediments. Similar approaches could be applied over large areas with poorly constrained bathymetry or water column properties and minimal metabolic sampling. This tool has potential applications for modeling and monitoring large-scale environmental impacts on reef productivity, such as the influence of ocean acidification on coral reef environments.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2009	380						103	115		10.3354/meps07920								WOS:000265907000009						
J	Yamakita, T; Nakaoka, M				Yamakita, Takehisa; Nakaoka, Masahiro			Scale dependency in seagrass dynamics: how does the neighboring effect vary with grain of observation?	POPULATION ECOLOGY												Although the importance of spatial scale in ecology has been increasingly recognized, the effects on ecological processes of changing the grain size of the observation have rarely been tested for empirical populations. A seagrass bed is an ideal system to study scale-dependency because it occurs in two-dimensional shallow soft-bottoms and can be monitored on a broader scale by using remote-sensing techniques. To investigate the grain dependency of seagrass spatial dynamics, we analyzed the effect of neighboring vegetation on the annual transition between vegetated and unvegetated states in a seagrass meadow in Futtsu, Tokyo Bay. The presence or absence of seagrass vegetation was observed at different grains from aerial photographs taken annually over 17 years. We detected the presence of a neighboring effect both in the increasing process (transition from the unvegetated to the vegetated state) and the decreasing process (vice versa) of vegetation. In the increasing process, the intensity of the neighboring effect was positive with the small grain, but the effect decreased to 0 with grain of ca. 20 m. In the decreasing process, the neighboring effect was negative with the small grain and increased to 0 with grain of ca. 30 m. The observed grain dependency in the neighboring effects also varied among different positions of the bed and among different years. The grain dependency in the increasing process cannot solely be explained by shoot elongation of the seagrass, which can cause positive neighboring effects only at small grain (a parts per thousand currency sign6 m). The neighboring effect at the greater grain can be regarded as an emergent property.

Regional-scale seagrass habitat mapping in the Wider Caribbean region using Landsat sensors: Applications to conservation and ecology	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Seagrass meadows occupy a large proportion of the world's coastal oceans and are some of the most productive systems on Earth. Direct and indirect human-derived impacts have led to significant seagrass declines worldwide and the alteration of services linked to their biodiversity. Effective conservation and the provision of sustainable recovery goals for ecologically significant species are limited by the absence of reliable information on seagrass extent. This is especially true for the Wider Caribbean region (WCR) where many conservation initiatives are under way, but are impaired by the lack Of accurate baseline habitat maps. To assist with such a fundamental conservation need using high-resolution remote sensing data, both environmental and methodological challenges need to be tackled. First, the diversity of environments, the heterogeneity of habitats, and the vast extent of the targeted region mean that local expertise and field data of adequate quality and resolution are seldom available. Second, large-scale high-resolution mapping requires several hundred Landsat 5 and 7 images, which poses substantial processing problems. The main goal of this study was to test the feasibility of achieving Landsat-based large-scale seagrass mapping with limited ground-truth data and acceptable accuracies. We used the following combination of methods to map seagrass throughout the WCR: geomorphological segmentation, contextual editing, and supervised classifications. A total of 40 Landsat scenes (path-row) were processed. Three major classes were derived ('dense seagrass', 'medium-sparse seagrass', and a generic 'other' class). Products' accuracies were assessed against (i) selected in situ data; (ii) patterns detectable with very high-resolution IKONOS images; and (iii) published habitat maps with documented accuracies. Despite variable overall classification accuracies (46-88%), following their critical evaluation, the resulting thematic maps were deemed acceptable to (i) regionally Provide an adequate baseline for further large-scale conservation programs and research actions; and (ii) regionally re-assess carrying capacity estimates for green turtles. They certainly represent a drastic improvement relative to current regional databases. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Seagrass mapping in the northern Gulf of Mexico using airborne hyperspectral imagery: A comparison of classification methods	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Mapping areas of seagrass is important, in part because the extent of seagrass habitat can serve as a general indicator of coastal ecosystem health. While aerial photography and multispectral imagery have commonly been used to map seagrass, digital hyperspectral imagery is at the forefront of current mapping technology in many natural resource applications. In this study, HyMap hyperspectral imagery at 2.9-m resolution was used to map seagrass distribution off Horn Island, Mississippi, and estimate its areal coverage. Seagrass beds and sand-bottom classes were defined based on visual interpretation of the imagery coupled with field observations. Image spectra were sampled for each class in three water-depth zones determined by distance from shore. Supervised image classifications were performed using maximum likelihood, minimum distance to means, and spectral angle mapper methods to compare relative accuracies in mapping seagrass coverage. The maximum likelihood classification produced the highest overall accuracy of 83%. The spectral angle mapper yielded the lowest accuracy due to the predominant influence of water-column optical properties on the apparent spectral characteristics of seagrass and sand bottom. The ML classification indicated total seagrass coverage of 107 ha. This compared favorably with the results of a separate, independent study based on aerial photography acquired 1 day after the HyMap flyover. For tracking seagrass coverage in the northern Gulf of Mexico, the mapping of individual seagrass patches at a spatial resolution of at least 3 m is recommended.

Mapping of the spatial distribution of benthic habitats in the Gulf of Batabano using Landsat-7 images	CIENCIAS MARINAS												The spatial distribution of benthic habitats in the Gulf of Batabano obtained by remote sensing, using five images from the Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite sensor, is reported for the first time. The map covers a total underwater area of 21,305 km(2) and is presented at the 1:250,000 scale. Five benthic habitats were identified within this area and located using the supervised classification technique: medium- to high-density seagrass, low-density seagrass, sand with scarce vegetation, mud with scarce vegetation, and rock. Seagrass covers 64.85% (13,818 km(2)) of the total area, while 35.15% (7,487 km(2)) corresponds to the remaining benthic habitats with or without scarce vegetation. Both the underwater vegetation (seagrass and macro seaweed) and the substratum types were considered. Results were confirmed by in situ measurements obtained from three research cruises between 2003 and 2005. This map represents an important characterization of the Cuban platform waters in order to better understand these ecosystems, and can be used in future change detection analyses to monitor the health of benthic habitats in the Gulf of Batabano.

Preface: High spatial resolutionremote sensing for environmental monitoring and management	JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE												This special feature in the journal of Spatial Science brings together a collection of papers showing environmental monitoring and management applications of high spatial resolution remotely sensed image data. As illustrated by the papers in this special feature, and a growing number of papers in ecology, environmental management and remote sensing journals (Butler, 2006; Mumby et aL, 2001; Zanoni and Goward, 2003), there is an increasing need for spatial information derived from multi-spectral sensors at the scales of traditional aerial photography. The application of moderate spatial resolution image data has produced limited results for mapping and monitoring small features (< 10 m) within terrestrial and aquatic habitats, Such as individual tree crowns and their associated biophysical variables, coral reef structures and seagrass distribution. With nominal spatial resolutions less than 5 m x 5 m, there now exists the capacity to acquire fully radiometrically and geometrically corrected data to map and monitor complex structures and patterns of small features. High spatial resolution airborne and satellite digital image sources in various forms are now easily obtainable for agencies responsible for monitoring natural and built environments. Spatial data, including airborne and satellite images, are globally accessible thanks to Virtual Globes, such as GoogleEarth and Microsoft's Virtual Earth. Organisations responsible for managing natural and built environments are now faced with choices of how to transform these data into management-relevant spatial information. Many standard per-pixel based approaches developed for moderate spatial resolution image data do not work on single- or multidate high spatial resolution image data, and it is not efficient to subject these data to visual interpretation. The papers presented in this special issue illustrate a variety of approaches developed to address some of these challenges in terrestrial and aquatic environments.

Pelagic habitat characterization of loggerhead sea turtles, Caretta caretta, in the North Pacific Ocean (1997-2006): Insights from satellite tag tracking and remotely sensed data	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												We analyzed satellite track data for 186 loggerhead sea turtles in the North Pacific Ocean using remotely sensed environmental data to characterize pelagic habitat. A large number of candidate habitat variables were merged to the satellite track data and statistically compared to background values over a large spatiotemporal grid which bounded overall occupancy. Five statistically significant variables were identified out of the 16 environmental variables examined. Two of these variables have strong seasonal, interannual, and spatial patterns (sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a concentration), while three others were primarily spatial (earth magnetic force, earth magnetic declination, and earth magnetic inclination). Habitat selectivity for these variables was quantified using preference curve methodology established in the foraging literature. The output from the selectivity curves was used to predict a multivariate loggerhead sea turtle habitat index across the pelagic North Pacific. This predicted habitat was ground-truthed with newly available satellite track data. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

IRS 1D LISS III (2000 and 2002) and IRS P6 LISS III (2004) showed the presence of extensive seagrass beds in these areas. Present study has recorded 3289.14 ha of reef area, 794.45 ha of reef vegetation, 726.15 ha of dense and 601.00 ha of sparse seagrass beds in this part of the Gulf during the year 2004. Further, spread and changes in seagrass cover in this region have been classified and loss has been estimated. In addition, drastic reduction in the seagrass resources of the Gulf of Mannar in certain places was identified and management plans to conserve this resource have been suggested.																	1589-1623						2008	6	1					139	146										WOS:000259019300012

Marine and coastal applications in landscape ecology	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Landscape ecology traditionally has been limited to the study of terrestrial systems; however, the questions and methods defining the science are equally relevant for marine and coastal systems. The reciprocal relationship between spatial pattern and ecological processes and the overarching effect of scale on this relationship was being explored in some marine and coastal settings as the general discipline of landscape ecology was evolving throughout the latter two decades of the last century. As with all components of the biosphere, an understanding of these relationships is critical for successful management of marine and coastal systems. In these systems, widely dispersed field or ship-based observations and lack of broad scale data have historically precluded quantification of large-scale patterns and processes and hindered management efforts. However, relatively recent advances in geographic information systems, remote sensing and computer technologies have begun to address these issues and are now permitting assessments of pattern and process in oceans. The intent of this special issue is to highlight research that is adapting the tools of landscape ecology to answer ecological questions within marine and coastal systems, to address the unique challenges faced in these landscapes, and to stimulate an exchange of ideas and solutions to common problems. Inspiration for this special issue of Landscape Ecology began with a special session on "Marine and Coastal Applications in Landscape Ecology" that was held at the 19th Annual Symposium of the United States Regional Association of the International Association for Landscape Ecology, March 31-April 2, 2004 in Las Vegas, Nevada.																	0921-2973						2008	23			1			1	5		10.1007/s10980-007-9141-3								WOS:000252922800001						
J	Houk, P; van Woesik, R				Houk, Peter; van Woesik, Robert			Dynamics of shallow-water assemblages in the Saipan Lagoon	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The Saipan Lagoon (Northern Mariana Islands) was first examined for benthic composition and habitat distribution in the late 1940s. Here, we employ a 4-stage approach to evaluate and explain change in the distribution of the 9 habitats previously demarcated. We show that there have been considerable reductions in seagrass, staghorn Acropora, and Acropora palifera dominated habitats (-3.72, -1.26, and -1.37 km(2), respectively) that were replaced by 6.16 km(2) of sand (similar to 20% of the lagoon area). Multiple regressions showed that the spatial extent of Enhalus seagrass was positively related with, and best predicted by, the adjacent watershed area and lagoon width. Although the interaction was not as strong, Enhalus also increased in accordance with human development. The size of the Halodule seagrass and macroalgal habitat was negatively related to water-flow velocities and positively related to human development, while its integrity (i.e. the density of seagrass within a given habitat) decreased with human development. Taken together, the results suggest Enhalus and Halodule respond differently to proxies of watershed pollution, and contradict contemporary doctrine linking pollution with reduced seagrass density. This study found no relationship between offshore habitats and watershed characteristics, but suggests their expansion and contraction on relatively short time scales is a result of large-scale disturbances such as typhoons. We posit that, while habitat integrity can be altered by human disturbances, habitat identity is only altered under extreme conditions. In summary, this study advances habitat mapping by increasing resolution and accuracy, which, in turn, improves the texture at which reef ecology is used by management.																	0171-8630						2008	356						39	50		10.3354/meps07252								WOS:000254963900004

Spatial predictability of juvenile fish species richness and abundance in a coral reef environment	CORAL REEFS												Juvenile reef fish communities represent an essential component of coral reef ecosystems in the current focus of fish population dynamics and coral reef resilience. Juvenile fish survival depends on habitat characteristics and is, following settlement, the first determinant of the number of individuals within adult populations. The goal of this study was to provide methods for mapping juvenile fish species richness and abundance into spatial domains suitable for micro and meso-scale analysis and management decisions. Generalized Linear Models predicting juvenile fish species richness and abundance were developed according to spatial and temporal environmental variables measured from 10 m up to 10 kin in the southwest lagoon of New Caledonia. The statistical model was further spatially generalized using a 1.5-m resolution, independently created, remotely sensed, habitat map. This procedure revealed that : (1) spatial factors at 10 to 100-m scale explained up to 71% of variability in juvenile species richness, (2) a small improvement (75%) was gained when a combination of environmental variables at different spatial and temporal scales was used and (3) the coupling of remotely sensed data, geographical information system tools and point-based ecological data showed that the highest species richness and abundance were predicted along a narrow margin overlapping the coral reef flat and adjacent seagrass beds. Spatially explicit models of species distribution may be relevant for the management of reef communities when strong relationships exist between faunistic and environmental variables and when models are built at appropriate scales.

This paper presents a method for estimating seagrass dry weight using a photo-library of classes of differing seagrass biomass. Field data were collected at seagrass beds in Ngederrak Reef, Palau, in 2006. Photos of 25 x 2.5 cm quadrats were taken prior to the collection the above-ground biomass for determination of biomass dry weight. Fifteen classes of seagrass biomass and substrate type were identified. The dry weight for each class of seagrass was measured in laboratory. A photo-library was created for biomass classification where each in situ quadrat photo is accompanied with seagrass dry weight of the sample and a photo of the sorted sample taken in laboratory. The photo-library of quadrats was then used to estimate seagrass biomass on photos gathered along 100 m long transects at 2 m intervals. This procedure was conducted by three different observers. The seagrass dry weight estimates were consistent between interpreters even if one of the interpreters had no experience in seagrass research. This approach allows quick collection of seagrass dry weight data over large areas. The method can be used for creating seagrass biomass maps by snorkelling/diving and/or for calibrating and validating biomass maps created by remote sensing. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Application of color infrared aerial photography to assess macroalgal distribution in an eutrophic estuary, upper Newport Bay, California	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Newport Bay is a large estuary in southern California that is subject to anthropogenic nutrient loading, eutrophication, and hypoxia. Ground-based methods of assessing algal extent for monitoring and management are limited in that they cannot provide a synoptic view of algal distribution over comparatively large areas. The goal of this study was to explore the application of color infrared aerial photography as an alternative for analyzing the changes in the abundance of exposed macroalgae. Three surveys combining remote sensing (color infrared aerial photography) and ground-based sampling to quantify macroalgal mat coverage were carried out in Upper Newport Bay (UNB) between July and October 2005. Airborne photographs (scale 1:6000) collected during daytime low tides, clear skies, and appropriate sun angle were digitized to 25-cm resolution, orthorectified, georegistered, and combined into three mosaic composite digital images: one for each survey. During each aerial photography survey, macroalgal percent cover was measured on the ground by the point-intercept method in a 6.25-m(2) area at ca. 30 locations distributed along the water's edge throughout the intertidal mudflat area. There were three main types of cover: Ulva spp. (green algae), Ceramium spp. (red algae), and bare surface (mud and mussel beds). To analyze similarities between spectral signatures in the images and cover types, the pixels corresponding to the ground samples from each survey were grouped into clusters based on similarity of their spectral signatures. To establish relationships between spectral signatures in the images and cover as determined from ground data, pixels in each composite image corresponding to ground samples from the same day that were characterized by > 90% of one cover type were attributed to that cover type. Ground samples comprised of a mixture of cover types were used for accuracy assessment. Before classification, each digital image was transformed by the Minimum Noise Fraction Rotation method to remove noise and enhance contrast between the classes. For classification of each composite image, the Spectral Angle Mapper scheme was used: all pixels in each image were attributed to the identified classes and the areal extent of each class was estimated. According to these assessments, the macroalgal coverage in UNB increased from 37% in July to 57% in September to 80% in October, and during this time Ulva spp. replaced Ceramium spp. as the dominant alga. This analysis showed that color infrared aerial photography is an effective tool for assessing estuarine, intertidal macroalgal coverage.

Reduction in water clarity, through increased turbidity and increased nutrient concentrations, is considered to be the primary cause of seagrass loss. Recent studies have indicated the need for new methods that will enable early detection of decline in seagrass extent and productivity, over large areas. In this review of current literature on coastal remote sensing, we examine the ability of remote sensing to serve as an information provider for seagrass monitoring. Remote sensing offers the potential to map the extent of seagrass cover and monitor changes in these with high accuracy for shallow waters. The accuracy of mapping seagrasses in deeper waters is unclear. Recent advances in sensor technology and radiometric transfer modelling have resulted in the ability to map suspended sediment, sea surface temperature and below-surface irradiance. It is therefore potentially possible to monitor the factors that cause the decline in seagrass status. When the latest products in remote sensing are linked to seagrass production models, it may serve as an early-warning system for seagrass decline and ultimately allow a better management of these susceptible ecosystems.

Relationship between the evolution of the shoreline and the Posidonia oceanica meadow limit in a Sardinian coastal zone	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Important environmental changes have been observed for some coastal processes in the Gulf of Oristano (west coast of Sardinia, Italy). With remote sensing as the principal tool, this study aims to assess littoral evolution over time (1977-2000) and to evaluate whether there is a relationship between the evolutionary trend of the shoreline and that of the upper limit of the Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile meadow. Results show that some portions of the coastline, mainly located on the sandy part of the littoral, have encountered significant variations that can be partially related to the evolution of the upper limit of the P. oceanica meadow. Mainly of natural origins, this evolutionary trend has also been related to anthropogenic pressures put on the seagrass meadow. This finding confirms that Posidonia meadows significantly affect the littoral geomorphology, providing biogenic sediments, controlling beach slope, and acting as a '' brake '' on coastal water masses.

Optimal scales to observe habitat dynamics: A coral reef example	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												A new technique to estimate the characteristic length scales (CLSs) of real ecological systems provides an objective means to identify the optimal scale(s) of observation to best detect underlying dynamical trends. Application of the technique to natural systems has focused on identifying appropriate scales to measure the dynamics of species as descriptors of community and ecosystem dynamics. However, ecosystem monitoring is often based not on assessing single species, but on species assemblages, functional groups, or habitat types. We asked whether the concept of CLSs based on dynamic interactions among species could be extended to examine interactions among habitat types and thus to identify optimal scales for observing habitat dynamics. A time series of three spatial maps of benthic habitats on a Caribbean coral reef was constructed from aerial photographs, Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) images, and IKONOS satellite images, providing the short time sequence required for this technique. We estimated the CLS based on the dynamics of three distinct habitat types: dense stands of seagrass, sparse stands of seagrass, and Montastrea patch reefs. Despite notable differences in the areal extent of and relative change in these habitats over the 21-year observation period, analyses based on each habitat type indicated a similar CLS of similar to 300 m. We interpret the consistency of CLSs among habitats to indicate that the dynamics of the three habitat types are linked. The results are encouraging, and they indicate that CLS techniques can be used to identify the appropriate scale at which to monitor ecosystem trends on the basis of the dynamics of only one of a disparate suite of habitat types.

Spectral reflectance of the seagrasses: Thalassia testudinum, Halodule wrightii, Syringodium filiforme and five marine algae	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Spectral reflectance of three Western Atlantic subtropical/tropical dominant benthic seagrasses (Thalassia testudinum, Halodule wrightii and Syringodium filiforme) measured in the laboratory by UNIspec Spectral Analysis system over 400-1000 nm are compared to five Western Atlantic dominant benthic and intertidal algae (Fucus vesiculosus, Ulva lactuca, Halimeda incrassata, Udotea flabellum and Penicillus capitatus). Thalassia spectra are also compared to previously studied forest species, showing that the spectral reflectance signature of Thalassia was of the same general shape as forest species, but of lesser peak height (18% vs 28-50%) in the 750-759 nm range. For marine plants, near-infrared reflectance of Thalassia, Syringodium and Halodule was intermediate (18%) between the ubiquitous green alga Ulva (15%) and the temperate brown alga, Fucus (27%). The brown alga had a unique spectral signature in the first difference spectrum (three secondary peaks at differing spectral values than the other species' secondary peaks). Comparisons between Halodule, Syringodium and Thalassia near-infrared peaks and Halimeda (58%), Penicillus (29%) and Udotea (42%), subtropical/tropical algae, were also carried out. Halimeda differed most from the other green algae in terms of numerous oscillations from 450 to 700 nm seen in the first difference spectrum. The three seagrasses were similar in spectral reflectance curve shape to one another but differed somewhat in peak height. The first difference spectrum was helpful in pointing out subtle differences among the species and between algae and seagrass. Spectral reflectance data such as those presented here appear potentially useful for remote sensing of shallow habitats, and may additionally be used to monitor their health.

Modeling coupling between eelgrass Zostera marina and water flow	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Ecological effects caused by submerged aquatic vegetation not only depend on the plants and their morphology but also on the flow and transport patterns of dissolved and suspended constituents near the canopy. Canopy height is a major variable in any quantitative analysis of plant biomass and constituent transport in its vicinity. Height of eelgrass Zostera marina canopies changes due to bending of the blades under varying current regimes. In this paper, I mathematically modeled the coupling between eelgrass blade bending and water flow. Based on the balance of forces of drag, lift, friction, weight and buoyancy on a single blade, the model defined the bending of blades (i.e. height of canopy) and the flow response within and above the canopy. This coupling was tested using laboratory data and indicated that the model performed adequately. Both model results and laboratory data confirmed that the bending of blades, and hence canopy height, was very sensitive to current magnitude and directly influenced current profile. Identifying canopy height is a major factor in defining spatial distribution of grass biomass from optical or acoustic remote sensing devices. The model has direct implications for biological issues related to the plants themselves and to their associated organisms, such as the vertical distribution of photosynthesis within the canopy and the effect of current shear on recruitment of organisms on the blades. It can also be used to study how eelgrass canopies affect horizontal transport of constituents, such as dissolved oxygen, nutrients and organic carbon, and particulate material such as pollen, larvae, plankton and detritus.																	0171-8630						2007	338						81	96		10.3354/meps338081								WOS:000247480200008

We used high spatial resolution QuickBird-2 satellite remote sensing data to map both terrestrial and submerged aquatic vegetation communities of the National Seashore. We adopted a stratified classification and unsupervised classification approach for mapping terrestrial vegetation types. Our classification scheme included detailed terrestrial vegetation types identified by previous vegetation mapping efforts of the National Park Service and three generalized categories of high-density seagrass, low-density seagrass coverages, and unvegetated bottom to map the submerged aquatic vegetation habitats. We used underwater videography, GPS-guided field reference photography, and bathymetric data to support remote sensing image classification and information extraction. This study achieved approximately 82% and 75% overall classification accuracy for the terrestrial and submnerged aquatic vegetations, respectively, and provided an updated vegetation inventory and change analysis for the Northeast Coastal and Barrier Network of the National Park Service.																	0149-0419	1521-060X					2007	30	1-2					77	95		10.1080/01490410701296226								WOS:000251571400005						
J	Forster, RM; Jesus, B				Forster, Rodney M.; Jesus, Bruno			Field spectroscopy of estuarine intertidal habitats	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING					Conference on Studying Land Use Effects in Coastal Zones with Remote Sensing and GIS	AUG 13-16, 2003	Kemer, TURKEY					The recent introduction of portable, low-cost hyperspectral radiometers for measuring the reflectance of marine intertidal habitats has considerable promise, first as a source of reference spectra for airborne and satellite remote sensing, and second as a survey technique in its own right. This paper reports on the results of an intercalibration exercise in which two designs of commercially available instruments were used to measure reflectance spectra across a diverse, intertidal site. The substrates sampled included seagrasses, macroalgae, and sediments which varied in wetness and grain size. Spectra were compared statistically using several measures of similarity, and the results showed a high degree of correlation between the measured reflectance spectra. There were no significant differences between instruments from different manufacturers in the shape of reflectance spectra, but the signal-to-noise ratio varied considerably between individual instruments. Spectra measured by operators with lesser experience in field spectrometry tended to be more variable than those of more experienced operators, indicating that training and adherence to set protocols are important when implementing this method in the field situation. Spatial plots derived from field spectra showed essentially the same trends in surface features as plots created using traditional sampling and remote sensing methods. Furthermore, the use of field spectrometry as a stand-alone, low-cost method for rapidly mapping the distribution of major habitat types was demonstrated by the results of a survey of a large intertidal sandbank.

Mapping Posidonia oceanica from IKONOS	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Posidonia oceanica is the dominant seagrass in the Mediterranean Sea that affects biological, biogeochemical and physical processes in Mediterranean coastal areas. The widespread loss of this species is attributed to excessive anthropic pressure and other large-scale environmental changes. Seagrass conservation requires mapping to estimate the extent of existing stocks and to measure changes over time. Optical remote sensing provides a cost-effective method to monitor vast areas of shallow waters that are potential P. oceanica habitat. As part of an interdisciplinary research effort, where the effects of these seagrasses on the hydrodynamics were investigated, new technologies of reliable, fast and effective monitoring of R oceanica were essential. This paper presents a method for using IKONOS multispectral imagery for bottom classification in a shallow coastal area of Mallorca (Balearic Islands). After applying a supervised classification, pixels are automatically classified in four classes: sand, rock, P oceanica bottoms and unclassifiable pixels. Results indicate that, in these clear waters, the spectral response of P. oceanica can be determined to a depth of about 15 m. In order to validate the method, the image classification is compared with a bottom classification derived from an acoustical survey. Agreement with the reference acoustic seabed classification is up to 84% for the sampled area. Spectral IKONOS image analysis is presented as an effective approach for monitoring P. oceanica meadows in most clear, shallow waters of the western Mediterranean.

Through complementary field work the potential of the technique for change detection was verified. The general changes in SAV cover were examined using Landsat images from 1986, 1987, 1998, 2001 and 2003. Two of these images, from 1987 (Landsat TM) and 2003 (Landsat ETM+), were specifically analysed to create a map of the change in SAV cover. Overall, the general distribution of SAV stayed fairly stable over the period investigated, but the result also showed regions where significant alterations, both losses and gains, had occurred between the two years. Based on our findings and anecdotal information from local fishermen and seaweed farmers potential causative factors are discussed. It was concluded that a repeated mapping with satellite remote sensing is a suitable tool to monitor changes of seagrass and seaweed distribution in shallow tropical environments.

J	Roelfsema, CM; Phinn, SR; Dennison, WC; Dekker, AG; Brando, VE				Roelfsema, CM; Phinn, SR; Dennison, WC; Dekker, AG; Brando, VE			Monitoring toxic cyanobacteria Lyngbya majuscula (Gomont) in Moreton Bay, Australia by integrating satellite image data and field mapping	HARMFUL ALGAE												Large-scale blooms of Lyngbya majuscula (Gomont) have occurred throughout Moreton Bay (south-east Queensland) and have been documented since 1997. L. majuscula is a toxic cyanobacteria which fixes nitrogen and is found attached to: seagrass, algae and coral. The toxic and smothering nature of L. majuscula has affected human and environmental health in sensitive coastal ecosystems. To reduce these impacts, monitoring is an essential component of studying the origins and development of L. majuscula blooms. An accurate and cost effective means to map the extent of a bloom and its biophysical properties is needed. This study presents an operational approach for mapping the extent of L. majuscula blooms in the clear and shallow water regions of Moreton Bay, eastern Australia, from a combination of field and remotely sensed data sets. The ability to discriminate L. majuscula from other substrate types over a range of depths was first examined using detailed field reflectance spectra, measured optical properties of Moreton Bay waters and a radiative transfer model (Hydrolight 4.1). A two-stage process was then used to map L. majuscula. The spatial extent of L. majuscula and other major substrate types was first recorded from a boat-based survey by marine park authorities using point-based GPS measurements. This sampling was timed to coincide with an overpass of the Landsat 7 ETM+ sensor. When the results of the boat-based mapping detected more than 25% L. majuscula cover in the study area, a cloud free Landsat 7 ETM+ image was acquired for that date. In the second stage of mapping, selected field survey data provided the basis for a supervised classification of the ETM+ image data to map L. majuscula. Effort and accuracy assessment of both field and image mapping methods indicated a trade-off between areal coverage and mapping accuracy. The Landsat 7 ETM+ based mapping procedure provided 100% areal coverage with 58% accuracy. In contrast, the boat-based field survey method covered only 0.5% of the study area, but with almost 100% mapping accuracy. The approach outlined in this work has been adopted as a standard operating procedure in Moreton Bay. This study illustrates how remote sensing can be combined with field monitoring, to provide marine park authorities with useful information to understand and manage blooms. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Nakaoka, M				Nakaoka, M			Plant-animal interactions in seagrass beds: ongoing and future challenges for understanding population and community dynamics	POPULATION ECOLOGY												Seagrass beds are some of the most productive parts of coastal ecosystems, hosting a wide variety of associated fauna. This paper reviews recent studies of animal-plant interactions in seagrass beds, focusing particularly on studies conducted in Japan and Thailand. Although the positive effect of seagrass habitat structure on animals has been widely acknowledged, the magnitude of this effect varies greatly among studies. A comparative study on epifaunal communities and a manipulative experiment using an infaunal bivalve revealed that behavioral and life-history traits of component species and their interactions influence the observed variation. Some recent studies have challenged the previously accepted view that direct herbivory on seagrasses is rare, and has a minor effect on the seagrass community. A series of studies of dugong herbivory revealed that the marine mammal has great impacts not only on seagrass productivity but also on the infaunal community. Furthermore, it has been found that seed predators have a negative influence on seed production and the subsequent recruitment of seagrass. Recent studies have also demonstrated significant effects of fine-scale landscape patterns in seagrass vegetation on productivity, species interactions and community structure in seagrass beds. Future research integrating new concepts and theories in ecology, such as metapopulation and hierarchy theories, with new research tools, such as molecular-genetic analyses and remote-sensing techniques, may aid in developing a more comprehensive understanding of population and community dynamics in seagrass beds.																	1438-3896					DEC	2005	47	3					167	177		10.1007/s10144-005-0226-z								WOS:000233725100002

The lake benthic material was classified into sets of spectral classes representing the patterns and texture of the ecosystem, and then linked to environmentally relevant labels through a radiative transfer model. The classification results for 2002 achieved an accuracy of 76% for the least understood areas; other areas were significantly better, but not quantified. Classification results of 1988, 1991, and 1995 were consistent with past surveys and maps. Based on the change detection from 1988 to 2002 Posidonia, Ruppia and Halophila change slightly in the 14 year period from 1988 to 2002. However, Zostera has undergone significant change and adaptation. Early in the time series (between 1988 and 1991) a reduction in Zostera beds was evident, especially in the middle and south of the take with some areas not returning by 2002. Epiphytic growth over Zostera could be a confounding factor here, but the Landsat sensors do not have sufficient spectral resolution to detect these subtleties. Hyperspectral remote sensing could resolve this issue more clearly. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Coastal ocean color remote sensing techniques permit benthic habitats to be explored with higher resolution than ever before. The objective of this research was to develop an accurate benthic habitat map for an area off the northwest coast of Roatan Island, Honduras, using high-resolution multispectral IKONOS data. Atmospheric (Rayleigh and aerosol path radiance) and water column corrections (water depth and water column attenuation) were applied to the imagery, making it a robust method for mapping benthic habitats. Water depth for each pixel was calculated based on a site-specific polynomial model. A mechanistic radiative transfer approach was developed that removed the confound effect of the water column (absorption and scattering) from the imagery to retrieve an estimate of the bottom reflectance (albedo). Albedos were <= 12% for seagrass benthos, 12% to 24% for coral areas, and >= 24% for sand-dominated areas. The retrieved bottom albedos were then used to classify the benthos, generating a detailed map of benthic habitats, followed by accuracy assessment.																	0196-2892					JUL	2005	43	7					1592	1604		10.1109/TGRS.2005.847790								WOS:000230149900017

In the present study, the visible bands of the Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor aboard Landsat 7 satellite were used in a supervised classification of benthic habitats and for the assessment of submerged vegetation biomass in Los Roques Archipelago National Park, Venezuela. Initially, the TM visible bands were log-transformed and linearly combined to reduce the depth-dependent variance in the bottom reflectance signal. The supervised classification had an overall accuracy of 74%. Eight bottom types could be spectrally separated: sand, dispersed communities over sand (shallow and deep), dense seagrass, dispersed seagrass meadows over sand, reef communities, mixed vegetation over muddy bottom, and lagoons. Regression analyses were performed between the depth-invariant band combinations and field samples of vegetation biomass. The regression using the TM band 2 and 3 combination accounted for 64% of the variability of submerged vegetation biomass. According to these estimates, seagrass meadows with biomass between 64-96 g m(-2) and 96-128 g m(-2) predominate in the Los Roques Archipelago National Park.																	0143-1161					JUN 20	2005	26	12					2657	2667		10.1080/01431160500104111								WOS:000230731900010						
J	Meehan, AJ; Williams, RJ; Watford, FA				Meehan, AJ; Williams, RJ; Watford, FA			Detecting trends in seagrass abundance using aerial photograph interpretation: Problems arising with the evolution of mapping methods	ESTUARIES												In the late 1970s and early 1980s an inventory of seagrass distribution in southeast Australia was made from multiscale aerial photographs using a simple analog mapping method, referred to here as the Camera lucida technique. Four priority estuaries were remapped in 2003, also using multi-scale aerial photographs, but using a geographic information system (GIS)-based analog mapping technique. We quantified the degree of error that arose when estimates of seagrass distribution were compared for the two techniques by reassessing, with GIS, the same aerial photographs used earlier for four estuaries: Port Hacking, Bermagui River, Merimbula, Lake, and St Georges Basin. Camera lucida produced a larger estimate of total seagrass area than GIS in all four locations: 8% of total seagrass area or 12.9 ha in Port Hacking, 15% or 5 ha in Bermagui River, 20% or 38.0 ha in Merimbula Lake, and 243% or 502.2 ha in St Georges Basin. The consistent and moderate discrepancy in Port Hacking, Bermagui River, and Merimbula Lake was attributed mainly to differences between Camera lucida and GIS, such as the tendency of Camera lucida to overestimate seagrass area by amalgamating disjunct seagrass patches into continuous meadows. The large discrepancy at St Georges Basin was attributed to interoperator error; i.e., the operators who mapped photographs taken in 1979 had widely differing interpretations of the aerial photographs. A 20-yr trend was calculated for each estuary using either the Camera lucida or revised GIS value as the start point. Perceived management status of the seagrass depended greatly on the initial data used. In St Georges Basin, a catastrophic decline (65%, 553.9 ha) occurred based on the Camera lucida-GIS comparison, but only a small decline (14.7%, 51.8 ha) when all photos were GIS assessed. In view of the technical developments in habitat mapping, evaluation of change in seagrass abundance using remote sensing needs an assessment of intra-operator error, inter-operator error, and systemic error before maps produced by superseded technology are considered useful baselines.																	0160-8347					JUN	2005	28	3					462	472		10.1007/BF02693927								WOS:000230877300013

Further complications can arise when algae are not permanently attached to the substratum and drift with tides and currents. A study using acoustic seafloor discrimination was conducted in the Indian River Lagoon (Florida, USA) to determine the extent of drift algae and seagrass. Acoustic surveys using the QTC View V system based on 50 and 200 kHz transducers were conducted near Sebastian Inlet. Results indicate that areas of seagrass can be identified, and are mixed with a high abundance of drift algae. Nearest-neighbor extrapolation was used to fill in spaces between survey lines and thus obtain spatially cohesive maps. These maps were then ground-truthed using data from towed video and compared using confusion matrices. The maps showed a high level of agreement (60%) with the actual distribution of algae, however some confusion existed between bare sand and algae as well as seagrass.

Satellite image data and derived maps of water column and substrate biophysical properties provide an opportunity to develop baseline mapping and monitoring programs for coastal and coral reef ecosystem health indicators. A significant challenge for satellite image data in coastal and coral reef water bodies is the mixture of both clear and turbid waters. A new approach is presented in this paper to enable production of water quality and substrate cover type maps, linked to a field based coastal ecosystem health indicator monitoring program, for use in turbid to clear coastal and coral reef waters. An optimized optical domain method was applied to map selected water quality (Secchi depth, Kd PAR, tripton, CDOM) and substrate cover type (seagrass, algae, sand) parameters. The approach is demonstrated using commercially available Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper image data over a coastal embayment exhibiting the range of substrate cover types and water quality conditions commonly found in sub-tropical and tropical coastal environments. Spatially extensive and quantitative maps of selected water quality and substrate cover parameters were produced for the study site. These map products were refined by interactions with management agencies to suit the information requirements of their monitoring and management programs. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite the perceived importance, system-wide assessments of cover, susceptibility to change, and ecological functioning are rare because of the geographical scope and multidisciplinary expertise required. A collaboration between scientists, estuarine managers, and environmental educators was initiated to map the SAV and the Eurasian water chestnut (Trapa natans) in the Hudson River estuary from Hastings-on-Hudson north to Troy, New York. These groups provided diverse scientific and estuarine management expertise to enable the first broad delimitation of SAV in the Hudson and sampling of beds to describe abundance, biomass, and species composition and to address management and education needs and opportunities. The areal extent of SAV based on a combination of 1995 and 1997 photographs in the study area was 1,802 hectares (4,453 acres), similar to6% of the river area and similar to18% of the shallows (defined as less than 3 meters deep at low tide). Trapa natans covered 575 hectares (1,421 acres), 2% of the river area and 6% of the shallows. In the most heavily vegetated portion of the Hudson (approximately 150-200 kilometers of river), the coverage by plants (both SAV and T natans) approached 25% of the river bottom area. Results of this work have been integrated into the federal and state regulatory processes, local resource users, and local science education programs.

Agardh and Sargassum mangarevense (Grunow) Setchell on heterogeneous Tahitian coral reefs using 4-meter resolution IKONOS satellite data	CORAL REEFS												Turbinaria ornata and Sargassum mangarevense (Halophyte, Sargassaceae) are two Fucales that have strong biotechnological potential for the cosmetic industries. To plan for the harvesting of these two species on Tahiti (French Polynesia, South Pacific Ocean) reefs, their total biomass is estimated for three morphologically different reefs using a combination of field data and three 4-m resolution IKONOS satellite images. Fieldwork provided mean algal cover for each of the main habitats of the reefs and a ubiquitous relationship linking percent cover and biomass. Images were used to map the spatial extent of the habitats. Image classification resulted in an overall habitat map accuracy of 70%. For the three reefs, the total biomass was 153,565 +/- 73,441, 561,718 +/- 192,956, and 215,203 +/- 75,012 tons of dry matter, which yielded a mean areal biomass of 0.173 +/- 0.083 kg.m(-2),0.133 +/- 0.046 kg.m(-2), and 0.193 +/- 0.067 kg.m(-2) (dry matter). The different total and areal biomass reflect different reef structures and the abundance of suitable substratum for algal settlement. Images reveal the spatial distribution of the algae, mostly located on the outer edges (crest and dense back-reef) of the reefs. Since percent cover data were collected during the cool season when algal densities are at their highest, the computed biomasses are maxima.

J	Karpouzli, E; Malthus, TJ; Place, CJ				Karpouzli, E; Malthus, TJ; Place, CJ			Hyperspectral discrimination of coral reef benthic communities in the western Caribbean	CORAL REEFS												Determining a subset of wavelengths that best discriminates reef benthic habitats and their associated communities is essential for the development of remote sensing techniques to monitor them. This study measured spectral reflectance from 17 species of western Caribbean reef biota including coral, algae, seagrasses, and sediments, as well as healthy and diseased coral. It sought to extend the spectral library of reef-associated species found in the literature and to test the spectral discrimination of a hierarchy of habitats, community groups, and species. We compared results from hyperspectral reflectance and derivative datasets to those simulated for the three visible multispectral wavebands of the IKONOS sensor. The best discriminating subset of wavelengths was identified by multivariate stepwise selection procedure (discriminant function analysis). Best discrimination at all levels was obtained using the derivative dataset based on 6-15 non-contiguous wavebands depending on the level of the classification, followed by the hyperspectral reflectance dataset which was based on as few as 2-4 non-contiguous wavebands. IKONOS wavebands performed worst. The best discriminating subset of wavelengths in the three classification resolutions, and particularly those of the medium resolution, was in agreement with those identified by Hochberg and Atkinson (2003) and Hochberg et al. (2003) for reef communities worldwide. At all levels of classification, reflectance wavebands selected by the analysis were similar to those reported in recent studies carried out elsewhere, confirming their applicability in different biogeographical regions. However the greater accuracies achieved using the derivative datasets suggests that hyperspectral data is required for the most accurate classification of reef biotic systems.

Coral reefs are often remote, relatively large and shallow. Thus, optical remote sensing techniques provide an efficient and cost-effective approach to mapping and monitoring the condition of reefs. We tested the hypothesis that in-situ spectral signatures, together with water column attenuation measurements, satellite imagery and Geographical Information System, can effectively differentiate reef substrates. In situ upwelling radiances were collected for coarse descriptive habitat types near Lee Stocking Island, Bahamas between 17 July and 27 July, 1998. Down-looking spectral scans from 300-750 nm were taken 1 m above the substrate and 1 m below the water surface, using a LiCor-1800 underwater spectroradiometer. Principal component analysis of upwelling radiances indicated that wavelengths from 515-580 nm are most useful in distinguishing between substrates. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) multi-spectral imagery was geo-registered and an ISODATA unsupervised classification was used to delineate reef features and associated communities. Using this method, we achieved an overall accuracy of 74% for coarse descriptive resolution mapping of seven substrate types (i.e. ocean, deep sand, shallow sand, deep coral, shallow coral, seagrass, and mixed sand and seagrass) within an area of 590 km(2) near Lee Stocking Island.																	0143-1161					JUL 10	2003	24	13					2627	2639		10.1080/0143116031000066990								WOS:000184005900005

Therefore, mapping seagrass beds is indispensable in the management and conservation of sound littoral ecosystems, and in the development of sustainable fisheries in coastal waters. Multi-beam sonar is often used to map bottom topography. We developed a mapping method to quantify the volume of seagrass using a multi-beam sonar. Seagrass beds were scanned with the multi-beam sonar and quadrat sampled to verify the distribution of seagrasses. We used software to discriminate seagrass signals from echoes to obtain a topographic profile of the bottom without seagrass this was then subtracted from the topography including the seagrass. We then mapped seagrass distribution, calculated seagrass volume, and estimated biomass using volume and quadrat samples. We applied these methods to map a seagrass bed of Zostera caulescens in Otsuchi Bay, on the Sanriku Coast of Japan, during the growing season of 2001. A transducer was attached to a boat (one gross ton) equipped with a differential-GPS, a motion sensor, and a gyrocompass. The vessel completed a grid survey scanning whole seagrass bed with an area of 115 m x 156 m at bottom depths between 2 and 8 in within about 40 min when traveling at a speed of 1.5 m s(-1) (3 knots). The multi-beam sonar was able to visualize three-dimensional seagrass distribution without interpolation and easily to estimate area and volume occupied by the seagrass using hydrography software. The results indicated that Z. caulescens was distributed at bottom depths of 6-7 m with a surface area of 3 628 m(2) and a volume of 1 368 m(3). The mean biomass of above- and below-ground parts of seagrass were estimated to be 28.6 gDW m(-2) (range 26.6-30.9) and 15.9 gDW m(-2) (range 14.1-17.7). Our study demonstrated that multi-beam sonar is effective for mapping and quantifying the spatial distribution of seagrass beds, and for visualizing the landscape of the seagrass canopy.

This problem is common in wide field-of-view images where there is limited control on acquisition conditions other than cloud cover. To eliminate most of these wave and glint patterns, we use the near-infrared band, which exhibits maximum absorption and minimal water leaving radiance over clear waters, to characterize the spatial distribution of relative glint intensity, which is then scaled by absolute glint intensities in each of the visible bands. The result is subtracted from the visible bands, thus filtering out glint effects. Corrected visible bands clearly reveal seabed structural features obscured in the original data. Before- and after-correction classifications of an Ikonos image of Lee Stocking Island (Bahamas) reveal an improvement of user's accuracies for critical benthic habitat classes such as coral-dominated habitat (46.8% versus 60.5%) or dense seagrass beds (31.7% versus 52.1%). This technique offers potential to use previously discarded sections of high spatial resolution airborne or satellite images of optically shallow water for mapping substrate features.																	0196-2892					JUL	2003	41	7	2				1724	1729		10.1109/TGRS.2003.815408								WOS:000184820100003

The classes are defined by using a set of multiple spectral decision rules based on the image spectral bands. A general model is applied to the entire Southwest lagoon (5500 km(2)) and tested on three representative sites: a section of the barrier reef, a cay reef flat rich in corals, and a cay reef flat rich in algae and seagrass beds. In the latter one, the classification results are compared with a locally optimized model, with aerial color photographs and extensive ground-truthed observations. Results show that a reconnaissance of the main benthic habitats in shallow areas (<5 m depth) is possible, at a geomorphological scale for coral reef structure and at a habitat scale for seagrass beds. However, results directly issued from the model must be cautiously interpreted according to empirical spatial rules, especially to avoid confusion between coral slopes and shallow dense seagrass.

J	Hochberg, EJ; Atkinson, MJ; Andrefouet, S				Hochberg, EJ; Atkinson, MJ; Andrefouet, S			Spectral reflectance of coral reef bottom-types worldwide and implications for coral reef remote sensing	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Coral reef benthic communities are mosaics of individual bottom-types that are distinguished by their taxonomic composition and functional roles in the ecosystem. Knowledge of community structure is essential to understanding many reef processes. To develop techniques for identification and mapping of reef bottom-types using remote sensing, we measured 13, 100 in situ optical reflectance spectra (400-700 nm, 1-nm intervals) of 12 basic reef bottom-types in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans: fleshy (1) brown, (2) green, and (3) red algae; non-fleshy (4) encrusting calcareous and (5) turf algae; (6) bleached, (7) blue, and (8) brown hermatypic coral; (9) soft/gorgonian coral; (10) seagrass; (11) terrigenous mud; and (12) carbonate sand. Each bottom-type exhibits characteristic spectral reflectance features that are conservative across biogeographic regions. Most notable are the brightness of carbonate sand and local extrema near 570 nm in blue (minimum) and brown (maximum) corals. Classification function analyses for the 12 bottom-types achieve mean accuracies of 83%, 76%, and 71% for full-spectrum data (301-wavelength), 52-wavelength, and 14-wavelength subsets, respectively. The distinguishing spectral features for the 12 bottom-types exist in well-defined, narrow (10-20 nm) wavelength ranges and are ubiquitous throughout the world. We reason that spectral reflectance features arise primarily as a result of spectral absorption processes. Radiative transfer modeling shows that in typically clear coral reef waters, dark substrates such as corals have a depth-of-detection limit on the order of 10-20 in. Our results provide the foundation for design of a sensor with the purpose of assessing the global status of coral reefs.

Low salinity water can transport natural and manmade river-borne contaminants into the sea, and can directly stress marine ecosystems that are adapted to higher salinity levels. An efficient method of mapping surface salinity distribution over large ocean areas is required to address such environmental issues. We describe here an investigation of the utility of airborne remote sensing of sea surface salinity using an L-band passive microwave radiometer. The study combined aircraft overflights of the scanning low frequency microwave radiometer (SLFMR) with shipboard and in situ instrument deployments to map surface and subsurface salinity distributions, respectively, in the Great Barrier Reef Lagoon. The goals of the investigation were (a) to assess the performance of the airborne salinity mapper; (b) to use the maps and in situ data to develop an integrated description of the structure and zone of influence of a river plume under prevailing monsoon weather conditions; and (c) to determine the extent to which the sea surface salinity distribution expressed the subsurface structure. The SLFMR was found to have sufficient precision (1 psu) and accuracy ( similar to 3 psu) to provide a useful description of plumes emanating from estuaries of moderate discharge levels with a salinity range of 16 to 32 psu in the open sea. The aircraft surveys provided a means of rapidly assessing the spatial extent of the surface salinity distribution of the plume, while in situ data revealed subsurface structure detail and provided essential validation data for the SLFMR. The combined approach allowed us to efficiently determine the structure and zone of influence of the plume, and demonstrated the utility of sea surface salinity remote sensing for studying coastal circulation in tropical seas.

A control of these wetlands needs the creation of an inventory of knowledge for the concerned environment. In this perspective, the seagrass beds were followed up in the coastal lagoon of Urbino (Corse, France) since 1990. A cartographic study was carried out by remote sensing of aerial photography. Temporal evolution of the seagrass beds (Cymodocea nodosa principally) allows to determine the vitality of these structures. A comparison of the surface areas occupied by Cymodocea nodosa, between 1990 and 1999, did not allow seeing any significant evolution. However, some variations appear like biotopes all more fragile and coveted as the Mediterranean coastal fringe is straight and is the privileged site of appear in the localization of the beds, due to the modification of environmental conditions in the lagoon.

J	Ackleson, SG				Ackleson, SG			Light in shallow waters: A brief research review	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Until recently, optical processes in shallow water, where a large portion of solar photons penetrate to the ocean floor, has received little attention outside of a relatively small number of modeling and remote sensing investigations. In the open ocean, scales of variability in relation to optical attenuation length often permit the treatment of the in-water light field as a one-dimensional, depth-dependent problem. In shallow waters hosting productive benthic ecosystems, such as coral reefs or seagrasses, the in-water light field is often three-dimensional in character. In the past decade, quantitative investigations of benthic optical properties and the resulting shallow-water light field have been conducted, fueled by a variety of new sensors designed specifically to address the shallow water problem. Recent publications, as well as the papers contained in this volume, illustrate the rich diversity and interdisciplinary nature of shallow-water optical problems and highlight important issues that should attract closer attention in the future.																	0024-3590					JAN	2003	48	1	2				323	328		10.4319/lo.2003.48.1_part_2.0323								WOS:000182049800001

A mechanistic radiative transfer approach is developed that first removes the distorting influence of the water column on the remotely sensed signal to retrieve an estimate of the reflectance at the seafloor. The retrieved bottom reflectance is then used to classify the benthos. This spectrally based approach is advantageous because model components are separate and can be evaluated and modified individually for different environments. Here, we applied our approach to quantitatively estimate shallow-water bathymetry and leaf area index (LAI) of the seagrass Thalassia testudinum for a study site near Lee Stocking Island, Bahamas. Two high-resolution images were obtained from the ocean portable hyperspectral imager for low-light spectroscopy (Ocean PHILLS) over the study site in May 1999 and 2000. A combination of in situ observations of seafloor reflectance and radiative transfer modeling was used to develop and test our algorithm. Bathymetry was mapped to meter-scale resolution using a site-specific relationship (r(2) = 0.97) derived from spectral ratios of remote sensing reflectance at 555 and 670 nm. Depth-independent bottom reflectance was retrieved from remote sensing reflectance using bathymetry and tables of modeled water column attenuation coefficients. The magnitude of retrieved bottom reflectance was highly correlated to seagrass LAI measured from diver surveys at seven stations within the image (r(2) = 0.88-0.98). Mapped turtlegrass LAI was remarkably stable over a 2-yr period at our study site, even though Hurricane Floyd swept over the study site in September 1999.

J	Fyfe, SK				Fyfe, SK			Spatial and temporal variation in spectral reflectance: Are seagrass species spectrally distinct?	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The spectral signatures of the seagrasses Zostera capricorni, Posidonia australis, and Halophila ovalis were investigated to determine whether species could be discriminated by remote sensing. The spectral reflectance of fouled and unfouled leaf samples collected from marine and brackish habitats at three estuaries in southeastern Australia were measured in the field with a spectroradiometer during each season in 1999 and 2000. Seagrass species were spectrally distinct regardless of whether the leaves were fouled by epibionts and despite spatial and temporal variability in the reflectance of each species. The visible wavelengths that penetrate water coincide with the regions of maximum absorption and characteristic reflectance by plant photosynthetic and accessory pigments. Strong and consistent differences in reflectance between species were recorded in the green wavelengths at 530-580 nm with additional discrimination in the regions 520-530 nm and 580-600 nm and at the red chlorophyll absorption trough at 686-700 nm. Species discrimination should be possible in the remote sensing of benthic aquatic vegetation using a hyperspectral sensor that has narrow bands centered on pigment-related spectral features in the visible wavelengths. The detection of statistically significant differences in intraspecific reflectance associated with the year, season, estuary, and habitat of sample collection suggests a potential for monitoring seagrass health and estuarine water quality. This study has produced the first spectral library of aquatic plant species to take into account the range of spectral variability expected for the species under natural conditions. The results provide a sound basis for future mapping of seagrass species in Australia.

Past applications have been limited, however, by multispectral models that are typically difficult to apply when bottom types are heterogeneous and complex. We attempt to overcome these limitations by using a spectral library of remote sensing reflectance (R-rs), generated through radiative transfer computations, to classify image pixels according to bottom type and water depth. R-rs spectra were calculated for water epths ranging from 0.5 to 20 m at 0.5- to 1.0-m depth intervals using measured reflectance spectra from sediment, seagrass, and pavement bottom types and inherent optical properties of the water. To verify the library, computed upwelling radiance and downwelling irradiance spectra were compared to field measurements obtained with a hyperspectral tethered spectral radiometer buoy (TSRB). Comparisons between simulated spectra and TSRB data showed close matches in signal shape and magnitude. The library classification method was tested on hyperspectral data collected using a portable hyperspectral imager for low light spectroscopy (PHILLS) airborne sensor near Lee Stocking Island, Bahamas. Two hyperspectral images were classified using a minimum-distance method. Comparisons with ground truth data indicate that library classification can be successful at identifying bottom type and water depth information from hyperspectral imagery. With the addition of diverse sediments types and different species of corals, seagrass, and algae, spectral libraries will have the potential to serve as valuable tools for identifying characteristic wavelengths that can be incorporated into bottom classification and bathymetry algorithms.																	0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2003	48	1	2				511	521		10.4319/lo.2003.48.1_part_2.0511								WOS:000182049800020

Previous attempts at subsurface feature discrimination with satellite remote sensing have been limited in accuracy due to the effects of pixel mixing associated with poor spatial resolutions. While aerial reconnaissance may offer higher spatial resolutions than satellite sensors, it is often limited by the high costs of planning and implementing the missions, image rectification, area that can be covered, and repeat coverage. In this study, the Ikonos satellite with a 4- by 4-m spatial resolution in the multispectral bands was used as a tool for subsurface feature identification. The Single-Image Normalization Using Histogram Adjustment was used for atmospheric corrections on the imagery. Classification was peiformed using bands 1, 2, and 3 (blue, green, and red) to maximize the water-penetration capabilities of the sensor. An accuracy assessment of the classification results was performed using in situ data collected at 62 points one day prior to the image being acquired. It Was concluded that the Ikonos data were useful for discriminating sand, coral reef (at two depth intervals), and seagrass features (providing overall accuracies of 89 percent each for the two study areas). However, error still remained in discriminating small, diverse patch-reef features. This error (producers accuracy 67 percent) was found in the "Reef less than or equal to 5 m" class and was primarily attributed to the diversity of this spectral class, which may lead to a spectral signature based on the dominant cover type in a given pixel.

J	Mumby, PJ; Edwards, AJ				Mumby, PJ; Edwards, AJ			Mapping marine environments with IKONOS imagery: enhanced spatial resolution can deliver greater thematic accuracy	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The IKONOS 2 satellite was launched in late 1999 and carries the first commercial multispectral instrument to achieve 4 in spatial resolution. The cost and accuracy of using IKONOS imagery to map shallow-water marine environments is evaluated and compared directly to that using a suite of satellite and airborne instruments including Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) and Thematic Mapper (TM), Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) High-Resolution Visible (HRV) multispectral and panchromatic, and Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI). Evaluations were conducted in the Turks and Caicos Islands which are ideally suited to aquatic remote sensing because of the large areas of clear, shallow water containing a range of different habitats. Over 600 field sites were surveyed and used to define habitat categories, supervise image classification, and make an independent assessment of thematic map accuracy. For the high-resolution IKONOS imagery, pixel sizes were small enough to allow within-habitat textural information to be added to the classification. Making full use of this textural information in supervised classifications significantly improved (P<.01) thematic map accuracy for fine-level habitat discrimination (13 classes). Although significantly (P<.001) and almost 20% more accurate than Landsat TM, like other satellite-borne sensors, IKONOS data were unable adequately to discriminate 13 categories of coral, algal, and seagrass habitats (overall accuracy 50%). Comparison with CASI in a restricted area where only nine of these habitats were represented indicated that CASI (81% user accuracy) was significantly (P<.01) more accurate than IKONOS (64% user accuracy). Comparisons of IKONOS, Landsat TM, and CASI along a transect in the maximally penetrating blue part of the spectrum suggest that the poor descriptive resolution of satellite sensors is partly due to loss of radiance contrast, presumably as a result of atmospheric Rayleigh scattering. Problems of scattering, coupled with the relatively poor spectral resolution of satellite sensors such as IKONOS, currently constrain their use for fine-level marine habitat mapping. IKONOS data enabled significantly more accurate mapping at a geomorphological scale (e.g., coral vs. seagrass) than other satellite sensors except Landsat TM. While reasonably high accuracies (75%) were obtained for such coarse-level habitat mapping, Landsat TM was more cost-effective than IKONOS, even for small (50 km(2)) areas. IKONOS may only be a cost-effective option if (i) independent field data are available to identify habitat patches, (ii) the area to be mapped is fairly small (<500 km(2)), and (iii) small-scale (<10 in) habitat dynamics are to be monitored.

J	Beanish, J; Sanchez-Azofeifa, A; Jones, B				Beanish, J; Sanchez-Azofeifa, A; Jones, B			Application of image analysis for mapping of sedimentary facies in a shallow lagoon: case study, south sound, Grand Cayman, British West Indies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Facies are areas on the seafloor that are characterized by the same sediment and biota. They are key elements of any sedimentological assessment of shallow coastal lagoons. They are also natural barometers of change. Thus, changes in facies distribution over time may signal changes in the environment that are driven by natural or anthropogenic causes. Monitoring shallow coastal lagoons is a time consuming and expensive process. The accuracy of conventional facies maps, which are difficult to produce, is a function of the skill of the mapper and the time that is spent compiling the map. Image analysis of black and white or colour air photographs, however, offers an easier and more economical method of producing such maps. Image analysis techniques are generally applied to remote sensing space-borne data sets, and were used to produce facies maps of South Sound, a shallow water lagoon on Grand Cayman. Ground truthing showed that the implemented techniques are capable of producing thematic maps of facies changes with high accuracy. Analysis of air photographs taken in different years allows the assessment of changes in the total area covered by each facies as well as changes in their spatial characteristics (sea floor landscape changes). Image analysis of South Sound, for example, showed that the Thalassia (seagrass) banks expanded in area by 17% between 1971 and 1992 whereas the area covered by the Sand Facies was substantially reduced. This information provides added insights into the dynamic sedimentological behaviour of the lagoon and opens new venues for further expanding the use of conventional aerial photography as a tool for regular mapping of shallow coastal lagoons.

J	Fonseca, M; Whitfield, PE; Kelly, NM; Bell, SS				Fonseca, M; Whitfield, PE; Kelly, NM; Bell, SS			Modeling seagrass landscape pattern and associated ecological attributes	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												A predictive model for seagrass bed coverage (presence/absence at 1-m resolution) and ecological attributes of the bed, such as biomass and shoot density, would be a valuable management tool. But forming such a predictive model is complicated by a number of factors that strongly influence seagrass bed structure and our interpretation of its ecological function. The factors include the effects of waves and water depth (hydrodynamic setting) and the spatial and temporal scales of the sampling technique itself. In this study, we examined the coherence of predictions of seagrass cover and ecological attributes of temperate, mixed-species seagrass derived from two common sampling techniques, (video) line transect (commonly used by biologists) and grid-sampled surveys (often used in remote sensing). Mapping resolution was held constant at 1 m, and the two techniques applied across seagrass beds of varying coverage that reflected the effect of a hydrodynamic gradient ranging from patchy, high-energy beds to continuous cover, low-energy beds. We found that the prediction of seagrass coverage as a function of hydrodynamic setting can be improved not only by increasing the, spatial extent of sampling at a fixed resolution (1 m), but also by ensuring that data for both dependent (e.g., percent cover) and independent (e.g., wave exposure) variables are averaged over similar scales (spatial extent and resolution). Large-scale features of the landscape, such as, patches several meters in width, appeared to be best quantified by sampling over a large spatial extent, as with the video transects. Therefore, contiguous sampling over a broad spatial extent, as opposed to our numerous, somewhat smaller sampling (grid-sampled, 50 X 50 in areas) is the more appropriate strategy for predicting the probability of seagrass bed cover. Conversely, we found that ecological attributes of the seagrass bed (biomass, shoot density, and sediment composition) were best characterized by sampling over a shorter spatial extent (i.e., <50 m), indicating that very localized conditions may have influenced patterns of seagrass community attributes. Generalizing information about seagrass bed ecological attributes obtained from high-resolution samples (fine scale) taken over a broad spatial extent (coarse or landscape scale), as may occur with resource surveys and impact assessments, has the potential to be highly misleading, especially in patchy environments. The influence of sampling scale and survey method on the prediction of coverage and ecological attributes of seagrass beds reveals the need to carefully choose sampling designs to evaluate seagrass distribution and their associated ecological characteristics in the Beaufort, North Carolina (USA) area, and perhaps in other like habitats.																	1051-0761					FEB	2002	12	1					218	237		10.2307/3061148								WOS:000173549600018

The methods to map spatial distribution of seagrass and seaweed beds are reviewed. They are classified into two categories. One is a direct method by visual observation and the other is an indirect method using a remote sensing apparatus. Indirect methods are divided into optical or hydro-acoustic methods. Indirect methods require sea truth by direct methods. Optical methods are image analysis of aerial photography or satellite imagery. They are effective for mapping broad areas but limited to shallow waters due to light attenuation in waters. Hydro-acoustic methods such as an echosounder and a side scan sonar have no limitation of turbidity The echosounder is practical to map vertically density and height distributions of seagrass and seaweed beds. The side scan sonar is appropriate for mapping broad horizontal distributions. Coupling of several indirect mapping methods is more useful than using only one method.

J	Nayak, S; Bahuguna, A				Nayak, S; Bahuguna, A			Application of remote sensing data to monitor mangroves and other coastal vegetation of India	INDIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCES												Remote sensing data, because of its repetitive, synoptic and multi-spectral nature, has proved to be of an immense value in monitoring of coastal vegetation. Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) data have been extensively used to map mangroves and other coastal vegetation for the entire country's coastline. Large database on spatial extent of mangroves and their condition has been created on 1:250,000, 1:50,000 and 1:25,000 scale using IRS data (the database provides information for the first time on the mangrove areas of the entire Indian coast). Based on this study, it was observed that the Kori creek, Gujarat, has large area under mangroves. The repetitive nature of the data has helped in monitoring vital and critical areas, periodically. In one such study, on the Marine National Park, in the Gulf of Kachchh, mangrove areas were monitored for the last 25 years. The degradation of mangroves continued up to 1985 and the condition significantly improved due to the adoption of conservation measures. This has helped in planning various management actions to conserve this vital ecosystem. IRS data have been used in identifying dominant plant communities in many mangrove areas such as Bhitarkanika, Coringa, Mandovi estuary in Goa and the Gulf of Kachchh, etc, This is a unique approach for providing spatial information at plant community level and can be seen as a first step towards bio-diversity assessment. Along with the mangroves, seaweed, seagrass beds and dune vegetation have also been mapped with reasonable accuracy. With the better sensors planned for future, remote sensing-based information is going to be one of the major inputs in the preparation of management action plans.																	0379-5136					DEC	2001	30	4					195	213										WOS:000173106900001

This data source is now more accessible because of improvements in digitizing technology. Internet file transfer, and availability of image processing software. We present three examples of conservation-related projects that benefited from the use of astronaut photographs. First, NASA scientist requested that astronauts photograph the area of the controversial Isahaya Bay reclamation project in Japan. Japanese researches used photograph from before and after the reclamation as a tool for communication with the public about the effects of tidal-flat loss. The newly acquired images and the availability of high-resolution digital images from NASA archives provided timely public information on the observed changes. Second, we digitally classified and analyzed a Space Shuttle photograph of Chobe National Park in Botswana to identify the locations of woodlands affected by elephants. Field validation later confirmed that area identified on the image showed evidence of elephant damage. Third, we used a summary map from intensive field surveys of seagrasses in Shoalwater Bay, Australia, as reference data for a supervised classification of a digitized photograph taken from orbit. The classification distinguished seagrasses, sediments and mangroves with accuracy approximating that in studies using other satellite remote-sensing data. Astronaut photographs are in the public domain, and the database of nearly 400,000 photographs from the late 1960s to the present is available as a single searchable location on the Internet (http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/sseop). These photographs can be used by conservation biologists as a source of general information about the landscaped and for quantitative mapping.

J	Chauvaud, S; Bouchon, C; Maniere, R				Chauvaud, S; Bouchon, C; Maniere, R			Thematic mapping of tropical marine communities (coral reefs, seagrass beds and mangroves) using SPOT data in Guadeloupe Island.	OCEANOLOGICA ACTA												In the framework of a comprehensive study of the coastal marine ecosystems of Guadeloupe Island (French West Indies), a remote sensing survey of marine communities was conducted in the Bay of the Grand Cul-de-Sac Marin. Pictures of SPOT satellite were used. At first sight, XS data from SPOT did not seem to be well adapted to extract information from deepest underwater areas. In the present study, a method for analysis of XS data was developed, which increases tenuous spectral differences associated to very low intensity signals. This technique led to a better distinction of objects, even the deepest ones. Reference surfaces were then identified in the field and a reliable supervised classification was conducted, which reflected the high diversity of ecological themes (up to 32) of the area to 20 m depth. A total of 23 700 ha of biota was clearly identified. Mangrove covered up to 2 700 ha. Submerged areas were constituted of 15 700 ha of soft bottoms and 3 800 ha of hard substrate bottoms. On the coral reefs, flourishing coral communities accounted only for 113 ha (11.2%). This result enhances the alarming situation of these communities in Guadeloupe. Finally, seagrass beds took up to 8 200 ha (i.e. 42% of the total sublittoral area, 58% of soft bottom substrates). This ecosystem revealed to be of primary importance within the studied area and particular attention was paid to seagrass beds of Thalassia rest testudinum. Twelve themes were retained to describe them, based on the coverage rate of the substratum by the plants and the type of the sediment colonised. The final document expresses well the high complexity of the studied area. This map constitutes a reference of the present status of the coastal benthic communities of the 'Grand Cul-de-Sac Marin' and can be useful for scientists and the administrative managers of that area.

The present study was carried out within the Gulf of St-Florent (Corsica, France) on a Posidonia oceanica reef platform. Over the last 40 years, no major diachronic evolution has been observed within this plant formation. An erosion of the coastline has been noted inland of these seagrass beds, however, with erosion values of up to 40 m. The use of photogrammetric techniques, which are new to the marine environment, allows the possibility of obtaining a numeric model of a given site. The comparison of cartographic and bathymetric data, brought together in a geographic information system, allows the spatial distribution of seagrasses to be evaluated for the first time.

Through satellite remote sensing this study investigates the distribution of these plants along a southern section of the Kenyan coast. The visible bands (red, green and blue) and the near infra-red band of a Landsat Thematic Mapper image acquired in 1992 were combined in order to detect seagrasses and algae in 10 sectors along the section of the coast. Ground truthing was done at three locations along the same section. Results indicate that two distinct zones of vegetation can be recognised, and ground truthing reveals their identity is rocky substrate with mostly algae and seagrasses, respectively. The extent of the vegetation in the two zones has been quantified in square kilometres for the 10 sectors. However, care is needed in the interpretation of the satellite images when dealing with artefacts such as clouds. The zonation of the algal vegetation is discussed for one of the study sites.

J	Mumby, PJ; Green, EP; Edwards, AJ; Clark, CD				Mumby, PJ; Green, EP; Edwards, AJ; Clark, CD			The cost-effectiveness of remote sensing for tropical coastal resources assessment and management	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Although coastal habitat mapping is expensive, remote sensing is a more cost-effective technique than alternative field-survey methods (where effectiveness is defined as overall map accuracy), Satellite imagery is suitable for coarse detail habitat mapping where overall accuracies of c. 70% can be achieved but is inadequate for fine detail mapping, achieving c. 40% accuracy. Four types of cost are encountered when undertaking remote sensing: (1) set-up costs, (2) field survey costs, (3) image acquisition costs and (4) the time spent on analysis of field data and processing imagery. The largest of these are set-up costs such as the acquisition of hardware and software which may comprise 48-78% of the total cost of the project depending on specific objectives. For coarse-detail habitat mapping with satellite imagery, the second highest cost is field survey which can account for c. 20% of total costs and >80% of total costs if a remote sensing facility already exists. Field survey is a vital component of any habitat mapping programme and may constitute c. 70% of project duration. For mapping small coastal areas (<60 km in any direction) in coarse detail, SPOT XS is the most cost-effective satellite sensor but for larger areas Landsat TM is the most cost-effective and accurate sensor: Detailed habitat mapping should be undertaken using digital airborne scanners or interpretation of colour aerial photography (API). The cost of commissioning the acquisition of such imagery can be high [pound 15000-pound 27000 (US$24000-$43000) even for small areas of 150 km(2)] and may constitute 27-40% of total costs (64-75% if set-up costs are excluded). Acquisition of digital airborne imagery is more expensive than the acquisition of colour aerial photography but is offset against the huge investment in time required to create maps from API. If habitat maps are needed urgently, API may be prohibitively time-consuming. For small areas of say 150 km2, a map could be created within 25 days using CASI but might take six times longer to create using API. We estimate that API is only cheaper if the staff costs for API are considerably less than pound 80 day(-1). As the scope of the survey increases in size, the cost of API is likely to rise much faster than that arising from digital airborne scanners. If the costs of API and digital airborne scanners are similar; the latter instruments should be favoured because they are likely to yield more accurate results than API. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

J	Chauvaud, S; Bouchon, C; Maniere, R				Chauvaud, S; Bouchon, C; Maniere, R			Remote sensing techniques adapted to high resolution mapping of tropical coastal marine ecosystems (coral reefs, seagrass beds and mangrove)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The need for high resolution maps in the management of tropical environments is increasing and emphasized by the rapid anthropogenic development often occurring in coastal zones. In areas subject to humid tropical climate, such as the West Indies, cloud coverage often disturbs image acquisition by orbital imagery. Moreover, as these tropical coastal ecosystems, i.e., coral reefs, mangroves and seagrass beds, are intricate and geographically complex, high resolution data must be used to accurately restore these features. Digitized aerial photographs meet these requirements by providing higher-resolution images than orbital remote sensing devices. This paper reports on the method applied to map coral reefs, mangroves and seagrass beds in the Bay of Robert in Martinique Island (French West Indies) by digitizing true-colour aerial photographs. But, as these photographs present two drawbacks, i.e., they are not geographically oriented and their margins are distorted, a reference map was used to design a rectification model. Aerial photographs were first subjected to true-colour digitization. After separation of the red, green and blue bands, an unsupervised classification was achieved, then various masks each corresponding to a given range of depths were built and applied to the initial image. The new images obtained were analysed. Great care was taken in the selection of training sites to gather the pixels characterized by a high spectral similarity which corresponded to precise themes. After ground identification, these training sites enabled a supervized classification to be established, then a confusion matrix was built. The final map consisted of 31 themes. Each theme was related to a particular feature of the benthic communities. The error matrix and subsequent field samplings confirmed the reliability of the final map. In addition to their use in ecosystem studies, e.g., calculation of surface areas; biocoenosis distribution, etc., these thematic maps are of overriding importance for the management of coastal areas.																	0143-1161					DEC	1998	19	18					3625	3639		10.1080/014311698213858								WOS:000077774800010

Here we present an account of one of the first coral reef applications. The CASI was flown over reefs of the Turks and Caicos Islands (British West Indies) and set to view 1 m pixels in 8 spectral bands. In addition, reef habitats were sampled in situ by visual assessment of percent cover in 1 m quadrats. Seagrass standing crop was assessed using a calibrated visual scale. Benthic habitats were classified using hierarchical cluster and similarity percentage analyses of the field survey data. Two levels of habitat discrimination were assessed: a coarse level (corals, algae, sand, seagrass) and a fine level which included nine reef habitats. Overall accuracies of CASI-derived habitat maps were 89% and 81% for coarse and fine levels of habitat discrimination, respectively. Accuracies were greatest once CASI data had been processed to compensate for variations in depth and edited to take account of generic patterns of reef distribution. These overall accuracies were significantly (P < 0.001) better than those obtained from satellite imagery of the same site (Landsat MSS, Landsat TM, SPOT XS, SPOT Pan, merged Landsat TM/SPOT Pan). Results from CASI were also significantly better than those from interpretation of 1:10 000 colour aerial photographs of reefs in Anguilla (Sheppard et al. 1995). However, the studies may not have been entirely com parable due to a disparity in the areas mapped.

MARINE BIOLOGY												The capability of satellite and airborne remote-sensing methods for mapping Caribbean coral reefs is evaluated. Reef habitats were categorised into coarse, intermediate and fine detail, using hierarchical classification of field data (percent cover in 1 m quadrats and seagrass standing-crop). Habitats were defined as assemblages of benthic macro-organisms and substrata and were mapped using the satellite sensors Landsat MSS, Landsat TM, SPOT XS, SPOT Pan and merged Landsat TM/SPOT Pan. Habitats were also mapped using the high-resolution digital airborne sensor, CASI (compact airborne spectrographic imager). To map areas >60 km in any direction with coarse detail, Landsat TM was the most accurate and cost-effective satellite sensor (SPOT XS when < 60 km). For maps with intermediate habitat detail, aerial photography (from a comparable study in Anguilla) exhibited similar accuracy to Landsat TM, SPOT XS, SPOT Pan and merged Landsat TM/SPOT Pan. Landsat MSS was consistently the least accurate sensor. Maps from CASI were significantly (p < 0.001) more accurate than satellite sensors and aerial photographs. Maps with detailed habitat information (i.e. >9 reef classes) had a maximum accuracy of 37% when based on satellite imagery, but aerial photography and CASI achieved accuracies of 67 and 81%, respectively. Commissioning of new aerial photography does not appear to be a cost-effective option; satellites are cheaper for coarse habitat-mapping, and detailed habitat-mapping can be conducted more accurately and cheaply with CASI. The results will guide practitioners in matching survey objectives to appropriate remote-sensing methods.

J	Ward, DH; Markon, CJ; Douglas, DC				Ward, DH; Markon, CJ; Douglas, DC			Distribution and stability of eelgrass beds at Izembek Lagoon, Alaska	AQUATIC BOTANY												Spatial change in eelgrass meadows, Zostera marina L., was assessed between 1978 and 1987 and between 1987 and 1995 at Izembek Lagoon, Alaska. Change in total extent was evaluated through a map to map comparison of data interpreted from a 1978 Landsat multi-spectral scanner image and 1987 black and white aerial photographs. A ground survey in 1995 was used to assess spatial change from 1987. Eelgrass beds were the predominant vegetation type in the lagoon, comprising 44-47% (15000-16000 ha) of the total area in 1978 and 1987. Izembek Lagoon contains the largest bed of seagrass along the Pacific Coast of North America and largest known single stand of eelgrass in the world. There was a high degree of overlap in the spatial distribution of eelgrass among years of change detection. The overall net change was a 6% gain between 1978 and 1987 and a <l% gain between 1987 and 1995. The lack of significant change in eelgrass cover suggests that eelgrass meadows in Izembek Lagoon have been stable during the 17-year period of our study. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Ferguson, RL; Korfmacher, K				Ferguson, RL; Korfmacher, K			Remote sensing and GIS analysis of seagrass meadows in North Carolina, USA	AQUATIC BOTANY												Seagrass meadows are a valuable and vulnerable resource which supports coastal fisheries. Spatial monitoring of seagrass meadows can improve coastal management and research with baseline inventories of change in location and areal extent through time. Vertical aerial photography is an effective but expensive approach for monitoring seagrass meadows. Remote sensing with Landsat TM is less expensive but image selection is critical because environmental factors affect detection of seagrass meadows. Interpretation of photographs (March 1985 and April 1988) provides reference data for evaluation of results with three Landsat TM images of coastal North Carolina. Agreement of the Landsat classification with reference data was as high as 72.6% for a June 1992 image. Despite limited development of coastal North Carolina, seagrasses closely associated with the mainland are relatively low in abundance and are restricted to shallower water than seagrasses nearer the uninhabited barrier islands.

Extensive field measurements of standing crop were used to define empirical relationships with imagery from satellite sensors [Landsat Thematic Mapper and SPOT (Systeme Probatoire de l'Observation de la Terre) XS (multispectral)], and the digital airborne imager CASI (Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager). Predictions of standing crop from processed imagery had high coefficients of determination: 0.74, 0.79 and 0.81 respectively. Using a bootstrap method to measure standard error, the 95% confidence interval of predictions was found to have a similar order of magnitude to quadrat sampling in situ at a precision (standard error/mean) of 10%.

J	Kirkman, H				Kirkman, H			Baseline and monitoring methods for seagrass meadows	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Seagrass meadows are one of the most vulnerable habitats of coastal or estuarine waters in Australia. Their continued existence near centres of human population is in peril, but all levels of government are now under pressure to protect these valuable habitats. The first step is to measure the health and abundance of the seagrasses. To help managers to do this, I describe some of the methods used successfully in Australia and overseas. Aerial surveys and remote sensing are discussed as the method for gross scale inventory gathering. Permanent transects can detect changes at a much smaller scale. Biomass, density and productivity measurements all indicate the ''health'' of seagrass meadows. These methods are described with emphasis on the need for statistical rigour and regard for temporal and spatial variability. If managers and researchers use the same or similar methods throughout the coastal and estuarine seagrass habitats, they can compare results and use baseline studies and findings from other areas, where relevant.

Analysis of remote sensing data (Landsat MSS, SPOT XS and P, NOAA AVHRR) combined with field measurements were used to describe actual and historical states and begin understanding alteration mechanisms. The satellite information concerns bottom changes, sea color, sea surface temperature, and swell. Drastic changes have occurred in the Gabes Gulf to the west of the Gneiss-Djerba sill. The seagrass beds and Caulerpa fields that covered most part of the Gulf are now restricted to some areas upwards of 10m depth. Under hydrodynamic processes, bare sediments can be re-suspended more easily. Light reaching the bottom is reduced, inducing a shift from bottom primary production to a planktonic one. Other contributory factors are discussed.																	0025-3324	1948-1209				SUM	1995	29	2					46	58										WOS:A1995RR99400005

However, bleached reefs alone are poor indicators because they reflect the final stages of stress. This research project used multidate satellite imagery to look for coral reef changes as indicators of stress. Findings suggest that (1) satellite imagery can be used to identify small-scale changes in coastal marine ecosystems, including coral reefs; (2) remote sensing, marine ecology, and ethnographic data can be integrated to suggest potential causes of coral reef stress; and (3) changes in reef, seagrass, and mangrove ecozones are more closely tied to fishing, tourism, and land use practices than to global warming.																	0300-7839					SEP	1994	22	3					355	378		10.1007/BF02168857								WOS:A1994PZ90400006						
J	ARMSTRONG, RA				ARMSTRONG, RA			REMOTE-SENSING OF SUBMERGED VEGETATION CANOPIES FOR BIOMASS ESTIMATION	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The visible bands of the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor were used in an empirical assessment of seagrass biomass on shallow banks near Lee Stocking Island in the Bahamas. The TM bands were transformed to minimize the depth-dependent variance in the bottom reflectance signal. Regression analyses were performed between the transformed bands and field measurements of seagrass standing crop (above-ground biomass). Regression equations using spectral data accounted for up to 80 per cent of the variability in seagrass biomass. The unexplained variance was ascribed to variations in bottom sediment colour.																	0143-1161					FEB	1993	14	3					621	627		10.1080/01431169308904363								WOS:A1993KN98500016

The area studied was on the north coast of Porquerolles island (Hyeres, SE France). The treated data were compared with mapping carried out by diving. We show that satellite remote sensing may permit a distinction between certain epibenthic populations and bottom types down to 10 m depth. Thus the usefulness of the satellite is reduced where the sublittoral is steeply shelving, as the mappable area is narrow and represented by only a few pixels, each of which tends to overlap several separate biocoenoses. The image treated was obtained in June under very favourable conditions, with dense meadows of relatively epiphyte-free Posidonia oceanica seagrass, calm sea, and very clear water. However, much of the image was subject to marked reflectance, which reduced image usefulness. To avoid this problem, future requests for images should take into account the season and parameters, such as overflight time and satellite angle, likely to be associated with high reflectance at the site in question.																	0399-1784						1991	14	3					299	307										WOS:A1991FW22400008
