J	Levin, N; Kark, S; Crandall, D				Levin, Noam; Kark, Salit; Crandall, David			Where have all the people gone? Enhancing global conservation using night lights and social media	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Conservation prioritization at large scales is complex, combining biological, environmental, and social factors. While conservation scientists now more often aim to incorporate human-related factors, a critical yet unquantified challenge remains: to identify which areas people use for recreation outside urban centers. To address this gap in applied ecology and conservation, we developed a novel approach for quantifying human presence beyond populated areas by combining social media "big data" and remote sensing tools. We used data from the Flickr photo-sharing website as a surrogate for identifying spatial variation in visitation globally, and complemented this estimate with spatially explicit information on stable night lights between 2004 and 2012, used as a proxy for identifying urban and industrial centers. Natural and seminatural areas attracting visitors were defined as areas both highly photographed and non-lit. The number of Flickr photographers within protected areas was found to be a reliable surrogate for estimating visitor numbers as confirmed by local authority censuses (r = 0.8). Half of all visitors' photos taken in protected areas originated from under 1% of all protected areas on Earth (250 of 27 000). The most photographed protected areas globally included Yosemite and Yellowstone National Parks (USA), and the Lake and Peak Districts (UK). Factors explaining the spatial variation in protected areas Flickr photo coverage included their type (e.g., UNESCO World Heritage sites have higher visitation) and accessibility to roads and trails. Using this approach, we identified photography hotspots, which draw many visitors and are also unlit (i.e., are located outside urban centers), but currently remain largely unprotected, such as Brazil's Pantanal and Bolivia's Salar de Uyuni. The integrated big data approach developed here demonstrates the benefits of combining remote sensing sources and novel geo-tagged and crowd-sourced information from social media in future efforts to identify spatial conservation gaps and pressures in real time, and their spatial and temporal variation globally.

J	Kusimi, JM				Kusimi, John Manyimadin			Characterizing land disturbance in Atewa Range Forest Reserve and Buffer Zone	LAND USE POLICY												Changes in land cover of protected areas and their buffers have serious implications on the conservation of biodiversity within such biomes because land use has been recognized as one of the major drivers of biodiversity change. Atewa Range Forest Reserve is one of Ghana's Upper Guinea Forests declared as a Globally Significant Biodiversity Area (GSBA). But the reserve is under threat from several human disturbances which could impact on the land cover of the reserve.This study examined the spatial and temporal changes in land cover of Atewa Range Forest Reserve and it's buffer between 1986 and 2013 using remote sensing. Land use and land cover (LULC) classification and change detections were undertaken using one Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) image of 1986 and Landsat ETM+ images of 2003 and 2013.The study also investigated the driving forces of LULC and the effectiveness of the Forest and Wildlife Policy of 1994 in the management of the reserve. Results of image classification showed that much of the peripheral closed and open vegetative covers have been converted to farms and bushes with little disturbance within the interior of the reserve. The study revealed that, the conservation management policies were yielding very little results due to a number of policy deficiencies including low staff strength, lack of logistics and low remuneration. Enforcement of legal instruments against illegal logging, small scale mining and farming activities within the reserve, improvement in the staff strength and their condition of service, intensification of public education on the value of forest and the need to protect it are some of the major recommendations that could curb encroachment on the reserve.

In this study, we investigated the diversity and patterns of wild landscapes in relation to ecological factors, human disturbances and land protection regime in the Mo river basin (Central Togo). First, we used geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing techniques to quantify and spatially explicit the major land cover types occurring in the area. We performed a supervised classification of Landsat 8 image from 2014. Next, we used vegetation ordination and classification methods to detect vegetation group types and their similarity level from forest inventory data collected at 75 sites. Data from soil samples at the 75 sites and DEM-based topographical indices were used as biophysical variables to analyze factors of current landscape structure. Both satellite image classification and the outputs from ordination methods indicated that three major vegetation types (forestlands, woodlands and savannahs/shrubs) occurred in protected (PA) and unprotected (UPA) areas. Image classification showed that savannahs/shrubs are the most widespread vegetation types (54.4%) while forestlands and woodlands cover 10.4% and 26.4% of the total area, respectively. UPA showed high rates of human disturbances that shaped the occurrence of a fourth vegetation type made up mainly by degraded savannahs and woodlands. Along the land protection gradient, the landscapes are driven by soil nutrients and moisture, in combination with the influence of topography and human disturbances. In both PA and UPA, and along protection gradient, majority of features exhibited significant differences among plant communities. The spatial analyses combined with the field data providing information on vegetation cover, species richness, and human footprint indices suggested that some areas outside protection still exhibit high potentials for land conservation. In multifunctional landscapes of Mo basin, conservation strategies could also be encouraged in the wild landscapes of community common lands to promote both biodiversity conservation and sustainable provision of ecosystem services.

We sampled saproxylic beetles with window traps on fresh aspen dead wood and conducted field surveys of dead wood in the surroundings (1, 2 and 3 km radius). In addition, we used maps derived from satellite imagery to extract data on forest age and volume for the same surroundings. We found that species richness of saproxylic beetles was related to dead wood volume estimated by field survey within 1 or 2 km radius from the trapping points. However, the map-derived variable describing area of forest with high levels of deciduous wood volume was the overall best predictor of species richness. The scale of response to this variable differed; species richness of all saproxylic beetles was best predicted by estimates for the 2 km radius whereas richness of species more strongly associated with aspen was best predicted by estimates for the 3 km radius. This might indicate that aspen-associated beetles disperse over larger distances than many other beetles; possibly an adaptation to the scattered distribution and ephemeral nature of aspen dead wood in boreal forests. Our results show that substrate variables must be measured at the scale that is ecologically relevant for the study organism to elicit a response. We also show that remote sensing data -often easy to obtain for large scales-can be used to complement studies of scale-specific responses and thus improve conservation measures for saproxylic beetle species.

J.; Somers, Ben; Honnay, Olivier			Plant Species Diversity Mediates Ecosystem Stability of Natural Dune Grasslands in Response to Drought	ECOSYSTEMS												How plant species diversity can mediate the temporal stability of ecosystem functioning during periods of environmental stress is still a pressing question in ecology, certainly in the context of predicted increasing frequencies and intensities of climate extremes, such as drought. The vast majority of empirical research in this context is based on relatively small-scaled experiments, where plant species composition is manipulated and ecosystem functions, such as biomass production, are monitored through time. Results of these studies have generally shown that ecosystem functioning is more stable in more species-diverse communities. Yet, there is very little evidence so far that these relations also hold in naturally assembled plant communities. In this study, we combined historical vegetation and climate data with time series of remotely sensed indicators of aboveground biomass production (MODIS NDVI), to quantify how plant species diversity and plant functional diversity correlate with the temporal stability of biomass production in naturally assembled Dutch dune grasslands under the influence of fluctuating drought. We found that the negative NDVI response to drought of grasslands with a higher plant species richness and diversity was significantly lower than the response of less species rich and species-diverse grasslands, indicating a stabilizing role of plant species richness and diversity on biomass production through time. We found no relation between plant functional diversity and NDVI response to drought. This is the first study to generalize experimentally established relations between species diversity and stability of ecosystem functioning to naturally assembled grasslands across a large spatial and temporal scale.

Remote Sensing and Ecosystem Services: Current Status and Future Opportunities for the Study of Bees and Pollination-Related Services	CURRENT FORESTRY REPORTS												An unprecedented array of observing systems, coupled with ever increasing computing capacity, makes this a golden era for ecologists to study and quantify ecosystem services using remote sensing technology. Here, we review recent studies that utilize remote sensing to understand the supply and demand of ecosystem services, with a specific focus on pollination services by bees in forested and agroforestry contexts. Pollination by bees is a globally threatened ecosystem service that supports the production of food crops and maintains plant biodiversity. We explore how studies that use remote sensing to characterize landscapes, monitor individual organisms, measure biodiversity proxies or species habitat, and describe ecosystem processes may improve modeling of pollination services on spatial scales that match large-scale management efforts, such as forest conservation policy. We then discuss future research opportunities, such as exploring LiDAR and radar for 3-D habitat measurements, mapping phenology in space and time, and direct measurement of pollination events and outcomes.																	2198-6436					DEC	2015	1	4					261	274		10.1007/s40725-015-0024-6								WOS:000218418900004

Therefore creates great scope for the development of organic farming in rural areas to boost the rural economies. But organic farming is not very much evolved in this state due to lack of adequate transportation services and other socioeconomic reasons. Remote sensing and GIS can play an important role in the identification of the suitable zones for the development of organic farming in more facile manner. In this paper a methodology is proposed to identify the suitable zones in the state for the development of the organic farming using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Geospatial techniques to boost rural economies and promote rural tourism to make self-sustainable villages. This study represents the efficacy of AHP and weighted overlay model for the site suitability analysis of organic farming in the study area. (C) 2015 Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

J	Kantakumar, LN; Neelamsetti, P				Kantakumar, Lakshmi N.; Neelamsetti, Priti			Multi-temporal land use classification using hybrid approach	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES												Land use and land cover (LULC) classification of a satellite image is one of the prerequisites and plays an indispensable role in many land use inventories and environmental modeling. Many studies viz., forest inventories, hydrology and biodiversity studies, etc., are in demand to account the dynamics of land use and phenology of vegetation. Multi-temporal land use classification accounts the phenology of vegetation and land use dynamics of the study area. In this study, a hybrid classification scheme was developed to prepare a multi-temporal land use classification data set of Sawantwadi taluka of Maharashtra state in India. Parametric classification methods like maximum likelihood and ISODATA clustering methods are combined with the non-parametric decision tree approach to generate the multi-temporal LULC dataset.

How are landscape complexity and vegetation structure related across an agricultural frontier in the subtropical Chaco, NW Argentina?	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Human-driven alteration of the Chaco strongly affects ecological patterns and associated processes at all spatial scales. To understand these modifications, sufficient methods for describing and quantifying high levels of landscape complexity caused by human activities in the region are urgently needed. Most methods involve the use of passive remote sensors, which capture complexity in only two dimensions (2D). A common 2D approach has been to calculate landscape metrics, such as Shannon's Landscape Diversity Index. But, it is not clear what aspects of three dimensional (3D) vegetation structure are being captured by these metrics. 3D structure is known to be as important as or more important than 20 structure in determining landscape patterns of biodiversity of many groups of organisms. In addition, studies have used a limited number of coarsely defined land-cover classes to calculate metrics. Our question was: how is vegetation structure related to remote sensing attributes in an agricultural frontier in the subtropical dry Chaco, NW Argentina? A secondary question was to explore the relationships between traditional landscape metrics and the semivariogram, a geostatistical tool used to describe 2D complexity. We described landscape complexity from the panchromatic QuickBird band and measured vegetation structure in 22-1 ha plots across an agricultural frontier in the subtropical dry Chaco, northern Argentina. A total of 2683 individual trees in 51 plant species and 21 families were measured in the field and 25,665 points were recorded to estimate foliage height diversity. Four landscape complexity groups were identified by a two-way cluster analysis using the 20 metrics. Four vegetation variables differed significantly among the 2D complexity groups: the standard deviation of the Enhanced Vegetation Index, the coefficient of variation of density per transect (CV density), mean tree diameter (DBH), and foliage height diversity (FHD). Largest patch index and semivariogram range were negatively related to CV density, mean DBH and FHD, while semivariogram sill, mean shape index, landscape shape index and number of patches were positively related to all three vegetation variables. Landscape metrics were not related to tree species diversity or density as previously shown, probably as a result of structural similarity among the dominant tree species in the Chaco biome.

Ustin and Gamon (2010) proposed the new concept of "optical types" (OT), meaning "optically distinguishable functional types", as a way to better understand remote sensing signals related to the actual functional behavior of species that share common physiognomic forms but differ in functionality. Whereas the OT approach seems to be promising and consistent with ecological theory as a way to monitor vegetation derived from RS, it received little implementation. This work presents a method for implementing the OT concept for efficient monitoring of ecosystems based on RS time series. We propose relying on an ecosystem's repetitive pattern in the temporal domain (self-similarity) to assess its dynamics. Based on this approach, our main hypothesis is that distinct dynamics are intrinsic to a specific OT. Self-similarity level in the temporal domain within a broadleaf forest class was quantitatively assessed using the auto-correlation function (ACF), from statistical time series analysis. A vector comparison classification method, spectral angle mapper, and principal component analysis were used to identify general patterns related to forest dynamics. Phenological metrics derived from MOD IS NDVI time series using the TIMESAT software, together with information from the National Forest Map were used to explain the different dynamics found. Results showed significant and highly stable self-similarity patterns in OTs that corresponded to forests under non-moisture-limited environments with an adaptation strategy based on a strong phenological synchrony with climate seasonality. These forests are characterized by dense closed canopy deciduous forests associated with high productivity and low biodiversity in terms of dominant species. Forests in transitional areas were associated with patterns of less temporal stability probably due to mixtures of different adaptation strategies (i.e., deciduous, marcescent and evergreen species) and higher functional diversity related to climate variability at long and short terms. A less distinct seasonality and even a double season appear in the OT of the broadleaf Mediterranean forest characterized by an open canopy dominated by evergreen-sclerophyllous formations. Within this forest, understory and overstory dynamics maximize functional diversity resulting in contrasting traits adapted to summer drought, winter frosts, and high precipitation variability.

These pigments usually vary in presence and concentration and influence the spectral characteristics of corals. We studied the variations in pigment composition among seven Caribbean shallow-water Scleractinian corals by means of High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis to further resolve the discrimination of corals. We found a total of 27 different pigments among the coral species, including some alteration products of the main pigments. Additionally, pigments typically found in endolithic algae were also identified. A Principal Components Analysis and a Hierarchical Cluster Analysis showed the separation of coral species based on pigment composition. All the corals were collected under the same physical environmental conditions. This suggests that pigment in the coral's symbionts might be more genetically-determined than influenced by prevailing physical conditions of the reef. We further investigated the use of remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) as a tool for estimating the total pigment concentration of reef corals. Depending on the coral species, the Rrs and the total symbiont pigment concentration per coral tissue area correlation showed 79.5-98.5% confidence levels demonstrating its use as a non-invasive robust technique to estimate pigment concentration in studies of coral reef biodiversity and health.																	1932-6203					NOV 30	2015	10	11							e0143709	10.1371/journal.pone.0143709								WOS:000365889800059	26619210

Official data indicate a reduction of 71% in this biome's forests, what is a worrying indicator, since it is worldwide recognized as the fifth of the 34 hot spots of the planet and with high biodiversity so as high degree of endemism. In this context, the aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in the forest fragmentation of the Atlantic forest in the city of Caxias do Sul-RS, calibrating a spatial dynamic model for this process and simulating a scenario for the year of 2021. To achieve the proposed goal it was used a time series of Landsat 5 satellite images from the years of 1985, 2004 and 2011, with topography and soil information data. The results indicated an increase of native forest from 1985 to 2011 (increase of 36%) and to the 2021 simulated scenario (20% of forest areas). This increase in forest cover in the evaluated area is possibly associated with the rural exodus, more rigorous enforcement of environmental laws and strict enforcement by the environmental agency. This presents relevant information for decision making in relation to the management and monitoring of forest resources.																	0100-6762					NOV-DEC	2015	39	6					1019	1030		10.1590/0100-67622015000600004								WOS:000370522100004

However, several problematic issues (e.g., imagery correction and registration, image interpretation, habitat type and quality definitions, assessment and monitoring procedures, uncertainties inherent in mapping, expert knowledge integration, scale selection, analysis of the interrelationships between habitat quality and landscape structure) challenge the effective and reliable use of such data and techniques. We discuss these issues, as a contribution to the development of a common language, framework and suite of research approaches among ecologists, remote-sensing experts and stakeholders (conservation managers) on the ground, and highlight recent theoretical and applied advances that provide opportunities for meeting these challenges. Reconciling differing stakeholder perspectives and needs will boost the timely provisioning of reliable information on the current and changing distribution of biodiversity to enable effective conservation management.

J	Bell, G; Neal, S; Medcalf, K				Bell, Gemma; Neal, Samuel; Medcalf, Katie			Use of remote sensing to produce a habitat map of Norfolk	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Information on the extent, location and condition of semi-natural habitats is essential to deliver the national targets to achieve the UK commitment to Biodiversity 2020 (Defra, 2011). This strategy aims to halt overall biodiversity loss by 2020 and move towards a position of net gain. In order to achieve this, both local and national bodies need detailed information on the habitats present over their entire area. Remote sensing provides opportunities for cost-effective, rapid and repeatable habitat mapping. This paper presents a method used to produce a seamless habitat map of the county of Norfolk, UK, of sufficient detail to inform land management decisions. Key aspects of the method were the development of parallel classification systems using different input data combinations and a long-term, volunteer-based map validation and update procedure. The habitat classification method utilised multiple earth observation platforms characterised by differences in spatial resolution, spectral range and season of image capture. The combinations of image data used were very important for the success of the analyses. The classification process was guided by ecological principles and local knowledge, along with targeted ground-truthing to guide class associations, confirm underlying ecological processes and to assess accuracy, and map revision. The study found that automated methods of analysis were most effective when classifying habitats characterised by distinctive dominant cover species, or groups of dominant species. The methods were least effective at identifying habitats defined by the presence of low growth-form species at low frequency or where they form understorey vegetation; in such cases field checking is vital to confirm the habitat class assignment. This scale of mapping can be used in combination with targeted, sustainable field survey effort to provide the level of information needed by decision makers to support Biodviersity 2020 targets and a wide range of other policy needs. The map has already been adopted by a wide range of organisations and finding application in such areas as Green Infrastructure, Living Landscape and habitat suitability modelling.

However, often it is perceived that the needs of the terrestrial conservation community are not being met by the remote sensing community. The first step to bridging this gap is the improved communication between both communities, and the compilation of a list of needs and best practises for conservation applications. Here we review five recent workshops that help to answer the broad question "What conservationists need and want from remote sensing". We identify recurring requests, and consider potential ways forward for the conservation and remote sensing communities to start to deliver data or tools to address these needs.

Airborne laser scanning (ALS) provides horizontal and vertical information on canopy structure simultaneously. Existing approaches to assess canopy layering often require prior information about stand characteristics or rely on pre-defined height thresholds. We developed a multi-scale method using ALS data with point densities >10 pts/m(2) to determine the number and vertical extent of canopy layers (canopy(layer), canopy(length)), seasonal variations in the topmost canopy layer (canopy(type)), as well as small-scale heterogeneities in the canopy (canopy(heterogeneity)). We first tested and developed the method on a small forest patch (800 ha) and afterwards tested transferability and robustness of the method on a larger patch (180,000 ha). We validated the approach using an extensive set of ground data, achieving overall accuracies >77% for canopy(type) and canopy(heterogeneity), and >62% for canopy(layer) and canopy(length). We conclude that our method provides a robust characterization of canopy layering supporting automated canopy structure monitoring.

Some uncertainty about forest cover area in China calls for an accurate and updated forest cover map. In this study, we combined ALOS PALSAR orthorectified 50-m mosaic images (FED mode with HH and HV polarization) and MODIS time series data in 2010 to map forests in China. We used MODIS-based NDVI dataset (MOD13Q1, 250-m spatial resolution) to generate a map of annual maximum NDVI and used it to mask out built-up lands, barren lands, and sparsely vegetated lands. We developed a decision tree classification algorithm to identify forest and non-forest land cover, based on the signature analysis of PALSAR backscatter coefficient data. The PALSAR-based algorithm was then applied to produce a forest cover map in China in 2010. The resulting forest/non-forest classification map has an overall accuracy of 96.2% and a Kappa Coefficient of 0.91. The resultant 50-m PALSAR-based forest cover map was compared to five forest cover databases. The total forest area (2.02 x 10(6) km(2)) in China from the PALSAR-based forest map is close to the forest area estimates from China National Forestry Inventory (1.95 x 10(6) km(2)), JAXA (2.00 x 10(6) km(2)), and FAO FRA (2.07 x 10(6) km(2)). There are good linear relationships between the PALSAR-based forest map and the forest maps from the JAXA, MCD12Q1, and NLCD-China datasets at the province and county scales. All the forest maps have similar spatial distributions of forest/non-forest at pixel scale. Our PALSAR-based forest map recognizes well the agro-forests in China. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of integrating PALSAR and MODIS images to map forests in large areas. The resultant map of forest cover in China in 2010 can be used for many studies such as forest carbon cycle and ecological restoration.

Wide-area mapping of small-scale features in agricultural landscapes using airborne remote sensing	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Natural and semi-natural habitats in agricultural landscapes are likely to come under increasing pressure with the global population set to exceed 9 billion by 2050. These non-cropped habitats are primarily made up of trees, hedgerows and grassy margins and their amount, quality and spatial configuration can have strong implications for the delivery and sustainability of various ecosystem services. In this study high spatial resolution (0.5 m) colour infrared aerial photography (CIR) was used in object based image analysis for the classification of non-cropped habitat in a 10,029 ha area of southeast England. Three classification scenarios were devised using 4 and 9 class scenarios. The machine learning algorithm Random Forest (RF) was used to reduce the number of variables used for each classification scenario by 25.5 % +/- 2.7%. Proportion of votes from the 4 class hierarchy was made available to the 9 class scenarios and where the highest ranked variables in all cases. This approach allowed for misclassified parent objects to be correctly classified at a lower level. A single object hierarchy with 4 class proportion of votes produced the best result (kappa 0.909). Validation of the optimum training sample size in RF showed no significant difference between mean internal out-of-bag error and external validation. As an example of the utility of this data, we assessed habitat suitability for a declining farmland bird, the yellowhammer (Emberiza citronella), which requires hedgerows associated with grassy margins. We found that similar to 22% of hedgerows were within 200 m of margins with an area >183.31 m(2). The results from this analysis can form a key information source at the environmental and policy level in landscape optimisation for food production and ecosystem service sustainability.

New technologies alone do not save species, and new data create new problems. For example, improving technologies alone cannot prevent poaching: solutions require providing appropriate tools to the right people. Habitat loss is another driver: the challenge here is to connect existing sophisticated remote sensing with species occurrence data to predict where species remain. Other challenges include assembling a wider public to crowdsource data, managing the massive quantities of data generated, and developing solutions to rapidly emerging threats.																	0169-5347					NOV	2015	30	11					685	696		10.1016/j.tree.2015.08.008								WOS:000364891600009	26437636

We estimated a series of forest value metrics including components of biodiversity, carbon stocks, and timber and non-timber forest product resources, along the recently paved Inter-Oceanic Highway (IOH) integrating Brazil and Peru along the Bolivian border. We installed 69 vegetation plots in intact terra firme forests representative of local community holdings near and far from the IOH, and we characterized 15 components of forest value for each plot. We observed strong geographic gradients in forest value components across the region, with increases from west to east in aboveground biomass and in the abundance of timber and non-timber forest product trees and regeneration. Plots in communities in Pando, Bolivia, where the IOH remains in part unpaved, had the highest aboveground biomass, standing timber volumes and Brazil nut tree density. In contrast, communities in Madre de Dios, Peru, where settlements and unpaved portions of the IOH have existed for decades, and in Acre, Brazil, where paving of the IOH has been underway for more than a decade, were more degraded. Seven of the fifteen forest value components we measured increased with increasing distance from the IOH, although the magnitude of these effects was weak. Landscape scale remote sensing analyses showed much stronger effects of road proximity on deforestation. We suggest that remote sensing techniques including canopy spectral signatures might be calibrated to characterize multiple components of forest value, so that we can estimate landscape scale-impacts of infrastructure developments on both deforestation and forest degradation in tropical regions.

Long-term agroecosystem research on northern Great Plains mixed-grass prairie near Mandan, North Dakota	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE												In 1915, a stocking rate experiment was started on 101 ha of native mixed-grass prairie at the Northern Great Plains Research Laboratory (NGPRL) near Mandan, ND (100.9132N, 46.7710W). Here, we document the origin, evolution, and scientific outcomes from this long-term experiment. Four pastures of 12.1, 20.2, 28.3, and 40.5 ha were laid out and stocked continuously from May until October with 2-yr-old or yearling beef steers at four rates [initially 0.98, 1.39, 1.83, and 2.4 animal unit months ha(-1)]. The experiment generated some of the first information on the resilience of mixed-grass prairie to grazing and drought and relationships of livestock productivity to soil moisture for predictive purposes. After 1945, the experiment was reduced to the light and heavy stocking rate pastures only, which have been managed and grazed in approximately the same manner to the present day. The pastures were used to assess responses of vegetation to fertilizer in the 1950s and 1960s, develop grazing readiness tools in the 1990s, and assess remote sensing technologies in the 2000s. The long-term pastures currently serve as a unique resource to address contemporary questions dealing with drought, soil quality, carbon dynamics, greenhouse gas emissions, invasive species, and climate change.																	0008-4220	1918-1833				NOV	2015	95	6					1101	1116		10.4141/CJPS-2015-117								WOS:000364153900004						
J	Nieland, S; Moran, N; Kleinschmit, B; Forster, M				Nieland, Simon; Moran, Niklas; Kleinschmit, Birgit; Foerster, Michael			An ontological system for interoperable spatial generalisation in biodiversity monitoring	COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES												Semantic heterogeneity remains a barrier to data comparability and standardisation of results in different fields of spatial research. Because of its thematic complexity, differing acquisition methods and national nomenclatures, interoperability of biodiversity monitoring information is especially difficult. Since data collection methods and interpretation manuals broadly vary there is a need for automatised, objective methodologies for the generation of comparable data-sets. Ontology-based applications offer vast opportunities in data management and standardisation. This study examines two data-sets of protected heathlands in Germany and Belgium which are based on remote sensing image classification and semantically formalised in an OWL2 ontology. The proposed methodology uses semantic relations of the two data-sets, which are (semi-)automatically derived from remote sensing imagery, to generate objective and comparable information about the status of protected areas by utilising kernel-based spatial reclassification. This automatised method suggests a generalisation approach, which is able to generate delineation of Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) of the European biodiversity Natura 2000 network. Furthermore, it is able to transfer generalisation rules between areas surveyed with varying acquisition methods in different countries by taking into account automated inference of the underlying semantics. The generalisation results were compared with the manual delineation of terrestrial monitoring. For the different habitats in the two sites an accuracy of above 70% was detected. However, it has to be highlighted that the delineation of the ground-truth data inherits a high degree of uncertainty, which is discussed in this study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Tuanmu, MN; Jetz, W				Tuanmu, Mao-Ning; Jetz, Walter			A global, remote sensing-based characterization of terrestrial habitat heterogeneity for biodiversity and ecosystem modelling	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Habitat heterogeneity has long been recognized as a key landscape characteristic determining biodiversity patterns. However, a lack of standardized, large-scale, high-resolution and temporally updatable heterogeneity information based on direct observations has limited our understanding of this connection and its effective use for biodiversity conservation. To address this, we develop here remote sensing-based metrics to characterize global habitat heterogeneity at 1-km resolution and assess their value for biodiversity modelling. Location Global. Methods We develop 14 heterogeneity metrics (available at ) based on the textural features of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and closely examine a complementary core set of six of these metrics. We evaluate their ability to provide fine-grain habitat heterogeneity by comparing the heterogeneity information captured by them with that measured by 30-m Landsat-based land-cover data. Using spatial autoregressive models, we then compare their utility with that of more conventional metrics (derived from topography or categorical land-cover data) for modelling the species richness of bird communities across the conterminous United States based on Breeding Bird Survey data. Results The newly derived metrics capture different aspects of habitat heterogeneity and provide fine-grain information for locations deemed homogeneous by traditional land-cover classifications at both continental and global extents. Most of them strongly exceed conventional heterogeneity variables in capturing the spatial variation in bird species richness, with Homogeneity emerging as the strongest predictor. Main conclusions This study develops and validates the performance of readily usable metrics of textural measures capturing fine-grain habitat heterogeneity. The presented metrics outperform conventional measures in capturing detailed spatial variation in habitats and in predicting key biodiversity patterns. They provide a rigorous and comparable basis for understanding heterogeneity-diversity relationships, and offer a powerful tool for monitoring and understanding the responses of biodiversity and ecosystems to the changing environment.																	1466-822X	1466-8238				NOV	2015	24	11					1329	1339		10.1111/geb.12365								WOS:000362796400012

Using ecological models to assess ecosystem status in support of the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The European Union's Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) seeks to achieve, for all European seas, "Good Environmental Status" (GEnS), by 2020. Ecological models are currently one of the strongest approaches used to predicting and understanding the consequences of anthropogenic and climate-driven changes in the natural environment. We assess the most commonly used capabilities of the modelling community to provide information about indicators outlined in the MSFD, particularly on biodiversity, food webs, non-indigenous species and seafloor integrity descriptors. We built a catalogue of models and their derived indicators to assess which models were able to demonstrate: (1) the linkages between indicators and ecosystem structure and function and (2) the impact of pressures on ecosystem state through indicators. Our survey identified 44 ecological models being implemented in Europe, with a high prevalence of those that focus on links between hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry, followed by end-to-end, species distribution/habitat suitability, bio-optical (remote sensing) and multispecies models. Approximately 200 indicators could be derived from these models, the majority of which were biomass and physical/hydrological/chemical indicators. Biodiversity and food webs descriptors, with similar to 49% and similar to 43% respectively, were better addressed in the reviewed modelling approaches than the non-indigenous species (0.3%) and sea floor integrity (similar to 8%) descriptors. Out of 12 criteria and 21 MSFD indicators relevant to the abovementioned descriptors, currently only three indicators were not addressed by the 44 models reviewed. Modelling approaches showed also the potential to inform on the complex, integrative ecosystem dimensions while addressing ecosystem fundamental properties, such as interactions between structural components and ecosystems services provided, despite the fact that they are not part of the MSFD indicators set. The cataloguing of models and their derived indicators presented in this study, aim at helping the planning and integration of policies like the MSFD which require the assessment of all European Seas in relation to their ecosystem status and pressures associated and the establishment of environmental targets (through the use of indicators) to achieve GEnS by 2020.

Nonparametric Image Registration of Airborne LiDAR, Hyperspectral and Photographic Imagery of Wooded Landscapes	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												There is much current interest in using multisensor airborne remote sensing to monitor the structure and biodiversity of woodlands. This paper addresses the application of nonparametric (NP) image-registration techniques to precisely align images obtained from multisensor imaging, which is critical for the successful identification of individual trees using object recognition approaches. NP image registration, in particular, the technique of optimizing an objective function, containing similarity and regularization terms, provides a flexible approach for image registration. Here, we develop a NP registration approach, in which a normalized gradient field is used to quantify similarity, and curvature is used for regularization (NGF-Curv method). Using a survey of woodlands in southern Spain as an example, we show that NGF-Curv can be successful at fusing data sets when there is little prior knowledge about how the data sets are interrelated (i.e., in the absence of ground control points). The validity of NGF-Curv in airborne remote sensing is demonstrated by a series of experiments. We show that NGF-Curv is capable of aligning images precisely, making it a valuable component of algorithms designed to identify objects, such as trees, within multisensor data sets.

Estimating the Counterfactual Impact of Conservation Programs on Land Cover Outcomes: The Role of Matching and Panel Regression Techniques	PLOS ONE												Deforestation and conversion of native habitats continues to be the leading driver of biodiversity and ecosystem service loss. A number of conservation policies and programs are implemented-from protected areas to payments for ecosystem services (PES)-to deter these losses. Currently, empirical evidence on whether these approaches stop or slow land cover change is lacking, but there is increasing interest in conducting rigorous, counterfactual impact evaluations, especially for many new conservation approaches, such as PES and REDD, which emphasize additionality. In addition, several new, globally available and free high-resolution remote sensing datasets have increased the ease of carrying out an impact evaluation on land cover change outcomes. While the number of conservation evaluations utilizing 'matching' to construct a valid control group is increasing, the majority of these studies use simple differences in means or linear cross-sectional regression to estimate the impact of the conservation program using this matched sample, with relatively few utilizing fixed effects panel methods-an alternative estimation method that relies on temporal variation in the data. In this paper we compare the advantages and limitations of (1) matching to construct the control group combined with differences in means and cross-sectional regression, which control for observable forms of bias in program evaluation, to (2) fixed effects panel methods, which control for observable and time-invariant unobservable forms of bias, with and without matching to create the control group. We then use these four approaches to estimate forest cover outcomes for two conservation programs: a PES program in Northeastern Ecuador and strict protected areas in European Russia. In the Russia case we find statistically significant differences across estimators-due to the presence of unobservable bias-that lead to differences in conclusions about effectiveness. The Ecuador case illustrates that if time-invariant unobservables are not present, matching combined with differences in means or cross-sectional regression leads to similar estimates of program effectiveness as matching combined with fixed effects panel regression. These results highlight the importance of considering observable and unobservable forms of bias and the methodological assumptions across estimators when designing an impact evaluation of conservation programs.

Forest Loss in Protected Areas and Intact Forest Landscapes: A Global Analysis	PLOS ONE												In spite of the high importance of forests, global forest loss has remained alarmingly high during the last decades. Forest loss at a global scale has been unveiled with increasingly finer spatial resolution, but the forest extent and loss in protected areas (PAs) and in large intact forest landscapes (IFLs) have not so far been systematically assessed. Moreover, the impact of protection on preserving the IFLs is not well understood. In this study we conducted a consistent assessment of the global forest loss in PAs and IFLs over the period 2000-2012. We used recently published global remote sensing based spatial forest cover change data, being a uniform and consistent dataset over space and time, together with global datasets on PAs' and IFLs' locations. Our analyses revealed that on a global scale 3% of the protected forest, 2.5% of the intact forest, and 1.5% of the protected intact forest were lost during the study period. These forest loss rates are relatively high compared to global total forest loss of 5% for the same time period. The variation in forest losses and in protection effect was large among geographical regions and countries. In some regions the loss in protected forests exceeded 5% (e.g. in Australia and Oceania, and North America) and the relative forest loss was higher inside protected areas than outside those areas (e.g. in Mongolia and parts of Africa, Central Asia, and Europe). At the same time, protection was found to prevent forest loss in several countries (e.g. in South America and Southeast Asia). Globally, high area-weighted forest loss rates of protected and intact forests were associated with high gross domestic product and in the case of protected forests also with high proportions of agricultural land. Our findings reinforce the need for improved understanding of the reasons for the high forest losses in PAs and IFLs and strategies to prevent further losses.

Amongst nearshore ecosystems, seagrass beds play a major role enhancing biodiversity and water quality. Consequently, the development of new approaches to create extensive and high-resolution habitat maps is required not only to implement conservation, restoration and management plans, but also to establish adaptation plans to face climate change impacts. This study particularly assesses the capability of hyperspectral airborne imagery acquired with Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) to discriminate and map estuarine habitats, with special focus on Zostera noltii seagrass meadows. To this end, 13 habitats were defined along the supralittoral, intertidal and subtidal zones of an estuary, including Z noltii seagrass meadows. The CASI sensor was configured to acquire 25 bands in the visible and near infrared wavelengths with a ground sampling distance of 2 m. Spectral bands were selected for species discrimination based on the spectral signature of the different habitat classes. Six different band combinations were tested applying maximum likelihood classification algorithm. The most accurate classification was obtained with 10 band combination (a mean producer accuracy 92% and a mean user accuracy 94%). The classification of Z noltii beds has been found to be restricted to moderate and high dense meadows, however a vegetation index has been defined which could be applied for mapping Z noltii meadow cover. These results highlight the value of CASI data to discriminate and map estuarine habitats, providing key information to be used in supporting the implementation of environmental legislation, protection and conservation of coastal habitats.

With the use of remote sensing and geographic information systems, this research aimed to identify areas with potential for ecological corridors through an automated technique, which reduces personal character in image interpretation.

Optimal Altitude, Overlap, and Weather Conditions for Computer Vision UAV Estimates of Forest Structure	REMOTE SENSING												Ecological remote sensing is being transformed by three-dimensional (3D), multispectral measurements of forest canopies by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and computer vision structure from motion (SFM) algorithms. Yet applications of this technology have out-paced understanding of the relationship between collection method and data quality. Here, UAV-SFM remote sensing was used to produce 3D multispectral point clouds of Temperate Deciduous forests at different levels of UAV altitude, image overlap, weather, and image processing. Error in canopy height estimates was explained by the alignment of the canopy height model to the digital terrain model (R-2 = 0.81) due to differences in lighting and image overlap. Accounting for this, no significant differences were observed in height error at different levels of lighting, altitude, and side overlap. Overall, accurate estimates of canopy height compared to field measurements (R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 3.6 m) and LIDAR (R-2 = 0.99, RMSE = 3.0 m) were obtained under optimal conditions of clear lighting and high image overlap (>80%). Variation in point cloud quality appeared related to the behavior of SFM image features'. Future research should consider the role of image features as the fundamental unit of SFM remote sensing, akin to the pixel of optical imaging and the laser pulse of LIDAR.																	2072-4292					OCT	2015	7	10					13895	13920		10.3390/rs71013895								WOS:000364328600061

Long-term spatio-temporal changes in a West African bushmeat trade system	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Landscapes in many developing countries consist of a heterogeneous matrix of mixed agriculture and forest. Many of the generalist species in this matrix are increasingly traded in the bushmeat markets of West and Central Africa. However, to date there has been little quantification of how the spatial configuration of the landscape influences the urban bushmeat trade over time. As anthropogenic landscapes become the face of rural West Africa, understanding the dynamics of these systems has important implications for conservation and landscape management. The bushmeat production of an area is likely to be defined by landscape characteristics such as habitat disturbance, hunting pressure, level of protection, and distance to market. We explored (SSG, tense) the role of these four characteristics in the spatio-temporal dynamics of the commercial bushmeat trade around the city of Kumasi, Ghana, over 27 years (1978 to 2004). We used geographic information system methods to generate maps delineating the spatial characteristics of the landscapes. These data were combined with spatially explicit market data collected in the main fresh bushmeat market in Kumasi to explore the relationship between trade volume (measured in terms of number of carcasses) and landscape characteristics. Over time, rodents, specifically cane rats (Thryonomys swinderianus), became more abundant in the trade relative to ungulates and the catchment area of the bushmeat market expanded. Areas of intermediate disturbance supplied more bushmeat, but protected areas had no effect. Heavily hunted areas showed significant declines in bushmeat supply over time. Our results highlight the role that low intensity, heterogeneous agricultural landscapes can play in providing ecosystem services, such as bushmeat, and therefore the importance of incorporating bushmeat into ecosystem service mapping exercises. Our results also indicate that even where high bushmeat production is possible, current harvest levels may cause wildlife depletion.																	0888-8892	1523-1739				OCT	2015	29	5					1446	1457		10.1111/cobi.12545								WOS:000363729100019	26104770

We simulated land use mapping error at four levels then modelled potential land use transitions and indicators of ecosystem services supply using the Land Use Trade-Offs (LUTO) model, increasing error resulted in larger areas of uncertainty in land use transition. This influence was highly localised, with concentrations in mixed cropping areas, rather than homogeneous extensive grazing areas. Error effects also varied with spatial scale. While barely discernible when aggregated at the national level, error effects increased markedly with granularity of assessment. Sensitivity to land use mapping error also differed between ecosystem services. The results were driven largely by geographic heterogeneity and nuance in the environmental and economic drivers of land use peculiar to the study area. The finding of strongly-localised, scale-dependent impacts that differed between ecosystem services is likely to hold for other areas. Understanding the effects of land use mapping error propagation is necessary both for guiding efforts to reduce mapping error, and for supporting policy and governance at multiple scales.

Predicting spatial variations of tree species richness in tropical forests from high-resolution remote sensing	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												There is an increasing interest in identifying theories, empirical data sets, and remote-sensing metrics that can quantify tropical forest alpha diversity at a landscape scale. Quantifying patterns of tree species richness in the field is time consuming, especially in regions with over 100 tree species/ha. We examine species richness in a 50-ha plot in Barro Colorado Island in Panama and test if biophysical measurements of canopy reflectance from high-resolution satellite imagery and detailed vertical forest structure and topography from light detection and ranging (lidar) are associated with species richness across four tree size classes (>1, 1-10, >10, and >20 cm dbh) and three spatial scales (1, 0.25, and 0.04 ha). We use the 2010 tree inventory, including 204 757 individuals belonging to 301 species of freestanding woody plants or 166 +/- 1.5 species/ha (mean +/- SE), to compare with remote-sensing data. All remote-sensing metrics became less correlated with species richness as spatial resolution decreased from 1.0 ha to 0.04 ha and tree size increased from 1 cm to 20 cm dbh. When all stems with dbh >1 cm in 1-ha plots were compared to remote-sensing metrics, standard deviation in canopy reflectance explained 13% of the variance in species richness. The standard deviations of canopy height and the topographic wetness index (TWI) derived from lidar were the best metrics to explain the spatial variance in species richness (15% and 24%, respectively). Using multiple regression models, we made predictions of species richness across Barro Colorado Island (BCI) at the 1-ha spatial scale for different tree size classes. We predicted variation in tree species richness among all plants (adjusted and trees with dbh >10 cm (adjusted r(2) = 0.25). However, the best model results were for understory trees and shrubs (dbh 1-10 cm) (adjusted r(2) = 0.52) that comprise the majority of species richness in tropical forests. Our results indicate that high-resolution remote sensing can predict a large percentage of variance in species richness and potentially provide a framework to map and predict alpha diversity among trees in diverse tropical forests.																	1051-0761	1939-5582				OCT	2015	25	7					1776	1789		10.1890/14-1593.1								WOS:000362532600003	26591445					
J	Manaswini, G; Reddy, CS				Manaswini, G.; Reddy, C. Sudhakar			Geospatial monitoring and prioritization of forest fire incidences in Andhra Pradesh, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Forest fire has been identified as one of the key environmental issue for long-term conservation of biodiversity and has impact on global climate. Spatially multiple observations are necessary for monitoring of forest fires in tropics for understanding conservation efficacy and sustaining biodiversity in protected areas. The present work was carried out to estimate the spatial extent of forest burnt areas and fire frequency using Resourcesat Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) data (2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2014) in Andhra Pradesh, India. The spatio-temporal analysis shows that an area of 7514.10 km(2) (29.22 % of total forest cover) has been affected by forest fires. Six major forest types are distributed in Andhra Pradesh, i.e. semi-evergreen, moist deciduous, dry deciduous, dry evergreen, thorn and mangroves. Of the total forest burnt area, dry deciduous forests account for >75 %. District-wise analysis shows that Kurnool, Prakasam and Cuddapah have shown >100 km(2) of burnt area every year. The total forest burnt area estimate covering protected areas ranges between 6.9 and 22.3 % during the study period. Spatial burnt area analysis for protected areas in 2014 indicates 37.2 % of fire incidences in the Nagarjunasagar Srisailam Tiger Reserve followed by 20.2 % in the Sri Lankamalleswara Wildlife Sanctuary, 20.1 % in the Sri Venkateswara Wildlife Sanctuary and 17.4 % in the Gundla Brahmeswaram Wildlife Sanctuary. The analysis of cumulative fire occurrences from 2009 to 2014 has helped in delineation of conservation priority hotspots using a spatial grid cell approach. Conservation priority hotspots I and II are distributed in major parts of study area including protected areas of the Nagarjunasagar Srisailam Tiger Reserve and Gundla Brahmeswaram Wildlife Sanctuary. The spatial database generated will be useful in studies related to influence of fires on species adaptability, ecological damage assessment and conservation planning.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				OCT	2015	187	10							616	10.1007/s10661-015-4821-y								WOS:000362284700011	26350795					
J	Pitkanen, TP; Skanes, H; Kayhko, N				Pitkanen, Timo P.; Skanes, Helle; Kayhko, Niina			Detecting subpixel deciduous components to complement traditional land cover classifications in Southwest Finland	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												To ensure successful conservation of ecological and cultural landscape values, detailed and up-to-date spatial information of existing habitatpatterns is essential. However, traditional satellite-based and raster classifications rely on pixels that are assigned to a single category and often generalized. For many fragmented key habitats, such a strategy is too coarse and complementary data is needed. In this paper, we aim at detecting pixel-wise fractional coverage of broadleaved woodland and grassland components in a hemiboreal landscape. This approach targets ecologically relevant deciduous fractions and complements traditional crisp land cover classifications. We modeled fractional components using a k-NN approach, which was based on multispectral satellite data, assisted by a digital elevation model and a contemporary map database. The modeled components were then analyzed based on landscape structure indicators, and evaluated in conjunction with CORINE classification. The results indicate that both broadleaved forest and grassland components are widely distributed in the study area, principally organized as transition zones and small patches. Landscape structure indicators show a substantial variation based on the fractional threshold, pinpointing their dependency on the classification scheme and grain. The modeled components, on the other hand, suggest high internal variation for most CORINE classes, indicating their heterogeneous appearance and showing that the presence of deciduous components in the landscape are not properly captured in a coarse land cover classification. To gain a realistic perception of the landscape, and use this information for the needs of spatial planning, both fractional results and existing land cover classifications are needed. This is because they mutually contribute to an improved understanding of habitat patterns and structures, and should be used to complement each other. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Fassnacht, FE; Li, L; Fritz, A				Fassnacht, Fabian Ewald; Li, Li; Fritz, Andreas			Mapping degraded grassland on the Eastern Tibetan Plateau with multi-temporal Landsat 8 data - where do the severely degraded areas occur?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												The Tibetan Plateau in Western China is the world's largest alpine landscape, sheltering a rich diversity of native flora and fauna. In the past few decades, the Tibetan Plateau was found to suffer from grassland degradation processes. Grassland degradation is assumed to not only endanger biodiversity but also to increase the risk for natural hazards in other parts of the country which are ecologically and hydrologically connected to the area. However, the mechanisms behind the degradation processes remain poorly understood due to scarce baseline data and insufficient scientific research. We argue that remote sensing data can help to better understand degradation processes and patterns by: (1) identifying the distribution of severely degraded areas and (2) comparing the patterns of key spatial attributes of the identified areas (altitude above sea level, aspect, slope, administrative districts) with existing theories on degradation drivers. Therefore, we applied four Landsat 8 images covering large portions of the three counties Jigzhi, Baima and Darlag in the Eastern Tibetan Plateau. The dates of the Landsat scenes were selected to cover differing phenological stages of the ecosystem. Reference data were collected with a remotely piloted aircraft and a standard consumer RGB camera. To exploit the phenological information in the Landsat data as well as deal with the problem of cloud cover in multiple images, we developed a straightforward PCA-based procedure to merge the Landsat scenes. The merged Landsat data served as input to a supervised support vector machine classification which was validated with an iterative bootstrap procedure and an additional independent validation set. The considered classes were "high-cover grassland", "grassland (including several stages of grassland vitality)", "(severely) degraded grassland", "green shrubland", "grey shrubland", "urban areas" and "water bodies". Kappa accuracies ranged between 0.84 and 0.93 in the iterative procedure, while the independent validation led to a kappa accuracy of 0.76. Mean producer's and user's accuracies for all classes were higher than 80%, and confusion mainly occurred between the two shrubland classes and between the three grassland classes. Analysis of the slope, aspect and altitude values of the vegetation classes revealed that the degraded areas mostly occurred at the higher altitudes of the study area (4300-4600 m), with no strong connection to any specific slope or aspect. High-cover grassland was mostly located on sunny slopes at lower altitudes (less than 4300 m), while shrubland preferred shady, relatively steep slopes across all altitudes. These observations proved to be stable across the examined counties, while the proportions of land-cover classes differed between the examined regions. Most counties showed 5-7% severely degraded land cover. Darlag, the county located at the edge of the permafrost zone, and featuring the highest average altitude and lowest annual temperature and precipitation, was found to suffer from larger areas of severe degradation (14%). Therefore, our findings support a strong connection between degradation patterns and climatic as well as altitudinal gradients, with an increased degradation risk for high altitude areas and areas in colder and drier climatic zones. This is relevant information for pastoral management to avoid further degradation of high altitude pastures. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we analyze the land cover dynamics in the Osa Peninsula region of Costa Rica between 1987 and 2009 that provides a good scenario for evaluating the effects over forest trends of the environmental policies set up in 1996. Remote sensing imagery from Landsat and SPOT 2 satellites was classified using the See5 algorithm to obtain land cover maps for 1987, 1998, 2003 and 2009. Our results show that land cover changes in Osa County are driven by grassland/forest dynamics. Forest area diminished over the 1987-1998 period, whereas it increased by 5 and 6 % during the 1998-2003 and 2003-2009 periods, respectively. Grassland abandonment was identified as the main driver of the net increase in forest cover area. Fragmentation analysis was done over the forest class of these maps disclosing secondary forest of the persistent forest of each period. Persistent forest patches decrease in number, but increase in size through time, forming areas of persistent forest established in bigger patches with lower edge density. Secondary forest patches have increased in number and size, forming larger areas of forest established in bigger patches. Nearly half of the reforested area in the period 1987-2009 remained as secondary forest in 2009, playing a key role by decreasing forest fragmentation and strengthening the natural corridor connecting the conservation areas of the region.

Threatened birds of the Angolan Central Escarpment: distribution and response to habitat change at Kumbira Forest	ORYX												Kumbira Forest is the best representative area of Angola's Central Escarpment and the only site known to hold significant populations of four of the five threatened endemic bird species of this habitat. However, the forest is disappearing as a result of human activities. Remote-sensing techniques were used to assess changes in forest cover, and bird and habitat surveys were performed to assess the effect of land-use changes on endemic species and the bird community. No relationships could be established between the presence of endemics and habitat and landscape variables. This lack of effect may be attributable to the low number of records and compounded by the mosaic structure of the landscape. Although forest cover has been maintained in Kumbira, old-growth forest has been replaced by secondary growth in many areas. Nevertheless these secondary-growth forest patches can maintain a bird community similar to that found in old-growth forest.

Spectral data and derived indices from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) have been used for hydrological monitoring of large wetlands. However, comparable studies for small wetlands (< 25 km(2)) are lacking. Our aims are to examine whether MODIS-derived indices at 500-m spatial resolution can perform this task for small wetlands, and to compare the performance of various indices. First we evaluated if water levels are a good indicator for wetland inundation extent. A high correlation between water level and Landsat-derived inundation extent was found (R (2) = 0.957). Secondly, we compared 10 years of water level fluctuations with seven spectral indices at a 16-day interval. The Tasseled Cap brightness index (TCBI) had the highest correlation with water level for the complete time series including dry and wet years. Thirdly, we analyzed how these indices behave for areas with different inundation characteristics. Again TCBI showed a consistently accurate performance, which was independent of inundation frequency. We therefore conclude that TCBI is the best-suited index for monitoring of hydrological variability in small seasonally-flooded wetlands such as the Fuente de Piedra lake in southern Spain. We recommend testing this index further for other seasonally-flooded wetlands in semi-arid areas.

Over four decades since the launch of the first land-observation satellite Landsat-1 in 1972, a tremendous number of earth observation images have been acquired and archived. Here we examined land cover mapping in 142 critical terrestrial ecoregions (identified by WWF Global 200) from three aspects: Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (TM/ETM+) data availability, literature and existing global land cover map. We found that: (1) the availability of Landsat TM/ETM+ for historical land-cover change analysis in those ecoregions is poor. Only 17 ecoregions and 38 ecoregions have sufficient number of seasonal images in the Landsat archive for change analysis at 10-year and 5-year intervals, respectively. (2) Only 26 of 142 ecoregions belong to research hotspots of land cover mapping based on a spatialized literature database. (3) From a 30 m global land cover map (which is FROM-GLC, Finer Resolution Observation and Monitoring - Global Land Cover), only 28 ecoregions have greater than 80% map accuracy while 36 ecoregions have poorer than 50% map accuracy. Our finding suggests a significant gap of observation and understanding of these critical ecoregions from space, and an urgent need to meet the requirement of the conservation science community, in order for land cover data to fulfil its potential to timely monitor the loss of biodiversity from space, improve our knowledge of the state of conservation, and inform better decision making.

Active remote sensing provides a rapid assessment tool to potentially guide land managers in highly dynamic and spatially complex landscapes. These landscapes are often dependent on frequent disturbance regimes and characterized by high endemism. We propose a modified Shannon-Wiener Index and modified Evenness Index as stand structural complexity indices for surrogates of ecosystem health. These structural indices are validated at Tall Timbers Research Station the site of one of the longest running fire ecology studies in southeastern U.S. This site is dominated by highly dynamic pine-grassland woodlands maintained with frequent fire. Once the dominant ecosystem in the Southeast, this woodland complex has been cleared for agriculture or converted to other cover types, and depends on a frequent (1- to 3-year fire return interval) low- to moderate-intensity fire regime to prevent succession to mixed hardwood forests and maintain understory species diversity. Structural evaluation of the impact of multiple disturbance regimes included height profiles and derived metrics for five different fire interval treatments; 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, mixed fire frequency (a combination of 2- and 4-year fire returns), and fire exclusion. The 3-dimensional spatial arrangement of structural elements was used to assess hardwood encroachment and changes in structural complexity. In agreement with other research, 3-year fire return interval was considered to be the best fire interval treatment for maintaining the pine-grassland woodlands, because canopy cover and vertical diversity indices were shown to be statistically higher in fire excluded and less frequently burned plots than in 1- and 2-year fire interval treatments. We developed a LiDAR-derived structural diversity index, LHDI, and propose that an ecosystem-specific threshold target for management intervention can be developed, based on significant shifts in structure and composition using this new index. Structural diversity indices can be valuable surrogates of ecosystem biodiversity, and ecosystem-specific target values can be developed as objective quantifiable goals for conservation and ecosystem integrity, particularly in remote areas.

Measuring freshwater aquatic ecosystems: The need for a hyperspectral global mapping satellite mission	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Freshwater ecosystems underpin global water and food security, yet are some of the most endangered ecosystems in the world because they are particularly vulnerable to land management change and climate variability. The US National Research Council's guidance to NASA regarding missions for the coming decade includes a polar orbiting, global mapping hyperspectral satellite remote sensing mission, the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI), to make quantitative measurements of ecosystem change. Traditionally, freshwater ecosystems have been challenging to measure with satellite remote sensing because they are small and spatially complex, require high fidelity spectroradiometry, and are best described with biophysical variables derived from high spectral resolution data. In this study, we evaluate the contribution of a hyperspectral global mapping satellite mission to measuring freshwater ecosystems. We demonstrate the need for such a mission, and evaluate the suitability and gaps, through an examination of the measurement resolution issues impacting freshwater ecosystem measurements (spatial, temporal, spectral and radiometric). These are exemplified through three case studies that use remote sensing to characterize a component of freshwater ecosystems that drive primary productivity. The high radiometric quality proposed for the HyspIRI mission makes it uniquely well designed for measuring freshwater ecosystems accurately at moderate to high spatial resolutions. The spatial and spectral resolutions of the HyspIRI mission are well suited for the retrieval of multiple biophysical variables, such as phycocyanin and chlorophyll-a. The effective temporal resolution is suitable for characterizing growing season wetland phenology in temperate regions, but may not be appropriate for tracking algal bloom dynamics, or ecosystem responses to extreme events in monsoonal regions. Global mapping missions provide the systematic, repeated measurements necessary to measure the drivers of freshwater biodiversity change. Archival global mapping missions with open access and free data policies increase end user uptake globally. Overall, an archival, hyperspectral global mapping mission uniquely meets the measurement requirements of multiple end users for freshwater ecosystem science and management. (C) 2015 The Authors.

One of the awarded projects focused on the flight transects covering the coastal ocean to demonstrate that the AVIRIS data can be used to infer phytoplankton functional types at the land-sea interface. Specifically, this project directly assesses whether HyspIRI can provide adequate signal in the complex aquatic environment of the coastal zone to address questions of algal bloom dynamics, water quality, transient responses to human disturbance, river runoff, and red tides. Phytoplankton functional type (PFT), or biodiversity, can be determined from ocean color using the Phytoplankton Detection with Optics (PHYDOTax) algorithm and this information can be used to detect and monitor for harmful algal blooms. PHYDOTax is sensitive to spectral shape and accurate retrievals of ocean color across the visible spectral range is needed. The specific goal of this paper is to address the challenges of sensor capabilities and atmospheric correction in coastal environments by assessing two atmospheric correction methods using AVIRIS data for the retrieval of ocean color for use in derived products of chlorophyll-a and phytoplankton functional type. The atmospheric correction algorithms Atmospheric Removal (ATREM) and Tafkaa were applied to AVIRIS imagery of Monterey Bay, CA collected on 10 April 2013 and 31 October 2013. Data products from the imagery were compared with shipboard measurements including chlorophyll-a from whole-water samples and phytoplanlcton community structure estimated from diagnostic pigment markers using CHEMical TAXonomy (CHEMTAX). Using ATREM and Tafkaa and a selected set of input parameters for the scenes, we were unable to produce accurate retrievals of ocean color for the determination of chlorophyll-a and phytoplanlcton diversity. A modified ATREM correction produced science-quality data in which chlorophyll-a was accurately estimated using the Ocean Color 3 (00) chlorophyll-a algorithm, but biodiversity using PHYDOTax was not accurately estimated. Improvements in sensor calibration, sensitivity, and atmospheric correction of the HyspIRI imagery data set is needed in order to adequately estimate biogeochemically meaningful data products for the ocean such as chlorophyll-a, inherent optical properties, or PFfs. The HyspIRI Science Team is seeking improvements so the HyspIRI Airborne Campaign data set can be used for algorithm development to understand biodiversity and ecosystem function of coastal habitats that are facing increasing threats of human impact and climate change.

These tundra-like grasslands are widely recognized by the scientific community for their biodiversity and their important ecosystem services for the local human population. Despite their remoteness, limited accessibility for humans and waterlogged soils, paramos are highly flammable ecosystems. They are constantly under the influence of seasonal biomass burning mostly caused by humans. Nevertheless, little is known about the spatial extent of these fires, their regime and the resulting ecological impacts. This paper presents a thorough mapping and analysis of the fires in one of the world's largest paramo, namely the Complejo de Paramos of Cruz Verde-Sumapaz in the Eastern mountain range of the Andes (Colombia). Landsat TM/ETM+ and MODIS imagery from 2001 to 2013 was used to map and analyze the spatial distribution of fires and their intra- and inter-annual variability. Moreover, a logistic regression model analysis was undertaken to test the hypothesis that the dynamics of the paramo fires can be related to human pressures. The resulting map shows that the burned paramo areas account for 57,179.8 hectares, of which 50% (28,604.3 hectares) are located within the Sumapaz National Park. The findings show that the fire season mainly occurs from January to March. The accuracy assessment carried out using a confusion matrix based on 20 reference burned areas shows values of 90.1% (producer accuracy) for the mapped burned areas with a Kappa Index of Agreement (KIA) of 0.746. The results of the logistic regression model suggest a significant predictive relevance of the variables road distance (0.55 ROC (receiver operating characteristic)) and slope gradient (0.53 ROC), indicating that the higher the probability of fire occurrence, the smaller the distance to the road and the higher the probability of more gentle slopes. The paper sheds light on fires in the Colombian paramos and provides a solid basis for further investigation of the impacts on the natural ecosystem functions and biodiversity.

Remote sensing has been increasingly contributing to timely, accurate, and cost-effective assessment of biodiversity-related characteristics and functions during the last years. However, most relevant studies constitute individual research efforts, rarely related with the extraction of widely adopted CBD biodiversity indicators. Furthermore, systematic operational use of remote sensing data by managing authorities has still been limited. In this study, the Aichi targets and the related CBD indicators whose monitoring can be facilitated by remote sensing are identified. For each headline indicator a number of recent remote sensing approaches able for the extraction of related properties are reviewed. Methods cover a wide range of fields, including: habitat extent and condition monitoring; species distribution; pressures from unsustainable management, pollution and climate change; ecosystem service monitoring; and conservation status assessment of protected areas. The advantages and limitations of different remote sensing data and algorithms are discussed. Sorting of the methods based on their reported accuracies is attempted, when possible. The extensive literature survey aims at reviewing highly performing methods that can be used for large-area, effective, and timely biodiversity assessment, to encourage the more systematic use of remote sensing solutions in monitoring progress towards the Aichi targets, and to decrease the gaps between the remote sensing and management communities.																	0960-3115	1572-9710				SEP	2015	24	10					2333	2363		10.1007/s10531-015-0947-z								WOS:000361601400001

The density of neighbouring members (members mean both pixels and patches) similar to the centre pixel in some image features may offer an opportunity to improve the separability. This paper focuses on the density-involved feature-location analyses (refer to as F-L analyses) developed from the framework of integrated analysis of feature and space. We expressed the density of feature-carried members in two elaborated models: using the density dimension and adding the density descriptors to a feature space to conduct the F-L analyses during a procedure of classifying urban tree species. Experimental results indicate that the two models cannot only increase the number of available independent components for constructing an input vector therefore making the feature space richer, but also provide the reference of spatial dependence among the feature-carried members thus finally making the identification less difficult. The method with the density-involved F-L analyses obviously outperforms that with only conventional spectral features analyses in the classification. The average overall accuracy (OA) derived from the former is 23% higher than that from the latter. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Determination of the vegetation carbon effect requires the assessment of ecological restoration measures. In this study, the temporal-spatial characteristics of vegetation carbon services were analyzed using remote sensing data and weather parameters by using geographic information system in northwest Guangxi, China, a typical karst area covered by the ongoing China's Grain-to-Green Program and eco-environment immigration during 2000-2010. The results showed that ecosystem services of vegetation carbon sequestration showed an upward trend during the 11 years; approximately 21.14 and 18.09 % of the karst area showed significant changes in the net primary productivity (NPP) and net ecosystem productivity (NEP; P < 0.05), respectively. With regard to spatial distribution, NPP and NEP were higher for the western non-karst areas, and the greatest increase in these parameters was recorded in the eastern part of the restoration area of karst rocky desertification. Vegetation carbon sequestration was significantly affected by the impacts of vegetation coverage, vegetation species, and forest type. The results of this study suggested that rocky desertification control measures have positive impacts on the spatial distribution of vegetation carbon services in the typical karst area of northwest Guangxi, China.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				SEP	2015	74	6					5307	5317		10.1007/s12665-015-4542-0								WOS:000360537700055

Identification and characterization of vegetation formations is generally conducted at a fine scale using ecological ground surveys, which are limited to small areas. While optical remotely sensed imagery is limited to cloud-free periods, SAR time-series are used more extensively for wetland mapping and characterization using the relationship between distribution of vegetation formations and flood duration. The aim of this study was to determine the optimal number and key dates of SAR images to be classified to map wetland vegetation formations at a 1:10,000 scale. A series of eight dual-polarization TerraSAR-X images (HH/VV) was acquired in 2013 during dry and wet seasons in temperate climate conditions. One polarimetric parameter was extracted first, the Shannon entropy, which varies with wetland flooding status and vegetation roughness. Classification runs of all the possible combinations of SAR images using different k (number of images) subsets were performed to determine the best combinations of the Shannon entropy images to identify wetland vegetation formations. The classification runs were performed using Support Vector Machine techniques and were then analyzed using the McNemar test to investigate significant differences in the accuracy of all classification runs based on the different image subsets. The results highlight the relevant periods (i.e. late winter, spring and beginning of summer) for mapping vegetation formations, in accordance with ecological studies. They also indicate that a relationship can be established between vegetation formations and hydrodynamic processes with a short time-series of satellite images (i.e. 5 dates). This study introduces a new approach for herbaceous wetland monitoring using SAR polarimetric imagery. This approach estimates the number and key dates required for wetland management (e.g. restoration) and biodiversity studies using remote sensing data.

The removal of damaged timber to restore economic value is accompanied by negative effects on various species groups, particularly breeding bird communities, and can hinder natural regeneration. However, little is known about the effect of postdisturbance logging on bird assemblages in winter when temperatures are low and food resources are unpredictable. We conducted fixed-radius point counts of wintering birds in forest stands logged or unlogged after windthrows and in mature forest stands to test our predictions that bird species densities and abundances (i) are lower in postdisturbance logged stands and (ii) depend on the amount of natural regeneration, (iii) which differs between logged and unlogged stands. Our generalized linear mixed model did not support the expected differences in bird abundance or species densities between postdisturbance logged and unlogged stands but indicated that mature forest stands harbor the highest bird abundances and species densities. The number of regenerated coniferous trees significantly positively affected wintering bird abundances in both postdisturbance logged and unlogged stands. Hence, the number of coniferous trees appears to be a main predictor of wintering bird presence.

An analysis of the suitability change of habitats is critical to waterbirds' habitats conservation. In this study, the suitability maps of waterbirds' habitats in 1990, 2000, and 2010 were created using the ecological niche suitability model (ENSM) in Bielahong Watershed of Northeast China. Five grades (good suitable, fair suitable, suitable, poor suitable, and not suitable) of suitability for waterbirds' habitats were assessed in a spatial scale. The possible causes and changing characteristics of suitable waterbirds' habitats loss were studied based on landscape metrics and habitat suitability index. The results indicate a significant decrease in the suitable waterbirds' habitats areas over the past 20 years with an average annual decrease rate of 874,3 ha /year. The number of suitable waterbirds' habitats patches (NP) increased substantially from 765 to 1729, and the mean patch size (MPS) decreased from 161,3 to 713 ha. Wetland degradation also occurred over the study period, resulting in the loss and isolation of suitable waterbirds' habitats. Water source change had the largest contribution to the suitable waterbirds' habitats change compared with other waterbirds' habitats suitability indexes. The results show that the shrinkage of suitable waterbirds' habitats may be attributed to human activity, aided by decreased wetland area.																	0255-660X	0974-3006				SEP	2015	43	3					599	607		10.1007/s12524-014-0429-x								WOS:000359730500015

Can citizen science contribute to the evidence-base that underpins marine policy?	MARINE POLICY												Marine legislation is becoming ever more complex, so new cost-effective ways of obtaining and processing increasingly large data sets are required to support evidence-based policy making. Citizen science is one solution, but the uptake of the evidence generated by citizens among policy makers is often limited. Here, the importance of citizen science in delivery of the evidence-base that underpins marine policy was assessed using a series of case-studies. There was no consistent rationale for developing policy-relevant citizen science, but drivers included: lack of existing data, difficulty in collecting data by other means, the use of citizen science data by other organisations, and the capabilities of volunteers. Challenges to the uptake of marine citizen science were identified from policy-maker, scientist and citizen perspectives, and these related to data quality, data access, motivation of volunteers, and physical location. Citizen science has good potential to contribute to the evidence-base alongside traditional monitoring, remote sensing, and modelling, but only if outputs from citizen science projects are judged individually on quality. If this is the case, citizen science has an important role in delivery and understanding of future marine policy, but is only one part of an integrated solution.

Measures of spatio-temporal accuracy for time series land cover data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Remote sensing is a useful tool for monitoring changes in land cover over time. The accuracy of such time-series analyses has hitherto only been assessed using confusion matrices. The matrix allows global measures of user, producer and overall accuracies to be generated, but lacks consideration of any spatial aspects of accuracy. It is well known that land cover errors are typically spatially auto-correlated and can have a distinct spatial distribution. As yet little work has considered the temporal dimension and investigated the persistence or errors in both geographic and temporal dimensions. Spatio-temporal errors can have a profound impact on both change detection and on environmental monitoring and modelling activities using land cover data. This study investigated methods for describing the spatiotemporal characteristics of classification accuracy. Annual thematic maps were created using a random forest classification of MODIS data over the Jakarta metropolitan areas for the period of 2001-2013. A logistic geographically weighted model was used to estimate annual spatial measures of user, producer and overall accuracies. A principal component analysis was then used to extract summaries of the multitemporal accuracy. The results showed how the spatial distribution of user and producer accuracy varied over space and time, and overall spatial variance was confirmed by the principal component analysis. The results indicated that areas of homogeneous land cover were mapped with relatively high accuracy and low variability, and areas of mixed land cover with the opposite characteristics. A multi-temporal spatial approach to accuracy is shown to provide more informative measures of accuracy, allowing map producers and users to evaluate time series thematic maps more comprehensively than a standard confusion matrix approach. The need to identify suitable properties for a temporal kernel are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Remote sensing captures varying temporal patterns of vegetation between human-altered and natural landscapes	PEERJ												Global change has led to shifts in phenology, potentially disrupting species interactions such as plant-pollinator relationships. Advances in remote sensing techniques allow one to detect vegetation phenological diversity between different land use types, but it is not clear how this translates to other communities in the ecosystem. Here, we investigated the phenological diversity of the vegetation across a human-altered landscape including urban, agricultural, and natural land use types. We found that the patterns of change in the vegetation indices (EVI and NDVI) of human-altered landscapes are out of synchronization with the phenology in neighboring natural California grassland habitat. Comparing these findings to a spatio-temporal pollinator distribution dataset, EVI and NDVI were significant predictors of total bee abundance, a relationship that improved with time lags. This evidence supports the importance of differences in temporal dynamics between land use types. These findings also highlight the potential to utilize remote sensing data to make predictions for components of biodiversity that have tight vegetation associations, such as pollinators.

Northwest Yunnan Province is a key region for biodiversity conservation in China, and it has experienced severe droughts since the beginning of this century; however, the extent of the contributions from climate and human-driven changes remains unclear. We calculated the ecosystem evapotranspiration (ET) and water yield (WY) of northwest Yunnan Province, China from 2001 to 2013 using meteorological and remote sensing observation data and a Surface Energy Balance System(SEBS) model. Multivariate regression analyses were used to differentiate the contribution of climate and vegetation coverage to ET. The results showed that the annual average vegetation coverage significantly increased over time with a mean of 0.69 in spite of the precipitation fluctuation. Afforestation/reforestation and other management efforts attributed to vegetation coverage increase in NW Yunnan. Both ET and WY considerably fluctuated with the climate factors, which ranged from 623.29 mm to 893.8 mm and -51.88 mm to 384.40 mm over the time period. Spatially, ET in the southeast of NW Yunnan (mainly in Lijiang) increased significantly, which was in line with the spatial trend of vegetation coverage. Multivariate linear regression analysis indicated that climatic factors accounted for 85.18% of the ET variation, while vegetation coverage explained 14.82%. On the other hand, precipitation accounted for 67.5% of the WY. We conclude that the continuous droughts in northwest Yunnan were primarily climatically driven; however, man-made land cover and vegetation changes also increased the vulnerability of local populations to drought. Because of the high proportion of the water yield consumed for subsistence and poor infrastructure for water management, local populations have been highly vulnerable to climate drought conditions. We suggest that conservation of native vegetation and development of water-conserving agricultural practices should be implemented as adaptive strategies to mitigate climate change.																	1932-6203					AUG 3	2015	10	8							e0134795	10.1371/journal.pone.0134795								WOS:000358942400039	26237220

Since the beginning of the last century, the population of Ethiopia has increased drastically with large effects on the natural vegetation and biodiversity. However, the original land cover patterns in Ethiopia have not been precisely mapped, which hinder the identification of the biophysical and socio-economic factors that contributed to the current landscape patterns. The objective of this study was to reconstruct the past century vegetation landscapes of Ethiopia (i.e. vegetation cover before agricultural expansion) and identify which ecosystems have been most affected by land changes. First, the net primary productivity (NPP) was modelled based on the climatic constraints of natural vegetation growth (water availability, solar radiation and minimum temperature) derived from remote sensing and climate data. This analysis showed that water availability is the most critical constraint for vegetation growth for all regions and land cover types in Ethiopia. Then, the past vegetation was mapped based on predicted NPP. Our results show that i) the extent of broadleaved evergreen or semi-deciduous forest, open broadleaved deciduous forest, closed to open shrubland, mosaic forest-shrubland/grassland, sparse vegetation and grassland was 18.8%, 12.4%, 20.6%, 31.5%, and 16.8%, respectively, and ii) current agricultural landscapes were previously covered mainly by broadleaved evergreen and deciduous forest, which encompassed 38.9%. The least affected by agricultural expansion were sparse vegetation and grassland. Our study provides novel insights on pre-agricultural expansion landscapes in Ethiopia with critical information for scientists and other stakeholders working on the restoration and rehabilitation of degraded areas.

Populations have already been depleted to approximately 20% of their former size with habitat destruction, alterations, and loss being the main drivers of population declines. Habitat suitability models were computed using a combination of bioclimatic and remote sensing variables as environmental predictors to evaluate habitat suitability and coverage by designated protected areas across the species' distributional range. In addition, population connectivity as well as current and future habitat fragmentation through dam construction was assessed by performing population connectivity models. Habitat suitability models show the spatial extent of suitable habitat to be high (46%), although only a small proportion is covered by designated reserves (11%). Population connectivity models showed remnant populations to be highly fragmented. Considering habitat suitability, coverage of reserves and population connectivity the lower Mekong River Basin stretching from the Xe Champhon and Xe Xangxoy rivers in Lao PDR to the Srepok and Sekong rivers in eastern Cambodia seem to be particularly important for future conservation prioritization for C. siamensis. The presently established protected area network is unsatisfactory in terms of size and population connectivity and needs to be significantly improved to successfully sustain viable populations of the critically endangered Siamese crocodile in the future.

Low water levels predicted for several fluvial systems make wetlands especially vulnerable to the spread of invaders, such as the common reed (Phragmites australis), one of the most invasive species in North America. We developed a model to map the distribution of potential germination grounds of the common reed in freshwater wetlands of the St.Lawrence River (Quebec, Canada) under current climate conditions and used this model to predict their future distribution under two climate change scenarios simulated for 2050. We gathered historical and recent (remote sensing) data on the distribution of common reed stands for model calibration and validation purposes, then determined the parameters controlling the species establishment by seed. A two-dimensional model and the identified parameters were used to simulate the current (2010) and future (2050) distribution of germination grounds. Common reed stands are not widespread along the St.Lawrence River (212ha), but our model suggests that current climate conditions are already conducive to considerable further expansion (>16,000ha). Climate change may also exacerbate the expansion, particularly if river water levels drop, which will expose large bare areas propitious to seed germination. This phenomenon may be particularly important in one sector of the river, where existing common reed stands could increase their areas by a factor of 100, potentially creating the most extensive reedbed complex in North America. After colonizing salt and brackishwater marshes, the common reed could considerably expand into the freshwater marshes of North America which cover several million hectares. The effects of common reed expansion on biodiversity are difficult to predict, but likely to be highly deleterious given the competitiveness of the invader and the biological richness of freshwater wetlands.

Where the wild things are: using remotely sensed forest productivity to assess arboreal marsupial species richness and abundance	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												AimHighly productive areas have long been hypothesized to support a greater abundance and diversity of animals than less productive areas. However, evidence for this is equivocal and, until recently, has been difficult to test at a landscape level. For the first time, we use imaging spectroscopy to investigate the relationship between plant productivity and arboreal mammal species richness and abundance at a landscape scale. LocationA eucalypt forest in New South Wales, Australia. MethodsUsing a common index of plant productivity - normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) - as a proxy for available energy, we test the ability of species-energy theory and optimal foraging theory to explain variations in arboreal marsupial species richness and abundance. We obtained NDVI data from an airborne imaging spectrophotometer. ResultsSpecies richness increased in relation to NDVI among 53 eucalypt forest sites, based on five arboreal marsupial species. The presence and abundance of a eucalypt folivore specialist, Petauroides volans, increased in relation to NDVI. The relative abundance of all arboreal marsupials collectively also increased in relation to NDVI among sites, even with P.volans data excluded. In support of optimal foraging theory, the observed locations of P.volans had a higher NDVI value than the average for sampling transects. In addition, the average NDVI of eucalypt forest remnants was positively related to the overall abundance of P.volans. An important caveat is that NDVI did not explain all the variation in arboreal marsupial populations. Main conclusionsAssuming that NDVI is an appropriate proxy for available energy in a eucalypt forest, our results are consistent with predictions from species-energy and optimal foraging theories. Remotely sensed measures of productivity and forage quality, used in conjunction with other important landscape characteristics, provide a potentially powerful tool to evaluate habitat and biodiversity hotspots at scales relevant to wildlife management and conservation.

Ironically, there is a scarcity of a comprehensive and systematic effort to know its fire-sensitive forest regions. Therefore, the present study was carried out in Kangra region of Indian western Himalaya to identify suitable conditions for forest fire by overlaying geographical coordinates of recorded fire locations on various thematic layers such as elevation, slope, aspect, mean annual temperature and fuel map of the region. Based on suitability table, the regions with favourable fire conditions were extracted from above thematic layers in GIS environment. The fire-sensitive regions were further prioritized into very high, high, medium, low, and very low forest fire-prone areas. The Pinus roxburghii forest type, low elevation, high temperature, high slope, south-west facing aspect, May month and anthropogenic disturbances were identified as major factors responsible for forest fire in the region. The half of the forest cover was identified as fire sensitive. The 10.7 % of the forest cover in the study area was categorized as 'very high' and 'high' forest fire-prone areas. The 14.02 % villages of the region were identified as 'high' forest fire prone. The P. roxburghii, mixed forest species, khair forest (Acacia spp.) and oak forest (Quercus spp.) were identified as fire-sensitive forest types of the region.																	0921-030X	1573-0840				AUG	2015	78	1					203	217		10.1007/s11069-015-1710-1								WOS:000357507900012

Forest cover change in Miombo Woodlands: modeling land cover of African dry tropical forests with linear spectral mixture analysis	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Dry tropical forests are experiencing some of the highest rates of change among the globe's forests. In sub-Saharan Africa, gross (loss, gain) and net changes in dry tropical forest areas are difficult to quantify at sub-national scales because of high spatio-temporal variability in land cover conditions due to vegetation phenology and land use practices. In this project we developed new, field-validated remote sensing characterizations of dry season surface components to separate forest from non-forest land cover, and assessed forest changes from the 1990s-2010s in a Tanzanian Miombo Woodland landscape. Using a linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA) approach with Landsat 5-8 data, we examined the hypothesis that higher proportions of substrate and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) at non-forest regions distinguished them from forest cover against seasonally variable land cover conditions. Subsequently we evaluated the efficacy of multi-temporal classification and single-date image thresholding for identifying forest from non-forest cover. We found significantly greater proportions of substrate and NPV over non-forest compared to forest areas that enabled identification of forest cover across dry season images. Single-date, forest/non-forest maps based on an LSMA-derived metric attained overall accuracies of 81.0-85.3%, which approached multi-temporal unsupervised classifications (86.5% for forest/non-forest maps). Applying the LSMA-derived metric to study forest changes, our study region experienced a net 15.0% loss of 1995 forest area, and a 7.0% overall reduction in the total forest-occupied land cover from 1995-2011. Areas of gross forest gain were substantial, totaling 13.6% of the 1995 forest area. We found differing patterns in gross forest losses and gains among sub-regions and through time in our Tabora study area, which provide bases for testable hypotheses in future research on regional and localized drivers affecting forest cover. Our finding that non-green surface components distinguished forest from non-forest via an LSMA approach may be widely applicable to studying forest conversions in Miombo Woodlands and other dry tropical forests. This approach may also be useful for evaluating how land cover conditions change in response to potential land use or climate driving variables, or the impact of land changes for carbon balance and other ecosystem processes.

Detailed and area-wide environmental data on potential predictors and site-specific habitat characteristics, however, are usually not available across large spatial extents. Recent developments in environmental data acquisition such as the advent of Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing provide opportunities to characterize site-specific habitat conditions at a high level of detail and across large areas. Here, we used a dataset of regularly distributed local-scale records Of vascular plant, bryophyte and snail (Gastropoda) species to model richness patterns in forests across an environmentally heterogeneous region in Central Europe (Switzerland). We spatially predicted species richness based on a set of area-wide environmental factors representing climate, topography, soil pH and remotely sensed vegetation structure. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between species richness and field measures of forest stand structure and composition obtained from National Forest Inventory (NFI) data to identify potential target variables for habitat management. The predictions for species richness were most accurate for snails, followed by bryophyte and vascular plants, with R-2 values ranging from 0.37 to 0.07. Besides climate, site-specific factors such as soil pH, indices of topographic position and wetness as well as canopy structure were important for predicting species richness of all three target groups. Several NFI variables were identified as potential target variables for managing snail species richness. Stands with tree species from the genera Fraxinus, Tilia, Ulmus and Acer, for example, showed a positive relationship with snail species richness, as did an increasing overstory cover or higher volumes of deadwood. However, only weak relationships were found between NFI variables and species richness of vascular plants, and none for bryophytes. Our findings support the assumption that besides climate, site-specific habitat factors are important determinants of spatial variation of species richness at the local scale. The strength and direction of the determinants vary with taxa, thus indicating a functional relationship between site conditions and the respective species community. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This understanding is especially important in the fire-prone Mediterranean systems of the world. The fire frequency in these systems is sensitive to climate, and recent climate change has resulted in more frequent fires over the last few decades. However, the sensitivity of postfire recovery and biomass/fuel load accumulation to climate is less well understood than fire frequency despite its importance in driving the fire regime. In this study, we develop a hierarchical statistical framework to model postfire ecosystem recovery using satellite-derived observations of vegetation as a function of stand age, topography, and climate. In the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) of South Africa, a fire-prone biodiversity hotspot, we found strong postfire recovery gradients associated with climate resulting in faster recovery in regions with higher soil fertility, minimum July (winter) temperature, and mean January (summer) precipitation. Projections using an ensemble of 11 downscaled Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) general circulation models (GCMs) suggest that warmer winter temperatures in 2080-2100 will encourage faster postfire recovery across the region, which could further increase fire frequency due to faster fuel accumulation. However, some models project decreasing precipitation in the western CFR, which would slow recovery rates there, likely reducing fire frequency through lack of fuel and potentially driving local biome shifts from fynbos shrubland to nonburning semidesert vegetation. This simple yet powerful approach to making inferences from large, remotely sensed datasets has potential for wide application to modeling ecosystem resilience in disturbance-prone ecosystems globally.

Joseph			Operational Tree Species Mapping in a Diverse Tropical Forest with Airborne Imaging Spectroscopy	PLOS ONE												Remote identification and mapping of canopy tree species can contribute valuable information towards our understanding of ecosystem biodiversity and function over large spatial scales. However, the extreme challenges posed by highly diverse, closed-canopy tropical forests have prevented automated remote species mapping of non-flowering tree crowns in these ecosystems. We set out to identify individuals of three focal canopy tree species amongst a diverse background of tree and liana species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, using airborne imaging spectroscopy data. First, we compared two leading singleclass classification methods-binary support vector machine (SVM) and biased SVM-for their performance in identifying pixels of a single focal species. From this comparison we determined that biased SVM was more precise and created a multi-species classification model by combining the three biased SVM models. This model was applied to the imagery to identify pixels belonging to the three focal species and the prediction results were then processed to create a map of focal species crown objects. Crown-level cross-validation of the training data indicated that the multi-species classification model had pixel-level producer's accuracies of 94-97% for the three focal species, and field validation of the predicted crown objects indicated that these had user's accuracies of 94-100%. Our results demonstrate the ability of high spatial and spectral resolution remote sensing to accurately detect non-flowering crowns of focal species within a diverse tropical forest. We attribute the success of our model to recent classification and mapping techniques adapted to species detection in diverse closed-canopy forests, which can pave the way for remote species mapping in a wider variety of ecosystems.

Aboveground carbon loss in natural and managed tropical forests from 2000 to 2012	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Tropical forests provide global climate regulation ecosystem services and their clearing is a significant source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and resultant radiative forcing of climate change. However, consensus on pan-tropical forest carbon dynamics is lacking. We present a new estimate that employs recommended good practices to quantify gross tropical forest aboveground carbon (AGC) loss from 2000 to 2012 through the integration of Landsat-derived tree canopy cover, height, intactness and forest cover loss and GLAS-lidar derived forest biomass. An unbiased estimate of forest loss area is produced using a stratified random sample with strata derived from a wall-to-wall 30 m forest cover loss map. Our sample-based results separate the gross loss of forest AGC into losses from natural forests (0.59 PgC yr(-1)) and losses from managed forests (0.43 PgC yr(-1)) including plantations, agroforestry systems and subsistence agriculture. Latin America accounts for 43% of gross AGC loss and 54% of natural forest AGC loss, with Brazil experiencing the highest AGC loss for both categories at national scales. We estimate gross tropical forest AGC loss and natural forest loss to account for 11% and6% of global year 2012 CO2 emissions, respectively. Given recent trends, natural forests will likely constitute an increasingly smaller proportion of tropical forest GHG emissions and of global emissions as fossil fuel consumption increases, with implications for the valuation of co-benefits in tropical forest conservation.

This is mainly applied in areas degraded by uncontrolled human development that favors forest fragmentation and loss of connectivity between different habitats. Making use of remote sensing and geographic information systems, we sought to identify areas to act as biodiversity corridors, allowing gene flow between remnant fragments and areas of permanent preservation. For such purpose, a spatial analysis of the remaining fragments on Sao Gabriel do Oeste, Mato Grosso do Sul, was made, by its form, size and location. The areas for the corridors were identified from the location of fragments with potential, i.e., with proper size and conservation, besides considering the chart of land classes for mechanization and the map of priority areas for conservation from Ministry of Environment [Ministerio do Meio Ambiente], allowing the choice of better areas for biodiversity corridors. It was verified, that geotechnologies are important tools in helping to determine suitable areas for the integrated analysis of the landscape, as in helping on the delimitation of suitable areas for implanting corridors, generating an alternative scenario for environmental recovery, ecological zoning and environmental conservation.																	0100-6762					JUL-AUG	2015	39	4					595	602		10.1590/0100-67622015000400001								WOS:000366100700001

Although they only account for 5% of the global land surface, over 550 million people live in deltas. These preferred livelihood locations, which feature flat terrain, fertile alluvial soils, access to fluvial and marine resources, a rich wetland biodiversity and other advantages are, however, threatened by numerous internal and external processes. Socio-economic development, urbanization, climate change induced sea level rise, as well as flood pulse changes due to upstream water diversion all lead to changes in these highly dynamic systems. A thorough understanding of a river delta's general setting and intra-annual as well as long-term dynamic is therefore crucial for an informed management of natural resources. Here, remote sensing can play a key role in analyzing and monitoring these vast areas at a global scale. The goal of this study is to demonstrate the potential of intra-annual time series analyses at dense temporal, but coarse spatial resolution for inundation characterization in five river deltas located in four different countries. Based on 250 m MODIS reflectance data we analyze inundation dynamics in four densely populated Asian river deltas-namely the Yellow River Delta (China), the Mekong Delta (Vietnam), the Irrawaddy Delta (Myanmar), and the Ganges-Brahmaputra (Bangladesh, India)-as well as one very contrasting delta: the nearly uninhabited polar Mackenzie Delta Region in northwestern Canada for the complete time span of one year (2013). A complex processing chain of water surface derivation on a daily basis allows the generation of intra-annual time series, which indicate inundation duration in each of the deltas. Our analyses depict distinct inundation patterns within each of the deltas, which can be attributed to processes such as overland flooding, irrigation agriculture, aquaculture, or snowmelt and thermokarst processes. Clear differences between mid-latitude, subtropical, and polar deltas are illustrated, and the advantages and limitations of the approach for inundation derivation are discussed.

In this study, floristic diversity of a remote alpine valley has been studied based on information extracted from remotely sensed satellite data along with field surveys undertaken during 2008-2014. Analysis of vegetation information from satellite data revealed that similar to 75% of the area is covered with natural vegetation which comprises lush green coniferous forests, alpine pastures and alpine scrub lands. With inputs from vegetation information extracted from satellite data, comprehensive field surveys were planned to document the floristic diversity of the region. Analysis of species composition showed a total of 285 plant species, belonging to 191 genera in 60 families. Of these, 250 species are herbs, 14 shrubs, 2 sub-shrubs and 19 trees. The dicotyledons are represented by 240 species, monocotyledons 30, gymnosperms 04, and pteriodophytes 11 species. Asteraceae is the largest family with 35 species. During the present study, 5 species (Corydalis cashmeriana, Hippophae rhamnoides, Primula minutissima, Saussurea sacra and Inula orientalis) have been recorded for the first time from this Himalayan region. The study demonstrates the benefits of geo-informatics in floristic studies, particularly the robustness of remotely sensed data in identifying areas with potentially high species richness, which would be otherwise difficult in a complex mountainous terrain using traditional floristic surveys alone. The present study is expected to provide baseline scientific data for cutting edge studies relating to long term ecological research, bioprospecting, possible impacts of changing climate on vegetation and sustainable use of plant resources in this Himalayan region.

While remote sensing data are adequate to describe these patterns, the often high-dimensional nature of these data poses some analytical challenges, potentially resulting in loss of generality. This may hinder the use of such data for mapping and monitoring beta-diversity patterns. This study presents Sparse Generalised Dissimilarity Modelling (SGDM), a methodological framework designed to improve the use of high-dimensional data to predict community turnover with GDM. SGDM consists of a two-stage approach, by first transforming the environmental data with a sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA), aimed at dealing with high-dimensional data sets, and secondly fitting the transformed data with GDM. The SCCA penalisation parameters are chosen according to a grid search procedure in order to optimise the predictive performance of a GDM fit on the resulting components. The proposed method was illustrated on a case study with a clear environmental gradient of shrub encroachment following cropland abandonment, and subsequent turnover in the bird communities. Bird community data, collected on 115 plots located along the described gradient, were used to fit composition dissimilarity as a function of several remote sensing data sets, including a time series of Landsat data as well as simulated EnMAP hyperspectral data. The proposed approach always outperformed GDM models when fit on high-dimensional data sets. Its usage on low-dimensional data was not consistently advantageous. Models using high-dimensional data, on the other hand, always outperformed those using low-dimensional data, such as single-date multispectral imagery. This approach improved the direct use of high-dimensional remote sensing data, such as time-series or hyperspectral imagery, for community dissimilarity modelling, resulting in better performing models. The good performance of models using high-dimensional data sets further highlights the relevance of dense time series and data coming from new and forthcoming satellite sensors for ecological applications such as mapping species beta diversity.				van der Linden, Sebastian/B-4516-2008; Schwieder, Marcel/B-9071-2016; Geophysical Equipment Facility, NERC/G-5260-2010; Moreira, Francisco/B-2873-2008; Leitao, Pedro/B-7422-2009	van der Linden, Sebastian/0000-0001-6576-8377; Schwieder, Marcel/0000-0003-2103-8828; Moreira, Francisco/0000-0003-4393-8018; Leitao, Pedro/0000-0003-3038-9531; Catry, Ines/0000-0002-5593-5001												2041-210X	2041-2096				JUL	2015	6	7					764	771		10.1111/2041-210X.12378								WOS:000358083200003

The relative value of field survey and remote sensing for biodiversity assessment	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The importance of habitat for biodiversity is well established, but the two most commonly used methods to measure habitat (field survey and remote sensing) have seldom been explicitly compared. We compare high-resolution sample-based field survey (Countryside Survey) with medium-resolution remotely sensed habitat data (the highest resolution of Land Cover Map available) for Great Britain. Variation in abundance of 60 bird species from 335 1km squares was modelled using habitat predictors from the two methods. Model comparisons assessed the explanatory power of (i) field survey vs. remotely sensed data and (ii) coarse information on habitat areas (Broad Habitats) vs. fine-grained information on Landscape Features. Field survey data (combining Broad Habitat and Landscape Feature predictors) explained more variation in bird abundance than remotely sensed data (comprising Broad Habitat predictors only) for 57 species and had significantly higher mean explanatory power, averaged across 60 species models. The relative explanatory power of remote sensing, as a proportion of that provided by field data, was measured at 73%, averaged across 60 species models. Predictions from field survey Broad Habitat data were more accurate than those from either remotely sensed Broad Habitat data or field survey Landscape Feature data, averaged across 60 species models. High-resolution data generate more reliable models of predicted local population responses to land use change than lower resolution remotely sensed data. Collection of field data is typically costly in time, labour and resources, making use of remote sensing more feasible for assessment at larger spatial extents if data of equivalent value are produced, but the cost-benefit threshold between the two is likely to be context specific. However, integration of field survey with remotely sensed data provides accurate predictions of bird distributions, which suggests that both forms of data should be considered for future biodiversity surveys.

ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Species distribution models should identify ecological requirements of species and predict their spatial density. However, data from remote sensing sources are often used alone as predictors in modelling distributions. Such data will only produce accurate models if features that are distinguishable by remote sensing are a good match to the environmental traits that delineate habitat requirements. Both the Goldcrest Regulus regulus and the Firecrest Regulus ignicapilla respond to complex features of habitats that are not described by simple remote sensing data. We tested the usefulness of remote sensing data as a predictor for two Regulus species according to data from 970 study plots sized 1 x 1 km. Predictors were aggregated using the PCAs and related to the Hayne estimator of species density using GAMs. The models based on both remote sensing data and detailed environmental data proved to be better than the model based only on remote sensing data and/or detailed forest structure data. The Goldcrest reached the highest density in areas with a high share of old spruce-dominated forests with a substantial share of the fir, avoiding the pine, and it preferred forests with a low number of tree species. In turn, the Firecrest favoured old forests, dominated by the spruce and the beech, with an admixture of single old fir and larch trees, avoiding the pine, and preferring forests with a high number of tree species. We suggest using not only free data sources, but also more detailed data containing thorough information on forest inventory derived from ground measurements.																	0912-3814	1440-1703				JUL	2015	30	4					625	638		10.1007/s11284-015-1263-5								WOS:000357679000009

Geospatial characterization of deforestation, fragmentation and forest fires in Telangana state, India: conservation perspective	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Conservation of biodiversity has been put to the highest priority throughout the world. The process of identifying threatened ecosystems will search for different drivers related to biodiversity loss. The present study aimed to generate spatial information on deforestation and ecological degradation indicators of fragmentation and forest fires using systematic conceptual approach in Telangana state, India. Identification of ecosystems facing increasing vulnerability can help to safeguard the extinctions of species and useful for conservation planning. The technological advancement of satellite remote sensing and Geographical Information System has increased greatly in assessment and monitoring of ecosystem-level changes. The areas of threat were identified by creating grid cells (5 x 5 km) in Geographical Information System (GIS). Deforestation was assessed using multi-source data of 1930, 1960, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2013. The forest cover of 40,746 km(2), 29,299 km(2), 18,652 km(2), 18,368 km(2), 18,006 km(2), 17,556 km(2) and 17,520 km(2) was estimated during 1930, 1960, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2013, respectively. Historical evaluation of deforestation revealed that major changes had occurred in forests of Telangana and identified 1095 extinct, 397 critically endangered, 523 endangered and 311 vulnerable ecosystem grid cells. The fragmentation analysis has identified 307 ecosystem grid cells under critically endangered status. Forest burnt area information was extracted using AWiFS data of 2005 to 2014. Spatial analysis indicates total fire-affected forest in Telangana as 58.9 % in a decadal period. Conservation status has been recorded depending upon values of threat for each grid, which forms the basis for conservation priority hotspots. Of existing forest, 2.1 % grids had severe ecosystem collapse and had been included under the category of conservation priority hotspot-I, followed by 27.2 % in conservation priority hotspot-II and 51.5 % in conservation priority hotspot-III. This analysis complements assessment of ecosystems undergoing multiple threats. An integrated approach involving the deforestation and degradation indicators is useful in formulating the strategies to take appropriate conservation measures.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2015	187	7							455	10.1007/s10661-015-4673-5								WOS:000357340500063

Emerging threats include climate change and its interaction with the spread of pests and diseases. The impact of such threats on the conservation status of trees is poorly understood. Here we highlight the need to conduct a comprehensive conservation assessment of the world's tree species, building on previous assessments undertaken for the IUCN Red List. We suggest that recent developments in plant systematics, online databases, remote sensing data and associated analytical tools offer an unprecedented opportunity to conduct such an assessment. We provide an overview of how a Global Tree Assessment could be achieved in practice, through participative, open-access approaches to data sharing and evaluation.

Population status of the Bornean orang-utan Pongo pygmaeus in a vanishing forest in Indonesia: the former Mega Rice Project	ORYX												As peat-swamp forests in Borneo become progressively more fragmented, the species that inhabit them are increasingly threatened, notably the Endangered Bornean orang-utan Pongo pygmaeus. The area of a failed agricultural project known as the Mega Rice Project in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, is composed of fragments of peat-swamp forest that are reported to contain orang-utans, although no comprehensive survey has previously been conducted. In a portion of this area we identified remaining forest fragments, using satellite imagery, and surveyed line transects for orang-utan sleeping nests to determine the density, abundance and distribution of the species. The total area of peat-swamp forest in the study area is 76,755 ha, 59,948 ha of which comprises patches at least as large as the home range of a female orang-utan (250 ha). We estimate a mean population density of 2.48 +/- SE0.32 individuals km(-2) and a population of 1,700 +/- SE220 or 1,507 +/- SE195 individuals, based on a 25 and 250 ha minimum patch size threshold, respectively. This is c. 40-45% of the original population, and the fragmented population is unlikely to be viable in terms of long-term demographic and genetic stability. To ensure persistence of this population of orang-utans, direct conservation action to connect forest fragments and prevent further loss of peat-swamp forest will be required, including re-establishing the hydrological regime, reforesting barren areas and fighting fires.

However, dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) which are increasingly used to simulate ecosystem functions under global change, condense functional diversity to plant functional types (PFTs) with constant parameters. Here, we develop an individual- and trait-based version of the DGVM LPJmL (Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land) called LPJmL- flexible individual traits (LPJmL-FIT) with flexible individual traits) which we apply to generate plant trait maps for the Amazon basin. LPJmL-FIT incorporates empirical ranges of five traits of tropical trees extracted from the TRY global plant trait database, namely specific leaf area (SLA), leaf longevity (LL), leaf nitrogen content (N-area), the maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco per leaf area (vcmaxarea), and wood density (WD). To scale the individual growth performance of trees, the leaf traits are linked by trade-offs based on the leaf economics spectrum, whereas wood density is linked to tree mortality. No preselection of growth strategies is taking place, because individuals with unique trait combinations are uniformly distributed at tree establishment. We validate the modeled trait distributions by empirical trait data and the modeled biomass by a remote sensing product along a climatic gradient. Including trait variability and trade-offs successfully predicts natural trait distributions and achieves a more realistic representation of functional diversity at the local to regional scale. As sites of high climatic variability, the fringes of the Amazon promote trait divergence and the coexistence of multiple tree growth strategies, while lower plant trait diversity is found in the species-rich center of the region with relatively low climatic variability. LPJmL-FIT enables to test hypotheses on the effects of functional biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and to apply the DGVM to current challenges in ecosystem management from local to global scales, that is, deforestation and climate change effects.

Is a three-dimensional (3D) woody vegetation structural classification applied to LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data better than a 2D analysis to investigate change in fine-scale woody vegetation structure over 2yrs in a protected area (PA) and a communal rangeland (CR)? LocationBushbuckridge Municipality and Sabi Sand Wildtuin, NE South Africa. MethodsAirborne LiDAR data were collected over 3300ha in April 2008 and 2010. Individual tree canopies were identified using object-based image analysis and classified into four height classes: 1-3, 3-6, 6-10 and >10m. Four structural metrics were calculated for 0.25-ha grid cells: canopy cover, number of canopy layers present, cohesion and number of height classes present. The relationship between top-of-canopy cover and sub-canopy cover was investigated using regression. Gains, losses and persistence (GLP) of cover at each height class and the four structural metrics were calculated. GLP of clusters of each structural metric (calculated using LISA - Local Indicators of Spatial Association - statistics) were used to assess the changes in clusters of each metric over time. ResultsTop-of-canopy cover was not a good predictor of sub-canopy cover. The number of canopy layers present and cohesion showed gains and losses with persistence in canopy cover over time, necessitating the use of a 3D classification to detect fine-scale changes, especially in structurally heterogeneous savannas. Trees >3m in height showed recruitment and gains up to 2.2 times higher in the CR where they are likely to be protected for cultural reasons, but losses of up to 3.2-fold more in the PA, possibly due to treefall caused by elephant and/or fire. ConclusionLand use has affected sub-canopy structure in the adjacent sites, with the low intensity use CR showing higher structural diversity. A 3D classification approach was successful in detecting fine-scale, short-term changes between land uses, and can thus be used as a monitoring tool for savanna woody vegetation structure.

However, the native biodiversity in these forests is threatened by the presence of invasive species such as Chromolaena odorata (L.) King and Robinson, which thrives in forest canopy gaps. Our study explored the utility of WorldView-2 data, an 8-band high resolution (2 m) imagery for mapping the probability of C. odorata occurrence (presence/absence) in canopy gaps of a subtropical forest patch, the Dukuduku forest, South Africa. An integrated modelling approach involving the WorldView-2 vegetation indices and ancillary environmental data was also assessed. The results showed a higher performance of the environmental data only model (deviance or D (2) = 0.52, p < 0.05, n = 77) when compared to modelling with WorldView-2 vegetation indices such as the enhanced vegetation index, simple ratio indices and red edge normalized difference vegetation index (D (2) = 0.30, p < 0.05, n = 77). The integrated model explained the highest presence/absence variance of C. odorata (D (2) = 0.71, i.e. 71 %). This model was used to derive a probability map indicating the occurrence of invasive species in forest gaps. A 2 x 2 error matrix table and the receiver operating characteristic curve derived from an independent validation dataset (n = 38) were used to assess the model accuracy. Approximately 87 % of canopy gaps containing C. odorata were correctly predicted at probability threshold of 0.3. The derived probability map of C. odorata occurrence could assist management in prioritizing target areas for eradication of the species.

New vegetation type map of India prepared using satellite remote sensing: Comparison with global vegetation maps and utilities	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												A seamless vegetation type map of India (scale 1: 50,000) prepared using medium-resolution IRS LISS-III images is presented. The map was created using an on-screen visual interpretation technique and has an accuracy of 90%, as assessed using 15,565 ground control points. India has hitherto been using potential vegetation/forest type map prepared by Champion and Seth in 1968. We characterized and mapped further the vegetation type distribution in the country in terms of occurrence and distribution, area occupancy, percentage of protected area (PA) covered by each vegetation type, range of elevation, mean annual temperature and precipitation over the past 100 years. A remote sensing-amenable hierarchical classification scheme that accommodates natural and semi-natural systems was conceptualized, and the natural vegetation was classified into forests, scrub/shrub lands and grasslands on the basis of extent of vegetation cover. We discuss the distribution and potential utility of the vegetation type map in a broad range of ecological, climatic and conservation applications from global, national and local perspectives. We used 15,565 ground control points to assess the accuracy of products available globally (i.e., GlobCover, Holdridge's life zone map and potential natural vegetation (PNV) maps). Hence we recommend that the map prepared herein be used widely. This vegetation type map is the most comprehensive one developed for India so far. It was prepared using 23.5 m seasonal satellite remote sensing data, field samples and information relating to the biogeography, climate and soil. The digital map is now available through a web portal (http://bis.iirs.govin). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Focusing on the effects of logging, this study introduces an index of wood production, the forest harvest index (FHI), which calculates the expected gross forest cover loss (GFCL) reflecting the demand for timber and wood products at the global scale. We examined the accuracy and precision of the index by investigating the relationship between the FHI and actual GFCL measured through remote sensing. The index incorporates wood- and climate-specific biomass expansion factors and country-specific growing stock densities to convert wood production volume to expected GFCL. We quantitatively examined the effect of data uncertainty in the growing stock density values obtain from FRA 2010 on the predicted relationship between the FHI and actual GFCL. We quantified the FHI for both industrial roundwood and wood fuel during a 5-year period (FY2000-FY2004) in each of the 139 nations considered. Results demonstrated that the FHI of industrial roundwood (18.6 million ha yr(-1)) corresponds well to actual GFCL (19.3 million ha yr(-1)) during the same period. The data uncertainty analysis suggested that increasing the frequency of forest monitoring at the national level can improve the precision and accuracy of the FHI, but discrepancies between the FHI and actual GFCL were also identified. Furthermore, to demonstrate the utility of our index as a metric of virtual GFCL of wood products, we disaggregated the FHI into export, import and domestic based on global wood trade data and compared the strength of the relationship with actual GFCL. Export FHI had a strong positive relationship with GFCL, which effect far exceeded the compensating effect of import FHI, indicating that wood trade overall increased GFCL at the global scale.

The Total Wildlife Reserve of Bontioli (TWRB) in Burkina Faso is one of the country's refuges with high biodiversity. This reserve is seriously threatened by human activities, and little information is available about the on-site causes of degradation extent. This study was carried out to investigate drivers and extent of LDD in the TWRB. Household surveys, focus group discussions and field observations were used to identify socio-economic factors that influence land use and land cover (LULC) changes. The socio-economic data were analyzed using rankings and binary logistic regression techniques. Logistic regression model was used to establish the relationship between socio-economic drivers and land cover change. Remote sensing and GIS techniques were used to analyze land use and LULC changes over 29 years, employing Landsat images of 1984, 2001 and 2013. We performed a supervised classification based on the maximum likelihood algorithm to derive vegetation maps. The results revealed significant (p < 0.05) LULC change from one class of LULC to another. From 1984 to 2001, tree savannas, bare soils and agricultural lands increased by 17.55%, 18.79% and 21778.79%, respectively, while woodland, gallery forest, shrub savannas and water bodies decreased by 22.02%, 5.03%, 40.08% and 31.2%, respectively. From 2001 to 2013, gallery forests decreased by 14.33%, tree savannas by 22.30% and shrub savannas by 5.14%, while agricultural lands increased by 167.87% and woodlands by 3.21%. LDD occurred at a higher rate in areas bordering the reserve compared to the core-protected area and the inaccessible areas. Agricultural expansion and wood cutting activities were the main direct causes of LDD. Extensive land utilization for agriculture is a major threat to the conservation of biodiversity in this reserve. The research highlighted the soundness of GIS and remote sensing practical application to assess vegetation change extent in Burkina Faso. Understanding the signal extent of vegetation change is particularly important to support efforts by policy makers to halt or at least to slow down the deforestation in the country. There is a need to control the immediate causes of LULC dynamics by limiting agricultural land expansion and wood cutting in the study area. (C) 2015 The Authors.

An open-source spatio-dynamic wetland model of plant community responses to hydrological pressures	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING					19th Global Biennial Conference of the International-Society-for-Ecological-Modelling (ISEM)	OCT 28-31, 2013	Toulouse, FRANCE	Int Soc Ecol Modelling, Univ Toulouse, INRA, INP, CNRS, METEO France, Elsevier, Air France, Federat Rech Agrobiosciences, Interact & Biodiversites, MAD Environnement, SO Toulouse, Galleries Lafayette				Semiarid Mediterranean saline wetlands are semi-terrestrial ecosystems, which yearly undergo dry periods of several months, and shelter a rich, endemic and sensitive biota. In the last decades, the expansion of agricultural irrigated areas in semiarid Mediterranean catchments has led to altered inputs of water and nutrients to lowland wetlands. Hydrological alterations have affected characteristic plant communities, resulting in the replacement of valuable halophilic salt marsh and salt steppeplant communities by more generalist and opportunistic taxa, such as Phragmites australis (reed beds). A spatio-dynamic model and library were developed that aimed to explain the spatial distribution of three characteristic wetland plant communities in a semiarid Mediterranean wetland site in response to hydrological pressures from the catchment. Wetland plant communities and watershed irrigated agricultural areas were mapped by means of remote sensing at several dates between 1984 and 2008 and were partly used as forcing inputs and validation data. A dynamic model was initially developed using Stella software and then converted into R language by means of the StellaR software. Spatial dimension was added including neighbourhood and spatial flow algorithms representing the dispersion of plant communities. The conversion between plant communities was caused by the increase In water inflows from the watershed, mediated by spatial parameters, such as the distance to ephemeral rivers and the flow accumulation map within the wetland site. Results of the model were in agreement with remote sensing data, showing that in 2008 salt steppe had lost a half of its original area, whereas salt marsh and reed beds expanded extensively. The model developed in this study is available online as an R library, including all necessary input data sets and maps and documentation to run it. The model library offers a flexible tool that suits the needs of both advanced modellers and neophytes. Free and open source software and online code sharing repositories are proposed as modelling tools for future research. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The pattern of cropland varies among different regions depending on the traditional knowledge of farmers and availability of uncultivated land. Satellite images can be used to map cropland in open areas but have limitations for detecting undergrowth inside forests. Classification results are often biased and need to be supplemented with field observations. Undercover cropland inside forests in the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia was assessed using field observed percentage cover of land use/land cover classes, and topographic and location parameters. The most influential factors were identified using Boosted Regression Trees and used to map undercover cropland area. Elevation, slope, easterly aspect, distance to settlements, and distance to national park were found to be the most influential factors determining undercover cropland area. When there is very high demand for growing food crops, constrained under restricted rights for clearing forest, cultivation could take place within forests as an undercover. Further research on the impact of undercover cropland on ecosystem services and challenges in sustainable management is thus essential.

Single-Species Detection With Airborne Imaging Spectroscopy Data: A Comparison of Support Vector Techniques	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING					6th Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing (WHISPERS)	JUN, 2014	Lausanne, SWITZERLAND					Progress in mapping plant species remotely with imaging spectroscopy data is limited by the traditional classification framework, which carries the requirement of exhaustively defining all classes (species) encountered in a landscape. As the research objective may be to map only one or a few species of interest, we need to explore alternative classification methods that may be used to more efficiently detect a single species. We compared the performance of three support vector machine (SVM) methods designed for single-class detection-binary (one-again-stall) SVM, one-class SVM, and biased SVM-in detecting five focal tree and shrub species using data collected by the Carnegie Airborne Observatory over an African savanna. Prior to this comparison, we investigated the effects of training data amount and balance on binary SVM and evaluated alternative methods for tuning one-class and biased SVMs. A key finding was that biased SVM was generally best parameterized by crown-level cross validation paired with the tuning criterion proposed by Lee and Liu [1]. Among the different single-class methods, binary SVM showed the best overall performance (average F-scores 0.43-0.78 among species), whereas one-class SVM showed very poor performance (F-scores 0.09-0.46). However, biased SVM produced results similar to those obtained with binary SVM (F-scores 0.40-0.72), despite using labeled training data from only the focal class. Our results indicate that both binary and biased SVMs can work well for remote single-species detection, while both methods, particularly biased SVM, greatly reduce the amount of training data required compared with traditional multispecies classification.

Because conventional research methods were not practical for this purpose due to the lack of a geospatial perspective, we attempted to develop a research method integrating visual fish observation with a seabed habitat map and to expand knowledge to a two-dimensional scale. WorldView-2 satellite imagery of Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia obtained in September 2012 was analyzed and classified into four typical substrates: live coral, dead coral, seagrass and sand. Overall classification accuracy of this map was 81.3% and considered precise enough for subsequent analyses. Three sub-areas (CC: continuous coral reef, BC: boundary of coral reef and FC: few live coral zone) around reef slopes were extracted from the map. Visual transect surveys for several fish species were conducted within each sub-area in June 2013. As a result, Mean density (Ind. / 300 m(2)) of Chaetodon octofasciatus, known as an obligate feeder of corals, was significantly higher at BC than at the others (p < 0.05), implying that this species' density is strongly influenced by spatial configuration of its habitat, like the "edge effect." This indicates that future conservation procedures for coral reef fishes should consider not only coral cover but also its spatial configuration. The present study also indicates that the introduction of a geospatial perspective derived from remote sensing has great potential to progress conventional ecological studies on coral reef fishes.																	1738-5261	2005-7172				JUN	2015	50	2					343	352		10.1007/s12601-015-0032-2								WOS:000357691000023

The collective impact of harvest decisions by many small forest owners can be substantial at the landscape scale, yet monitoring harvests and regrowth in these forests is challenging. Remote sensing is an obvious route to detect and monitor small-scale land use dynamics over large areas. Using an annual series of Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images and a GIS shapefile of property boundaries, we identified units where harvests occurred from 2005 to 2011 using an Object-Based Change Detection (OBCD) approach. Percent of basal area harvested was verified using stand-level harvest data. Our method detected all harvests above 20% basal area removal in all forest types (northern hardwoods, mixed deciduous/coniferous, coniferous), on properties as small as 10 acres (0.4 ha; approximately four Landsat pixels). Our results had a resolution of about 10% basal area (that is, a selective harvest removal of 30% could be distinguished from one of 40%). Our method can be automated and used to measure annual harvest rates and intensities for large areas of the United States, providing critical information on land use transition.																	2072-4292					JUN	2015	7	6					7809	7825		10.3390/rs70607809								WOS:000357590300014

Measuring or monitoring habitat quality requires complex integration of many properties of the ecosystem, where traditional terrestrial data collection methods have proven extremely time-demanding. Remote sensing has known potential to map various ecosystem properties, also allowing rigorous checking of accuracy and supporting standardized processing. Our Special Issue presents examples where remote sensing has been successfully used for habitat mapping, quantification of habitat quality parameters, or multi-parameter modelling of habitat quality itself. New frontiers such as bathymetric scanning, grassland vegetation classification and operational use were explored, various new ecological verification methods were introduced and integration with ongoing habitat conservation schemes was demonstrated. These studies show that remote sensing and Geoinformation Science for habitat quality analysis have evolved from isolated experimental studies to an active field of research with a dedicated community. It is expected that these new methods will substantially contribute to biodiversity conservation worldwide.

To ensure effective monitoring and management of such landscapes, it is necessary to integrate landscape composition and the associated socio-economic processes in the conservation schemes. Artificial Night-Time Light (ANTL) pollution is a recent but striking environmental alteration due to human interventions. It is a major threat for species and communities which co-evolved with invariant natural light patterns over geological times. In spite of its potential key role in re-shaping natural systems, ANTL is seldom considered in macroecology. Remote sensing provides a unique set of tools to integrate ANTL in macroecological studies. In this work, we used remote sensing data of night-time lights along with Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) to study the effects and extent of ANTL in the night-time landscape (nightscape) of two protected areas in Italy. Our results showed that a considerable number of semi-natural vegetated patches suffer from ANTL pollution with varying magnitude. We observed a decline in highly suitable patches for biodiversity while the remaining patches were found concentrated in the innermost part of the parks. By simulating an exponential decrease in ANTL we showed that a moderate reduction in ANTL pollution would result in regaining a substantial amount of highly suitable patches for biodiversity. The decline in homogeneous dark patches in vegetated landscapes has negative impacts on biodiversity as well as on the ecosystem services it provides. Therefore, it is high time that the scientific community and the policy-makers increase their efforts to monitor and mitigate the ecological impacts of ANTL on ecosystems. The integration of light pollution in landscape ecology could combine remote sensing with other aspects of light pollution like indirect propagation and spectral composition. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Framework tool for a rapid cumulative effects assessment: case of a prominent wetland in Myanmar	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The wetland of focus, Inle Lake, located in centralMyanmar, is well known for its unique biodiversity and culture, as well as for ingenious floating garden agriculture. During the last decades, the lake area has seen extensive degradation in terms of water quality, erosion, deforestation, and biodiversity concomitant with a major shift to unsustainable land use. The study was conducted, with an emphasis on water quality, to analyze environmental impacts (effects) changing the ecosystem and to comprehensively evaluate the environmental state of the ecosystem through an innovative Rapid Cumulative Effects Assessment framework tool. The assessment started with a framework-forming Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA), which quantified and prioritized impacts over space and time. Critically important impacts were assessed for "intra-inter interactions" using the loop analysis simulation. Water samples were analyzed while geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing were used to identify water pollution hotspots. It was concluded that out of a plethora of impacts, pollution from municipal sources, sedimentation, and effects exerted by floating gardens had the most detrimental impacts, which cumulatively affected the entire ecosystem. The framework tool was designed in a broad sense with a reference to highly needed assessments of poorly studied wetlands where degradation is evident, but scarcely quantified, and where long- term field studies are fraught with security issues and resource unavailability (post- conflict, poor and remote regions, e.g., Afghanistan, Laos, Sudan, etc.)																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JUN	2015	187	6							341	10.1007/s10661-015-4508-4								WOS:000355917300028	25963760

Considerations on capacity building for national forest - assessments in developing countries - with a case study of India	INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW												Large-area forest assessments are attracting increasing attention owing to their role in providing information related to carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation and enhancement of rural livelihoods. The information needs actually hold good for all geographic levels from the local to the global. Forest assessments on national level are of particular interest because countries that wish to engage in the REDD+initiative and to benefit from results-based payments, need to give quantitative evidence of their progresses in enhancing their forest resources. This contribution analyzes the capacity building needs for national forest assessments with a focus on the situation in developing countries, identifies key areas in which national capacity may be developed and makes suggestions for implementation. India's forest assessment systems are used as an example. The National Forest Inventory (NFI) system needs to be institutionalized to ensure a practical way for proficient monitoring and analysis of forest ecosystems. The institutions established to carry out NFI require continued institutional and financial support with qualified and committed scholars and professionals from relevant disciplines, including forest mensuration, forest inventory and remote sensing.

Using lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles to monitor tropical forest recovery	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Large areas of tropical lands are being removed from agriculture and restored to address conservation goals. However, monitoring the ecological value of these efforts at the individual land-owner scale is rare, owing largely to issues of cost and accessibility. Traditional field-based measures for assessing forest recovery and habitat quality can be labour intensive and costly. Here we assess whether remote sensing measurements from lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are a cost-effective substitute for traditional field measures. An inexpensive UAV-based remote sensing methodology, "Ecosynth", was applied to measure forest canopy structure across field plots in a 7-9-yr tropical forest restoration study in southern Costa Rica. Ecosynth methods combine aerial images from consumer-grade digital cameras with computer vision software to generate 3D 'point cloud' models of vegetation at high spatial resolutions. Ecosynth canopy structure measurements were compared to field-based measures and their ability to predict the abundance of frugivorous birds; key seed dispersers that are sensitive to canopy structure. Ecosynth canopy height measurements were highly correlated with field-based measurements (R-2 >= 0.85), a result comparable in precision to LiDAR-based remote sensing measurements. Ecosynth parameters were also strongly correlated with above-ground biomass (R-2 >= 0.81) and percent canopy openness (R-2 = 0.82). Correlations were weaker with proportion-based measures such as canopy roughness (R-2 = 0.53). Several Ecosynth metrics (e.g., canopy openness and height) predicted frugivore presence and abundance at levels of accuracy similar to those of field-based measurements. Ecosynth UAV remote-sensing provides an effective alternate methodology to traditional field-based measures of evaluating forest structure and complexity across landscapes. Furthermore, given the volume of data that can be generated in a single flight plan, as well as the ability to use the technology in remote areas, these methods could expand the scope of studies on forest dynamics and recovery when combined with field-based calibration plots.

J	Gillespie, TW; Willis, KS; Ostermann-Kelm, S				Gillespie, Thomas W.; Willis, Katherine S.; Ostermann-Kelm, Stacey			Spaceborne remote sensing of the world's protected areas	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												There has been a rapid evolution of satellites, sensors, and techniques to measure, monitor, and manage terrestrial protected areas. There are over 100,000 protected areas around the world and most lack important information on the status and trends of natural resource issues. We review advances and limitations in spaceborne remote sensing that can be applied to all terrestrial protected areas around the world. There have been significant advances in baseline vegetation mapping and land cover classifications by combining field data, data from multiple sensors, and classification techniques. However, global classifications on the extent of non-forest vegetation types (e.g. grasslands and shrublands) are still needed at 30 m pixel resolution. High spatial (< 1 m) and spectral (220 bands) resolution sensors have provided important data on environmental issues (e.g. invasive species, degradation) that are region or site specific. Advances in monitoring protected areas have primarily focused on forest ecosystems and land cover dynamics in and around protected areas using time series data. Landsat imagery can be used to monitor vegetation extent and dynamics at 30 m pixel resolution across the globe, while the MODIS sensors are more appropriate for monthly updates on trends of ecosystem health in protected areas. There has also been an increase in time series remote sensing datasets on anthropogenic impacts, such as light pollution, fire, and land surface temperature, that can be used for all protected areas. Future geographic research should focus on developing global protocols and incorporating near real time and annual metrics that can easily be used by natural resource managers to assess the status and trends of all protected areas.																	0309-1333	1477-0296				JUN	2015	39	3					388	404		10.1177/0309133314561648								WOS:000355265300005

Nowadays, due to industrial, agricultural and anthropogenic activities signs of water pollution in the region have been found. The level of surface water pollution can be determined by traditional methods through observatory stations. However, a traditional approach to determine water contamination is discontinuous, and thereby makes pollution assessment of the entire estuary very difficult. Nowadays, remote sensing technology has been developed and widely applied in many fields, for instance, in monitoring water environments. Remote sensing data combined with information from in-situ observations allow for extraction of polluted components in water and accurate measurements of pollution level in the large regions ensuring objectivity. According to results obtained from Spot-5 imagery of Quang Ninh and Hai Phong, the extracted pollution components, like BOD, COD and TSS can be determined with the root mean square error, the absolute mean error and the absolute mean percentage error (%):+/- 4.37 (mg/l) 3.86 (mg/l), 27%; +/- 55.32 (mg/l), 48.30 (mg/l), 14%; and +/- 32.90 (mg/l), 23.38 (mg/l), 28%; respectively.

Study of the NDVI with multi-scale and time-series analysis using SPOT imagery during the period 1998-2012 in Uruguay	REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION												Vegetation indices are a relevant source of information for spatial monitoring of vegetation at multiple scales. Among them, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is one of the most commonly used. This study aims to describe and analyze the spatial patterns of the NDVI in terrestrial systems in Uruguay at the onset of the 21st Century. A multiscalar approach (country, basin and sites) was applied using time series analysis of NDVI values obtained from SPOT 4 and 5 images through the program Instrument Vegetation (VGT). The analyzed time series showed a significant fit of the Autocorrelated Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA) model, with an autocorrelation of order 2 and a level of integration of order 1, ARIMA (211). A significant decline of the NDVI over all spatial units was found, with agricultural units (site scale) showing the most negative slope. This study provides baseline data on changes in vegetation productivity for Uruguay, and develops an accurate and robust methodology for spatio-temporal analysis of NDVI series. Remote sensing techniques are shown to be relevant to improve the management of environmental systems.																	1133-0953	1988-8740				JUN	2015		43					31	42		10.4995/raet.2015.3683								WOS:000215991300004

The main objective of this study is to provide an environmental (coastal vegetation and coral reef condition) and socioeconomic (human population condition) baseline data of a poorly documented and weakly managed zone by the use of a set of rapid assessment methodologies, looking to assist the regional efforts to manage these coastal resources. To achieve this goal we used a series of surveying methods including remote sensing, geographic information systems and in situ land/underwater surveys, to allow a broad characterization of the resources' condition in the study zone. Results showed that reef habitat was dominated by macro-algae (61.2 +/- 7.6%), followed by soft coral (gorgonians, 12.4 +/- 4.1%), hard coral (8.2 +/- 5.1%) and sponges (2.5 +/- 1.3%). Zooanthids and tunicates represented less than 1% of the total; coral and macro algae estimates suggest a decline from records of 15 years ago. Highest fish densities were (144 +/- 124 individuals/100 m(2)), while lowest were (83 +/- 25 individuals/100 m(2)). The total average fish density recorded could also be reflecting a decrease trend in the reef community structure. The main economic activities in the area are fishing and land clearing. From December 2003, 22% (corresponding to 44 ha) of the total original vegetation cover in the studied area was deforested. By February 2007, the deforested area increased 4.4 ha more. Should this tendency continue, by 2025 it would only maintain 24% of its total coastal vegetation cover representing a huge habitat loss. The future of economic activities in these areas lie directly on the establishment of appropriate management strategies for the protection and conservation of the renowned biodiversity that this area comprises.

Evaluation of SPOT imagery for the estimation of grassland biomass	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												In many regions, a decrease in grasslands and change in their management, which are associated with agricultural intensification, have been observed in the last half-century. Such changes in agricultural practices have caused negative environmental effects that include water pollution, soil degradation and biodiversity loss. Moreover, climate-driven changes in grassland productivity could have serious consequences for the profitability of agriculture. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of remotely sensed data with high spatial resolution to estimate grassland biomass in agricultural areas. A vegetation index, namely the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and two biophysical variables, the Leaf Area Index (LAI) and the fraction of Vegetation Cover (fCOVER) were computed using five SPOT images acquired during the growing season. In parallel, ground-based information on grassland growth was collected to calculate biomass values. The analysis of the relationship between the variables derived from the remotely sensed data and the biomass observed in the field shows that LAI outperforms NDVI and fCOVER to estimate biomass (R-2 values of 0.68 against 0.30 and 0.50, respectively). The squared Pearson correlation coefficient between observed and estimated biomass using LAI derived from SPOT images reached 0.73. Biomass maps generated from remotely sensed data were then used to estimate grass reserves at the farm scale in the perspective of operational monitoring and forecasting. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The utilization of timber and non-timber resources by poor rural communities living around protected forest patches produce subtle changes in the forest canopy which can be hardly detected on a timely manner using traditional field surveys. The aims of this study were to assess: (i) the utility of very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery (World View-2, 0.5-2 m spatial resolution) for mapping tree species and canopy gaps in one of the protected subtropical coastal forests in South Africa (the Dukuduku forest patch (ca.3200 ha) located in the province of KwaZulu-Natal) and (ii) the implications of the map products to forest conservation. Three dominant canopy tree species namely, Albizia adianthifolia, Strychnos spp. and Acacia spp., and canopy gap types including bushes (grass/shrubby), bare soil and burnt patches were accurately mapped (overall accuracy = 89.3 +/- 2.1%) using WorldView-2 image and support vector machine classifier. The maps revealed subtle forest disturbances such as bush encroachment and edge effects resulting from forest fragmentation by roads and a power-line. In two stakeholders' workshops organised to assess the implications of the map products to conservation, participants generally agreed amongst others implications that the VHR maps provide valuable information that could be used for implementing and monitoring the effects of rehabilitation measures. The use of VHR imagery is recommended for timely inventorying and monitoring of the small and fragile patches of subtropical forests in Southern Africa. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Cherrill, A				Cherrill, Andrew			Large-scale Spatial Patterns in Species Richness of Orthoptera in the Greater London Area, United Kingdom: Relationships with Land Cover	Landscape Research												This paper explores species richness of insects of the order Orthoptera (grasshoppers, crickets, etc.) along spatial gradients defined using remotely sensed land cover data for an area of 5600 km(2) centred on the city of London. The number of species within grid-squares of a national atlas, controlled for recording effort, declined along composite multivariate spatial gradients representing landscapes with increasing dominance of arable and urban land uses, yet was uncorrelated with the area of an individual land cover representing cultivated land, and only weakly correlated with a second land cover representing urban development. Few orthopteran species reside directly within either arable crops or non-vegetated urban land covers. Thus, whilst the areas of the individual land covers are intuitively sensible (and simple) measures of agricultural and urban cover respectively, their areas do not capture ecologically relevant information about variation in the composition of the uncultivated and non-urban land cover matrices within which the species actually reside. The results illustrate the advantages of using multivariate data reduction techniques (such as the Principle Components Analysis applied here) to describe spatial gradients in the extent of agricultural and urban influence. Relatively few landscape scale studies have focused on insects and the present study illustrates a) the potential for using Orthoptera to explore issues of biodiversity in the landscape and to monitor impacts of land use via analysis of large-scale spatial patterns from national species distribution atlases combined with remotely sensed land cover, and b) the importance of selecting appropriate measures of land use which incorporate information on the complex mix of land cover types utilised by the species under investigation.

J	Feret, JB; Corbane, C; Alleaume, S				Feret, Jean-Baptiste; Corbane, Christina; Alleaume, Samuel			Detecting the Phenology and Discriminating Mediterranean Natural Habitats With Multispectral Sensors-An Analysis Based on Multiseasonal Field Spectra	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												Due to their high degree of vegetation heterogeneity, fragmentation, and biodiversity, Mediterranean natural habitats are difficult to assess and monitor with in situ observations solely. Together with standardized ground plots and regular in situ measurements, remote sensing contributes to better understand the diversity of these habitats and their phenology. We used field spectroradiometry to simulate the radiometric signal corresponding to six multispectral satellites: 1) IKONOS, 2) Landsat 5 TM, 3) Landsat 8, 4) Pleiades, 5) Sentinel-2, and 6) WorldView-2. We compared the suitability of each sensor for the estimation of the cover fraction of photosynthetic vegetation (PV) observed for five types of habitats during a vegetation cycle from February to October 2013. We also analyzed the contribution of multiseasonal satellite acquisitions for habitat discrimination. We showed that multivariate regression applied to Worldview-2 reflectance produces the most accurate PV. This was explained by the higher number of spectral bands in the visible domain. Habitat discrimination based on monotemporal acquisitions showed better performances when PV was higher. Sentinel-2 and WorldView-2 outperformed other sensors for each individual date. Multitemporal acquisitions outperformed monotemporal acquisition for habitat discrimination. However, selecting all reflectance data acquired during the season resulted in suboptimal performances compared to more parsimonious combinations. Finally, all of them ranged between 86.6% and 89.2% classification accuracy with multiseasonal acquisitions. New strategies need to be designed to identify individual habitats of particular interest. Defining optimal multiseasonal remote-sensing acquisitions specific to each habitat and appropriate spectral and spatial resolution will contribute to improved discrimination of Mediterranean natural habitats.

First, a spectral database of various land-cover and land-use information was compiled using multi-year field campaign data and photointerpretation of satellite images. Next, residential areas were extracted from IKONOS-2 and GeoEye-1 images using object oriented feature extraction (OBIA). Then, Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data were used to generate land-cover and land-use maps from 1990 to 2011, and LCLUC maps were developed with decadal intervals and converted to 100 m vector grid cells. Finally, the causal associations between LCLUC were quantified using ordinary least square regression analysis and Moran's I, and a forest disturbance index derived from the time series Landsat data were used to further confirm LCLUC drivers. The results showed that (1) local spatial statistical approaches were most effective at quantifying the drivers of LCLUC, and (2) the combined threats of habitat degradation in and around the reserve and increasing encroachment of invasive plant species lead to the expansion of shrubland and mixed forest within the former primary forest, which was echoed by the forest disturbance index derived from the Landsat data.																	2072-4292					MAY	2015	7	5					6257	6279		10.3390/rs70506257								WOS:000357596900022

As a result Kazakhstan became an important breadbasket of the former Soviet Union. However, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 triggered widespread agricultural abandonment, and much cropland reverted to grasslands. Our goal in this study was to reconstruct and analyze agricultural land-cover change since the eve of the Virgin Lands Campaign, from 1953 to 2010 in Kostanay Province, a region that is representative of Northern Kazakhstan. Further, we assessed the potential of currently idle cropland for re-cultivation. Wereconstructed the cropland extent before and after the Virgin Lands Campaign using archival maps, and we mapped the agricultural land cover in the late Soviet and post-Soviet period using multi-seasonal Landsat TM/ETM+ images from circa 1990, 2000 and 2010. Cropland extent peaked at approximately 3.1 Mha in our study area in 1990, 38% of which had been converted from grasslands from 1954 to 1961. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, 45% of the Soviet croplandwas abandoned and had reverted to grassland by 2000. After 2000, cropland contraction and re-cultivation were balanced. Using spatial logistic regressions we found that cropland expansion during the Virgin Lands Campaign was significantly associated with favorable agro-environmental conditions. In contrast, cropland expansion after the Campaign until 1990, as well as cropland contraction after 1990, occurred mainly in areas that were less favorable for agriculture. Cropland re-cultivation after 2000 was occurring on lands with relatively favorable agro-environmental conditions in comparison to remaining idle croplands, albeit with much lower agro-environmental endowment compared to stable croplands from1990 to 2010. In sum, we found that cropland production potentials of the currently uncultivated areas are much lower than commonly believed, and further cropland expansion is only possible at the expense of marginal lands. Our results suggest if increasing production is a goal, improving crop yields in currently cultivated lands should be a focus, whereas extensive livestock grazing as well as the conservation of non-provisioning ecosystem services and biodiversity should be priority on more marginal lands.

However, wildfires may: have undesirable effects on biodiversity and vegetation coverage; produce carbon emissions to the atmosphere; release smoke affecting human health; and cause loss of lives and property. There have been increasing concerns about the potential impacts of climate variability and change on forest fires. Climate change can alter factors that influence the occurrence of fire ignitions, fuel availability and fuel flammability. This review paper aims to identify tools and methods used for gathering information about the impacts of climate variability and change on forest fires, forest fuels and the probability of fires. Tools to assess the impacts of climate variability and change on forest fires include: remote sensing, dynamic global vegetation and landscape models, integrated fire-vegetation models, fire danger rating systems, empirical models and fire behavior models. This review outlines each tool in terms of its characteristics, spatial and temporal resolution, limitations and applicability of the results. To enhance and improve tool performance, each must be continuously tested in all types of forest ecosystems.

Mt Res Initiative EDW Working Grp	Elevation-dependent warming in mountain regions of the world	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE												There is growing evidence that the rate of warming is amplified with elevation, such that high-mountain environments experience more rapid changes in temperature than environments at lower elevations. Elevation-dependent warming (EDW) can accelerate the rate of change in mountain ecosystems, cryospheric systems, hydrological regimes and biodiversity. Here we review important mechanisms that contribute towards EDW: snow albedo and surface-based feedbacks; water vapour changes and latent heat release; surface water vapour and radiative flux changes; surface heat loss and temperature change; and aerosols. All lead to enhanced warming with elevation (or at a critical elevation), and it is believed that combinations of these mechanisms may account for contrasting regional patterns of EDW. We discuss future needs to increase knowledge of mountain temperature trends and their controlling mechanisms through improved observations, satellite-based remote sensing and model simulations.

USING GOOGLE EARTH, A VIRTUAL-GLOBE IMAGING PLATFORM, FOR ECOSYSTEM SERVICES-BASED RIVER ASSESSMENT	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS					3rd Biennial Symposium of the International Society for River Science	AUG 05-09, 2013	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA					A methodology for reach-based river ecosystem service assessment of eight ecosystem functions using remote sensing via Google Earth is presented. The number of publications addressing Google Earth and ecosystem services has grown significantly since 2005, yet this powerful remote sensing platform remains under-used in river science. Theoretical linkages between 18 riverscape fluvial features, attributes and land cover types, observable and measurable on Google Earth, and resultant river ecosystem service delivery are central to the methodology. Using this framework, we build on earlier ecosystem service conceptual models to develop a rules-based scoring approach and apply it to three rivers of differing size and character from source to mouth. The aim was to devise a robust ecosystem service assessment tool applicable to any ecoregion and to rivers of any size, degree of human modification and character. Reach or sector scales are river length dependent. The minimum reach scale recommended is 500m, and a 10km sector length was used on the longest of our three rivers. Two key metrics, the individual ecosystem service score and the total ecosystems service score, are derived at the river reach scale from source to mouth. Scoring is on a 0-3 scale with 0 representing an absent or virtually no ecosystem service value and 3 an optimal or maximum value. Output is best expressed in score per kilometre of river length. The exercise showed the tool to be applicable across two ecoregions and to rivers of varying size, level of human modification and character. While requiring further refinement, the approach shows that ecosystem service assessments based on virtual globes can be universally applied providing valuable information on riverscape ecosystem service delivery.

Segmentation of High Resolution Satellite Image Using S-Transform	RESEARCH JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL SCIENCES												The resolution of remote sensing images increases every day, raising the level of detail and the heterogeneity of the scenes. Most of the existing geographic information systems classification tools (Stock well Transform) have used the same methods for years. With these new high resolution images basic classification methods do not provide satisfactory results. A region-based classification method segmentation is based on and a classification. In this paper, we have proposed an approach for the segmentation of very high resolution (VHR) satellite images using S-Transforms. Satellite images have many applications in meteorology, agriculture, geology, forestry, landscape, biodiversity conservation, regional planning, education, intelligence and warfare. The segmentation uses an S-Transform to divide the image into several homogenous regions. Then follows the region-based classification performed either with the method MCL (Maximum Likelihood classifier). The method was validated and a comparison between pixel-based and region-based classification was performed. This method provides better results comparing to the existing remote sensing classification tools, even if some work should be done to prove its robustness. We also proved that the prior segmentation significantly improves the results of classification, both from the quantitative and qualitative points of view.																	0975-8585					MAY-JUN	2015	6	3					251	259										WOS:000413298700035						
J	Zhao, F; Keane, R; Zhu, ZL; Huang, CQ				Zhao, Feng; Keane, Robert; Zhu, Zhiliang; Huang, Chengquan			Comparing historical and current wildfire regimes in the Northern Rocky Mountains using a landscape succession model	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Wildland fire is a key ecosystem process that shapes the landscape of Western United States. Changes in fire regimes can therefore have profound impact on ecosystem functions and services, including carbon cycling, habitat conditions, and biodiversity. This study examined fire regime changes in the Northern Rocky Mountain region using a landscape succession model (LANDSUMv4). The objective is to report a new method to develop fire regime condition class (FRCC) maps by comparing historical reference conditions of fire regimes simulated using historical fire record and the LANDSUMv4 model - with current fire regimes developed using 27 years remote sensing fire product and LANDSUMv4. Results of this study indicate that most forest ecosystems in the study region experienced less frequent but more severe fires during the contemporary time period compared to the historical conditions. Fire regimes have changed the most for montane forests which historically were dominated by frequent and nonlethal fires. Forest ecosystems characterized by infrequent stand replacement fires also experienced moderate departure from historical fire conditions. FRCC assessment method proposed in this study can be applied to other areas of U.S. The findings of this study will help reveal contemporary fire dynamics in this region and serve for future fire and fuel studies and other forest management applications.

This study focused on quantifying and assessing changes of multiple ecosystem services in the Sanjiang Plain of China as a result of land cover changes over the period of 1992-2012. This region is important for its large area of natural wetlands and intensive agriculture. The ecosystem services that were assessed for this region included its regulating services (water yield and ecosystem carbon stocks), supporting services (suitable waterbird habitats), and provisioning services (food production), and the approach to the assessment was composed of the surface energy balance algorithms for land (SEBAL), soil survey re-sampling method and an empirical waterbird habitat suitability model. This large scale and integrated investigation represents the first systematic evaluation on the status of ecosystem carbon stocks in the Sanjiang Plain in addition to the development of an effective model for analysis of waterbird habitat suitability with the use of both remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS). More importantly, the result from this study has confirmed trade-offs between ecosystem services and negative consequences to environment in this region. The trade-offs were typically manifested by increased water yield and significantly grown food production, which is in contrast with significant losses in ecosystem carbon stocks (14%) and suitable waterbird habitats (23%) mainly due to the conversion of land cover from wetland to farmland. This finding implies that land use planning and policy making for this economically important region should take ecosystem service losses into account in order to preserve its natural ecosystems in the best interest of society.

Remote sensing of ecosystem services: A systematic review	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Appropriate integration of remote sensing technologies into ecosystem services concepts and practices leads to potential practical benefits for the protection of biodiversity and the promotion of sustainable use of Earth's natural assets. The last decade has seen the rapid development of research efforts on the topic of ecosystem services, which has led to a significant increase in the number of scientific publications. This systematic review aims to identify, evaluate and synthesise the evidence provided in published peer reviewed studies framing their work in the context of spatially explicit remote sensing assessment and valuation of ecosystem services. Initially, a search through indexed scientific databases found 5920 papers making direct and/or indirect reference to the topic of "ecosystem services" between the years of 1960 and 2013. Among these papers, 211 make direct reference to the use of remote sensing. During the search we aimed at selecting papers that were peer-reviewed publications available through indexed bibliographic databases. For this reason, our literature search did not include books, grey literature, extended abstracts and presentations. We quantitatively present the growth of remote sensing applications in ecosystem services' research, reviewing the literature to produce a summary of the state of available and feasible remote sensing variables used in the assessment and valuation of ecosystem services. The results provide valuable information on how remotely sensed Earth observation data are used currently to produce spatially-explicit assessments and valuation of ecosystem services. Using examples from the literature we produce a concise summary of what has been done, what can be done and what can be improved upon in the future to integrate remote sensing into ecosystem services research. The reason for doing so is to motivate discussion about methodological challenges, solutions and to encourage an uptake of remote sensing technology and data where it has potential practical applications.

Few ecological studies use remote sensing data to assess the biophysical or structural properties of vegetation to understand species distribution. To date, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have seldom been used for ecological applications. However, these sensors provide data allowing access to the inner structure of vegetation which is a key information in ecology. The objective of this article is to compare the predictive power of ecological habitat structure variables derived from a TerraSAR-X image, an aerial photograph and a SPOT-5 image for species distribution. The test was run with a hedgerow network in Brittany and assessed the spatial distribution of the forest ground carabid beetles which inhabit these hedgerows. The results confirmed that radar and optical images can be indifferently used to extract hedgerow network and derived landscape metrics (hedgerow density, network grain) useful to explain the spatial distribution of forest carabid beetles. In comparison with passive optical remotely sensed data, VHSR SAR images provide new data to characterize vegetation structure and more particularly hedgerow canopy cover, a variable known to explain the spatial distribution of carabid beetles in an agricultural landscape, but not yet quantified at a fine scale. The hedgerow canopy cover derived from the SAR image is a strong predictor of the abundance of forest carabid beetles at two scales i.e., a local scale and a landscape scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To reach this aim a high-level understanding of the distribution and conditions of these habitats is needed. Remote sensing can considerably contribute to habitat mapping and their observation over time. Several European projects and a large number of scientific studies have addressed the issue of mapping and monitoring natural habitats via remote sensing and the deriving of indicators on their conservation status. The multitude of utilized remote sensing sensors and applied methods used in these studies, however, impede a common understanding of what is achievable with current state-of-the-art technologies. The aim of this paper is to provide a synthesis on what is currently feasible in terms of detection and monitoring of natural and semi-natural habitats with remote sensing. To focus this endeavour, we concentrate on those studies aimed at direct mapping of individual habitat types or discriminating between different types of habitats occurring in relatively large, spatially contiguous units.

The EODHaM approach has adopted the Food and Agriculture Organization Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) taxonomy and translates mapped classes to General Habitat Categories (GHCs) from which Annex I habitats (EU Habitats Directive) can be defined. The EODHaM system uses a combination of pixel and object-based procedures. The 1st and 2nd stages use earth observation (EO) data alone with expert knowledge to generate classes according to the LCCS taxonomy (Levels 1 to 3 and beyond). The 3rd stage translates the final LCCS classes into GHCs from which Annex I habitat type maps are derived. An additional module quantifies changes in the LCCS classes and their components, indices derived from earth observation, object sizes and dimensions and the translated habitat maps (i.e., GHCs or Annex I). Examples are provided of the application of EODHaM system elements to protected sites and their surrounds in Italy, Wales (UK), the Netherlands, Greece, Portugal and India. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Synergy of airborne LiDAR and Worldview-2 satellite imagery for land cover and habitat mapping: A BIO_SOS-EODHaM case study for the Netherlands	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												A major challenge is to develop a biodiversity observation system that is cost effective and applicable in any geographic region. Measuring and reliable reporting of trends and changes in biodiversity requires amongst others detailed and accurate land cover and habitat maps in a standard and comparable way. The objective of this paper is to assess the EODHaM (EO Data for Habitat Mapping) classification results for a Dutch case study. The EODHaM system was developed within the BIO_SOS (The BIOdiversity multi-SOurce monitoring System: from Space TO Species) project and contains the decision rules for each land cover and habitat class based on spectral and height information. One of the main findings is that canopy height models, as derived from LiDAR, in combination with very high resolution satellite imagery provides a powerful input for the EODHaM system for the purpose of generic land cover and habitat mapping for any location across the globe. The assessment of the EODHaM classification results based on field data showed an overall accuracy of 74% for the land cover classes as described according to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) land Cover Classification System (LCCS) taxonomy at level 3, while the overall accuracy was lower (69.0%) for the habitat map based on the General Habitat Category (GHC) system for habitat surveillance and monitoring. A GHC habitat class is determined for each mapping unit on the basis of the composition of the individual life forms and height measurements. The classification showed very good results for forest phanerophytes (FPH) when individual life forms were analyzed in terms of their percentage coverage estimates per mapping unit from the LCCS classification and validated with field surveys. Analysis for shrubby chamaephytes (SCH) showed less accurate results, but might also be due to less accurate field estimates of percentage coverage. Overall, the EODHaM classification results encouraged us to derive the heights of all vegetated objects in the Netherlands from LiDAR data, in preparation for new habitat classifications.

EU member states have to undertake surveillance of habitats and species of community interest protected under the Habitat Directive. Remote sensing techniques have been applied successfully to monitor biodiversity aspects according to Natura 2000, but many challenges remain in assessing dynamics and habitat changes outside protected sites. Grasslands are among the most threatened habitats in Europe. In this paper we tested the integration of expert knowledge into different standard classification approaches to map grassland habitats in Schleswig Holstein, Germany. Knowledge about habitat features is represented as raster information layers, and used in subsequent grassland classifications. Overall classification accuracies were highest for the maximum likelihood and support vector machine approaches using RapidEye time series, but results improved for specific grassland classes when information layers were included in the classification process.

Very high resolution Earth observation features for monitoring plant and animal community structure across multiple spatial scales in protected areas	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Monitoring the status and future trends in biodiversity can be prohibitively expensive using ground-based surveys. Consequently, significant effort is being invested in the use of satellite remote sensing to represent aspects of the proximate mechanisms (e.g., resource availability) that can be related to biodiversity surrogates (BS) such as species community descriptors. We explored the potential of very high resolution (VHR) satellite Earth observation (EO) features as proxies for habitat structural attributes that influence spatial variation in habitat quality and biodiversity change. In a semi-natural grassland mosaic of conservation concern in southern Italy, we employed a hierarchical nested sampling strategy to collect field and VHR-EO data across three spatial extent levels (landscape, patch and plot). Species incidence and abundance data were collected at the plot level for plant, insect and bird functional groups. Spectral and textural VHR-EO image features were derived from a Worldview-2 image. Three window sizes (grains) were tested for analysis and computation of textural features, guided by the perception limits of different organisms. The modelled relationships between VHR-EO features and BS responses differed across scales, suggesting that landscape, patch and plot levels are respectively most appropriate when dealing with birds, plants and insects. This research demonstrates the potential of VHR-EO for biodiversity mapping and habitat modelling, and highlights the importance of identifying the appropriate scale of analysis for specific taxonomic groups of interest. Further, textural features are important in the modelling of functional group-specific indices which represent BS in high conservation value habitat types, and provide a more direct link to species interaction networks and ecosystem functioning, than provided by traditional taxonomic diversity indices.

In this work we use remote sensing-based biodiversity information and apply semantic formalisation and ontological inference to show improvements in data interoperability/comparability. The proposed methodology includes an observation-based, "bottom-up" engineering approach for remote sensing applications and gives a practical example of semantic mediation of geospatial products. We apply the methodology to three different nomenclatures used for remote sensing-based classification of two heathland nature conservation areas in Belgium and Germany. We analysed sensor nomenclatures with respect to their semantic formalisation and their bio-geographical differences. The results indicate that a hierarchical and transparent nomenclature is far more important for transferability than the sensor or study area. The inclusion of additional information, not necessarily belonging to a vegetation class description, is a key factor for the future success of using semantics for interoperability in remote sensing.

Only recently have widespread monitoring programs been implemented for salmon habitat in the Pacific Northwest. Remote sensing data, such as Landsat images, are therefore a useful way to evaluate trends prior to the advent of species-specific habitat monitoring programs. We used annual (1986-2008) land cover maps created from Landsat images via automated algorithms (LandTrendr) to evaluate trends in developed (50-100% impervious) land cover in areas adjacent to five types of habitat utilized by Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) in the Puget Sound region of Washington State, U.S.A. For the region as a whole, we found significant increases in developed land cover adjacent to each of the habitat types evaluated (nearshore, estuary, mainstem channel, tributary channel, and floodplain), but the increases were small (<1% total increase from 1986 to 2008). For each habitat type, the increasing trend changed during the time series. In nearshore, mainstem, and floodplain areas, the rate of increase in developed land cover slowed in the latter portion of the time series, while the opposite occurred in estuary and tributary areas. Watersheds that were already highly developed in 1986 tended to have higher rates of development than initially less developed watersheds. Overall, our results suggest that developed land cover in areas adjacent to Puget Sound salmon habitat has increased only slightly since 1986 and that the rate of change has slowed near some key habitat types, although this has occurred within the context of a degraded baseline condition.																	1932-6203					APR 29	2015	10	4							e0124415	10.1371/journal.pone.0124415								WOS:000353711600085	25923327

The results indicate that between 1986 and 2013, settlement/bare surface, mangrove forest/wetland and water body increased at 0.84% per year, 0.05% per year and 0.10% per year, respectively, while arable land/secondary vegetation and natural forest loss at 0.47% per year and 0.52% per year, respectively. This implies that intensity of change varies temporally. The implications of these changes include loss of valuable environmental goods and services, alteration of the food chain and increased impacts of climate change-related disasters. It is recommended that steps be taken to slow down the rate of land-use change in the study area to reduce its impact on the environment and social well-being.																	1010-6049	1752-0762				APR 21	2015	30	4					441	456		10.1080/10106049.2014.883435								WOS:000351063200005

To date, the knowledge of the differences in community parameters and their successional trends in degraded wetlands remains scarce. Here based on remote sensing images, geographic information system technology, and statistical methods, we produced a successional gradient map of the Yeyahu Wetland Nature Reserve in Beijing, which has experienced a steady decline in water level in recent decades. In addition, we analyzed community composition and diversity along with each identified gradient. The results showed that community diversity decreases while dominance increases with the progress of succession, with the highest diversity occurring during the early stage of succession. Moreover, the community demonstrates greater similarity among subareas during later successional stages, and the similarity coefficients calculated from the important value (IV) of each species are more accurate. Correlation analysis showed that the impact of soil factors on diversity was not significant at a subarea scale, although these nutrients showed an increasing trend with the community succession. Furthermore, the IVs of the dominant species had a particularly significant impact on diversity, showing a significantly negative correlation with diversity indices and a significantly positive correlation with dominance indices. Further analysis showed that the retreat of water level resulted from sustained drought and local human activities was a major extrinsic driving force resulting in observed differences in the community successional stages, which resulted in differences in community composition and diversity. On the other hand, interspecific competition was the main intrinsic mechanism, which significantly influenced the IVs of the dominant species and community diversity. The results of this study could aid in improving the understanding of community composition, diversity, and its successional trends in degraded wetlands.

Discriminating Native and Nonnative Grasses in the Dry Mixedgrass Prairie With MODIS NDVI Time Series	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												Separating native grasses from tame pastures is an important mapping exercise that assists in the assessment of biodiversity, delineation of species' habitat, and appraisal of rangeland health. However, native grasslands (primarily naturally occurring species) and tame pastures (primarily nonnative grasses planted for hay, pasture, or seed) are spectrally similar and therefore difficult to differentiate with traditional remote sensing techniques and with air-photo interpretation. We used seasonal profiles of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments to examine the separability of native grasslands and tame pastures (where both types employ the C3 photosynthetic pathway) in the Dry Mixedgrass natural subregion of Alberta, Canada. The two classes were found to have different rates of spring green up at the pixel level that allowed for separation with a simple linear discriminant function. We achieved an overall accuracy of 73% (n = 100 independent test cases) with the MODIS time series-a statistically significant improvement of the photo-interpretation-based Grassland Vegetation Inventory (52%): the current standard for vegetation information in Alberta's agricultural zone. We also found that the multitemporal method was able to select dates for single-date classifications that provided relatively high classification accuracies (up to 71% overall). In addition to achieving higher levels of overall accuracy than more conventional methods, the MODIS time series produced much more reliable identification of abandoned pastures: formerly planted rangelands that lack many of the visual cues used by photo interpreters.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				APR	2015	8	4					1395	1403		10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2416713								WOS:000358568900001

REMOTE SENSING												In managed landscapes, conservation planning requires effective methods to identify high-biodiversity areas. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of airborne laser scanning (ALS) and forest estimates derived from satellite images extracted at two spatial scales for predicting the stand-scale abundance and species richness of birds and beetles in a managed boreal forest landscape. Multiple regression models based on forest data from a 50-m radius (i.e., corresponding to a homogenous forest stand) had better explanatory power than those based on a 200-m radius (i.e., including also parts of adjacent stands). Bird abundance and species richness were best explained by the ALS variables "maximum vegetation height" and "vegetation cover between 0.5 and 3 m" (both positive). Flying beetle abundance and species richness, as well as epigaeic (i.e., ground-living) beetle richness were best explained by a model including the ALS variable "maximum vegetation height" (positive) and the satellite-derived variable "proportion of pine" (negative). Epigaeic beetle abundance was best explained by "maximum vegetation height" at 50 m (positive) and "stem volume" at 200 m (positive). Our results show that forest estimates derived from satellite images and ALS data provide complementary information for explaining forest biodiversity patterns. We conclude that these types of remote sensing data may provide an efficient tool for conservation planning in managed boreal landscapes.

Our goals were to increase conservation practitioners' use of remote sensing to support their work, increase collaboration between the conservation science and remote sensing communities, identify and develop new and innovative uses of remote sensing for advancing conservation science, provide guidance to space agencies on how future satellite missions can support conservation science, and generate support from the public and private sector in the use of remote sensing data to address the 10 conservation questions. We identified a broad initial list of questions on the basis of an email chain-referral survey. We then used a workshop-based iterative and collaborative approach to whittle the list down to these final questions (which represent 10 major themes in conservation): How can global Earth observation data be used to model species distributions and abundances? How can remote sensing improve the understanding of animal movements? How can remotely sensed ecosystem variables be used to understand, monitor, and predict ecosystem response and resilience to multiple stressors? How can remote sensing be used to monitor the effects of climate on ecosystems? How can near real-time ecosystem monitoring catalyze threat reduction, governance and regulation compliance, and resource management decisions? How can remote sensing inform configuration of protected area networks at spatial extents relevant to populations of target species and ecosystem services? How can remote sensing-derived products be used to value and monitor changes in ecosystem services? How can remote sensing be used to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of conservation efforts? How does the expansion and intensification of agriculture and aquaculture alter ecosystems and the services they provide? How can remote sensing be used to determine the degree to which ecosystems are being disturbed or degraded and the effects of these changes on species and ecosystem functions?

Various remote sensing studies observed a positive trend in vegetation greenness over the last decades which is known as the re-greening of the Sahel. However, little investment has been made in including long-term ground-based data collections to evaluate and better understand the biophysical mechanisms behind these findings. Thus, deductions on a possible increment in biomass remain speculative. Our aim is to bridge these gaps and give specifics on the biophysical background factors of the re-greening Sahel. Therefore, a trend analysis was applied on long time series (1987-2013) of satellite-based vegetation and rainfall data, as well as on ground-observations of leaf biomass of woody species, herb biomass, and woody species abundance in different ecosystems located in the Sahel zone of Senegal. We found that the positive trend observed in satellite vegetation time series (+36%) is caused by an increment of in situ measured biomass (+34%), which is highly controlled by precipitation (+40%). Whereas herb biomass shows large inter-annual fluctuations rather than a clear trend, leaf biomass of woody species has doubled within 27years (+103%). This increase in woody biomass did not reflect on biodiversity with 11 of 16 woody species declining in abundance over the period. We conclude that the observed greening in the Senegalese Sahel is primarily related to an increasing tree cover that caused satellite-driven vegetation indices to increase with rainfall reversal.

Remote sensing variables as predictors of habitat suitability of the viscacha rat (Octomys mimax), a rock-dwelling mammal living in a desert environment	MAMMAL RESEARCH												Identifying high-quality habitats across large areas is a central goal in biodiversity conservation. Remotely sensed data provide the opportunity to study different habitat characteristics (e.g., landscape topography, soil, vegetation cover, climatic factors) that are difficult to identify at high spatial and temporal resolution on the basis of field studies. Our goal was to evaluate the applicability of remotely sensed information as a potential tool for modeling habitat suitability of the viscacha rat (Octomys mimax), a rock-dwelling species that lives in a desert ecosystem. We fitted models considering raw indices (i.e., green indices, Brightness Index (BI) and temperature) and their derived texture measures on locations used by and available for the viscacha rat. The habitat preferences identified in our models are consistent with results of field studies of landscape use by the viscacha rat. Rocky habitats were well differentiated by the second-order contrast of BI, instead of BI only, making an important contribution to the global model by capturing the heterogeneity of the substratum. Furthermore, rocky habitats are able to maintain more vegetation than much of the surrounding desert; hence, their availability might be estimated using SATVI (Soil Adjusted Total Vegetation Index) and its derived texture measures: second-order contrast and entropy. This is the first study that evaluates the usefulness of remotely sensed data for predicting and mapping habitat suitability for a small-bodied rock dwelling species in a desert environment. Our results may contribute to conservation efforts focused on these habitat specialist species by using good predictors of habitat quality.																	2199-2401	2199-241X				APR	2015	60	2					117	126		10.1007/s13364-015-0215-3								WOS:000351153500004

Testing the relevance of binary, mosaic and continuous landscape conceptualisations to reptiles in regenerating dryland landscapes	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Context Fauna distributions are assessed using discrete (binary and mosaic) or continuous conceptualisations of the landscape. The value of the information derived from these analyses depends on the relevance of the landscape representation (or model) used to the landscape and fauna of interest. Discrete representations dominate analyses of landscape context in disturbed and regenerating landscapes; however within-patch variation suggests that continuous representations may help explain the distribution of fauna in such landscapes. Objectives Wetested the relevance of binary, mosaic, and continuous conceptualisations of landscape context to reptiles in regenerating dryland landscapes. Methods For each of thirteen reptile groups, we compared the fit of models consisting of one landscape composition and one landscape heterogeneity variable for each of six landscape representations (29 binary, 29 mosaic, and 29 continuous), at three buffer distances. We used Akaike weights to assess the relative support for each model. Maps were created from Landsat satellite images. Results Reptiles varied in their response to landscape context; however, the binary landscape representation with classes 'intact/disturbed' was best supported overall. Species richness was best described by a binary landscape representation with classes 'wooded/clear', whereas reptile abundance was best described by a mosaic landscape representation with classes defined by vegetation type. Five out of ten reptile species responded strongly to a single landscape representation, with the most relevant representation and conceptualisation varying among species. Conclusions Our findings support the use of multiple landscape conceptualisations and representations during analyses of landscape context for fauna in regenerating landscapes.

The Honghe National Nature Reserve is a biodiversity-rich area in the Jiansanjiang region of northeast China. In this study, the LUCC and landscape patterns were compared between the reserve and the Jiansanjiang region. With remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) procedures, satellite images from 1989, 2001 and 2010 were used to calculate dynamics of LUCC amplitudes, landscape pattern index, transition matrix. The influence of LUCC on the wetland landscape of the nature reserve was discussed in the context of broader LUCC analyses. The results showed that land uses in the studied regions changed remarkedly over the time period; swamp area declined significantly as arable land increased. The ecological landscape index showed that distinct landscape patches were small, scattered and highly fragmented, moving toward a more monotonous landscape. Anthropogenic activities such as farming directly decreased the wetland landscape diversity. Furthermore, anthropogenic factors diminished wetland areas indirectly through climatic factors, namely air temperature and precipitation levels. National and regional policies on agriculture and water use have been highly influential, and the Honghe National Nature Reserve is highly susceptible to land use changes in the surrounding Jiansanjiang region.

Despite many efforts on land use change in Qinghai, knowledge of the spatial variation of land use change is still lacking. This study examines the patterns of land use change across various watersheds, prefectures and the temple surroundings. Remote sensing images of 1987, 1997 and 2007 were analyzed to derive land use distributions; patterns and structures of the landscape were then quantified with landscape metrics. The results illustrated that the Yangtze River headwater region had more diverse and more evenly distributed landscape, while the Lantsang and the Yellow headwater regions showed a decline in landscape diversity. Comparison of the land use patterns of four prefectures revealed that Yushu Prefecture experienced an increase in landscape diversity from 1987 to 2007 while the land use patches in Guoluo Prefecture exhibited more aggregated patterns than other prefectures. Analysis of the spatial variations of land use change in the temple surroundings illustrated that 19.7% and 35.9% of the temples in Guoluo and Yushu Prefectures, respectively, encountered land use change for their immediate areas within 2 km. Comparison of the surroundings of temples and human settlements found that land use change was not evenly distributed, and that greater land use change had occurred for the surroundings of human settlements. Such findings provided insights into the spatial variation of land use change in the Three Rivers Headwaters Region.

To explore how mammals of extreme elevation respond to glacial recession and past harvest, we combined our fieldwork with remote sensing and used analyses of,60 expeditions from 1850-1925 to represent baseline conditions for wildlife before heavy exploitation on the Tibetan Plateau. Focusing on endangered wild yaks (Bos mutus), we document female changes in habitat use across time whereupon they increasingly relied on steeper post-glacial terrain, and currently have a 20x greater dependence on winter snow patches than males. Our twin findings-that the sexes of a cold-adapted species respond differently to modern climate forcing and long-past exploitation-indicate that effective conservation planning will require knowledge of the interplay between past and future if we will assure persistence of the region's biodiversity.																	2045-2322					MAR 2	2015	5								8676	10.1038/srep08676								WOS:000350300300021	25728642

There are, in particular, large areas within southern Africa savanna ecosystems that lack consistent geospatial data on vegetation morphological properties, which is a prerequisite for biodiversity conservation and sustainable management of ecological resources. Given the challenges involved in distinguishing and mapping savanna vegetation assemblages using remote sensing, the objective of this study was to develop a vegetation morphology map for the largest protected area in Africa, the central Kalahari. Six vegetation morphology classes were developed and sample training/validation pixels were selected for each class by analyzing extensive in situ data on vegetation structural and functional properties, in combination with existing ancillary data and coarse scale land cover products. The classification feature set consisted of annual and intra annual matrices derived from 14 years of satellite-derived vegetation indices images, and final classification was achieved using an ensemble tree based classifier. All vegetation morphology classes were mapped with high accuracy and the overall classification accuracy was 91.9%. Besides filling the geospatial data gap for the central Kalahari area, this vegetation morphology map is expected to serve as a critical input to ecological studies focusing on habitat use by wildlife and the efficacy of game fencing, as well as contributing to sustainable ecosystem management in the central Kalahari.																	2073-445X					MAR	2015	4	1					197	215		10.3390/land4010197								WOS:000365120300009

Remote Sensing and GIS Based Assessment of Land Degradation and Implications for Ghana's Ecological Zones	ENVIRONMENTAL PRACTICE												Land degradation and desertification have become complex environmental, social, and economic concerns in Ghana owing to decline in agricultural productivity, loss of biodiversity, and forced out-migration from degraded lands to cities in search of jobs or to rural forested communities for farming, resulting in further deforestation. In an attempt to address these complex land degradation and desertification problems, particularly in the northern areas of Ghana, land degradation was assessed in six major ecological zones of Sudan savanna, Guinea savanna, forest transition, moist semi-deciduous forest, evergreen forest, and coastal savanna. The objectives of the assessment were to: (a) analyze current satellite images to document land degradation, (b) model trends of land degradation, and (c) create a desertification hazard map for Ghana. Land degradation was modeled by using ArcGIS 9.3; satellite image analysis was conducted by using ERDAS Imagine software. Land degradation indicator data layers were soil, vegetation, climate, and land management data. The Modified Mediterranean Desertification and Land Use Model was adapted to model desertification and land degradation, which resulted in the production of a land degradation risk map for Ghana. In addition to the modeling, satellite image based land cover classification results from 2000 to 2008 showed evidence of approximately 880.006 sq km of land degradation in Ghana.																	1466-0466	1466-0474				MAR	2015	17	1					3	15		10.1017/S1466046614000465								WOS:000358375700002

Analysis of deforestation and protected area effectiveness in Indonesia: A comparison of Bayesian spatial models	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS												Tropical deforestation in Southeast Asia is one of the leading causes of carbon emissions and reductions of biodiversity. Spatially explicit analyses of the dynamics of deforestation in Indonesia are needed to support sustainable land use planning but the value of such analyses has so far been limited by data availability and geographical scope. We use remote sensing maps of land use change from 2000 to 2010 to compare Bayesian computational models: autologistic and von Thunen spatial-autoregressive models. We use the models to analyze deforestation patterns in Indonesia and the effectiveness of protected areas. Cross-validation indicated that models had an accuracy of 70-85%. We find that the spatial pattern of deforestation is explained by transport cost, agricultural rent and history of nearby illegal logging. The effectiveness of protected areas presented mixed results. After controlling for multiple confounders, protected areas of category la, exclusively managed for biodiversity conservation, were shown to be ineffective at slowing down deforestation. Our results suggest that monitoring and prevention of road construction within protected areas, using logging concessions as buffers of protected areas and geographical prioritization of control measures in illegal logging hotspots would be more effective for conservation than reliance on protected areas alone, especially under food price increasing scenarios.

To find sustainable land use options adapted to the local situation, a profound knowledge of the long-term spatiotemporal patterns of land cover change and its drivers is necessary, but hitherto lacking. The complex topography and the high cloud frequency make the use of remote sensing in this area a challenge. To deal with these conditions, we pursued specific pre-processing steps before classifying five Landsat scenes from 1975 to 2001. Then, we quantified land cover changes and habitat fragmentation, and we investigated landscape changes in relation to key spatial elements (altitude, slope, and distance from roads). Good classification results were obtained with overall accuracies ranging from 94.5% to 98.5% and Kappa statistics between 0.75 and 0.98. Forest was strongly fragmented due to the rapid expansion of the arable frontier and the even more rapid invasion by bracken. Unexpectedly, more bracken-infested areas were converted to pastures than vice versa, a practice that could alleviate pressure on forests if promoted. Road proximity was the most important spatial element determining forest loss, while for bracken the altitudinal range conditioned the degree of invasion in deforested areas. The annual deforestation rate changed notably between periods: ~1.5% from 1975 to 1987, ~0.8% from 1987 to 2000, and finally a very high rate of ~7.5% between 2000 and 2001. We explained these inconstant rates through some specific interrelated local and national political and socioeconomic drivers, namely land use policies, credit and tenure incentives, demography, and in particular, a severe national economic and bank crisis.

Knowledge of the spatial distribution of this diversity must be gained in order to aid in conservation management. Heterogeneous environmental conditions involve an important number of niches closely related to species richness. Remote sensing information derived from satellite hyperspectral and airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data can be used as proxies to generate a spatial prediction of vascular plant richness. This study aimed to estimate the spatial distribution of plant species richness using remote sensing in the Andes foothills of the Maule Region, Chile. This region has a secondary deciduous forest dominated by Nothofagus obliqua mixed with sclerophyll species. Floristic measurements were performed using a nested plot design with 60 plots of 225 m(2) each. Multiple predictors were evaluated: 30 topographical and vegetation structure indexes from LiDAR data, and 32 spectral indexes and band transformations from the EO1-Hyperion sensor. A random forest algorithm was used to identify relevant variables in richness prediction, and these variables were used in turn to obtain a final multiple linear regression predictive model (Adjusted R-2 = 0.651; RSE = 3.69). An independent validation survey was performed with significant results (Adjusted R-2 = 0.571, RMSE = 5.05). Selected variables were statistically significant: catchment slope, altitude, standard deviation of slope, average slope, Multiresolution Ridge Top Flatness index (MrRTF) and Digital Crown Height Model (DCM). The information provided by LiDAR delivered the best predictors, whereas hyperspectral data were discarded due to their low predictive power.

Global Trends in Exposure to Light Pollution in Natural Terrestrial Ecosystems	REMOTE SENSING												The rapid growth in electric light usage across the globe has led to increasing presence of artificial light in natural and semi-natural ecosystems at night. This occurs both due to direct illumination and skyglow - scattered light in the atmosphere. There is increasing concern about the effects of artificial light on biological processes, biodiversity and the functioning of ecosystems. We combine intercalibrated Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) images of stable night-time lights for the period 1992 to 2012 with a remotely sensed landcover product (GLC2000) to assess recent changes in exposure to artificial light at night in 43 global ecosystem types. We find that Mediterranean-climate ecosystems have experienced the greatest increases in exposure, followed by temperate ecosystems. Boreal, Arctic and montane systems experienced the lowest increases. In tropical and subtropical regions, the greatest increases are in mangroves and subtropical needleleaf and mixed forests, and in arid regions increases are mainly in forest and agricultural areas. The global ecosystems experiencing the greatest increase in exposure to artificial light are already localized and fragmented, and often of particular conservation importance due to high levels of diversity, endemism and rarity. Night time remote sensing can play a key role in identifying the extent to which natural ecosystems are exposed to light pollution.

Scott			Monitoring the Impact of Grazing on Rangeland Conservation Easements Using MODIS Vegetation Indices	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Monitoring the effects of grazing on rangelands is crucial for ensuring sustainable rangeland ecosystem function and maintaining its conservation values. Residual dry matter (RDM), the dry grass biomass left on the ground at the end of the grazing season, is a commonly used proxy for rangeland condition in Mediterranean climates. Moderate levels of RDM are correlated with soil stability, forage production, wildlife habitat, and diversity of native plants. Therefore RDM is widely monitored on rangeland conservation properties. Current ground-based methods for RDM monitoring are expensive, are labor intensive, and provide information in the fall, after the effects of grazing have already occurred. In this paper we present a cost-effective, rapid, and robust methodology to monitor and predict RDM using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data. We performed a time series analysis of three MODIS-based vegetation indices (VIs) measured over the period 2000-2012: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR). We examined the correlation between the four VIs and fall RDM measured at The Nature Conservancy's Simon Newman Ranch in central California. We found strong and significant correlations between maximum VI values in late spring and RDM in the fall. Among the VIs, LAI values had the most significant correlation with fall RDM. MODIS-based multivariate models predicted up to 63% of fall RDM. Importantly, maximum and sum VIs values were significantly higher in management units with RDM levels in compliance with RDM conservation easement terms compared with units out of compliance. On the basis of these results, we propose a management model that uses time series analysis of MODIS VIs to predict forage quantities, manage stocking rates, and monitor rangeland easement compliance. This model can be used to improve monitoring of rangeland conservation by providing information on range conditions throughout the year. (C) 2015 Society for Range Management.

Disappearing Arctic tundra ponds: Fine-scale analysis of surface hydrology in drained thaw lake basins over a 65year period (1948-2013)	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Long-term fine-scale dynamics of surface hydrology in Arctic tundra ponds (less than 1ha) are largely unknown; however, these small water bodies may contribute substantially to carbon fluxes, energy balance, and biodiversity in the Arctic system. Change in pond area and abundance across the upper Barrow Peninsula, Alaska, was assessed by comparing historic aerial imagery (1948) and modern submeter resolution satellite imagery (2002, 2008, and 2010). This was complemented by photogrammetric analysis of low-altitude kite-borne imagery in combination with field observations (2010-2013) of pond water and thaw depth transects in seven ponds of the International Biological Program historic research site. Over 2800 ponds in 22 drained thaw lake basins (DTLB) with different geological ages were analyzed. We observed a net decrease of 30.3% in area and 17.1% in number of ponds over the 62year period. The inclusion of field observations of pond areas in 1972 from a historic research site confirms the linear downward trend in area. Pond area and number were dependent on the age of DTLB; however, changes through time were independent of DTLB age, with potential long-term implications for the hypothesized geomorphologic landscape succession of the thaw lake cycle. These losses were coincident with increases in air temperature, active layer, and density and cover of aquatic emergent plants in ponds. Increased evaporation due to warmer and longer summers, permafrost degradation, and transpiration from encroaching aquatic emergent macrophytes are likely the factors contributing to the decline in surface area and number of ponds.																	2169-8953	2169-8961				MAR	2015	120	3					466	479		10.1002/2014JG002778								WOS:000353046200006

Satellite image duration of four decades, LandSat(1-5), and IRS-P6 data were used to develop land cover classification maps for 1971, 1987, 1998, and 2011. The number and size of land cover patches, the degree of naturalness, and the diversity indices were calculated and compared for a 40-year period. The results showed an increasing concern with regard to unplanned human activities. Some improvements of the natural landscape also occurred in the core protected zone of the study area. The number and size of land cover patches, the degree of naturalness, and the diversity indices were calculated. Overall changes in natural land use between 1971 and 1998 at MWR showed that the number of patches for natural land use has increased, but it also showed a decrease in 2011. Similar changes were observed for seminatural land use. Within the artificial classes, the number and area of patches were higher and the largest patch occurred in 2011. The maximum variation of diversity is related to the year 2011. The results showed an increasing concern with regard to unplanned human activities. Some improvements of the natural landscape also occurred in the core protected zone of the study area. Remote sensing and geographic information system offers an important means of detecting and analyzing temporal changes occurring in our landscape.

The aim of the PEN is to validate terrestrial ecological remote sensing, with a particular focus on seasonal changes (phenology) in vegetation. There are three types of core sensors at PEN sites: an Automatic Digital Fish-eye Camera, a HemiSpherical SpectroRadiometer, and a Sun Photometer. As of 2014, there are approximately 30 PEN sites, among which many are also FluxNet and/or International Long Term Ecological Research sites. The PEN is now part of a biodiversity observation framework. Collaborations between remote sensing scientists and ecologists working on PEN data have produced various outcomes about remote sensing and long-term in situ monitoring of ecosystem features, such as phenology, gross primary production, and leaf area index. This article reviews the design concept and the outcomes of the PEN, and discusses its future strategy.

However, biodiversity and ecosystem services are often inadequately accounted for in land use management decisions. We studied a boreal forest ecosystem by linking citizen-science bird data with detailed information on forest characteristics from airborne laser scanning (ALS). In this paper, we describe this method, and evaluate how similar kinds of biological data sets combined with remote sensing can be used for ecosystem assessments at landscape scale. We analysed data for 41 boreal forest bird species and for 14 structural ALS-based forest parameters. The results support the use of the selected method as a basis for quantifying spatially-explicit biodiversity indicators for ecosystem assessments, while suggestions for improvements are also reported. Finally, we evaluate the capacity of those indicators to describe biodiversity-ecosystem service relationships, for example with carbon trade-offs. The results showed clear distinctions between the different species as measured, for example, by above-ground forest biomass at the observation sites. We also assess how the available data sources can be developed to be compatible with the concept of essential biodiversity variables (EBV), which has been put forward as a solution to cover the most important aspects of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

Extrapolation of in situ data from 1-km squares to adjacent squares using remote sensed imagery and airborne lidar data for the assessment of habitat diversity and extent	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Habitat surveillance and subsequent monitoring at a national level is usually carried out by recording data from in situ sample sites located according to predefined strata. This paper describes the application of remote sensing to the extension of such field data recorded in 1-km squares to adjacent squares, in order to increase sample number without further field visits. Habitats were mapped in eight central squares in northeast Estonia in 2010 using a standardized recording procedure. Around one of the squares, a special study site was established which consisted of the central square and eight surrounding squares. A Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image was used for correlation with in situ data. An airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) vegetation height map was also included in the classification. A series of tests were carried out by including the lidar data and contrasting analytical techniques, which are described in detail in the paper. Training accuracy in the central square varied from 75 to 100 %. In the extrapolation procedure to the surrounding squares, accuracy varied from 53.1 to 63.1 %, which improved by 10 % with the inclusion of lidar data. The reasons for this relatively low classification accuracy were mainly inherent variability in the spectral signatures of habitats but also differences between the dates of imagery acquisition and field sampling. Improvements could therefore be made by better synchronization of the field survey and image acquisition as well as by dividing general habitat categories (GHCs) into units which are more likely to have similar spectral signatures. However, the increase in the number of sample kilometre squares compensates for the loss of accuracy in the measurements of individual squares. The methodology can be applied in other studies as the procedures used are readily available.

Development of a global inundation map at high spatial resolution from topographic downscaling of coarse-scale remote sensing data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Large-scale estimates of the area of terrestrial surface waters have greatly improved over time, in particular through the development of multi-satellite methodologies, but the generally coarse spatial resolution (tens of kms) of global observations is still inadequate for many ecological applications. The goal of this study is to introduce a new, globally applicable downscaling method and to demonstrate its applicability to derive fine resolution results from coarse global inundation estimates. The downscaling procedure predicts the location of surface water cover with an inundation probability map that was generated by bagged derision trees using globally available topographic and hydrographic information from the SRTM-derived HydroSHEDS database and trained on the wetland extent of the GLC2000 global land cover map. We applied the downscaling technique to the Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellites (GIEMS) dataset to produce a new high-resolution inundation map at a pixel size of 15 arc-seconds, termed GIEMS-D15. GIEMS-D15 represents three states of land surface inundation extents: mean annual minimum (total area, 6.5 x 10(6) km(2)), mean annual maximum (12.1 x 10(6) km(2)), and long-term maximum (173 x 10(6) km(2)); the latter depicts the largest surface water area of any global map to date. While the accuracy of GIEMS-D15 reflects distribution errors introduced by the downscaling process as well as errors from the original satellite estimates, overall accuracy is good yet spatially variable. A comparison against regional wetland cover maps generated by independent observations shows that the results adequately represent large floodplains and wetlands. GIEMS-D15 offers a higher resolution delineation of inundated areas than previously available for the assessment of global freshwater resources and the study of large floodplain and wetland ecosystems. The technique of applying inundation probabilities also allows for coupling with coarse-scale hydro-climatological model simulations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

Biodiversity is depleting very fast due to conversion of forest region into agricultural or other land use. Here comes the role of biodiversity assessment and evaluation of spatial data of species to prioritize the conservation purposes. Traditionally, ground-based plots were used to assess different biodiversity. Later on, remote sensing approaches were also incorporated along with field-based studies to quantify the results accurately. Assessment of biodiversity constitutes estimation of various indices that were obtained using ground-based plot or survey. With the advancement of the remote sensing technology, spatial information about tree species was collected using field sample and satellite data and field sample plots within the Sariska Tiger Reserve. Different diversity indices were calculated like alpha, beta, diversity, and others, i.e., Pilot's index (J), Shannon-Wiener index (SR), Margalef index (E-w), and Whittaker's index (H'). The multistage statistical techniques, which integrate high spatial resolution and spectral characteristics of satellite data (LISS IV), will help in providing precise information about tree species. Regression analysis provides better results to identify forest species among different bands. A positive correlation has been found in the infrared band even negative correlation has been found in other bands. This paper incorporates field-based surveys along with remote sensing technologies using a regression model (r(2) = 0.636) to estimate and recognize different species diversity in Sariska Tiger Reserve.

Towards a general framework for predicting threat status of data-deficient species from phylogenetic, spatial and environmental information	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												In taxon-wide assessments of threat status many species remain not included owing to lack of data. Here, we present a novel spatial-phylogenetic statistical framework that uses a small set of readily available or derivable characteristics, including phylogenetically imputed body mass and remotely sensed human encroachment, to provide initial baseline predictions of threat status for data-deficient species. Applied to assessed mammal species worldwide, the approach effectively identifies threatened species and predicts the geographical variation in threat. For the 483 data-deficient species, the models predict highly elevated threat, with 69% 'at-risk' species in this set, compared with 22% among assessed species. This results in 331 additional potentially threatened mammals, with elevated conservation importance in rodents, bats and shrews, and countries like Colombia, Sulawesi and the Philippines. These findings demonstrate the future potential for combining phylogenies and remotely sensed data with species distributions to identify species and regions of conservation concern.

In this study, we first tested whether life forms are discriminated through leaf level functional traits. We then explored the correlation between leaf-level plant functional traits and spectral reflectance. Location Serra do Cipo National Park, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Methods Six ecophysiological leaf traits were selected to best characterize differences between life forms in the woody plant community of the Cerrado. Results were compared to spectral vegetation indices to determine if plant groups provide means to separate leaf spectral responses. Results Values obtained from leaf traits were similar to results reported from other tropical dry sites. Trees and shrubs significantly differed from lianas in terms of the percentage of leaf water content and Specific Leaf Area. Spectral indices were insufficient to capture the differences of these key traits between groups, though indices were still adequately correlated to overall trait variation. Conclusion The importance of life forms as biochemical and structurally distinctive groups is a significant finding for future remote sensing studies of vegetation, especially in arid and semi-arid environments. The traits we found as indicative of these groups (SLA and water content) are good candidates for spectral characterization. Future studies need to use the full wavelength (400 nm-2500 nm) in order to capture the potential response of these traits. The ecological linkage to water balance and life strategies encourages these traits as starting points for modeling plant communities using hyperspectral remote sensing.

Without understanding the response of plague systems to anthropogenic or climate changes in their trophic web, it is unfeasible to effectively predict years with high risks of plague outbreak, hampering our ability for effective prevention and control of the disease. Here, by using surveillance data, we apply structural equation modelling to reveal the drivers of plague prevalence in two very different rodent systems: those of the solitary Daurian ground squirrel and the social Mongolian gerbil. We show that plague prevalence in the Daurian ground squirrel is not detectably related to its trophic web, and that therefore surveillance efforts should focus on detecting plague directly in this ecosystem. On the other hand, plague in the Mongolian gerbil is strongly embedded in a complex, yet understandable trophic web of climate, vegetation, and rodent and flea densities, making the ecosystem suitable for more sophisticated low-cost surveillance practices, such as remote sensing. As for the trophic webs of the two rodent species, we find that increased vegetation is positively associated with higher temperatures and precipitation for both ecosystems. We furthermore find a positive association between vegetation and ground squirrel density, yet a negative association between vegetation and gerbil density. Our study thus shows how past surveillance records can be used to design and improve existing plague prevention and control measures, by tailoring them to individual plague foci. Such measures are indeed highly needed under present conditions with prevailing climate change.

We proposed the first biophysical environmental delineation of the SBS using globally available satellite remote sensing and model-assimilated data to categorize this area into unique and meaningful biophysical classes. Specifically, the SBS was partitioned into eight biophysical classes characterized by similar sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, currents, and salinity patterns. Areas within each class were expected to have similar habitat types and ecosystem functions. Our work supplemented prevailing global marine management schemes by focusing in on a regional scale with finer spatial resolution. It also provided a baseline for academic research, ecological assessments and will facilitate marine spatial planning and conservation activities in the area. In addition, the framework and methods of delineating biophysical environments we presented can be expanded throughout the whole Coral Triangle to support research and conservation activities in this important region.

Free and open-access satellite data are key to biodiversity conservation	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Satellite remote sensing is an important tool for monitoring the status of biodiversity and associated environmental parameters, including certain elements of habitats. However, satellite data are currently underused within the biodiversity research and conservation communities. Three factors have significant impact on the utility of remote sensing data for tracking and understanding biodiversity change. They are its continuity, affordability, and access. Data continuity relates to the maintenance of long-term satellite data products. Such products promote knowledge of how biodiversity has changed over time and why. Data affordability arises from the cost of the imagery. New data policies promoting free and open access to government satellite imagery are expanding the use of certain imagery but the number of free and open data sets remains too limited. Data access addresses the ability of conservation biologists and biodiversity researchers to discover, retrieve, manipulate, and extract value from satellite imagery as well as link it with other types of information. Tools are rapidly improving access. Still, more cross-community interactions are necessary to strengthen ties between the biodiversity and remote sensing communities.

J	Willis, KS				Willis, Katherine S.			Remote sensing change detection for ecological monitoring in United States protected areas	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Remote sensing allows for cost- and time-efficient monitoring of landscapes vital to the conservation of natural resources, ecosystems, and biodiversity. This review synthesizes and recommends best practice change detection methods for land management groups to monitor chief ecological change indicators currently monitored in United States protected areas. The indicators frequently monitored via change detection and reviewed here include: land use/land cover, disturbance, and phenology. Landsat data products are recommended for monitoring land use/land cover and disturbance, due to their continuous data accessibility free of cost since 1972. Data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) are recommended for monitoring changes in phenology due to its 1-2 day return, interval at any given location. Best-practice remote sensing methods are stressed, such as careful validation of results, either by combination of remotely sensed datasets with high resolution imagery or in situ data, in order to increase accuracy and to better align the remotely sensed data to the scale of the on-the-ground processes. Reported results should always be presented with utmost clarity in a manner that is both applicable to managers and understood by the general public. Increased collaborations between ecologists, land managers, conservation groups, and scientists are compulsory for successful integration of remote sensing-based monitoting, which is vital for effective conservation in protected areas. Remote sensing change detection quantifies the effects of humans on a landscape scale without creating further disturbances to ecologically sensitive areas; the results of which can be used for efficient conservation management into the future.

However, aquatic and terrestrial ecologists have mainly studied these ecosystems separately, a "splendid isolation" historically fostered by disciplinary boundaries between institutes and funding schemes. Here, we synthesize the progress made in joint aquatic and terrestrial research and suggest new approaches to meeting future research challenges in changing environments. Aquatic and terrestrial organisms use cross-system subsidies to a comparable extent and addressing reciprocal subsidies is therefore necessary in order to understand biodiversity and functioning of both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. We suggest that the metaecosystem framework could be expanded to explicitly consider cross-system fluxes of matter differing in magnitude and quality. We further advocate the inclusion of cross-system analyses at broader spatial extents, for which remote-sensing applications would be a useful tool in environmental research at the land-water interface. A cross-ecosystem approach would therefore be valuable for a more thorough understanding of ecosystem responses to various stressors in the face of rapid environmental change.

Transition from heathland to scrub in south-eastern Tasmania: extent of change since the 1970s, floristic depletion and management implications	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Heathland is a speciose and floriferous vegetation type, defined by its stature (< 2 m) and dominance by scleromorphic shrubs. Heathland has been in decline globally, and much of its loss has been due to less frequent fire, while in some places more frequent fire has resulted in degradation through the loss of obligate seeding species. The aims of the present study were to determine: (1) the extent of the transition from heathland to scrub in south-eastern Tasmania, Australia between c1976 and 2013; (2) the spatial attributes of heathland that are likely to have been the most instrumental in heathland loss; (3) whether the transition to scrub resulted in the loss of local species richness and changed species composition when taking both above ground vegetation and the soil seed bank into account; and (4) the implications of the answers to the first three questions for heathland management. Changes in heathland and scrub extent were mapped from remote sensing imagery and ground truthing. At one locality with floristic data from the heathland of 1976, the scrub that has replaced the heathland was surveyed and soil collected to determine seed banks under heating and non-heating treatments. Approximately one third of the 1976 heathland had become scrub by 2013, mostly around the margins of heathland patches and near built up areas. Twenty-two species present in 1976 were not found in either the scrub or seed bank, with only three species absent from the scrub, but present in the 1976 heath, being found in the seed bank. The species composition of germinates in the unheated treatment was dominated by taxa that colonise mechanically disturbed areas, such as Juncus, while germinates in the heat treated soils were largely scleromorphic heath species. The depletion of species richness by the transition to scrub, and the large extent of its incidence, suggest that a higher frequency of planned fire is needed in south-eastern Tasmania.				iDiv, Deutsches Zentrum/B-5164-2016													0960-3115	1572-9710				FEB	2015	24	2					213	228		10.1007/s10531-014-0803-6								WOS:000348114700001

Impact of land use and land cover dynamics on Zhalong wetland reserve ecosystem, Heilongjiang Province, China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												In view of the significant hydrological and ecological role of wetlands, an analysis was made on the impact of land use and land cover dynamics on the spatial status of Zhalong wetland, a Ramsar site located downstream of Wuyuer River Basin in Northeast China. The impact assessment analyzed multi-temporal changes in the upstream land use/land cover characteristics of the wetland watershed using remote sensing data of Landsat MSS/TM. The multi-temporal land use/land cover statistics revealed that significant changes have taken place in the Wuyuer River Basin. In response to these upstream land use/cover changes, the marsh landscape in Zhalong wetland has showed changes in spatial extension, landscape pattern, and water quality characteristics. The major impacts have resulted from construction of a reservoir and water diversion engineering that has altered the wetland hydrological conditions and reduced the spatial distribution of the marsh landscape. In addition, inputs of agricultural nutrients, and industrial and human wastes from the upper catchments have resulted in increased signs of eutrophication. This study suggests that effective wetland hydrological restoration measures are needed to avoid further deterioration of this internationally important ecosystem.																	1735-1472	1735-2630				FEB	2015	12	2					445	454		10.1007/s13762-013-0398-6								WOS:000347681800003

Possessing vast amounts of coal deposits, the Waterberg region of the Limpopo Province is set to undergo rapid transformation as new power stations and coal mines are built, expected to exacerbate water shortages. Detailed baseline information to assess future impacts on key plant species is lacking compromising biodiversity conservation efforts in a region where eco - tourism is a major source of livelihood. In this study we evaluated the spatio - temporal distribution plant status during wet and dry seasons using two measures of plant stress namely the midday leaf water potential (LWP), and leaf nitrogen (N) concentrations. At leaf level, spectral indices such as the moisture stress index (MSI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and the water index (WI) predicted more than 70% of LWP variation using leaf reflectance data. At landscape level, red edge based simple ratio indices were selected for mapping leaf water potential and leaf N for wet and dry season using RapidEye data. We conclude that remote sensing images can be applied for the long term vegetation monitoring for future biodiversity conservation efforts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, existing operational approaches are limited to the monitoring of European dry heaths only. They need to be extended to further habitats. Thus far, reported studies lack the exploitation of intra-annual time series of high spatial resolution data to take advantage of the vegetations' phenological differences. In this study, we investigated the usefulness of such data to classify grassland habitats in a nature reserve area in northeastern Germany. Intra-annual time series of 21 observations were used, acquired by a multi-spectral (RapidEye) and a synthetic aperture radar (TerraSAR-X) satellite system, to differentiate seven grassland classes using a Support Vector Machine classifier. The classification accuracy was evaluated and compared with respect to the sensor type - multi-spectral or radar - and the number of acquisitions needed. Our results showed that very dense time series allowed for very high accuracy classifications (>90%) of small scale vegetation types. The classification for TerraSAR-X obtained similar accuracy as compared to RapidEye although distinctly more acquisitions were needed. This study introduces a new approach to enable the monitoring of small-scale grassland habitats and gives an estimate of the amount of data required for operational surveys. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Oceanic loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta associate with thermal fronts: evidence from the Canary Current Large Marine Ecosystem	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Oceanographic fronts are physical interfaces between water masses that differ in properties such as temperature, salinity, turbidity and chlorophyll a enrichment. Bio-physical coupling along fronts can lead to the development of pelagic biodiversity hotspots. A diverse range of marine vertebrates have been shown to associate with fronts, using them as foraging and migration habitats. Elucidation of the ecological significance of fronts generates a better understanding of marine ecosystem functioning, conferring opportunities to improve management of anthropogenic activities in the oceans. This study presents novel insights into the oceanographic drivers of habitat use in a population of marine turtles characterised by an oceanic-neritic foraging dichotomy. Using satellite tracking data from adult female loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta nesting at Cape Verde (n = 12), we tested the hypothesis that oceanic-foraging loggerheads associate with mesocale (10s to 100s of km) thermal fronts. We used high-resolution (1 km) composite front mapping to characterise frontal activity in the Canary Current Large Marine Ecosystem over 2 temporal scales: (1) seasonal front frequency and (2) 7 d front metrics. Our use-availability analysis indicated that oceanic loggerheads show a preference for the highly productive upwelling region between Cape Verde and mainland Africa, an area of intense frontal activity. Within the upwelling region, turtles appear to forage epipelagically around mesoscale thermal fronts, exploiting profitable foraging opportunities resulting from physical aggregation of prey.

J	Garg, JK				Garg, J. K.			Wetland assessment, monitoring and management in India using geospatial techniques	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Satellite remote sensing and GIS have emerged as the most powerful tools for inventorying, monitoring and management of natural resources and environment. In the special context of wetland ecosystems, remotely sensed data from orbital platforms have been extensively used in India for the inventory, monitoring and preparation of action plans for conservation and management. First scientific inventory of wetlands in India was carried out in 1998 by Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad using indigenous IRS (Indian Remote Sensing Satellite) data of 1992-93 timeframe, which stimulated extensive use of geospatial techniques for wetland conservation and management. Subsequently, with advances in GIS, studies were carried out for development of Wetland Information System for a state (West Bengal) and for Loktak lake wetland (a Ramsar site) as a prelude to National Wetland Information System. Research has also been carried out for preparation of action plans especially for Ramsar sites in the country. In a novel research, use of the geospatial technology has also been demonstrated for biodiversity conservation using landscape ecological metrics. A country-wide estimate of emission of methane, a Green House Gas, from wetlands has also been made using MODIS data. Present article critically reviews the work carried out in India for wetland conservation and management using geospatial techniques. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ANNUAL FOREST MONITORING AS PART OF THE INDONESIA'S NATIONAL CARBON ACCOUNTING SYSTEM	36TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				36th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment	MAY 11-15, 2015	Berlin, GERMANY					Land use and forest change, in particular deforestation, have contributed the largest proportion of Indonesia's estimated greenhouse gas emissions. Indonesia's remaining forests store globally significant carbon stocks, as well as biodiversity values. In 2010, the Government of Indonesia entered into a REDD+ partnership. A spatially detailed monitoring and reporting system for forest change which is national and operating in Indonesia is required for participation in such programs, as well as for national policy reasons including Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV), carbon accounting, and land-use and policy information. Indonesia's National Carbon Accounting System (INCAS) has been designed to meet national and international policy requirements. The INCAS remote sensing program is producing spatially-detailed annual wall-to-wall monitoring of forest cover changes from time-series Landsat imagery for the whole of Indonesia from 2000 to the present day. Work on the program commenced in 2009, under the Indonesia-Australia Forest Carbon Partnership. A principal objective was to build an operational system in Indonesia through transfer of knowledge and experience, from Australia's National Carbon Accounting System, and adaptation of this experience to Indonesia's requirements and conditions. A semi-automated system of image pre-processing (ortho-rectification, calibration, cloud masking and mosaicing) and forest extent and change mapping (supervised classification of a 'base' year, semi-automated single-year classifications and classification within a multi-temporal probabilistic framework) was developed for Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+. Particular attention is paid to the accuracy of each step in the processing. With the advent of Landsat 8 data and parallel development of processing capability, capacity and international collaborations within the LAPAN Data Centre this processing is being increasingly automated. Research is continuing into improved processing methodology and integration of information from other data sources. This paper presents technical elements of the INCAS remote sensing program and some results of the 2000 - 2012 mapping.																	2194-9034						2015	47	W3					441	448		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-7-W3-441-2015								WOS:000380531900064

GLOBIL: WWF'S GLOBAL OBSERVATION AND BIODIVERSITY INFORMATION PORTAL	36TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				36th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment	MAY 11-15, 2015	Berlin, GERMANY					Despite ever increasing availability of satellite imagery and spatial data, conservation managers, decision makers and planners are often unable to analyze data without special knowledge or software. WWF is bridging this gap by putting extensive spatial data into an easy to use online mapping environment, to allow visualization, manipulation and analysis of large data sets by any user. Consistent, reliable and repeatable ecosystem monitoring information for priority eco-regions is needed to increase transparency in WWF's global conservation work, to measure conservation impact, and to provide communications with the general public and organization members. Currently, much of this monitoring and evaluation data is isolated, incompatible, or inaccessible and not readily usable or available for those without specialized software or knowledge. Launched in 2013 by WWF Netherlands and WWF Germany, the Global Observation and Biodiversity Information Portal (GLOBIL) is WWF's new platform to unite, centralize, standardize and visualize geo-spatial data and information from more than 150 active GIS users worldwide via cloud-based ArcGIS Online. GLOBIL is increasing transparency, providing baseline data for monitoring and evaluation while communicating impacts and conservation successes to the public. GLOBIL is currently being used in the worldwide marine campaign as an advocacy tool for establishing more marine protected areas, and a monitoring interface to track the progress towards ocean protection goals. In the Kavango-Zambezi (KAZA) Transfrontier Conservation area, local partners are using the platform to monitor land cover changes, barriers to species migrations, potential human-wildlife conflict and local conservation impacts in vast wildlife corridor. In East Africa, an early warning system is providing conservation practitioners with real-time alerts of threats particularly to protected areas and World Heritage Sites by industrial extractive activities. And for globally consistent baseline ecosystem monitoring, MODIS-derived data are being combined with local information to provide visible advocacy for conservation. As GLOBIL is built up through the WWF network, the worldwide organization is able to provide open access to its data on biodiversity and remote sensing, spatial analysis and projects to support goal setting, monitoring and evaluation, and fundraising activities.																	2194-9034						2015	47	W3					511	514		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-7-W3-511-2015								WOS:000380531900074

NEW METHODS IN ACQUISITION, UPDATE AND DISSEMINATION OF NATURE CONSERVATION GEODATA - IMPLEMENTATION OF AN INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK	36TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				36th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment	MAY 11-15, 2015	Berlin, GERMANY					Within the framework of this project methods are being tested and implemented a) to introduce remote sensing based approaches into the existing process of biotope mapping and b) to develop a framework serving the multiple requirements arising from different users' backgrounds and thus the need for comprehensive data interoperability. Therefore state-wide high resolution land cover vector-data have been generated in an automated object oriented workflow based on aerial imagery and a normalised digital surface models. These data have been enriched by an extensive characterisation of the individual objects by e.g. site specific, contextual or spectral parameters utilising multitemporal satellite images, DEM-derivatives and multiple relevant geo-data. Parameters are tested on relevance in regard to the classification process using different data mining approaches and have been used to formalise categories of the European nature information system (EUNIS) in a semantic framework. The Classification will be realised by ontology-based reasoning. Dissemination and storage of data is developed fully INSPIRE-compatible and facilitated via a web portal. Main objectives of the project are a) maximum exploitation of existing "standard" data provided by state authorities, b) combination of these data with satellite imagery (Copernicus), c) create land cover objects and achieve data interoperability through low number of classes but comprehensive characterisation and d) implement algorithms and methods suitable for automated processing on large scales.																	2194-9034						2015	47	W3					707	712		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-7-W3-707-2015								WOS:000380531900105

MULTI-SCALE MONITORING OF LANDSCAPE CHANGE AFTER THE 2011 TSUNAMI	36TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				36th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment	MAY 11-15, 2015	Berlin, GERMANY					The Great East Japan Earthquake (magnitude 9.0; occurred on 11th March 2011) and subsequent huge tsunami caused widespread damage along the Pacific Ocean coast of eastern Honshu, Japan. This research utilizes multi-resolution remote sensing images to clarify the impact on landscapes caused by this disaster, and also to monitor the subsequent survival and recovery process in the Sendai Bay region. The coastal landscape in the target area features a narrow strip of coastal sand barrier, historically stabilized by planted pine groves; backed by a low-lying plain that has traditionally been diked and converted to irrigated rice paddies. Farmsteads on the flat alluvial plain are surrounded by groves called "Igune", consisting primarily of conifers. MODIS data (250 m resolution) were employed to map the overall extent of inundation and damage on the regional landscape scale. The major damage caused by the tsunami, destruction of coastal pine forests and inundation or rice paddies on the plain, was identified at this level. Progressively finer scale analysis were then implemented using SPOT/HRG-2 (10 m resolution) data; GeoEye-1 fine resolution data (0.5 m) and very fine resolution aerial photographs (10 cm) and LiDAR. These results demonstrated the minute details of the damage and recovery process. Some patches of pine forest, for example, were seen to have survived, and some coastal plant communities were already recovering only a year after the disaster. Continuous monitoring using field work and remote sensing is required for balanced regional strategies that provide for economic and social recovery and as well as restoration of vegetation, biodiversity and vital ecosystem services.																	2194-9034						2015	47	W3					805	809		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-7-W3-805-2015								WOS:000380531900119

BENTHIC HABITAT MAPPING AND BIODIVERSITY ANALYSIS IN THE PRIMEIRAS AND SEGUNDAS ARCHIPELAGO RESERVE	36TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				36th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment	MAY 11-15, 2015	Berlin, GERMANY					The Primeiras and Segundas Archipelago Reserve is a recently established marine protected area, the largest in Africa, located in the waters of Northern Mozambique. This protected area is of significant local economic importance and global ecological relevance, containing the southernmost coral reefs in Eastern Africa. However, information related to the marine ecosystem, notably benthic habitat is very scarce. Twelve atolls were mapped in the region using object-based image classification of very-high resolution satellite imagery (IKONOS, Quickbird, and WorldView-2). Geographically referenced data on benthic cover and depth were gathered in the course of three fieldwork expeditions covering a total of four atolls and two shallow reef structures in the Segundas Archipelago. The resulting map allows the estimation of three distinct types of coral cover (field, patches, spurs and grooves); the differentiation of sand, rubble and rock substrate; and the detection of seagrass and brown macroalgae, identifying up to 24 benthic habitats. Average overall accuracy was above 50%. The high variability of the optical properties on the reef systems, in large due to the connectivity with the mainland via plumes, while interesting from an ecological perspective increases the challenges for remote sensing of bottom cover. New information indicates the presence of deep benthic cover extending from the atolls, suggesting the need for further research on Coastal Eastern African corals, namely on their resilience and connectivity, and supporting current knowledge of the existence of an almost continuous coral reef from Kenya to Mozambique. Coral and fish biodiversity data have been analysed together with the satellite-derived maps. Results support the local perception that ecosystems are in decline and uncover new information about biodiversity's spatial patterns. Our work provides a detailed depiction of marine habitats that may aid the management of the protected area, namely in the definition of fishing zones and coral cover monitoring.																	2194-9034						2015	47	W3					1009	1016		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-7-W3-1009-2015								WOS:000380531900150

MAPPING LAND COVER IN THE TAITA HILLS, SE KENYA, USING AIRBORNE LASER SCANNING AND IMAGING SPECTROSCOPY DATA FUSION	36TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				36th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment	MAY 11-15, 2015	Berlin, GERMANY					The Taita Hills, located in south-eastern Kenya, is one of the world's biodiversity hotspots. Despite the recognized ecological importance of this region, the landscape has been heavily fragmented due to hundreds of years of human activity. Most of the natural vegetation has been converted for agroforestry, croplands and exotic forest plantations, resulting in a very heterogeneous landscape. Given this complex agro-ecological context, characterizing land cover using traditional remote sensing methods is extremely challenging. The objective of this study was to map land cover in a selected area of the Taita Hills using data fusion of airborne laser scanning (ALS) and imaging spectroscopy (IS) data. Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) was used to derive land cover nomenclature, while the height and percentage cover classifiers were used to create objective definitions for the classes. Simultaneous ALS and IS data were acquired over a 10 km x 10 km area in February 2013 of which 1 km x 8 km test site was selected. The ALS data had mean pulse density of 9.6 pulses/m(2), while the IS data had spatial resolution of 1 m and spectral resolution of 4.5-5 nm in the 400-1000 nm spectral range. Both IS and ALS data were geometrically co-registered and IS data processed to at-surface reflectance. While IS data is suitable for determining land cover types based on their spectral properties, the advantage of ALS data is the derivation of vegetation structural parameters, such as tree height and crown cover, which are crucial in the LCCS nomenclature. Geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) was used for segmentation and classification at two scales. The benefits of GEOBIA and ALS/IS data fusion for characterizing heterogeneous landscape were assessed, and ALS and IS data were considered complementary. GEOBIA was found useful in implementing the LCCS based classification, which would be difficult to map using pixel-based methods.

HYDROLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE USUMACINTA RIVER BASIN TOWARDS THE PRESERVATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES	36TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				36th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment	MAY 11-15, 2015	Berlin, GERMANY					The Usumacinta basin is characterized by aboundance of natural and scenic resources. It also houses a vast biodiversity ( wich also means invaluable genetic resources). Its river is the longest in Mexico ( main channel length of 927 km). Therefore it is one of the most productive regions of the country in terms of ecosystem services ( such as habitat for biodiversity, maintenance of wetlands, water flows generation, carbon sequestration, soil retention, etc.) that are directly related to the hydrological functioning. During the last centuries, human activities on the Usumacinta basin have drastically changed its geomorphology and vegetation cover. As a result the hydrological cycle has been greatly modified. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct studies in order to support planning activities and implementation of public policies, as well as, to generate a permanent scientific ecosystem monitoring system. This paper presents the results of a study focused on estimating the water balance of this frontier basin. Satellite and field data is used. Variables as vegetation cover ( generated by classification of Landsat and MODIS), digital terrain model ( SRTM), surface temperature ( MODIS), potential evaporation, precipitation and runoff measurements were processed. Various techniques of Remote Sensing, geospatial models ( as SSEB and the model for definition of surface hydrological connectivity) and spatial analysis ( geostatistics and map algebra) were implemented. The results were integrated into the environment of a Geographic Information System. These are estimates of actual evapotranspiration, soil moisture and runoff, among other biophysical parameters. For the lower part of the basin a balance was performed to estimate inputs of water from runoff and precipitation to the large amount of wetlands in the area. Additionally, areas generating runoff and areas in which most of the precipitaion infiltrates were also mapped. The geo-information obtained is requiered for purposes of planning and land management.

Recently, remote sensing techniques have been successfully applied in marine benthic mapping in coastal waters. However, the majority of these techniques have focused on either seagrasses meadows or coral reefs. There are a few studies that have been published validating a methodology for mapping SAV on brown macroalgae (Sargassum spp., Ecklonia spp.), seagrasses, and/or other macroalgae groups by spectral response from remote sensing. Hence, we studied the in-situ optical properties of living macroalgae, seagrasses, and rubble. The spectral characteristics of varied SAV groups were measured using the high resolution FieldSpec (R) 4 Hi-Res portable spectroradiometer. The study site selected was the Shoalwater Islands Marine Park, Rockingham, Western Australia as it is one of the fifteen biodiversity hotspots in Australia. Correlation and Principle Component Analysis were employed to evaluate the differences between SAV groups. The results have documented the spectral features of SAV and their associated habitats in Shoalwater Islands Marine Park, Western Australia, and developed a spectral library to distinguish among seagrass species and algae groups (green, red, and brown benthic macroalgae). The implications of this study will contribute to estimate and detect the distribution and seasonal variation of SAV on a broader scale.																	0197-7385		978-0-933957-43-5				2015																		WOS:000380550000227

Advances in Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technologies have enabled remote sensing-based studies of vegetation canopies by capturing three-dimensional structures, yielding information not available in two-dimensional images of the landscape provided by traditional multi-spectral remote sensing platforms. However, the large volume data sets produced by airborne LiDAR instruments pose a significant computational challenge, requiring algorithms to identify and analyze patterns of interest buried within LiDAR point clouds in a computationally efficient manner, utilizing state-of-art computing infrastructure. We developed and applied a computationally efficient approach to analyze a large volume of LiDAR data and characterized the vegetation canopy structures for 139,859 hectares (540 sq. miles) in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. This study helps improve our understanding of the distribution of vegetation and animal habitats in this extremely diverse ecosystem.

Global meat consumption trends and local deforestation in Madre de Dios: assessing land use changes and other environmental impacts	DEFINING THE FUTURE OF SUSTAINABILITY AND RESILIENCE IN DESIGN, ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION	Procedia Engineering				Defining the Future of Sustainability and Resilience in Design, Engineering and Construction	MAY 10-13, 2015	Chicago, CA	ASCE, ICSDEC				Meat consumption is becoming one of the most relevant sectors in terms of environmental impacts globally. In the Brazilian Amazon the effects of this process are seen in the ongoing deforestation and land-use change (about 65% of deforestation can be linked to cattle ranching). One of the main causes of this trend is the increased efficiency of the transport infrastructure: along both sides of the Brazilian Inter-Oceanic highway, about 50km of rainforest have been converted to cattle ranching. In 2011 the Inter-Oceanic highway was finalized also on the Peruvian side: the region of Madre de Dios is neighboring the Brazilian Amazon, therefore the risk is that this area will undergo the same kind of development. The objective of this analysis is to highlight the contribution of global meat demand trend as cause of land use change and deforestation in the Madre de Dios region. This focus has been chosen since, nowadays, the magnitude of cattle ranching activities is hidden by more evident and damaging activities (e.g., gold mining), and its near-future effects risk to be underestimated. By starting with investigating the preliminary signals of cattle ranching contribution to the local deforestation process, this analysis will serve as basis for more comprehensive future works on local data, including monitoring campaigns of local biodiversity and GHG emissions. Land-use change is, thus, analyzed through FAO data and also through data acquired with remote sensing carried out within other projects. Meat consumption and production outcomes are obtained from the FAOSTAT database. By integrating trends in the regional meat consumption with the emerging trading effects, which are incremented by the new highway, it is possible to highlight the risk that the global convergence in meat consumption trends can locally influence the deforestation in Madre de Dios.

J	Rioja-Nieto, R; Moreno-Ruiz, JA; Gomez-Valdes, J				Rioja-Nieto, Rodolfo; Antonio Moreno-Ruiz, Juan; Gomez-Valdes, Jose			Effect of the management of a Natural Protected Area in the landscape of the mangrove forest in the Yucatan Peninsula	HIDROBIOLOGICA												Natural Protected Areas (NPAs) are one of the main conservation tools used to maintain biodiversity. Due to the limitations on the anthropogenic activities that are generally associated with these tools, it is important to determine their efficiency in order to justify and/or modify their operation. This study evaluates the effect of the management of the "El Palmar" state reserve, which was established 23 years ago, by comparing the landscape characteristics of the mangrove forest of the Natural Protected Area (NPA) and the adjacent area that has no historical conservation status. A Geographic Information System (GIS) was used, as well as remote sensing techniques, based on the hierarchical analysis of quantitative characteristics of the habitat, the spectral similarity, contextual edition and the supervised classification of a multispectral Spot 5 image, to compare the area, fragmentation and compactness of ten types of mangrove habitats between the NPA and the adjacent area. The contrasted regions present the same general fragmentation pattern (p>0.05). However, when comparing the types of habitat, significant differences were observed (p<0.05) in the fragmentation, the area and the compactness of certain types of habitat. The observed differences do not indicate a clear effect of the protected area management strategies in the structure of the landscape and are possibly more related to the local conditions, ecological processes, and the natural and/or anthropogenic disturbances. Our results highlight the importance of adjusting the management strategies of the NPA in such a manner that they have a positive effect in the integrity of the mangrove's forest.

S	Zhang, LQ; Yuan, L; Huang, HM		Zhang, J		Zhang, Liquan; Yuan, Lin; Huang, Huamei			Coastal Wetlands in the Changjiang Estuary	ECOLOGICAL CONTINUUM FROM THE CHANGJIANG (YANGTZE RIVER) WATERSHEDS TO THE EAST CHINA SEA CONTINENTAL MARGIN	Estuaries of the World											The enormous quantities of sediment produced by the Changjiang (Yangtze River) have created extensive coastal wetlands in the estuarine region, which have been colonized by various types of salt marsh vegetation. As the Changjiang Estuary is located adjacent to the megacity of Shanghai, human activities exert substantial pressures on the coastal wetlands and cause coastal ecosystem degeneration and consequent decreases or loss in ecosystem services. The major stresses from human activities on the coastal wetlands in the Changjiang Estuary include urbanization, reclamation, the introduction of invasive species, overfishing, and environmental pollution. In this chapter, the succession of plant communities in the coastal wetlands of the Changjiang Estuary is described. The spatial and temporal variation of plant communities on salt marshes are analyzed on the basis of remote sensing (RS) and mapping, combined with field inventories of sampling plots. The population expansion of an exotic species, Spartina alterniflora, after its introduction to the coastal wetlands in the Changjiang Estuary in the 1990s, is described and analyzed. The impacts of the invasion of S. alterniflara on benthic communities are examined along intertidal salt marsh gradients, and the invasion history is described. A cellular automaton (CA) model was developed to simulate the expansion of S. alterniflora and to study the interactions between the spatial pattern of expansion and salt marsh vegetation ecosystems.

Many tropical protected areas exist as "islands" surrounded by continuing land use change and development. To understand the interconnections between land cover, biodiversity, and population growth, we use a unique dataset from the Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring (TEAM) Network together with Landsat derived land cover products, population data from the Gridded Population of the World (GPW), and roads data from the Global Roads Open Access Dataset (gROADS). We find significant relationships between road network length and forest loss and between road network length and agricultural development, but no clear links between population growth and land use change. This reaffirms the importance of planning future road extensions to limit their effects on tropical protected areas.																	2153-6996		978-1-4799-7929-5				2015							2560	2563										WOS:000371696702166						
J	Lin, B; Meyers, J; Barnett, G				Lin, Brenda; Meyers, Jacqui; Barnett, Guy			Understanding the potential loss and inequities of green space distribution with urban densification	URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING												Urban population growth is leading to growing concerns about land use change, green infrastructure, and the loss of beneficial ecosystem services. Human and environmental health is supported by services such as climate regulation, air filtration, and flood mitigation. However, maintaining these services within cities requires the preservation and equitable distribution of green infrastructure near where people live. Sydney, Australia, where the population is expected to grow from 4.3 million to 5.6 million by 2031, is undergoing an urban transformation. This study investigates the spatial distribution of green infrastructure within Sydney to determine how patterns of green infrastructure vary according to land use, residential density, and socio-economic variation. More than half of urban Sydney is comprised of residential land use, representing the single largest contribution to Sydney's green infrastructure. Two types of green infrastructure are examined in this study, public green space represented by parkland area and tree canopy cover and private green space represented by residential area and tree canopy cover. Results show that with greater dwelling density, both types of green infrastructure decrease. Availability of private versus public green infrastructure, however, differs according to socio-economic advantage. Suburbs of higher socio-economic advantage have significantly more private green cover, but slightly less public green cover than suburbs of greater disadvantage. These findings highlight that urban densification can lead to a general loss of two important reservoirs of urban green infrastructure (public parkland and residential tree cover). Disadvantaged communities may have a greater reliance on public green infrastructure in the form of parkland due to a lack of private residential tree cover. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Identification and characterization of agro-ecological infrastructures by remote sensing	REMOTE SENSING FOR AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS, AND HYDROLOGY XVII	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XVII part of the International Symposium on Remote Sensing	SEP 22-24, 2015	Toulouse, FRANCE	SPIE				Agro-Ecological Infrastructures (AEIs) include many semi-natural habitats (hedgerows, grass strips, grasslands, thickets.) and play a key role in biodiversity preservation, water quality and erosion control. Indirect biodiversity indicators based on AEISs are used in many national and European public policies to analyze ecological processes. The identification of these landscape features is difficult and expensive and limits their use. Remote sensing has a great potential to solve this problem. In this study, we propose an operational tool for the identification and characterization of AEISs. The method is based on segmentation, contextual classification and fusion of temporal classifications. Experiments were carried out on various temporal and spatial resolution satellite data (20-m, 10-m, 5-m, 2.5-m, 50-cm), on three French regions southwest landscape (hilly, plain, wooded, cultivated), north (open-field) and Brittany (farmland closed by hedges). The results give a good idea of the potential of remote sensing image processing methods to map fine agro-ecological objects. At 20-m spatial resolution, only larger hedgerows and riparian forests are apparent. Classification results show that 10-m resolution is well suited for agricultural and AEIs applications, most hedges, forest edges, thickets can be detected. Results highlight the multi-temporal data importance. The future Sentinel satellites with a very high temporal resolution and a 10-m spatial resolution should be an answer to AEIs detection. 2.50-m resolution is more precise with more details. But treatments are more complicated. At 50-cm resolution, accuracy level of details is even higher; this amplifies the difficulties previously reported. The results obtained allow calculation of statistics and metrics describing landscape structures.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-847-7				2015	9637								96372H	10.1117/12.2195077								WOS:000367321800045

Role of landscape diversity in dynamics of abundance of sugar beet pests population in Poltava region	VISNYK OF DNIPROPETROVSK UNIVERSITY-BIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Indicators of landscape-ecological diversity of territory of the Poltava region according to remote sensing of the Earth have been established, and its role in determination of dynamics of abundance of sugar beet pests has been found. The greatest landscape-ecological diversity has been calculated to be characteristic for the east and central areas of the Poltava region. The greatest landscape diversity has been revealed for Reshetilovsky (by the average Shannon index it is equal to 1,07 bit/pixel) and Velikobagachansky (1,06 bit/pixel) districts which are in the center of the Poltava region. The least landscape diversity is characteristic for Chemuhinsky, Semenovsky, Globinsky and Kobeljansky districts. General level of the landscape-ecological diversity and its dynamics has its effect on the condition and dynamics of sugar beet pests' abundance within the Poltava region. Landscape diversity defines the conditions where sharp growth of abundance of sugar beet pests may occur with the highest probability. Low level of landscape diversity displays ecological conditions at which risks of high infestations of sugar beet pest insects are the greatest Level of landscape diversity in the conditions of the Poltava region, first of all, is defined by the relation of agroecosystems to the landscape complexes of other types. Large unvaried territories which are occupied by agricultural lands create the conditions for high infestations of sugar beet pest insects.

Extreme values of snow-related variables in Mediterranean regions: trends and long-term forecasting in Sierra Nevada (Spain)	EXTREME HYDROLOGICAL EVENTS	Proceedings of the International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS)				Joint Inter-Association Symposium on Extreme Hydrological Events	JUN 22-JUL 02, 2015	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC					Mountain areas in Mediterranean regions constitute key monitoring points for climate variability and its impacts, but long time datasets are not always available due to the difficult access to high areas, relevant for capturing temperature and precipitation regimes, and the predominance of cloudy remote sensing images during the snow season. Sierra Nevada National Park (South Spain), with altitudes higher than 3500 m a.s.l., is part of the Global Change in Mountain Regions network. Snow occurrence just 40 km from the seaside determines a wide range of biodiversity, a snowmelt fluvial regime, and the associated ecosystem services. This work presents the local trend analysis of weather variables at this area together with additional snow-related variables. For this, long term point and distributed observations from weather stations and remote sensing sources were studied and used as input and calibration datasets of a physically based snow model to derive long term series of mean and maximum daily fraction of snow covered area, annual number of days with snow, annual number of days with precipitation, mean and maximum mean daily snow water equivalent, and snowmelt and evaporation volumes. The joint analysis of weather and snow variables showed a decrease trend in the persistence and extent of the snow cover area. The precipitation regime, rather than the temperature trend, seems to be the most relevant driver on the snow regime forcing in Mediterranean areas. This poses a constraint for rigorous scenario analysis in these regions, since the precipitation pattern is poorly approximated by climatic models in these regions.

However, detailed information on the distribution of lichens on the Antarctic Peninsula region is scarce, and the data available exhibit significant heterogeneity in sampling frequency and effort. Satellite remote sensing, in particular the use of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), has facilitated determination of vegetation richness and cover distribution in some remote and otherwise inaccessible environments. However, it is known that using NDVI for the detection of vegetation can overlook the presence of lichens even if their land cover is extensive. We tested the use of known spectra of lichens in a matched filtering technique for the detection and mapping of lichen-covered land from remote sensing imagery on the Antarctic Peninsula, using data on lichen presence collected by citizen scientists and other non-specialists as ground truthing. Our results confirm that the use of this approach allows for the detection of lichen flora on the Antarctic Peninsula, showing an improvement over the use of NDVI alone for the mapping of flora in this area.																	0800-0395	1751-8369					2015	34								25633	10.3402/polar.v34.25633								WOS:000363404700001

Based on remote sensing data of Landsat TM in 2005 and Landsat OLI in 2013, the effects of LUCC on ecosystem services in ecological preservation development districts (EPDD) of Beijing were analyzed from spatial and temporal perspectives. The results showed that: (1) Regional structure of land use and land cover in EPDD was forest land-farmland-orchard land; Forest land was the major land cover type, while farmland and orchard land dominated land use. From 2005 to 2013, changes in land use and land cover accelerated, and land use intensity was enhanced gradually with the land use degree comprehensive index (La) varied from 229.67 to 233.09. The main characteristics of LUCC were farmland, grassland (decreasing) and construction land, forest land, water body, orchard land (increasing). (2) Between 2005 and 2013, ecosystem services value of EPDD showed a rising trend with the increments of 803.27x10(4) USD from 113535.19x10(4) USD to 114338.46x10(4) USD. Ecosystem services value of farmland, grassland, wetland and unused land decreased since 2005, while orchard land, forest land, water body increased. Service function value of food production, climate regulation and soil conservation decreased with climate regulation having the largest reduction; Service function value of raw materials production, gas regulation, hydrological regulation, waste treatment, biodiversity conservation and leisure entertainment increased, while hydrological regulation had the largest increment. Ecological environment and ecosystem service functions became more symphonious after EPDD foundation.																	2352-538X		978-94-62520-74-5				2015	9						71	75										WOS:000359721400018

Due to its special topography, as they are characterized as salt-marshes, their characterization, both altimetric and volumetric, is quite complex. In this research, Landsat TM and ETM satellite images from the United States Geological Service (USGS) were analyzed for a period of 35 years, which were examined and classified in a certain period of time in order to characterize the dynamic changes (floods and land use changes) in the Tinto Tidal Marshes. The erosion phenomena were studied and analyzed through the use of different DEM and UAV data. All data were integrated into a GIS. Results shown how the forest fires and the oak decline of Quercus are the two processes that accelerate the conversion of forest stands in scrub areas or pastureland. Moreover, the ecological preservation of the Tinto salt-marshes results in a similarity of the volumetric change processes produced in the study periods. Erosion processes are an immediate consequence of the low kinetic energy in the Tinto river and hence of the progressive increase of the negative rate of eroded soil.																	2352-538X		978-94-62520-74-5				2015	9						105	108										WOS:000359721400026

The effects of a moratorium on land-clearing in the Douglas-Daly region, Northern Territory, Australia	RANGELAND JOURNAL												Land-clearing represents the first step in agricultural development and signals a shift in landscape function towards provisioning ecosystem services, in particular food production. In the process, other types of ecosystem services are often unintentionally lost as illustrated by the associated decline in biodiversity, increased soil erosion and emission of greenhouse gases. In 2003, the Northern Territory state government in Australia promulgated a moratorium on the clearing of native vegetation on freehold land in the Douglas-Daly river catchment, an area experiencing increasing pressure from agricultural development. The moratorium was intended to limit the rate and extent of land-clearing for a period of time so that informed policy could be concurrently developed to guide future land-clearing and minimise negative impacts. Under the moratorium, land-clearing required a permit and had to conform to broad guidelines; clearing was confined to freehold land, was prohibited in close proximity to wetlands, rivers and rainforest to safeguard water quality, and there were prescribed limits on percentages cleared by property, vegetation type, sub-catchment, and the whole catchment. Remotely sensed data (1977-2011) were used to explore the effectiveness of the moratorium. The analysis shows that, during moratorium years (2002-2009), clearing rates accelerated rather than slowed in the moratorium area and was mostly (81%) conducted without the required permits. The extent of land cleared after the moratorium was declared, and the fallow nature of some of this land a decade later, suggests that much of the land-clearing may have been completed in anticipation of stricter future controls. The moratorium failed because it was not formally legislated and was too broadly defined. Consequently, the non-binding nature of the land-clearing guidelines, and the absence of systematic monitoring of land cover change or penalties for clearing land without a permit, led to uninformed and uncontrolled clearing. This paper demonstrates that effective policy is only as good as its level of implementation.

Coffee is particularly important in the Ethiopian highlands, where appropriate climate allows higher productivity and quality. The Ethiopian highlands also host an outstanding biodiversity, being considered one of the world's most important biodiversity hotspots. In this context, conciliating agricultural practices with biodiversity conservation is a priority task for researchers and other stakeholders. However, identifying and mapping understorey coffee plantations in Ethiopian highlands is particularly challenging due to the presence of scattered exotic trees and the characteristics of understorey cultivation. In this research, we mapped potential areas of understorey coffee using predictive modelling and evaluated how projected changes in climate would affect the suitability of coffee production in the study area. Landscape maps, which were mapped using remote-sensing data based on object-based image analysis, remotely sensed spectral vegetation indices, and climatic variables were used to delineate probability maps showing the most likely location of understorey coffee. Normalized difference vegetation index and maximum temperature and precipitation were considered the best predictors for explaining the spatial distribution of understorey coffee. The accuracy of the probability map was validated based on existing understorey coffee areas mapped during field surveys. In addition, we show that potential changes in temperature and precipitation by 2050 are likely to shift suitable areas of understorey coffee to higher altitudes, affecting the landscape changes dynamics in the region.

Remote sensing is the only practical means of monitoring the conversion and regeneration of this vegetation formation. The objective of this article is to model the process of regeneration of Cerrado vegetation and to estimate its age using a RapidEye image mosaic and textural features derived from the grey-level co-occurrence matrix. The study area is Parque Estadual Veredas do Peruacu, a State Park in Minas Gerais, which was a plantation of eucalyptus until 1994 with a broad range of regeneration ages between 15 and 37 years. A total of 47 plots were surveyed for which the exact ages of regeneration are known and other structural variables were measured. Multiple regression and stepwise feature selection were used to create models that explain over 80% of the age, 58% of the crown closure, and 48% of the height of the vegetation. Texture proved essential for capturing the patterns of light and shadow generated by the trees of varying widths and heights.

G-LiHT is a compact, lightweight and portable system that can be used on a wide range of airborne platforms to support a number of NASA Earth Science research projects and space-based missions. G-LiHT permits simultaneous and complementary measurements of surface reflectance, vegetation structure, and temperature, which provide an analytical framework for the development of new algorithms for mapping plant species composition, plant functional types, biodiversity, biomass, carbon stocks, and plant growth. G-LiHT and its supporting database are designed to give scientists open access to the data that are needed to understand the relationship between ecosystem form and function and to stimulate the advancement of synergistic algorithms. This system will enhance our ability to design new missions and produce data products related to biodiversity and climate change. G-LiHT has been operational since 2011 and has been used to collect data for a number of NASA & USFS sponsored studies, including NASA's Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) and the American ICESat/GLAS Assessment of Carbon (AMIGA-Carb). These acquisitions target a broad diversity of forest communities and ecoregions across the United States and Mexico. Here, we will discuss the components of G-LiHT, their calibration and performance characteristics, operational implementation, and data processing workflows. We will also provide examples of higher level data products that are currently available.

J	Asner, GP				Asner, Gregory P.			ORGANISMIC REMOTE SENSING FOR TROPICAL FOREST ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION	ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN												Tropical forests are vast and scientifically underexplored places. Biotic losses, gains, and reorganization within these systems go undetected due to a lack of access to technologies needed to monitor forest cover, composition, and carbon content. Provision of forest cover-monitoring tools for non-scientists has, thus, become a focus of innovation in the remote-sensing community, while advances in high-resolution forest carbon and biodiversity mapping science has progressed more slowly. This paper focuses on high-resolution remote-sensing developments to measure and monitor tropical forest canopies at the "organismic scale," which is the resolution that resolves individual canopies and species throughout the forest landscape. Emphasis is placed on how forest carbon stocks can be mapped with precision and accuracy comparable to that of field-based estimates. Biodiversity mapping poses the greatest challenge, but recent advances in three-dimensional functional and structural trait imaging can reveal variation in species richness, abundance, and functional diversity over large geographic regions. The pay-off in pursuing these studies will be a vastly improved understanding of tropical biodiversity patterns and their underlying ecological and evolutionary drivers, which will have positive cascading effects on conservation decision-making and resource policy development.																	0026-6493	2162-4372					2015	100	3					127	140		10.3417/2012016								WOS:000351321700001

The lower Evros/Meric River, shared by Greece and Turkey, is one of the most heavily militarized river borders in Europe and access to the river corridor is strictly restricted. This 218 kin proposed green-belt conservation area has never been completely surveyed for its riparian biodiversity values. Here we provide an assessment and evidence for green-belt conservation justification for the entire portion of the Greek-Turkish river corridor for the first time. We employ satellite imagery to assess riparian corridor conditions and the distribution of natural habitat refuge environments focusing on riparian woodlands and river islands. The analysis found that nearly half of the area of the riparian green-belt is under cultivation; approximately 22% of the riparian zone is wooded, while some of these woodlands are taken over by artificial poplar plantations. The natural woodland areas are severely fragmented and usually small in extent and width being affected by frequent logging and clearing. The most extensive remaining woodlands are mapped; most of the 12 largest contiguous natural woodland are in the northern half of the river valley. Important natural habitat refuges are the river's islands; 127 such island features are mapped from recent satellite images, and most are heavily wooded, again most are found in the northern half of the river valley. Based on best-available information we interpret these patterns and encourage an international green-belt conservation initiative.

J	Mishra, NB; Chaudhuri, G				Mishra, Niti B.; Chaudhuri, Gargi			Spatio-temporal analysis of trends in seasonal vegetation productivity across Uttarakhand, Indian Himalayas, 2000-2014	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Himalayan mountain system in the Indian sub-continent are among the most ecologically sensitive environments and are also a repository of biodiversity, water and ecosystem services. Over the last two decades, land transformation related to exploitative land uses is among the main drivers of changing vegetation cover and productivity in western Himalayas. In a region where field based research is challenging due to heterogenous relief and high altitude, quantifying changes in vegetation photosynthetic activity using remote sensing can provide essential information regarding trends in vegetation cover and its linkages with anthropogenic impacts. We conducted seasonal trend analysis (STA) on MODIS NDVI time-series data (2000-2014) over Uttarakhand Himalayas and examined spatio-temporal patterns in vegetation trends and its association with altitudinal gradient and land use land cover (LULC) dynamics. In STA the first step determines the annual mean and seasonal NDVI patterns and the second step analyzes the non-parametric trend in magnitude and timing of the annual mean and seasonal NDVI cycle. To provide insights on the role of changing land use to detected changes in vegetation trend, we linked MODIS derived trends to land transformation processes using multi-temporal high spatial resolution imagery in Google Earth (GE). In total 3286.82 km(2) (6.9% vegetated area of Uttarakhand) showed significant trend (p < 0.01) in mean annual greenness. While areas <800 m elevation showed dominant negative trend in mean annual greenness (browning)), those between 800 and 1600 m showed mostly positive trend (greening) and majority of areas >1600 m were characterized by negative trend in mean annual greenness. Majority of intensively cultivated irrigated croplands in the Himalayan foothills as well as areas around growing urban centers showed widespread browning, which was contrastingly different from rainfed cultivation areas that showed dominant greening trend. Browning trend was observed to be consistent with increasing altitude, particularly in closed needle leaf forests and alpine shrublands, except areas where human impacts has led to more mixed patterns. Trends in the annual seasonal timing of NDVI indicated an earlier green-up for most parts of the Uttarakhand Himalayas. These results highlight fine scale spatial variations in seasonal vegetation trends and are in partial agreement with previous studies that report only increasing brownness detected at broader scale using much coarser spatial resolution time-series.

Advancing species diversity estimate by remotely sensed proxies: A conceptual review	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Many geospatial tools have been advocated in spatial ecology to estimate biodiversity and its changes over space and time. Such information is essential in designing effective strategies for biodiversity conservation and management. Remote sensing is one of the most powerful approaches to identify biodiversity hotspots and predict changes in species composition in reduced time and costs. This is because, with respect to field-based methods, it allows to derive complete spatial coverages of the Earth surface under study in a short period of time. Furthermore, remote sensing provides repeated coverages of field sites, thus making studies of temporal changes in biodiversity possible. In this paper we discuss, from a conceptual point of view, the potential of remote sensing in estimating biodiversity using various diversity indices, including alpha- and beta-diversity measurements.

Testing the spectral diversity hypothesis using spectroscopy data in a simulated wetland community	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												The spectral diversity hypothesis proposes that as the number of plant species increases for a given area, the diversity of spectra observed from that area should also increase. This approach could be very useful as an assessment and monitoring tool to help ecologists understand the spatial and temporal patterns of biodiversity without relying on consistently detecting individual species. While the spectral diversity hypothesis has been examined for a wide range of ecosystems using a variety of remote sensing data, it has not been tested using spectroscopy (i.e. hyperspectral) data for wetlands. Previous studies have not explicitly considered the impact that flowers may have on spectral diversity and how this may impact the spectral diversity hypothesis. To test the spectral diversity hypothesis and the potential impact on flowers, we used a simulation approach to combine leaf and flower spectra collected from a diverse prairie fen wetland ecosystem into datasets of virtual plots with varying levels of species diversity and different combination of species. To address the high dimensionality of the data, we compared spectral diversity and floristic diversity using partial least squares regression. Our results found that defining floristic diversity using the Shannon's diversity index, which accounts for plant abundance in each plot, produced the best predictive models where the predicted values had a RMSE less than 40% of the mean observed value. We also found that the inclusion of flower spectra with leaf spectra did increase the RMSE of the best model, but across all models, correlation increased. Our results indicate that spectral diversity could be used as an initial biodiversity assessment tool for wetlands, especially with on-going advancements in unmanned aerial vehicle technology that can provide a low altitude platform for imaging spectroscopy.

Interferometric processing of C-band SAR data for the improvement of stand age estimation in rubber plantation	INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON PHOTONICS, OPTICS, AND ITS APPLICATIONS (ISPHOA 2014)	Proceedings of SPIE				International Seminar on Photonics, Optics, and its Applications (ISPhOA)	OCT 14-15, 2014	INDONESIA	FTI, Dept Engn Phys, Inst Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Opt Soc, PT Telekomunikasi Selular, PT Len Industri, PT Sigma Cipta Caraka				Rubber ranks the second largest plantation in Indonesia after oil palm. While oil palm plantations have been exploited mainly by large companies, many rubber plantations are still managed by peasant farmers who maintain its biodiversity. Due to its broad and scattered location, monitoring tropical rubber plantation is a crucial application of active remote sensing. In this paper, the backscatter coefficient of Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) is compared to interferometric coherence to study the relationship between stand age and SAR parameters. It is shown that VV polarized C-band SAR achieves its saturation level in plantations aged about 5-10 years. Extension of saturation level can be achieved by processing an interferometric pair of ASAR data, which results in interferometric coherence. In this paper, coherence can take up to 20 years stand age to achieve prior to saturation. Since stand age is highly related to biomass, this finding argues that the biomass can be best estimated using coherence.

PREDICTING LONG-TERM CHANGES IN RIPARIAN BIRD COMMUNITIES IN FLOODPLAIN LANDSCAPES	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												As anthropogenic impacts on riverine ecosystems expand, both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are influenced over large spatiotemporal scales. We predicted how riparian bird communities changed in response to long-term changes in floodplain landscapes such as woodland expansion (i.e. rapid increases in vegetation cover on gravel bars and the progress of vegetation succession due to a decrease in the frequency and magnitude of flood disturbance). To test the hypothesis that woodland expansion after dam construction reduces the abundance of gravel bar-nesting birds and increases the abundance of forest-nesting birds, we estimated historical changes between past and present bird abundances using species distribution models across multiple rivers that were either unregulated or regulated by dams. We created past and present vegetation maps from remote sensing images and used habitat quantities as explanatory variables in the species distribution models. As we hypothesized, the estimated abundance of gravel bar-nesting birds decreased and that of forest-nesting birds increased because of woodland expansion in some regulated rivers. This suggests that anthropogenic alterations of riverine conditions (e.g. dam construction) can affect terrestrial ecosystems (e.g. riparian bird communities) through changes in floodplains (e.g. woodland expansion). In addition, our findings highlight the efficacy of combining spatial and temporal analyses when examining long-term ecological dynamics. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Conservation on islands is also often challenged by limited data on the distribution of remaining native habitats and threatened native and endemic species. We combine botanical survey data and habitat mapping through remote sensing and GIS to illustrate how multiple data sources can be used together to provide a synoptic view of the spatial distribution of native, naturalized and invasive alien plant species at an island scale, using the case study of Moorea (French Polynesia), a small (135 km(2)) tropical high volcanic island in the South Pacific. Results reveal that (i) 42 % of the rare and threatened native and endemic plant species are currently found in native habitats representing only 6 % of the island (8 km(2)); (ii) 49 % of these species occupy "hybrid" habitats covering 45 % of the island area (60 km(2)) where native species co-occur with naturalized non-native species; and (iii) 9 % of these species occur in 17 % of the island (23 km(2)) considered "novel" habitats that are highly invaded by alien plants that form dense monotypic stands. We conclude that conservation efforts and priorities should not neglect these novel and hybrid habitats on Moorea where many rare and threatened plants are found. Innovative strategies adapted to current conditions should be emphasized on small islands where conservation resources are often limited.																	0960-3115	1572-9710				JAN	2015	24	1					83	101		10.1007/s10531-014-0791-6								WOS:000348114100006

Phenology and climate relationships in aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) forest and woodland communities of southwestern Colorado	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) occurs over wide geographical, latitudinal, elevational, and environmental gradients, making it a favorable candidate for a study of phenology and climate relationships. Aspen forests and woodlands provide numerous ecosystem services, such as high primary productivity and biodiversity, retention and storage of environmental variables (precipitation, temperature, snow water equivalent) that affect the spring and fall phenology of the aspen woodland communities of southwestern Colorado. We assessed the land surface phenology of aspen woodlands using two phenology indices, start of season time (SOST) and end of season time (EOST), from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) database of conterminous U.S. phenological indicators over an 11-year time period (2001-2011). These indicators were developed with 250 m resolution remotely sensed data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer processed to highlight vegetation response. We compiled data on SOST, EOST, elevation, precipitation, air temperature, and snow water equivalent (SWE) for selected sites having more than 80% cover by aspen woodland communities. In the 11-year time frame of our study, EOST had significant positive correlation with minimum fall temperature and significant negative correlation with fall precipitation. SOST had a significant positive correlation with spring SWE and spring maximum temperature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Eco-certification and coffee cultivation enhance tree cover and forest connectivity in the Colombian coffee landscapes	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												Eco-certification of agricultural commodities offers an appealing option to promote more sustainable practices among smallholders, increase agricultural value, and lift farmers out of poverty through better market access. This study evaluates whether coffee cultivation is associated with changes in forest cover and forest fragmentation and whether the Rainforest Alliance eco-certification program has led to enhanced tree cover and greater landscape connectivity in the Colombian eastern Andes. Based on satellite imagery, geo-referenced coffee parcels and a pair-case comparison, we show that coffee-growing regions have larger areas in forest, larger forest patches, and better connectivity among patches than non-coffee areas. These differences, however, do not seem to be accentuated over time, except for dense forest cover in the coffee-growing region. The latter has increased since the introduction of a certification program that requires protection of forest remnants and riparian vegetation. Moreover, certified farms in the study area have increased the amount of tree cover on their plots significantly more than non-certified ones. Our study design, therefore, detects additionality in the impact of certification on tree cover increase: in a region with overall increase in tree cover, certified farms contributed significantly more to that trend than non-certified farms. This study presents the first evaluation of the impacts of certification in cultivated landscapes at the ecosystem level, detectable by Earth observation satellites.

REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												The introduction of fast-growing plant species has been a strategy worldwide to combat problems arising from land degradation. Prosopis juliflora is an ecosystem engineer that was introduced to Ethiopia in the 1970s to address erosion problems but has subsequently become an important invader. This paper analyzes the spread of P. juliflora in Baadu, located in the middle Awash Basin of Ethiopia, qualitatively assesses its impacts on ecosystem services and identifies research needs and challenges for sustainable land management. The plant was introduced in 1983 around cotton farms in the case study region to provide erosion regulation. By the year 2013, P. juliflora had invaded 20,000 ha (40 % of wetlands). It partly invaded also the riverbanks and agricultural lands and is expanding into adjacent dryland areas. The negative impacts of this invasion are partially offset by provisioning of firewood and charcoal. However, the difficulties to control its rapid spread indicate that the threats it poses to ecosystem services, people's livelihoods and lifestyles may exceed its benefits. We argue for an integrated research approach that considers both the services and disservices, as well as the social discourse among different groups of actors to appropriately address this issue and identify options for sustainable action.

In particular, climate predictions, demographic developments and a growing utilization of ecosystem services and functions are expected to increase pressure on resources and land. Land use conflicts, the sustenance of precarious livelihoods, deforestation of woodland savannahs, upstream-downstream water issues and human-wildlife conflicts are among the processes that are characteristic of policy and management challenges in the region. In the Eastern and Western Kavango regions of Namibia and the Cuando-Cubango province of Angola, a unique cross-border situation exists that allows assessing how the combination of local traditions, regional land management and national policies determines spatial patterns of land use and land cover transformation processes. To map major land use types and change processes we used a set of multi-temporal Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-7 ETM+ data sets, support vector machine (SVM) classification and iterative spectral mixture analysis (ISMA) on images covering the period from 1990 to 2010. Integrating satellite imagery with literature reviews, interviews, census and household survey data, we assessed the contrasting developrnent of resource utilization on both sides of the Okavango River. We investigated if and how policies and regulations at different levels drive land use decisions, and how these decisions manifest spatially. We found a strong and interconnected urban growth on both sides of the river. The area around Rundu has constantly been evolving to become Namibia's second largest city, also functioning as a hub of development and transborder commerce with opposing Calai. This trend was found to affect adjacent settlement areas and cause widespread conversion of woodland savannahs to agricultural land or their utilization for timber extraction. The conversion of woodland savannah to arable land was by far the dominant land use change process on both sides of the river, with a total conversion area of 460 km(2) (Namibia) and 293 km2 (Angola) observed during the observation period. Strong spatial change gradients occurred in relation to determining factors, such as accessibility, proximity to water, urban centres, etc., while relations to settlements where less obvious. Assessing results by country illustrated the difference in land use intensity and resource consumption between Angola and Namibia, which relate directly to historical developments, with a long period of stability in Namibia standing opposed to the recent and ongoing recovery from civil war in Angola. These are added to by statutory and traditional policy frameworks, the national endowment with natural capital (e.g. oil, uranium, diamonds, zinc) and the integration into global markets, which strongly affects national economies of both countries at large. Underlying land use decisions were found to be largely driven by individualized perspectives on growth ideologies, consumerism and wealth-aspirations connected to globalization processes. However, at present the result of these perspectives is still mainly a small-structured conversion to rainfed agriculture as a component of subsistence strategies of local livelihoods, and thus stands opposed to other regions of the world, where change processes are much more driven by large companies or follow national regulations and result in more intensive uses.

While the land use/cover change has accelerated land degradation, biodiversity loss, and climate change in the region, few studies exist on the drivers and implications of land use/cover dynamics in the basin. The study quantified the historical land use/cover changes beginning from 1984 to 2011 and predicted future changes using multi-level data-sets. We also examined population growth and government policies as they relate to land cover/use change. Data-sets from disparate sources consisting of multi-temporal satellite images, digital elevation model, population, and relevant ancillary data were used in the study. A combination of post-classification change detection method, intensity analysis, and Markov chain models were used to analyze and evaluate historical land use/cover changes and predict future change scenarios. We observed a major expansion of agriculture land at the loss of woodland savanna. Overall, change is more pronounced and fast during the period 1984-1994 and relatively slow during 1994-2011. Category and transition intensities were more pronounced in 1984-1994 than 1994-2011. These changes suggest policy intervention from government and individual response during the period 1994-2011. In addition, the study identified population growth, settlement expansion, and local policies as key drivers of land use/cover change. Future scenarios indicate: (1) increase in agriculture land use, (2) loss in woodland savanna and forest cover, and (3) significant wetland loss to agriculture.

In different parts of the globe, anthropic pressure on habitat and the species therein has been on an excessive scale. This causes the loss of linkage between habitats in the landscape and thus creates fragmented areas with less environmental regulation. Isolated management of protected areas is often not enough to guarantee biodiversity integrity, with the creation of management formats capable of integrating habitats being necessary. Methodological systematization provided by Geodesign for research, planning, and propositioning of solutions for a geographic area has great application potential in biodiversity protection and preservation strategies. This chapter's objective is to identify locations capable of making connectivity between protected areas possible and thus subsidizing an integrated management format for these areas. To meet the goal, we elaborated a script for an area's geographic representation, an analysis of the processes at play in space and time, and an evaluation of impacts the intended changes would cause in the study area so that we can indicate decision proposals aimed at integrated planning and management between protected areas. Geotechnologies supported the entire procedure using remote sensing and support of geographic information systems. Five suitable locations for establishing connectivity between habitats such as biodiversity corridors, stepping stones, and habitat mosaics were identified.																	1863-2246		978-3-319-17738-0; 978-3-319-17737-3				2015							333	346		10.1007/978-3-319-17738-0_23								WOS:000390822000023						
J	Ordway, EM				Ordway, Elsa M.			Political shifts and changing forests: Effects of armed conflict on forest conservation in Rwanda	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Most armed conflicts in recent history occurred in biodiversity hotspots. Yet, studies examining impacts of warfare on forests yield contradictory results. This study provides a theoretical framework articulating different hypothetical relationships between conflict and forest transitions. Landsat TM and ETM+ data were analyzed to examine forest transitions in Rwanda during conflict and post conflict periods. Net trends showed little difference between periods, with a rate of 1.6% annual gain during conflict years, and 2.5% following the conflict. Closer inspection revealed spatially concentrated forest loss during conflict years; 96% occurred in protected areas with the most loss in Gishwati Forest Reserve at a rate of -6.1%. Trends were explored with spatially explicit conflict data that distinguished armed conflict activity from conflict induced settlements. Impacts of conflict on forests in Rwanda appear to be influenced by natural resource use near settlements. Massive migrations of people into settlements during the conflict, who had previously been scattered across the landscape, resulted in a redistribution of pressures. Reduced pressure elsewhere supports this inference. Results underscore the vulnerability of protected areas and the spatial dynamics of forest resource dependence during conflicts. This work demonstrates the value of distinguishing conflict activities to assess their varied environmental effects. (C) 2015 The Author.

The main goal of this study was to contribute to conservation of 12 threatened species of amphibians at a cloud forest site in northwestern Ecuador, by identifying and proposing protection of critical areas. We used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing techniques to quantify land cover changes over 35 years and outline important areas for amphibian conservation. We performed a supervised classification of an IKONOS satellite image from 2011 and two aerial photographs from 1977 and 2000. The 2011 IKONOS satellite image classification was used to delineate areas important for conservation of threatened amphibians within a 200 m buffer around rivers and streams. The overall classification accuracy of the three images was >= 80%. Forest cover was reduced by 17% during the last 34 years. However, only 50% of the study area retained the initial (1977) forest cover, as land was cleared for farming and eventually reforested. Finally, using the 2011 IKONOS satellite image, we delineated areas of potential conservation interest that would benefit the long term survival of threatened amphibian species at the Ecuadorian cloud forest site studied.

Geospatial Analysis of Fragmentation and its Effects on Biodiversity: A Case Study of Reserve Forest	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS & STATISTICS												Fragmentation has many consequences on conservation, one of which is the loss of biological diversity. Remote sensing satellites and integration with Geographic Information Systems have provided a better understanding of natural resources and environmental dynamics. The present study focus on the use of geospatial methods to assess the level of fragmentation and its effects on biodiversity conservation in the Shasha forest reserve. The use of FRAGSTAT analysis technique incorporated with the classification of Landsat TM and ETM+ satellite data spanning a period of 14 years from 1986 to 2010 was used to quantify ecological metrics of fragmentation in the study area. The results showed increased settlement 24% (1986-2010) whilst agricultural/farmland uses increased by 38% (1986-2002) and dropped by 16% from 2002-2010. According to respondents who constituted inhabitants of the reserve, this was largely attributed to: human activities such as logging, farming, and settlement. Ecological metrics at landscape level (example, number of patches, Shannon and cohesion Indices) showed that fragmentation (Number of patches) strengthened (1986-2010 by over 57.7%). At class level, dense forest had fragmentation rate of over 59.7% between 1986-2010 while agricultural/Farmland had its peak of fragmentation in 1986-2002 by over 22.3% which later weakened by 13.8% in 2010 The increase in the magnitude of fragmentation in the study area has influenced the dynamics of species and materials in the landscape in such a way that it will have negative implication for biodiversity, climate, ecotourism, if nothing is done to reverse the trend.																	0973-1385						2015	36	1					28	43										WOS:000209993900003

Detecting and interpreting secondary forest on an old Amazonian frontier	JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE												Land uses that replace tropical forests are important determinants of terrestrial carbon storage and biodiversity. This includes secondary forest growth after deforestation, which has been integrated into the REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) concept as a means to enhance current forest carbon stocks. Incorporating secondary forest into climate change mitigation efforts requires both accurate measurements and a means to target interventions to achieve additionality. We demonstrate how remote sensing and household survey data can be combined to meet these requirements in 'old frontiers' of the Brazilian Amazon and introduce the idea that annual land-cover transitions - measured at the pixel level and over time - can serve as leading indicators of secondary forest regrowth. The patterns we observe are consistent with the suggested tension between equity and additionality in REDD+: the poorest households on the poorest quality lots already allow forest regeneration. Policy interventions to encourage regeneration are likely to have the greatest additional impact on higher quality lots owned by better capitalized households.

Costs related to these function losses can be avoided by early recognition of coastal squeeze and early action. In this research we investigate how remote sensing imagery data can contribute to early recognition of coastal squeeze. The case study is the lower Ayeyarwady delta in Myanmar, a crucial agricultural zone nicknamed the 'Ricebowl of Myanmar'. The coastal zone in Myanmar is subject to climate change, urbanization, extreme weather conditions (cyclones), increase in agri-and aquaculture and (illegal) felling of mangrove. This has already led to large loss of biodiversity and increased flood risk. Remote sensing analysis based on LANDSAT imagery has been done in attempt to identify land use and coastline change.																			978-90-824846-0-1				2015							2356	2367										WOS:000398996202054

To recover the increasingly degenerated ecology of the wetland in the estuarine delta of Diaokou River, the eco - water supplement to the wetland during the water and sediment regulation period was decided by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission in 2010. In this study, taking Diaokou River as one of case study, the effects of the Yellow River ecological water regulation were evaluated, and the follow - up assessments and analyses on the factors such as vegetation, wetland, soil salt content, ground water, etc. before and after the eco - water supplement are made with the methods including the real - time monitoring, remote sensing image interpretation and ground water model simulation concerned. The result shows that the eco - efficiency of the eco - water supplement to Diaokou River is remarkable, which not only preliminarily impedes the developing trend of the invasion of salty groundwater into the degenerated wetland area of the river, but also alleviates the soil salinization within the region to a certain extent, i.e. the damaged sensitive habitat and the wetland vegetation structure are restored along with the preliminary formation of the reed marsh and reed meadow-the suitable habitat for the aquatic birds and the obvious increase of the biodiversity of the aquatic birds therein.																			978-7-5509-0399-9				2015							398	406										WOS:000391414600053

The Al Hawizeh wetland in the Iran-Iraq border was selected as a study area to evaluate the changes. Maximum likelihood classification was used on the remote sensing data acquired during the period of 1985 to 2013. In this paper, five types of land use/land cover (LULC) were identified and mapped and accuracy assessment was performed. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient for years 1985, 1998, 2002, and 2013 were 93 % and 0.9, 92 % and 0.89, 91 % and 0.9, and 92 % and 0.9, respectively. The classified images were examined with post-classification comparison (PCC) algorithm, and the LULC alterations were assessed. The results of the PCC analysis revealed that there is a drastic change in the area and size of the studied region during the period of investigation. The wetland lost similar to 73 % of its surface area from 1985 to 2002. Meanwhile, post-2002, the wetland underwent a restoration, as a result of which, the area increased slightly and experienced an similar to 29 % growth. Moreover, a large change was noticed at the same period in the wetland that altered similar to 62 % into bare soil in 2002. The areal coverage of wetland of 3386 km(2) in 1985 was reduced to 925 km(2) by 2002 and restored to 1906 km(2) by the year 2013. Human activities particularly engineering projects were identified as the main reason behind the wetland degradation and LULC alterations. And, lastly, in this study, some mitigation measures and recommendations regarding the reclamation of the wetland are discussed. Based on these mitigate measures, the discharge to the wetland must be kept according to the water requirement of the wetland. Moreover, some anthropogenic activities have to be stopped in and around the wetland to protect the ecology of the wetland.

J	Ghulam, A				Ghulam, Abduwasit			Monitoring Tropical Forest Degradation in Betampona Nature Reserve, Madagascar Using Multisource Remote Sensing Data Fusion	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												This paper demonstrates how animal and plant species diversity in the Betampona Nature Reserve (BNR), Madagascar has become threatened through forest degradation and the introduction of invasive species over the last two decades. First, land-use changes and agricultural activities were analyzed using Landsat and IKO-NOS-2 data from 1990 to 2010. Then, a decision tree algorithm was developed to map under canopy invasive plant species using high resolution optical stereo imaging, land-use classification, and characterizing plant growth using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and polarimetric InSAR observations from Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR). Next, causal association between land use, climate change, and spatial and temporal dynamics of invasive plant species distribution was explored using satellite derived and in situ climate variables, changes in drought regimes, and tropical cyclones. Results showed that the region experienced intense land-use changes characterized by significant increase in agricultural lands at the cost of primary forest and other land-cover types. Encroachment by habitat-altering invasive plants from 2005 to 2012 within the reserve was obvious, and were probably attributable to illegal logging, erosion of the reserve boundary from anthropogenic activities and cyclone damage as well as shifts in drought regimes. The spatial extent of guava (Psidium cattleianum) has increased from 5.6% of the reserve in 2005 to 7.9% in 2012, a 55-ha increase over less than 7 years. Madagascar cardamom (Aframomum angustifolium) has increased by 1.7% and Molucca raspberry (Rubus moluccanus) by 2.3%, respectively.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				DEC	2014	7	12			SI		4960	4971		10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2319314								WOS:000348372000032

MODISTools - downloading and processing MODIS remotely sensed data in R	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Remotely sensed data - available at medium to high resolution across global spatial and temporal scales - are a valuable resource for ecologists. In particular, products from NASA's MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), providing twice-daily global coverage, have been widely used for ecological applications. We present MODISTools, an R package designed to improve the accessing, downloading, and processing of remotely sensed MODIS data. MODISTools automates the process of data downloading and processing from any number of locations, time periods, and MODIS products. This automation reduces the risk of human error, and the researcher effort required compared to manual per-location downloads. The package will be particularly useful for ecological studies that include multiple sites, such as meta-analyses, observation networks, and globally distributed experiments. We give examples of the simple, reproducible workflow that MODISTools provides and of the checks that are carried out in the process. The end product is in a format that is amenable to statistical modeling. We analyzed the relationship between species richness across multiple higher taxa observed at 526 sites in temperate forests and vegetation indices, measures of aboveground net primary productivity. We downloaded MODIS derived vegetation index time series for each location where the species richness had been sampled, and summarized the data into three measures: maximum time-series value, temporal mean, and temporal variability. On average, species richness covaried positively with our vegetation index measures. Different higher taxa show different positive relationships with vegetation indices. Models had high R-2 values, suggesting higher taxon identity and a gradient of vegetation index together explain most of the variation in species richness in our data. MODISTools can be used on Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms, and is available from CRAN and GitHub ().

Earth observation-based coastal zone monitoring of the Yellow River Delta: Dynamics in China's second largest oil producing region over four decades	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												The largest challenge for the Yellow River Delta region is finding an equilibrium between its two largest assets: large, valuable wetland reserves rich in biodiversity, declared as Ramsar sites in 2013 and breeding and resting grounds for numerous migratory bird species on the one hand, and extensive industrial and urban development based on the wealth of large underground oil and gas reserves, on the other. Based on high and highest spatial resolution satellite imagery covering nearly four decades, we employed manual feature digitization as well as rate-of-change statistics automatically derived with the Digital Shoreline Analyses System (DSAS) and present oil-industry-induced river bed changes and related coastal dynamics manifested via land erosion or accretion, and thus overall changes in the appearance of the Yellow River Delta. Over the past 37 years large re-diversions led to net erosion areas with over 13 km of shoreline retreat, and net accretion areas with over 21 km of shoreline advance. The satellite data furthermore enabled an assessment of oil pump development in the delta for the past two decades, indicating a strong expansion of oil extraction activities even in two of the delta's protected nature reserves, taking place at times and locations that indicate noncompliance with national regulations. Overall, the study proves the power of satellite imagery to quantify changes in the coastal zone, and to detect industry related activities; including the monitoring of compliance to restricting regulations. It is especially the freely accessible Landsat archives, granting four decades of monitoring, which are of immeasurable value to depict the regions dynamics. With Landsat 8 already in orbit and with the up-coming launch of the Sentinel-2 satellite, the monitoring concept presented here can be continued into the future. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A random forest approach for predicting the presence of Echinococcus multilocularis intermediate host Ochotona spp. presence in relation to landscape characteristics in western China	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Understanding distribution patterns of hosts implicated in the transmission of zoonotic disease remains a key goal of parasitology. Here, random forests are employed to model spatial patterns of the presence of the plateau pika (Ochotona spp.) small mammal intermediate host for the parasitic tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis which is responsible for a significant burden of human zoonoses in western China. Landsat ETM + satellite imagery and digital elevation model data were utilized to generate quantified measures of environmental characteristics across a study area in Sichuan Province, China. Land cover maps were generated identifying the distribution of specific land cover types, with landscape metrics employed to describe the spatial organisation of land cover patches. Random forests were used to model spatial patterns of Ochotona spp. presence, enabling the relative importance of the environmental characteristics in relation to Ochotona spp. presence to be ranked. An index of habitat aggregation was identified as the most important variable in influencing Ochotona spp. presence, with area of degraded grassland the most important land cover class variable. 71% of the variance in Ochotona spp. presence was explained, with a 90.98% accuracy rate as determined by 'out-of-bag' error assessment. Identification of the environmental characteristics influencing Ochotona spp. presence enables us to better understand distribution patterns of hosts implicated in the transmission of Em. The predictive mapping of this Em host enables the identification of human populations at increased risk of infection, enabling preventative strategies to be adopted. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a multidisciplinary approach used to assess historical land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes and their impacts on the environment in southeast Mato Grosso State, a region where the Cerrado has been intensively converted into agricultural lands. The methodology encompassed three main stages: (1) quantifying LULC changes using remote sensing data, (2) assessing LULC change impacts on vulnerable lands (e.g. erosion prone areas and wetlands), and (3) summarizing preceding information into key environmental indicators, assessed within the Pressure-State-Response framework (PSR) of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The results indicated a drastic landscape transformation in the selected area, which evolved from predominantly vegetated to a consolidated agricultural region. Crops expanded at high rates from 1985 to 1995, occupying the majority of the lands suited for agriculture. In the following decade, crops continued to expand and encroached into fragile environments (e.g. wetlands and more erodible soils). As a result, from 1985 to 2005, the area lost approximately 42% of its natural vegetation and erosion risks increased significantly. Our integration of land-use change information with intrinsic environmental vulnerabilities allowed a deeper understanding of LULC changes consequences and provided environmental indicators. This offered a synoptic view of how LULC changes occurred and how they affected the environment at a landscape scale. Furthermore, the assessment of the indicators using the PSR framework, helped to clarify cause-effect relationships thus furnishing key information of value to decision-makers and future comparisons with other areas.

The afforestation of abandoned or degraded land is a practical approach to restore regional ecological functions and to sequester atmospheric carbon to help mitigate the global imbalance of atmospheric carbon associated with climate change. Large gaps, however, remain in understanding the dynamics of afforested tree communities. In this study, the effect of topographical relief and soil properties on growth performance of planted trees has been assessed. Above ground dry biomass (AGB(dry)) accumulation was estimated to evaluate the performance of afforested tree communities on formerly abandoned pastures at the Reserva Ecologica de Guapiacu, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The study revealed large discrepancies in AGBdry and respective organic carbon accumulationThe afforested tree community located on the sloped terrain stored only half the carbon (21.70 +/- 7.3 Mgha(-1)) that the planted trees on the flat terrain stored. (46.67 +/- 8.7 Mgha(-1)). Our results suggest that differences in tree growth performance are complex, depending largely on topography and related soil conditions. These circumstances should be considered to prevent misleading carbon sink estimates when developing regional strategies for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) that promote afforestation activities.

Advances in animal ecology from 3D-LiDAR ecosystem mapping	TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION												The advent and recent advances of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) have enabled accurate measurement of 3D ecosystem structure. Here, we review insights gained through the application of LiDAR to animal ecology studies, revealing the fundamental importance of structure for animals. Structural heterogeneity is most conducive to increased animal richness and abundance, and increased complexity of vertical vegetation structure is more positively influential compared with traditionally measured canopy cover, which produces mixed results. However, different taxonomic groups interact with a variety of 3D canopy traits and some groups with 3D topography. To develop a better understanding of animal dynamics, future studies will benefit from considering 3D habitat effects in a wider variety of ecosystems and with more taxa.

The results showed that the temperature, salinity, nutrients, and oxygen of seawater changed when El Nio/La Nia occurred. The variation of biological communities reflected the response of ecosystem to environmental changes. During El Nio period, Chl a concentration and phytoplankton community structure changed significantly, and the relative proportion of diatoms increased while dinoflagellates decreased. During La Nia period, the proportion of diatoms decreased, but the golden-brown algae and blue-green algae increased significantly. The variation of phytoplankton population directly affected the biodiversity of the bay, which were also quite sensitive to the marine environment changes. Meanwhile, the satellite remote sensing data of 2002-2011 (December-March) have been used to study the temporal connection change of Chl a and phytoplankton in the Prydz Bay. We found that there were significant differences in the monthly variation characteristics of satellite remote sensing Chl a and sea surface temperature (SST), which had some links with sea ice melting and El Nio/La Nia events. We found that the start time of bloom advanced, lagged or synchronized with the changes of the SST, and we also found the occurrence time of phytoplankton bloom corresponded with the sea ice melting inner bay. To some extent, this study will help us understand the relationships between ENSO events and the phytoplankton bloom in the Southern Ocean.

The method of continuum removal, first derivative reflectance and second derivative reflectance were used to deal with the original spectral data of four tree species. The method of Mahalanobis Distance was used to select the bands with significant differences in the original spectral data and transform spectral data to identify the different tree species. The progressive discrimination analyses were used to test the selective bands used to identify different tree species. The results showed that The Mahalanobis Distance method was an effective method in feature band extraction. The bands for identifying different tree species were most near-infrared bands. The recognition accuracy of four methods was 85%, 93. 8%, 92. 4% and 95. 5% respectively. Spectrum transform could improve the recognition accuracy. The recognition accuracy of different research objects and different spectrum transform methods were different.

On the Front Line: frontal zones as priority at-sea conservation areas for mobile marine vertebrates	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												<list list-type="1" id="jpe12330-list-0001"> Identifying priority areas for marine vertebrate conservation is complex because species of conservation concern are highly mobile, inhabit dynamic habitats and are difficult to monitor. Many marine vertebrates are known to associate with oceanographic fronts - physical interfaces at the transition between water masses - for foraging and migration, making them important candidate sites for conservation. Here, we review associations between marine vertebrates and fronts and how they vary with scale, regional oceanography and foraging ecology. Accessibility, spatiotemporal predictability and relative productivity of front-associated foraging habitats are key aspects of their ecological importance. Predictable mesoscale (10s-100skm) regions of persistent frontal activity (frontal zones') are particularly significant. Frontal zones are hotspots of overlap between critical habitat and spatially explicit anthropogenic threats, such as the concentration of fisheries activity. As such, they represent tractable conservation units, in which to target measures for threat mitigation. Front mapping via Earth observation (EO) remote sensing facilitates identification and monitoring of these hotspots of vulnerability. Seasonal or climatological products can locate biophysical hotspots, while near-real-time front mapping augments the suite of tools supporting spatially dynamic ocean management.Synthesis and applications. Frontal zones are ecologically important for mobile marine vertebrates. We surmise that relative accessibility, predictability and productivity are key biophysical characteristics of ecologically significant frontal zones in contrasting oceanographic regions. Persistent frontal zones are potential priority conservation areas for multiple marine vertebrate taxa and are easily identifiable through front mapping via EO remote sensing. These insights are useful for marine spatial planning and marine biodiversity conservation, both within Exclusive Economic Zones and in the open oceans.

Its main scientific objective is to explore the potential of biodiversity and ecological processes such as pest regulation, enabling novel ecologically-based models for productive systems, reduction of pesticide use, and adaptation or resilience of farming systems in the face of environmental disruptions. From Northern Senegal to Southern Benin, the research group explores a wide range of ecoregions and socio-ecological contexts, including stakeholders and their objectives, land use and agricultural practices, and management of biodiversity for enhancing biological control. Main challenges to be turned into opportunities include (i) encouraging collaborations amongst researchers from different scientific fields, (ii) fostering interactive research and synergies among research institutions and among countries, and (iii) developing an ecological engineering approach for the design of sustainable agricultural systems for smallholder farmers.

J	Larue, MA; Knight, J				Larue, Michelle A.; Knight, Joseph			Applications of Very High-Resolution Imagery in the Study and Conservation of Large Predators in the Southern Ocean	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												The Southern Ocean is one of the most rapidly changing ecosystems on the planet due to the effects of climate change and commercial fishing for ecologically important krill and fish. Because sea ice loss is expected to be accompanied by declines in krill and fish predators, decoupling the effects of climate and anthropogenic changes on these predator populations is crucial for ecosystem-based management of the Southern Ocean. We reviewed research published from 2007 to 2014 that incorporated very high-resolution satellite imagery to assess distribution, abundance, and effects of climate and other anthropogenic changes on populations of predators in polar regions. Very high-resolution imagery has been used to study 7 species of polar animals in 13 papers, many of which provide methods through which further research can be conducted. Use of very high-resolution imagery in the Southern Ocean can provide a broader understanding of climate and anthropogenic forces on populations and inform management and conservation recommendations. We recommend that conservation biologists continue to integrate high-resolution remote sensing into broad-scale biodiversity and population studies in remote areas, where it can provide much needed detail. Aplicaciones de Imagenes de Muy Alta Resolucion en el Estudio y Conservacion de Grandes Depredadores en el Oceano Antartico Resumen El Oceano Antartico es uno de los ecosistemas con rapidos cambios en el planeta debido a los efectos del cambio climatico y la pesca comercial de peces y kril ecologicamente importantes. Ya que se espera que la perdida de hielo este acompanada por declinaciones de depredadores de peces y kril, desacoplar los efectos de los cambios climaticos y antropogenicos de estas poblaciones de depredadores es crucial para el manejo basado en ecosistemas del Oceano Antartico. Revisamos investigaciones publicadas desde 2007 hasta 2014, las cuales incorporaron imagenes satelitales de muy alta resolucion para evaluar la distribucion, abundancia y efectos del clima y otros cambios antropogenicos sobre las poblaciones de depredadores en las regiones polares. Las imagenes de muy alta resolucion se han utilizado para estudiar siete especies de animales polares en 13 articulos, muchos de los cuales proporcionan metodos mediante los cuales se pueden llevar a cabo mas investigaciones. El uso de imagenes de muy alta resolucion en el Oceano Antartico puede proporcionar un entendimiento mas amplio de las fuerzas climaticas y antropogenicas que actuan sobre las poblaciones e informar a las recomendaciones de manejo y conservacion. Recomendamos que los biologos de la conservacion integren sensores remotos de alta resolucion en los estudios poblacionales y de biodiversidad a gran escala en areas remotas, donde puede proporcionar detalles muy necesitados.																	0888-8892	1523-1739				DEC	2014	28	6					1731	1735		10.1111/cobi.12367								WOS:000344794200030	25103277					
J	Adams, MP; Smith, PL				Adams, Matthew P.; Smith, Peter L.			A systematic approach to model the influence of the type and density of vegetation cover on urban heat using remote sensing	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Cities around the world are pursuing increasing green or vegetation cover as a way of managing heat whilst improving beauty, biodiversity and recreational value. However, the pattern of the relationship between vegetation cover and urban temperature can be masked, controlled or exaggerated by vegetation structure, topography and other climate variables. This study examines the relationship between Sydney's urban surface temperature and vegetation cover as defined by two vegetation indices; mixed vegetation cover and tree cover exclusively. The shape of this relationship and relative influence of confounding factors are explored using penalised-likelihood criteria ranked regressions. Overall, increasing tree cover reduces average surface temperatures more dramatically than mixed vegetation cover. This study demonstrates that the extent of influence of greencover on surface temperatures is more accurately defined by identifying and incorporating site specific factors that confound the influence. Best predictor models are significantly improved when the influences of elevation, coastal effects and urban structure are added. Therefore, heat reducing urban greening strategies will be improved if based on local variables and conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

LocationChamonix Valley, French Alps. MethodsWe fit linear mixed effects (LME) models to historical changes in forest and glacier cover and projected these trends forward to align with 21st century IPCC climate scenarios. We used a logistic function to model the probability of plant establishment in glacial forelands zones expected to become ice free between 2008 and 2051-2080. Habitat filtering consisted of intersecting land cover maps with climate-driven SDMs to refine habitat suitability predictions. SDM outputs for tree, heath and alpine species were compared based on whether habitat filtering during the prediction period was carried out using present-day (static) land cover, future (dynamic) land cover filters or no land cover filter (unfiltered). Species range change (SRC) was used to measure differences in habitat suitability predictions across methods. ResultsLME predictions for 2021-2080 showed continued glacier retreat, tree line rise and primary succession in glacier forelands. SRC was highest in the unfiltered scenario (-10%), intermediate in the dynamic scenario (-15%) and lowest in the static scenario (-31%). Tree species were the only group predicted to gain overall range by 2051-2080. Although alpine plants lost range in all three land cover scenarios, new habitat made available by glacier retreat in the dynamic land cover scenario buffered alpine plant range loss due to climate change. Main conclusionsWe provide a framework for combining trajectories of land cover change with SDM predictions. Our pilot study shows that incorporating shifts in land cover improves habitat suitability predictions and leads to contrasting outcomes of future mountain plant distribution. Alpine plants in particular may lose less suitable habitat than standard SDMs predict due to 21st century glacier retreat.

Prasada			Geospatial assessment and monitoring of historical forest cover changes (1920-2012) in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, Western Ghats, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Deforestation in the biosphere reserves, which are key Protected Areas has negative impacts on biodiversity, climate, carbon fluxes and livelihoods. Comprehensive study of deforestation in biosphere reserves is required to assess the impact of the management effectiveness. This article assesses the changes in forest cover in various zones and protected areas of Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, the first declared biosphere reserve in India which forms part of Western Ghats-a global biodiversity hotspot. In this study, we have mapped the forests from earliest available topographical maps and multi-temporal satellite data spanning from 1920's to 2012 period. Mapping of spatial extent of forest cover, vegetation types and land cover was carried out using visual interpretation technique. A grid cell of 1 km x 1 km was generated for time series change analysis to understand the patterns in spatial distribution of forest cover (1920-1973-1989-1999-2006-2012). The total forest area of biosphere reserve was found to be 5,806.5 km(2) (93.8 % of total geographical area) in 1920. Overall loss of forest cover was estimated as 1,423.6 km(2) (24.5 % of the total forest) with reference to 1920. Among the six Protected Areas, annual deforestation rate of > 0.5 was found in Wayanad wildlife sanctuary during 1920-1973. The deforestation in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve is mainly attributed to conversion of forests to plantations and agriculture along with submergence due to construction of dams during 1920 to 1989. Grid wise analysis indicates that 851 grids have undergone large-scale negative changes of > 75 ha of forest loss during 1920-1973 while, only 15 grids have shown > 75 ha loss during 1973-1989. Annual net rate of deforestation for the period of 1920 to 1973 was calculated as 0.5 followed by 0.1 for 1973 to 1989. Our analysis shows that there was large-scale deforestation before the declaration of area as biosphere reserve in 1986; however, the deforestation has drastically reduced after the declaration due to high degree of protection, thus indicating the secure future of reserve in the long term under the current forest management practices. The present work will stand as the most up-to-date assessment on the forest cover of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve with immediate applications in monitoring and management of forest biodiversity.

J	Wang, SX; Wu, B; Yang, PN				Wang, Shuixian; Wu, Bin; Yang, Pengnian			Assessing the changes in land use and ecosystem services in an oasis agricultural region of Yanqi Basin, Northwest China	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The Yanqi Basin, one of the most productive agricultural areas, has a high population density in Xinjiang, Northwest China. Land use changes, mainly driven by oasis expansion, significantly impact ecosystem services and functions, but these effects are difficult to quantify. The valuation of ecosystem services is important to clarify the ecological and environmental changes caused by agriculturalization of oasis. This study aimed to investigate variations in ecosystem services in response to land use changes during oasis agricultural expansion activities in the Yanqi Basin from 1964 to 2009. The methods used were based on formula of ecosystem service value (ESV) and ESV coefficients. Satellite data were combined with the ESV coefficients to quantify land use changes and ecosystem service changes in the study area. Sensitivity analysis determined the effect of manipulating the coefficients on the estimated values. The results show that the total ESVs in the Yanqi Basin were $1,674, $1,692, $1,471, $1,732, and $1,603 million in 1964, 1973, 1989, 1999, and 2009, respectively. The net deline in ESV was $71 million in the past 46 years, but the ESVs of each types of landscape changed significantly. The aggregated ESVs of water areas and wetlands were approximately 80 % of the total ESV. Water supply and waste treatment were the two largest service functions and contributed approximately 65 % of the total ESV. The estimated ESVs in this study were elastic with respect to the value coefficients. Therefore, the estimations were robust in spite of uncertainties on the value coefficients. These significant changes in land use occur within the entire basin over the study period. These changes cause environmental problems, such as land degradation, vegetation degeneracy, and changes in aquatic environment.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				DEC	2014	186	12					8343	8357		10.1007/s10661-014-4009-x								WOS:000344349200021	25150053					
J	Stenzel, S; Feilhauer, H; Mack, B; Metz, A; Schmidtlein, S				Stenzel, Stefanie; Feilhauer, Hannes; Mack, Benjamin; Metz, Annekatrin; Schmidtlein, Sebastian			Remote sensing of scattered Natura 2000 habitats using a one-class classifier	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Mapping of habitats with relevance for nature conservation involves the identification of patches of target habitats in a complex mosaic of vegetation types not relevant for conservation planning. Limiting the necessary ground reference to a small sample of target habitats would greatly reduce and therefore support the field mapping effort. We thus aim to answer in this study the question: can semi-automated remote sensing methods help to map such patches without the need of ground references from sites not relevant for nature conservation? Approaches able to fulfill this task may help to improve the efficiency of large scale mapping and monitoring programs such as requested for the European Habitat Directive. In the present study, we used the maximum-entropy based classification approach Maxent to map four habitat types across a patchy landscape of 1000 km(2) near Munich, Germany. This task was conducted using the low number of 125 ground reference points only along with easily available multi-seasonal RapidEye satellite imagery. Encountered problems include the non-stationarity of habitat reflectance due to different phenological development across space, continuous transitions between the habitats and the need for improved methods for detailed validation. The result of the tested approach is a habitat map with an overall accuracy of 70%. The rather simple and affordable approach can thus be recommended for a first survey of previously unmapped areas, as a tool for identifying potential gaps in existing habitat inventories and as a first check for changes in the distribution of habitats.

J	Tulbure, MG; Kininmonth, S; Broich, M				Tulbure, Mirela G.; Kininmonth, Stuart; Broich, Mark			Spatiotemporal dynamics of surface water networks across a global biodiversity hotspot-implications for conservation	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The concept of habitat networks represents an important tool for landscape conservation and management at regional scales. Previous studies simulated degradation of temporally fixed networks but few quantified the change in network connectivity from disintegration of key features that undergo naturally occurring spatiotemporal dynamics. This is particularly of concern for aquatic systems, which typically show high natural spatiotemporal variability. Here we focused on the Swan Coastal Plain, a bioregion that encompasses a global biodiversity hotspot in Australia with over 1500 water bodies of high biodiversity. Using graph theory, we conducted a temporal analysis of water body connectivity over 13 years of variable climate. We derived large networks of surface water bodies using Landsat data (1999-2011). We generated an ensemble of 278 potential networks at three dispersal distances approximating the maximum dispersal distance of different water dependent organisms. We assessed network connectivity through several network topology metrics and quantified the resilience of the network topology during wet and dry phases. We identified 'stepping stone' water bodies across time and compared our networks with theoretical network models with known properties. Results showed a highly dynamic seasonal pattern of variability in network topology metrics. A decline in connectivity over the 13 years was noted with potential negative consequences for species with limited dispersal capacity. The networks described here resemble theoretical scale-free models, also known as 'rich get richer' algorithm. The 'stepping stone' water bodies are located in the area around the Peel-Harvey Estuary, a Ramsar listed site, and some are located in a national park. Our results describe a powerful approach that can be implemented when assessing the connectivity for a particular organism with known dispersal distance. The approach of identifying the surface water bodies that act as 'stepping stone' over time may help prioritize surface water bodies that are essential for maintaining regional scale connectivity.

H.; Steinbauer, Manuel J.; Jentsch, Anke			The relationship between the spectral diversity of satellite imagery, habitat heterogeneity, and plant species richness	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Assessment of habitat heterogeneity and plant species richness at the landscape scale is often based on intensive and extensive fieldwork at great cost of time and money. We evaluated the use of satellite imagery as a quantitative measure of the relationship between the spectral diversity of satellite imagery, habitat heterogeneity, and plant species richness. A 16 km(2) portion of a military training area in Germany was systematically sampled by plant taxonomic experts on a grid of one hundred 1-ha plots. The diversity of disturbance types, resulting habitat heterogeneity, and plant species richness were determined for each plot. Using an IKONOS multispectral satellite image, we examined 168 metrics of spectral diversity as potential indicators of those independent variables. Across all potential relationships, a simple count of values per spectral band per plot, after compressing the data from the original 11-bit format with 2048 potential values per band into a maximum of 100 values per band, resulted in the most consistent predictor for various metrics of habitat heterogeneity and plant species richness. The count of values in the green band generally out-performed the other bands. The relationship between spectral diversity and plant species richness was stronger than for measures of habitat heterogeneity. Based on the results, we conclude that remotely sensed assessment of spectral diversity, when coupled with limited ground-truthing, can provide reasonable estimates of habitat heterogeneity and plant species richness across broad areas.

K.; Tipdecho, Taravudh			Ecosystem evaluation (1989-2012) of Ramsar wetland Deepor Beel using satellite-derived indices	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The unprecedented urban growth especially in developing countries has laid immense pressure on wetlands, finally threatening their existence altogether. A long-term monitoring of wetland ecosystems is the basis of planning conservation measures for a sustainable development. Deepor Beel, a Ramsar wetland and major storm water basin of the River Brahmaputra in the northeastern region of India, needs particular attention due to its constant degradation over the past decades. A rule-based classification algorithm was developed using Landsat (2011)-derived indices, namely Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalised Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Normalised Difference Pond Index (NDPI), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and field data as ancillary information. Field data, ALOS AVNIR and Google Earth images were used for accuracy assessment. A fuzzy accuracy assessment of the classified data sets showed an overall accuracy of 82 % for MAX criteria and 90 % for RIGHT criteria. The rules were used to classify major wetland cover types during low water season (January) in 1989, 2001 and 2012. The statistical analysis of the classified wetland showed heavy manifestation in aquatic vegetation and other features indicating severe eutrophication over the past 23 years. This degradation was closely related to major contributing anthropogenic factors, such as a railway line construction, growing croplands, waste disposal and illegal human settlements in the wetland catchment. In addition, the landscape development index (LDI) indicated a rapid increase in the impact of the surrounding land use on the wetland from 1989 to 2012. The techniques and results from this study may prove useful for top-down landscape analyses of this and other freshwater wetlands.

Remotely sensed data with very high spatial resolution are currently used to study vegetation, but most satellite sensors are limited to four spectral bands, which is insufficient to identify some natural vegetation formations. The study objectives are to discriminate natural vegetation and identify natural vegetation formations using a Worldview-2 satellite image. The classification of the Worldview-2 image and ancillary thematic data was performed using a hybrid pixel-based and object-oriented approach. A hierarchical scheme using three levels was implemented, from land cover at a field scale to vegetation formation. This method was applied on a 48 km(2) site located on the French Atlantic coast which includes a classified NATURA 2000 dune and marsh system. The classification accuracy was very high, the Kappa index varying between 0.90 and 0.74 at land cover and vegetation formation levels respectively. These results show that Wordlview-2 images are suitable to identify natural vegetation. Vegetation maps derived from Worldview-2 images are more detailed than existing, ones. They provide a useful medium for environmental management of vulnerable areas. The approach used to map natural vegetation is reproducible for a wider application by environmental managers.

J	Hou, W; Walz, U				Hou, Wei; Walz, Ulrich			Extraction of small biotopes and ecotones from multi-temporal RapidEye data and a high-resolution normalized digital surface model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The conservation of habitats and habitat complexes in diverse landscapes is increasingly recognized as a crucial factor in sustaining biodiversity and ecosystems. For the successful management of landscapes, habitat monitoring is necessary, but often small biotopes, e.g. scattered trees, copses, tree rows, hedges, and the transition zones between ecosystems, are ignored. This is important as such small biotopes are recognized as keystone elements in landscape structure for habitat networks. Furthermore, the transition zones between different habitats, often called ecotones, are dynamic and play several functional roles in landscape ecology. This article presents an approach for the extraction of small biotopes and ecotones combining object-based and pixel-based image analysis. Both high-resolution digital elevation data from airborne laser scanning and multi-temporal RapidEye remote-sensing data were used to automatically detect landscape elements and landscape patterns. First, multi-temporal RapidEye images were used to classify the main land-use classes using object-based image analysis. In the second step, a high-resolution digital surface model was integrated with the main classes, and small biotopes and ecotones were delineated by means of pixel-based image analysis. Classification accuracy for main land-use classes is above 92%, and a visual assessment using aerial image and onsite investigation show that the identification results for small biotopes well match reality. The results show the effectiveness of the classification strategy developed and the potential for incorporating the detailed surface mapping in heterogeneous vegetated areas.

Land cover classifications, extracted in a timely and area-extensive manner through remote sensing data, can be employed to derive habitat maps, through the use of domain expert knowledge and ancillary information. However, complete information to fully discriminate habitat classes is rarely available, while expert knowledge may suffer from uncertainty and inaccuracies. In this study, a rule-based classification methodology for habitat mapping through the use of a pre-existing land cover map and remote sensing data is proposed to deal with uncertainty, missing information, noise afflicted data and inaccurate rule thresholds. The use of the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence is introduced in land cover to habitat mapping, in combination with fuzzy logic. The framework is able to handle lack of information, by considering composite classes, when necessary data for the discrimination of the constituting single classes is missing, and deal with uncertainty expressed in domain expert knowledge. In addition, a number of fuzzification schemes are proposed to be incorporated in the methodology in order to increase its performance and robustness towards noise afflicted data or inaccurate rule thresholds. Comparison with reference data reveals the improved performance of the methodology and the efficient handling of uncertainty in expert rules. The further scope is to provide a robust methodology readily transferable and applicable to similar sites in different geographic regions and environments. Although developed for habitat mapping, the proposed rule-based methodology is flexible and generic and may be well extended and applied in various classification tasks, aiming at handling uncertainty, missing information and inaccuracies in data or expert rules.

Ground-based surveys are both time consuming and labour intensive. Remote-sensing technology can reduce these costs. Here, we used high-spatial-resolution aerial photographs (0.5-1.0 cm per pixel) taken from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to survey fallen trees in a deciduous broadleaved forest in eastern Japan. In nine sub-plots we found a total of 44 fallen trees by ground survey. From the aerial photographs, we identified 80% to 90% of fallen trees that were >30 cm in diameter or >10 m in length, but missed many that were narrower or shorter. This failure may be due to the similarity of fallen trees to trunks and branches of standing trees or masking by standing trees. Views of the same point from different angles may improve the detection rate because they would provide more opportunity to detect fallen trees hidden by standing trees. Our results suggest that UAV surveys will make it possible to monitor the spatial and temporal variations in forest structure and function at lower cost.

Remote sensing offers a rapid and efficient means of data acquisition of ecosystems in time and space. The present study was undertaken to identify changes in the Harike wetland, a Ramsar site in the state of Punjab, India; and identify causal factors, as well as vulnerable areas threatened from the land cover changes. Unsupervised classification and post-classification change detection techniques were applied to Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data of 16-10-1989, 22-10-2000 and 26-10-2010. Images were classified into five land cover classes (1) Waterbody, (2) Wetland I, (3) Wetland II, (4) Barren land and (5) Agricultural land. Land cover change is characterized mainly by a decrease in the wetland area, as indicated by decrease in wetland vegetation and an increase in non-wetland areas, characterized by increasing agricultural and barren land areas. Overall, the wetland shrunk by 13% from 1989 to 2010, with the north-eastern side experiencing maximum shrinkage. The wetland needs immediate reclamation to check it from further shrinkage so as to save its biodiversity.

J	Giri, C; Long, J				Giri, Chandra; Long, Jordan			Land Cover Characterization and Mapping of South America for the Year 2010 Using Landsat 30 m Satellite Data	REMOTE SENSING												Detailed and accurate land cover and land cover change information is needed for South America because the continent is in constant flux, experiencing some of the highest rates of land cover change and forest loss in the world. The land cover data available for the entire continent are too coarse ( 250 m to 1 km) for resource managers, government and non-government organizations, and Earth scientists to develop conservation strategies, formulate resource management options, and monitor land cover dynamics. We used Landsat 30 m satellite data of 2010 and prepared the land cover database of South America using state-of-the-science remote sensing techniques. We produced regionally consistent and locally relevant land cover information by processing a large volume of data covering the entire continent. Our analysis revealed that in 2010, 50% of South America was covered by forests, 2.5% was covered by water, and 0.02% was covered by snow and ice. The percent forest area of South America varies from 9.5% in Uruguay to 96.5% in French Guiana. We used very high resolution (<5 m) satellite data to validate the land cover product. The overall accuracy of the 2010 South American 30-m land cover map is 89% with a Kappa coefficient of 79%. Accuracy of barren areas needs to improve possibly using multi-temporal Landsat data. An update of land cover and change database of South America with additional land cover classes is needed. The results from this study are useful for developing resource management strategies, formulating biodiversity conservation strategies, and regular land cover monitoring and forecasting.																	2072-4292					OCT	2014	6	10					9494	9510		10.3390/rs6109494								WOS:000344458000017

Serra Tombador Natural Reserve (STNR) is the largest private reserve located in Goias State, and the fourth largest in the Cerrado biome. The present study aimed to map the burnt areas and to describe the spatial patterns of fire recurrence and its interactions with the classes of land-cover that occurred in STNR and its surroundings in the period between 2001 and 2010. Several Landsat TM images acquired around the months of July, August and September, coinciding with the region's dry season when fire events intensify, were employed to monitor burnt areas. Fire scars were mapped using the supervised Mahalanobis-distance classifier and further refined using expert visual interpretation. Burnt area patterns were described by spatial landscape metrics. The effects of fire on landscape structure were obtained by comparing results among different land-cover classes, and results summarized in terms of fire history and frequencies. During the years covered by the study, 69% of the areas analyzed had fire events. The year with the largest burnt area was 2004, followed by 2001, 2007 and 2010. Thus, the largest fire events occurred in a 3-year cycle, which is compatible with other areas of the Brazilian savanna. The regions with higher annual probabilities of fire recurrence occur in the buffer zone around the park. The year 2004 also had the highest number of burnt area patches (831). In contrast, the burnt area in 2007 showed the most extensive fires with low number of patches (82). The physiognomies that suffered most fires were the native savanna formations. The study also identified areas where fires are frequently recurrent, highlighting priority areas requiring special attention. Thus, the methodology adopted in this study assists in monitoring and recovery of areas affected by fire over time.

This study developed a methodology for regional estimates of potential floodwater retention under floodplain inundation from ecologically significant flood return periods by coupling remote sensing and geographic information system technologies with spatial hydrological modelling. The Macquarie Marshes in Australia were selected as the case study area. Time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer 8-day composite imagery were related to peak flows (Mlday(-1)) of the 1-in-10 return period. Inundation extent in corresponding images was detected using the modified normalised difference water index (mNDWI). The potential maximum soil water retention was derived using a spatial hydrological modelling approach, which is driven by the Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS CN) method. Soil and land cover data were collected and intersected to determine spatial distribution of CN using ArcGIS. The CN-based retention capacity map was then integrated with an inundation extent map to delineate the spatial pattern of retention under inundation. The results have ecological implications in relation to the response of broad eco-types in wetlands. This study has proved that the integration of remote sensing, geographic information system and spatial hydrologic modelling can be used to provide essential information as inputs to the management of environmental flows in terms of sustaining ecosystem function, biodiversity and habitat suitability.

Satellite image based quantification of invasion and patch dynamics of mesquite (Prosopis juliflora) in Great Ram) of Kachchh, Kachchh Biosphere Reserve, Gujarat, India	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												The invasion of alien species is a significant threat to global biodiversity and the top driver of climate change. The present study was conducted in the Great Rann of Kachchh, part of Kachchh Biosphere Reserve, Gujarat, India, which has been severely affected by invasion of Prosopis juliflora. The invasive weed infestation has been identified using multi-temporal remote sensing datasets of 1977, 1990, 1999, 2005 and 2011. Spatial analyses of the transition matrix, extent of invasive colonies, patchiness, coalescence and rate of spread were carried out. During the study period of three and half decades, almost 295 km(2) of the natural land cover was converted into Prosopis cover. This study has shown an increment of 42.9% of area under Prosopis cover in the Great Rann of Kachchh, part of the Kachchh Biosphere Reserve during 1977 to 2011. Spatial analysis indicates high occupancy of Prosopis cover with most of the invasion (95.9%) occurring in the grasslands and only 4.1% in other land cover types. The process of Prosopis invasion shows high patch initiation, followed by coalescence, indicating aggressive colonization of species. The number of patches within an area of < 1 km(2) increased from 1977 to 2011, indicating the formation of new Prosopis habitats by replacing the grasslands. The largest patch of Prosopis cover increased from 144 km(2) in 1977 to 430 km(2) in 2011. The estimated mean patch size was 7.8 km(2) in 1977. The mean patch size was largest during 2011, i.e., 9 km(2). The annual spread rate for Prosopis has been estimated as 2.1% during 2005-2011. The present work has investigated the long term changes in Prosopis cover in the Great Rann of Kachchh, part of Kachchh Biosphere Reserve. The spatial database generated will be useful in preparing strategies for the management of Prosopis juliflora.

Yet, to date, the weather station-based WorldClim data set has been the primary source of temperature and precipitation information used in correlative species distribution models. WorldClim consists of grids interpolated from in situ station data recorded primarily from 1960 to 1990. Those data sets suffer from uneven geographic coverage, with many areas of Earth poorly represented. Here, we compare two remote sensing data sources for the purposes of biodiversity prediction: MERRA climate reanalysis data and AMSR-E, a pure remote sensing data source. We use these data to generate novel temperature-based bioclimatic information and to model the distributions of 20 species of vertebrates endemic to four regions of South America: Amazonia, the Atlantic Forest, the Cerrado and Patagonia. We compare the bioclimatic data sets derived from MERRA and AMSR-E information with in situ station data and contrast species distribution models based on these two products to models built with WorldClim. Surface temperature estimates provided by MERRA and AMSR-E showed warm temperature biases relative to the in situ data fields, but the reliability of these data sets varied in geographic space. Species distribution models derived from the MERRA data performed equally well (in Cerrado, Amazonia and Patagonia) or better (Atlantic Forest) than models built with the WorldClim data. In contrast, the performance of models constructed with the AMSR-E data was similar to (Amazonia, Atlantic Forest, Cerrado) or worse than (Patagonia) that of models built with WorldClim data. Whereas this initial comparison assessed only temperature fields, efforts to estimate precipitation from remote sensing information hold great promise; furthermore, other environmental data sets with higher spatial and temporal fidelity may improve upon these results. <doi origin="wiley" registered="yes">10.1111/(ISSN)2041-210X</doi																	2041-210X	2041-2096				OCT	2014	5	10					1033	1042		10.1111/2041-210X.12264								WOS:000344598300006

In India, which hosts a high density and diversity of CCAs, the need for more assessments of the ecological and socio-economic properties of these systems to guide conservation planning and policy has been emphasised in recent years. We inventoried the extant sacred grove network against official records of 407 groves across 70 villages in the Kodagu District of India's Western Ghats, and interviewed local communities about their management and conservation. We also evaluated recent trends in aboveground biomass of sacred groves using time-series satellite data from six time-points during the 2000-2010 period, and made comparisons to corresponding trends in nearby State-managed protected forests. Although most of the larger (>2 ha) groves officially listed were forested at present, over two-thirds of the smaller groves listed were either not forested or could not be located. Local communities attributed these declines to encroachment and illicit logging. Time-series satellite data revealed aboveground biomass declines of similar to 0.5% annually across the sacred grove network over the 2000-2010 period. In contrast, biomass increased during this period at the interiors and edges of State-managed forests in the landscape. Our results highlight that the conservation status of even well-protected CCAs can vary considerably over time, especially given the dynamism in socio-economic, cultural and ecological factors that govern their status. We argue that understanding and addressing this dynamism is crucial to the conservation of CCAs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Marcantonio, M; Rocchini, D; Ottaviani, G				Marcantonio, Matteo; Rocchini, Duccio; Ottaviani, Gianluigi			Impact of alien species on dune systems: a multifaceted approach	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												We applied a multifaceted approach, in terms of taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity, to study at fine scale how three plant communities occurring in a Mediterranean dune have been affected by the encroachment of alien species. We sampled 81 sites in a Site of Community Importance in Central Italy. Past and present land use/cover data have been derived using GIS and remote sensing tools. Information on plants phylogenesis and functional traits has been gathered from several databases. Ecological variables have been collected. GLMs in conjunction with an Information Based approach were used to model species composition, richness and phylogenetic diversity. Multivariate analysis has been used to study functional diversity. The results outlined how total species richness is related to recent land transformations and to a set of environmental factors. The analyses of functional and phylogenetic diversity support the idea that alien species significantly affect the functional and phylogenetic characteristics of the native plant communities. Habitat filtering seems to be predominant in not-invaded plots, whereas limiting similarity/niche differentiation is predominant in driving community assembly of invaded communities. The attained scenario depicts the spread of a reduced group of alien species phylogenetically and functionally well-differentiated, able to reduce the abundance of native species, not to exclude them though. Ultimately, the multifaceted approach assisted in understanding the community assembly of dune vegetation, and to discern the relative impact of alien species on native plant communities. Such approach represents a crucial step to achieve an efficient management of dune habitats, as useful tool to monitor and to effectively protect their biodiversity and functioning.

However, due to differing technical backgrounds and languages, cross-sectorial communication between this group and remote-sensing scientists is often hampered. Hardly any really comprehensive studies exist that are directed towards the conservation community and provide a solid overview of available Earth observation sensors and their different characteristics. This article presents, categorizes, and discusses what spaceborne remote sensing has contributed to the study of animal and vegetation biodiversity, which different types of variables of value for the biodiversity community can be derived from remote-sensing data, and which types of spaceborne sensor data are available for which time spans, and at which spatial and temporal resolution. We categorize all current and important past sensors with respect to application fields relevant for biologists, ecologists, and conservationists. Furthermore, sensor gaps and current challenges for Earth observation with respect to data access and provision are presented.

Overstorey and topographic effects on understories: Evidence for linkage from cork oak (Quercus suber) forests in Southern Spain	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The understorey is a critical feature of forest ecosystems, affecting nutrient cycling, biodiversity, regeneration capacity and wildfire regimes. Understanding the interaction of environmental and canopy controls on understorey development is therefore important for forest management. We use airborne lidar to elucidate this interaction in a forest of cork oak (Quercus suber) mixed with the deciduous oak (Quercus canariensis) on complex topographic relief in southern Spain. Solar radiation (controlled by aspect) and topographic position were highly influential in the differential distribution of the two dominant canopy trees, and exerted some control on their canopy density and height. There was a detectable effect of both canopy characteristics and solar radiation on the amount of understorey shrub cover, indicating direct and indirect controls of the environment on this stratum. In cork oak forest, understorey shrubbery increased towards valley bottoms, at lower levels of solar radiation and under shorter canopies. Our results are relevant to the management of these forest systems in the face of future change. They suggest that maturation and closure of these even-aged stands, coupled with climate warming, may lead to impoverishment of the shrub layer, reducing the build-up of fuel but also the biodiversity value of these systems.

Assessment and monitoring of deforestation from 1930 to 2011 in Andhra Pradesh, India using remote sensing and collateral data	CURRENT SCIENCE												Deforestation is one of the greatest threats to the world's forest ecosystems. The present study has utilized remote sensing and GIS techniques to quantify changes in forest cover and to map patterns of deforestation in Andhra Pradesh, India during 1930-2011. Andhra Pradesh has the second largest recorded forest area and ranks sixth with an actual forest cover amongst all Indian states. Forest cover maps from seven temporal datasets were prepared based on interpretation of multi-source topographical maps and satellite data. A representative set of landscape indices has been used to study landscape-level changes over time. The mapping for the period of 1930, 1960, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2011 indicates that the forest cover accounts for 85,392, 68,063, 46,940, 45,520, 44,409, 43,577 and 43,523 sq. km of the study area respectively. The study found the net forest cover declined as 49% of the total forest area during the last eight decades. The annual rate of estimated deforestation during 2005-2011 was 0.02%. Annual rate of deforestation of teak mixed forests was relatively higher (0.76) followed by mangroves (0.58%), semi-evergreen forests (0.43%), dry deciduous forests (0.21%), moist deciduous forests (0.09%) and dry evergreen forests (0.07%) during 1975-2011. The landscape analysis shows that the number of forest patches was 3,981 in 1930, 5,553 in 1960, 8,760 in 1975, 9,412 in 1985, 9,646 in 1995 and 10,597 in 2011, which indicates ongoing anthropogenic pressure on the forests. The mean patch size (sq. km) of forest decreased from 21.5 in 1930 to 12.3 in 1960 and reached 3.9 by 2011. The analysis of historical forest cover changes provides a basis for management effectiveness and future research on various components of biodiversity, climate change and accounting of carbon.																	0011-3891					SEP 10	2014	107	5					867	875										WOS:000342330900024

Distribution of environmental factors (climatic data and remote sensing of the earth surface) in the set of localities where each of the species was caught was taken as initial data for modeling. Species distribution ranges can be explained by distribution of environmental factors only in 30 cases out of 36. Seventeen of them can be explained by one or two environmental factors only. In 6 cases notable influence of historical factors or interspecific competition on present species distribution was found out. For these 6 species, modeling results make it possible to suggest hypotheses about reasons behind present distribution, which could not be advanced without modeling approach.

Estimating moose (Alces alces) occurrence and abundance from remotely derived environmental indicators	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Understanding species-habitat relationships is critical for wildlife management, providing information on habitat requirements, distribution, and potential land use impacts. In this paper, we examined occurrence and abundance-habitat relationships for moose (Alces alces), a species of economic and ecological importance, across its range in southern and central Ontario. We (1) evaluated and tested competing hypotheses for predicting moose distribution and abundance, and (2) examined the ability of remotely derived environmental indicators to characterize and extrapolate moose habitat throughout the Ontario moose range. To do so, remotely sensed environmental indicators - including vegetation productivity calculated using the Dynamic Habitat Index (DHI), land cover, topography, snow cover, and natural and anthropogenic disturbances - were used to estimate moose occurrence and abundance derived from moose aerial survey data. A 2-step Hurdle model was used to accommodate for zero-inflated data, separately modeling moose occurrence and abundance in a common model framework. Our results indicate that remotely sensed indicators are able to estimate moose occurrence with a moderate degree of certainty; however, these environmental indicators did not successfully estimate moose abundance. The approach outlined in this paper provides a useful framework for hypothesis testing of remote sensing environmental drivers at broad scales, as well as for estimating moose occurrence at the regional level.

Airborne laser scanning data is available for large areas with high resolution and supports automatic processing, therefore, it is well suited for habitat mapping. Lowland hay meadows are widespread habitat types in European grasslands, and also have one of the highest species richness. The objective of this study was to test the applicability of airborne laser scanning for vegetation mapping of different grasslands, including the Natura 2000 habitat type lowland hay meadows. Full waveform leaf-on and leaf-off point clouds were collected from a Natura 2000 site in Sopron, Hungary, covering several grasslands. The LIDAR data were processed to a set of rasters representing point attributes including reflectance, echo width, vegetation height, canopy openness, and surface roughness measures, and these were fused to a multi-band pseudo-image. Random forest machine learning was used for classifying this dataset. Habitat type, dominant plant species and other features of interest were noted in a set of 140 field plots. Two sets of categories were used: five classes focusing on meadow identification and the location of lowland hay meadows, and 10 classes, including eight different grassland vegetation categories. For five classes, an overall accuracy of 75% was reached, for 10 classes, this was 68%. The method delivers unprecedented fine resolution vegetation maps for management and ecological research. We conclude that high-resolution full-waveform LIDAR data can be used to detect grassland vegetation classes relevant for Natura 2000.

In this study, we evaluate best practices for generating gridded, one-kilometer resolution, daily maximum air temperature surfaces in a regional context, the state of Oregon, USA. Covariates used in the interpolation include remote sensing derived elevation, aspect, canopy height, percent forest cover and MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST). Because of missing values, we aggregated daily LST values as long term (2000-2010) monthly climatologies to leverage its spatial detail in the interpolation. We predicted temperature with three methods-Universal Kriging, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Generalized Additive Models (GAM)-and assessed predictions using meteorological stations over 365 days in 2010. We find that GAM is least sensitive to overtraining (overfitting) and results in lowest errors in term of distance to closest training stations. Mean elevation, LST, and distance to ocean are flagged most frequently as significant covariates among all daily predictions. Results indicate that GAM with latitude, longitude and elevation is the top model but that LST has potential in providing additional fine-grained spatial structure related to land cover effects. The study also highlights the need for more rigorous methods and data to evaluate the spatial structure and fine grained accuracy of predicted surfaces.

Models predict a significant reduction in reef spatial extension together with a decline in biodiversity in the relatively near future. In this context, monitoring programs to detect changes in reef ecosystems are essential. In recent years, coral reef mapping using remote sensing data has benefited from instruments with better resolution and computational advances in storage and processing capabilities. However, the water column represents an additional complexity when extracting information from submerged substrates by remote sensing that demands a correction of its effect. In this article, the basic concepts of bottom substrate remote sensing and water column interference are presented. A compendium of methodologies developed to reduce water column effects in coral ecosystems studied by remote sensing that include their salient features, advantages and drawbacks is provided. Finally, algorithms to retrieve the bottom reflectance are applied to simulated data and actual remote sensing imagery and their performance is compared. The available methods are not able to completely eliminate the water column effect, but they can minimize its influence. Choosing the best method depends on the marine environment, available input data and desired outcome or scientific application.																	1424-8220					SEP	2014	14	9					16881	16931		10.3390/s140916881								WOS:000343106600070	25215941					
J	Bermeo, A; Couturier, S; Pizana, MG				Bermeo, Adriana; Couturier, Stephane; Galeana Pizana, Mauricio			Conservation of traditional smallholder cultivation systems in indigenous territories: Mapping land availability for milpa cultivation in the Huasteca Poblana, Mexico	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												The ancient milpa agricultural system has been regarded as a resilient agro-biodiverse practice within the context of recent global land-use changes. The conservation of the traditional smallholder cultivation system (TSCS) has been the focus of an extended civil network that is based on an alliance between agro-ecological science and indigenous knowledge. Collaborative rural planning has recently been supported in cartographic representations of indigenous territories in Mexico at the intercommunity scale. However, spatial assessments of multicropping milpa practice are largely lacking, and reduced access to land by smallholders is reported to be one of the key constraints on this practice. This research employs a method for the intercommunity-scale mapping of land availability for milpa cultivation (LAMC). This method combines information on land use derived from remote sensing data with information on agrarian structures deduced from census data and it takes into account the concentration of land ownership associated with capital-intensive coffee and pasture-based production systems. We applied this method to explore trends in LAMC between 1970 and 2010 in a rural subdistrict of the State of Puebla, which is an indigenous, densely populated, and highly agro-biodiverse area of Mexico. The results were successfully assessed against conventional analysis based on an agricultural census. The method is replicable to any rural setting, provides an alternative approach to delineating peasant indigenous territories of Mexico and contributes to baseline cartography for the global conservation of TSCS.

It is a major biodiversity hot spot of our planet. At the same time the delta is home to Africa's largest oil reserves and responsible for a skyrocketing GDP development of Nigeria since the 1970s. Nigeria ranks 13th among all oil producing countries, but oil exploitation also brought with it severe environmental degradation, leading to the delta's nomination for a place on the top 10 list of the "World's Worst Polluted Places Report" in 2013. Despite the outstanding importance of the region for Nigeria, Africa, and the international community most studies published focus mainly on topics of geology, geochemistry, and environmental toxicology. Studies employing earth observation satellite data to assess Niger Delta dynamics are rare. This paper aims at contributing to an overview of Niger Delta geography and environmental threats and challenges, as well as to an understanding of Niger Delta land surface dynamics from 1986 to 2013. Covering the complete delta, we present results of land cover change analyses, results of an assessment of coastline dynamics, as well as the manifestation of oil exploitation activity as expressed via oil access canal dredging and gas flaring, monitored within the 27 year time span investigated.

Spatial conservation planning framework for assessing conservation opportunities in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Historic rates of habitat change and growing exploitation of natural resources threaten avian biodiversity in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a global biodiversity hotspot. We implemented a twostage framework for conservation planning in the Atlantic Forest. First, we used ecological niche modeling to predict the distributions of 23 endemic bird species using 19 climatic metrics and 12 spectral and radar remote sensing metrics. Second, we utilized the principle of complementarity to prioritize new sites to augment the Atlantic Forest's existing reserves. The best predictors of bird distributions were precipitation metrics (the seasonality of rainfall) and radar remote sensing metrics (QSCAT). The existing protected areas do not include 10% of the habitat of each of the 23 endemic species. We propose a more economical set of protected areas by reducing the extent to which new sites duplicate the biodiversity content of existing protected areas. There is a high concordance between the proposed conservation areas that we designed using computerized algorithms and Important Bird Areas prioritized by BirdLife International. Insofar as deforestation in the Atlantic Forest is similar to land conversion in other biodiversity hotspots, our methodology is applicable to conservation efforts elsewhere in the world.

Pen-urbanization, a specific form of urbanization characterized by rapid and fragmented growth, is also increasing, especially in developing countries. By 2030, it is anticipated that pen-urban areas in East Asia will expand by 200 million people, or 40% of total projected urban population growth, creating in these areas one of the largest and most significant land cover changes in the region. Characterizing and understanding the pen-urbanization process is critical, as these transition zones have a wide range of impacts across multiple scales, including local effects on farmer livelihoods, regional impacts to economic development, fragmented governance, as well as detrimental environmental impacts such as increased air and groundwater pollution, loss of native vegetation, and decreases in biodiversity. Yet the dynamic and piecemeal nature of pen-urbanization presents challenges for monitoring this unique process. This research combines commune-level Vietnamese census information, dense time stacks of Landsat satellite data (1990-2012), and several spatial measures to quantify urbanization and pen-urbanization in the greater Ho Chi Minh City metropolitan area from 1990 to 2012. The results indicate that 660.2 km(2) of cropland was converted to urban uses (a near quintupling of urban land), while 3.5 million persons moved into the region, bringing the total population to nearly 12 million by 2012. The analysis also highlights the rapid, unplanned nature of pen-urban development: approximately one-third of new urban expansion occurs in areas >40 km from the core, with nearly 50% of population expansion occurring in communes classified as pen-urban. This pattern of growth is likely linked to policies meant to spur foreign investment, and we expect that these regions will continue to attract much, if not most, of the foreign direct investment (FDI) flowing to the region, since most large manufacturing enterprises now locate in pen-urban areas.

Mapping tropical forest canopy diversity using high-fidelity imaging spectroscopy	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												There is a growing need for operational biodiversity mapping methods to quantify and to assess the impact of climate change, habitat alteration, and human activity on ecosystem composition and function. Here, we present an original method for the estimation of alpha- and beta-diversity of tropical forests based on high-fidelity imaging spectroscopy. We acquired imagery over high-diversity Amazonian tropical forest landscapes in Peru with the Carnegie Airborne Observatory and developed an unsupervised method to estimate the Shannon index (H') and variations in species composition using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (BC) and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). An extensive field plot network was used for the validation of remotely sensed alpha- and beta-diversity. Airborne maps of H' were highly correlated with field alpha-diversity estimates (r = 0.86), and BC was estimated with demonstrable accuracy (r = 0.61-0.76). Our findings are the first direct and spatially explicit remotely sensed estimates of alpha- and beta-diversity of humid tropical forests, paving the way for new applications using airborne and space-based imaging spectroscopy.

Given their widespread loss and increased recognition, remarkably little is known about restoration techniques. In this study, we examine the effects of gabions (wire baskets filled with rocks used as dams) on vegetation in the Cienega San Bernardino, in the Arizona, Sonora portion of the US-Mexico border, using a remote-sensing analysis coupled with field data. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), used here as a proxy for plant biomass, is compared at gabion and control sites over a 27-year period during the driest months (May/June). Over this period, green-up occurred at most sites where there were gabions and at a few of the control sites where gabions had not been constructed. When we statistically controlled for differences among sites in source area, stream order, elevation, and interannual winter rainfall, as well as comparisons of before and after the initiation of gabion construction, vegetation increased around gabions yet did not change (or decreased) where there were no gabions. We found that NDVI does not vary with precipitation inputs prior to construction of gabions but demonstrates a strong response to precipitation after the gabions are built. Field data describing plant cover, species richness, and species composition document increases from 2000 to 2012 and corroborate reestablished biomass at gabions. Our findings validate that gabions can be used to restore riparian vegetation and potentially ameliorate drought conditions in a desert cienega. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Tuanmu, MN; Jetz, W				Tuanmu, Mao-Ning; Jetz, Walter			A global 1-km consensus land-cover product for biodiversity and ecosystem modelling	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim For many applications in biodiversity and ecology, existing remote sensing-derived land-cover products have limitations due to among-product inconsistency and their typically non-continuous nature. Here we aim to help address these shortcomings by generating a 1-km resolution global product that provides scale-integrated and accuracy-weighted consensus land-cover information on an approximately continuous scale. Location Global. Methods Using a generalized classification scheme and an accuracy-based integration approach, we integrated four global land-cover products. We evaluated the performance of this product compared with inputs for estimating subpixel 30-m resolution land cover. We also compared the accuracy of deductive and inductive species distribution models built with the different products for modelling the continental distributions of six avian habitat specialists. Results Our product offers accuracy-weighted consensus information on the prevalence of 12 land-cover classes within every nominal 1-km pixel across the globe (except for Antarctica). Compared with the four base products, it better captures the land-cover information contained in the fine-grain validation data for all classes combined and for most individual classes. It also has the highest sensitivity and overall accuracy for detecting the presence of every fine-grain land-cover class. Both deductive and inductive models built with the consensus dataset have the highest or second highest accuracy for modelling bird species distributions. Main conclusions Our consensus product integrates the four base products and successfully maximizes accuracy and reduces errors of omission. Specifically, the consensus product reduces limitations caused by misclassifications, false absence rates and the categorical format of existing land-cover products. Consequently, it surpasses single base products in the ability to capture subpixel land-cover information and the utility for modelling species distributions. Both the presented methodology and the consensus product have multiple applications in biodiversity research and for understanding and modelling of global terrestrial ecosystems.																	1466-822X	1466-8238				SEP	2014	23	9					1031	1045		10.1111/geb.12182								WOS:000340426000008

Human health is likely to be affected by changes occurring across multiple geographic and time scales. Impacts range from increasing transmissibility and the range of vectorborne diseases, such as malaria and yellow fever, to undermining nutrition through deleterious impacts on food production and concomitant increases in food prices. This paper uses case studies to describe methods that make use of satellite remote sensing and Demographic and Health Survey data to better understand individual-level human health and nutrition outcomes. By bringing these diverse datasets together, the connection between environmental change and human health outcomes can be described through new research and analysis.

Collateral damage: impacts of ethno-civil strife on biodiversity and natural resource use near Indian nature reserves	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Civil conflicts often affect the control of natural resources, altering their access and use. Using a combination of questionnaires, remote sensing, and a review of articles in the popular print media, we investigated the impact of a protracted armed conflict on forest loss, livelihoods, and forest use near two globally important tiger reserves in northeastern India. Over a 23 year period, we found evidence of large-scale forest loss in the vicinity of Nameri and Pakke Tiger Reserves. Nearly all (99 %) interviewees opined that the ethno-civil strife was to blame for declining forest cover. Most interviewees identified 1990 as the year of onset of strife-mediated deforestation. This is partially supported by a review of print-media articles that reported conflict, violence, displacement, and the onset of large-scale migration in the previous year. According to respondents, ethno-civil strife has radically altered access to, and use of forests, by resident communities (causing economic hardship, increased costs, and reduced availability of essential timber products), and has also accelerated forest loss and increased poaching. We conclude that forests and wildlife in these protected areas are at immediate risk from ethno-civil strife. Urgent interventions are needed to reduce the environmental and societal impacts of civil strife in this biologically crucial region of India.

IRSeL-An approach to enhance continuity and accuracy of remotely sensed land cover data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Land cover data gives the opportunity to study interactions between land cover status and environmental issues such as hydrologic processes, soil properties, or biodiversity. Land cover data often are based on classification of remote sensing data that seldom provides the requisite accuracy, spatial availability and temporal observational frequency for environmental studies. Thus, there is a high demand for accurate and spatio-temporal complete time series of land cover. In the past considerable research was undertaken to increase land cover classification accuracy, while less effort was spent on interpolation techniques. The purpose of this article is to present a space-time interpolation and revision approach for remotely sensed land cover data. The approach leverages special properties known for agricultural areas such as crop rotations or temporally static land cover classes. The newly developed IRSeL-tool (Interpolation and improvement of Remotely Sensed Land cover) corrects classification errors and interpolates missing land cover pixels. The easy-to-use tool solely requires an initial land cover data set. The IRSeL specific interpolation and revision technique, the data input requirements and data output structure are described in detail. A case study in an area around the city of Neumunster in Northern Germany from 2006 to 2012 was performed for IRSeL validation with initial land cover data sets (Landsat TM image classifications) for the years 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010 and 2011. The results of the case study showed that IRSeL performs well; including years with no classification data overall accuracy values for IRSeL interpolated pixels range from 0.63 to 0.81. IRSeL application significantly increases the accuracy of the land cover data; overall accuracy values rise 0.08 in average resulting in overall accuracy values of at least 0.86. Considering estimated reliabilities, the IRSeL tool provides a temporally and spatially completed and revised land cover data set that allows drawing conclusions for land cover related studies.

B.; Jones, Joshua; Lucas, Richard M.; Gabriel, Cristina			Land Use and Land Cover Change Dynamics across the Brazilian Amazon: Insights from Extensive Time-Series Analysis of Remote Sensing Data	PLOS ONE												Throughout the Amazon region, the age of forests regenerating on previously deforested land is determined, in part, by the periods of active land use prior to abandonment and the frequency of reclearance of regrowth, both of which can be quantified by comparing time-series of Landsat sensor data. Using these time-series of near annual data from 1973-2011 for an area north of Manaus (in Amazonas state), from 1984-2010 for south of Santarem (Parastate) and 1984-2011 near Machadinho d'Oeste (Rondonia state), the changes in the area of primary forest, non-forest and secondary forest were documented from which the age of regenerating forests, periods of active land use and the frequency of forest reclearance were derived. At Manaus, and at the end of the time-series, over 50% of regenerating forests were older than 16 years, whilst at Santarem and Machadinho d'Oeste, 57% and 41% of forests respectively were aged 6-15 years, with the remainder being mostly younger forests. These differences were attributed to the time since deforestation commenced but also the greater frequencies of reclearance of forests at the latter two sites with short periods of use in the intervening periods. The majority of clearance for agriculture was also found outside of protected areas. The study suggested that a) the history of clearance and land use should be taken into account when protecting deforested land for the purpose of restoring both tree species diversity and biomass through natural regeneration and b) a greater proportion of the forested landscape should be placed under protection, including areas of regrowth.

Habitat loss and degradation, overexploitation, climate change and the spread of invasive species are drastically depleting the Earth's biological diversity, leading to detrimental impacts on ecosystem services and human well-being. 2. Our ability to monitor the state of biodiversity and the impacts of global environmental change on this natural capital is fundamental to designing effective adaptation and mitigation strategies for preventing further loss of biological diversity. This requires the scientific community to assess spatio-temporal changes in the distribution of abiotic conditions (e. g. temperature, rainfall) and in the distribution, structure, composition and functioning of ecosystems. 3. The potential for satellite remote sensing (SRS) to provide key data has been highlighted by many researchers, with SRS offering repeatable, standardized and verifiable information on long-term trends in biodiversity indicators. SRS permits one to address questions on scales inaccessible to ground-based methods alone, facilitating the development of an integrated approach to natural resource management, where biodiversity, pressures to biodiversity and consequences of management decisions can all be monitored. 4. Synthesis and applications. Here, we provide an interdisciplinary perspective on the prospects of satellite remote sensing (SRS) for ecological applications, reviewing established avenues and highlighting new research and technological developments that have a high potential to make a difference in environmental management. We also discuss current barriers to the ecological application of SRS-based approaches and identify possible ways to overcome some of these limitations.

We looked at both the local and national level needs of MRV. Our approach combines: (1) social research focusing on the enabling conditions for local participation in MRV; (2) governance analyses of existing MRV systems in forestry and health; and (3) remote sensing work comparing overlaps and gaps between satellite imagery and local assessments of forest changes.

Applications of airborne lidar for the assessment of animal species diversity	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												1. Habitat structure is important in explaining species diversity patterns for many animal groups. If we could map habitat structure over large spatial scales, we could use habitat structure-species diversity (HS-SD) relationships to model species diversity and inform conservation planning and management. Traditional approaches for measuring habitat structure cannot be applied over entire landscapes, but remote sensing tools are now able to overcome this limitation. Here, we explore the potential of airborne lidar for the assessment and monitoring of animal species diversity in terrestrial environments. 2. We review the habitat attributes commonly recorded in the study of HS-SD relationships and the spatial scale of their measurement, in papers published between 1960 and 2013. We also gather evidence for the use of lidar to make relevant measurements at similar scales. 3. Eight out of 15 attributes of habitat structure commonly used in published studies relate to the vertical dimension of habitat. The core strength of lidar is that it is a vertical profiler, and this technology can be used to derive estimates of all but one of these structural attributes. Lidar can also be used to improve the measurement of the four commonly used attributes focusing on the horizontal heterogeneity of habitat patches. The spatial grain and extent of HS-SD studies is usually within the operational capability of airborne lidar; when a vertical measure of habitat structure has been employed, this is true in 84% of published studies. The potential efficacy of lidar in this field of biodiversity studies is underlined by several published examples of lidar modelling of animal species diversity. 4. We conclude that lidar remote sensing is fit for the purpose of biodiversity assessment and monitoring through its ability to characterize habitat structure, a key driver of animal species diversity, over large spatial scales. We advocate wider application of lidar-based HS-SD indicators to help tackle the current biodiversity crisis. In combination with other remote sensing products, these indicators may support the implementation and monitoring of environmental legislation, inform gap analyses and the planning of management actions for protected areas and species, and drive greater synergy with forest-based climate change mitigation.																	2041-210X	2041-2096				AUG	2014	5	8					719	729		10.1111/2041-210X.12219								WOS:000340600400001

Based on maps generated by the National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity (CONABIO for its Spanish acronym), three land cover change indicators were estimated: net change, stability of location, and stability of residence. Analyses were made at national and regional (Northern Pacific, Central Pacific, Southern Pacific, Gulf of Mexico, and Yucatan Peninsula) scales, and for the 17 states presenting mangroves. At the national level during the studied period we observed a 10 % net loss of mangrove. At the state level, 13 states lost area, three gained area, and one showed no change in mangrove cover. According to the indicators of location stability and residence stability, the lowest values were recorded in four states within the Pacific Ocean coast (Jalisco, Colima, Guerrero, and Oaxaca), while the highest values corresponded to two states of the Gulf of Mexico (Tamaulipas and Tabasco). Many of the changes in mangrove cover we detected were attributed to crop and animal husbandry activities, and to anthropic infrastructure.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				AUG	2014	34	4					747	758		10.1007/s13157-014-0539-9								WOS:000340097600011

This study develops an urban isolation index (UII) to quantify the isolation effects of land-use conversion on key ecological areas (KEAs) and accounts for urban patch size, morphology, location, and quality loss. Based on the five remote sensing Landsat images taken between 1980 and 2005, UII is applied to analyze the spatio-temporal dynamics of the isolation effects caused by rapid urbanization in Shenzhen, China. The results showed that the habitat isolation constantly intensified during the urbanization process. We identified spatially explicit information of critical urban domains that exerted an interference effect on KEAs. There are considerable differences of isolation effects resulting from different urban growth types. Urban edge expansion caused the greatest habitat isolation in Shenzhen. The outlying and infilling urban patches contributed minor isolation effects to the KEAs. This paper furthers the understanding of the ecological effects of urbanization processes and provides a spatially explicit identification for ecological conservation and restoration in rapidly urbanized regions.

Threat evaluation for biodiversity conservation of forest ecosystems using geospatial techniques: A case study of Odisha, India	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Up-scaling the evaluation of threat status of biodiversity from species to ecosystem level has remained for long a research challenge in global conservation science. To meet this challenge, the present study makes an attempt toward actionable conservation prescription and assigning a threat category scheme for forest ecosystems. The scheme sets the quantitative criteria for evaluation of cumulative anthropogenic threats in grid cells, such as deforestation, degradation, fragmentation, forest fires and biological invasions. Adopting the convention of IUCN, five conservation status categories (i.e. Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable, Near Threatened, Least Concern) have been similarly adopted for the forest ecosystems facing these threats. The operational success of this scheme of threat categories at ecosystem level has been strengthened by remote sensing and field data generated for the forest ecosystems of Odisha, India. The threat category status of the forest ecosystems were identified by creating grids (5 km x 5 km) in GIS and assigned the degree of the threats for each grid. The database on deforestation was generated using topographical maps of 1935 and remote sensing data of 1975 and 2010. The degradation in forest ecosystems have been assessed based on the change in forest canopy closure, fragmentation pattern, forest fire distribution and impact of biological invasions. The analysis for conservation priority hotspots complements an assessment of the threatened ecosystems undergoing remarkable level of multiple threats. Areas under the danger of cumulative anthropogenic threats would have a higher priority. 5.8% grids of existing forest had included under the category of conservation priority hotspot-I, followed by 12.4% in conservation priority hotspot-II, and 12.5% in conservation priority hotspot-III. An integrated approach involving the cumulative anthropogenic threat indicators have been found to be the most appropriate tool to empirically evaluate the threat status of the forest ecosystems. Finally, identification of ecosystems especially those facing increasing extinction risks, as attempted in the present study, can help in devising an appropriate policy and management agenda for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.

Although wetlands are generally protected by law, growing human populations increasingly drain and clear them to provide agricultural land, especially in tropical Africa. Managing and conserving wetlands requires accurately monitoring their spatial and temporal extent, often using remote sensing, but distinguishing wetlands from other land covers can be difficult. Here, we report on a method to separate wetlands dominated by papyrus (Cyperus papyrus L.) from spectrally similar grasslands dominated by elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schumach.). We tested whether topographic, spectral, and temperature data improved land cover classification within and around Kibale National Park, a priority conservation area in densely populated western Uganda. Slope and reflectance in the mid-IR range best separated the combined papyrus/elephant grass pixels (average accuracy: 86%). Using a time series of satellite images, we quantified changes in six land covers across the landscape from 1984 to 2008 (papyrus, elephant grass, forest, mixed agriculture/bare soil/short grass, mixed tea/shrub, and water). We found stark differences in how land cover changed inside versus outside the park, with particularly sharp changes next to the park boundary. Inside the park, changes in land cover varied with location and management history: elephant grass areas decreased by 52% through forest regeneration but there was no net difference in papyrus areas. Outside the park, elephant grass and papyrus areas decreased by 61% and 39%, mostly converted to agriculture. Our method and findings are particularly relevant in light of social, biotic, and abiotic changes in western Uganda, as interactions between climate change, infectious disease, and changing human population demographics and distribution are predicted to intensify existing agricultural pressure on natural areas.

J	Wu, CF; Lin, YP; Chiang, LC; Huang, T				Wu, Chen-Fa; Lin, Yu-Pin; Chiang, Li-Chi; Huang, Tao			Assessing highway's impacts on landscape patterns and ecosystem services: A case study in Puli Township, Taiwan	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Highway construction facilitates urban growth in Taiwan. However, the long-term effects of transportation infrastructure are not well understood; these include land-use changes, changes in landscape patterns, and the alteration of ecosystem services. To assess the effects of different land-use scenarios under various agricultural and environmental conservation policy regimes, this study applies an integrated approach to analyze the effects of Highway 6 construction on Puli Township. Interviews with neighborhood leaders of Puli Township, along with remote sensing analysis, reveal that both biophysical and socioeconomic factors are the major forces driving land-use change. The effects of these land-use changes are varied. An example is the road-effect zone, which for Pull Township extends 400 m perpendicular to the length of the highway; however, due to differing spatial patterns it is highly asymmetric; indirect effects include the spatial restructuring of certain landscapes, which can drastically influence habitat dynamics. Land-use simulation results indicate that agricultural and environmental conservation policies have significant effects on projected land-use patterns in the southern part of Puli's downtown area and in areas along major roads. Specifically, highway construction and subsequent urbanization under various land-use policies result in varying degrees of isolation and fragmentation in the overall landscape pattern. A habitat quality assessment using the InVEST model indicates that the conservation of agricultural and forested lands improves habitat quality and preserves rare habitats. In summary, appropriate environmental policies will mediate both the direct and indirect impacts of Highway 6 on landscape patterns and ecosystem services in Pull Township. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Sheeren, D; Bonthoux, S; Balent, G				Sheeren, D.; Bonthoux, S.; Balent, G.			Modeling bird communities using unclassified remote sensing imagery: Effects of the spatial resolution and data period	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												In this paper we assess the capacity of satellite images to explain and predict bird community patterns in farm-wood landscapes in southwestern France. Our goal is to examine the effect of the images' acquisition date and spatial resolution on the models' performance. We also seek to assess whether unclassified images provide results comparable with classified data (i.e. land-cover map). To do that we constructed species richness models (generalized additive models) based on a sample of 573 counting points and on non-classified images made up of NDVI data and digital height model (DHM), making it possible to quantify the spatial and vertical heterogeneity of habitats. To assess the acquisition date effect, we compared the performance of NDVI data acquired on four different dates (February 4th, June 24th, August 19th and October 18th, 2009) by the same sensor (SPOT-5). To assess the spatial resolution effect, we compared five NDVI images acquired over an identical period (September 2010) but by different sensors (WorldView-2, SPOT-5, SPOT-4, Landsat, MODIS) as well as two DHMs obtained from LiDAR (1 m) and radar (5 m) data. Our results show that for a constant spatial resolution (10 m) it is the NDVI data acquired at the beginning of the autumn that provide the best performance. These data better reveal the landscape requirements of birds during the breeding period. For a given period (September 2010), the higher resolution spatial data (2 m) are the highest performing. However, in view of the cost of WorldView images, we suggest that 10 m data (SPOT-5) provide a good trade-off for studying the distribution of bird communities. For the height data (DHM), the effect of the spatial resolution is not significant. The differences of performance between the spatial resolutions of NDVI data are not as great as those between the data acquisition periods. The performance of unclassified data (NDVI or DHM) is also comparable with that of land-cover maps. This suggests on the one hand that the choice of the NDVI image date is more important than that of the spatial resolution and on the other hand that the NDVI or OHM data are good alternatives to classified data when constructing a bird-habitat predictive model.

Assessing these communities implies studying species' richness and composition, and determining a state variable of species abundance in order to infer changes in species distribution and habitat associations. The Tropical Ecology, Assessment and Monitoring (TEAM) network fills a chronic gap in standardized data collection by implementing a systematic monitoring framework of biodiversity, including mammal communities, across several sites. In this study, we used TEAM camera trap data collected in the Udzungwa Mountains of Tanzania, an area of exceptional importance for mammal diversity, to propose an example of a baseline assessment of species' occupancy. We used 60 camera trap locations and cumulated 1,818 camera days in 2009. Sampling yielded 10,647 images of 26 species of mammals. We estimated that a minimum of 32 species are in fact present, matching available knowledge from other sources. Estimated species richness at camera sites did not vary with a suite of habitat covariates derived from remote sensing, however the detection probability varied with functional guilds, with herbivores being more detectable than other guilds. Species-specific occupancy modelling revealed novel ecological knowledge for the 11 most detected species, highlighting patterns such as 'montane forest dwellers', e.g. the endemic Sanje mangabey (Cercocebus sanjei), and 'lowland forest dwellers', e.g. suni antelope (Neotragus moschatus). Our results show that the analysis of camera trap data with account for imperfect detection can provide a solid ecological assessment of mammal communities that can be systematically replicated across sites.																	1932-6203					JUL 23	2014	9	7							e103300	10.1371/journal.pone.0103300								WOS:000339614100105	25054806

Remotely sensed data are frequently employed for monitoring vegetation and for estimating herbivore diversity. Their use for predicting predator arthropod species abundance and richness has also been investigated with success for ants and beetles in forests using normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and for beetles in mountain forests using light detection and ranging data. 2. We investigated whether vegetation indices, derived from multispectral SPOT imagery could predict abundance and species richness of ground active spiders and ground beetles in a new ecological context, the floodplain meadows of the Loire River in Western Europe. Using pitfall traps, we collected carabids and spiders in the field. 3. Maximum vegetation height, litter-depth and plant species richness best explained species assemblages of both groups (multivariate analyses). NDVI and enhanced vegetation index (EVI 2) were strongly related to activity-density and species richness for ground beetles only, EVI 2 being the best surrogate. Relationships between vegetation indices and spider assemblage patterns were either non-significant or weak. 4. We demonstrated that EVI 2 is a good surrogate of the abundance and richness of carabid species in a temperate floodplain, and has potential as a low cost method for mapping arthropod assemblages at large spatial scales. 5. Our approach provides a tool which contributes to biodiversity assessment at large spatial scales. It can also contribute to the prioritisation of conservation areas and early change detection, as carabids are keystone indicators.

Thus, it is worthwhile to use remote sensing methods to survey endangered ecosystems, as the studied species will behave naturally while undisturbed. The latest passive optical remote sensing solutions permit surveys from long distances. State-of-the-art highly sensitive sensor systems allow high spatial resolution image acquisition at high altitudes and at high flying speeds, even in low-visibility conditions. As the aerial imagery captured by an airplane covers the entire study area, all the animals present in that area can be recorded. A population assessment is conducted by visual interpretations of an ortho image map. The basic objective of this study is to determine whether small-and medium-sized bird species are recognizable in the ortho images by using high spatial resolution aerial cameras. The spatial resolution needed for identifying the bird species in the ortho image map was studied. The survey was adjusted to determine the number of birds in a colony at a given time.																	1424-8220					JUL	2014	14	7					12828	12846		10.3390/s140712828								WOS:000340035700087	25046012

European mountain landscapes that include numerous protected areas provide a unique opportunity to weigh the long-term influences of land-use practices and climate on forest-grassland ecotone dynamics. Aerial photographs from four dates (1948, 1978, 1993, and 2009) were used to quantify the extent of forest and grassland cover at 5-m resolution across a 150-km(2) area in a protected area of the southwestern French Alps. The study area included a grazed zone and a nongrazed zone that was abandoned during the 1970s. We estimated time series of a forestation index (FI) and analyzed the effects of elevation and grazing on FI using a hierarchical linear mixed effect model. Forest extent (composed primarily of mountain pine, Pinus uncinata) expanded from 50.6 km(2) in 1948 to 85.5 km(2) in 2009, i.e., a 23% increase in relative cover at the expense of grassland communities. Over the sixty-year period, the treeline rose by 118 m, from 1564 to 1682 m. Rapid forest expansion within the nongrazed zone followed the cessation of logging activities and was likely accelerated by climate warming during the 1980s. Within the grazed zone, the maintained presence of sheep did not fully counteract mountain pine expansion and led to highly contrasting rates of land-cover change based on the location of shepherds' cabins and water sources. Projections of FI for 2030 showed remnant patches of intensively used grasslands interspersed in a densely forested matrix. Our analysis of mountain land-cover dynamics provided strong evidence for forest encroachment into grassland habitat despite consistent grazing pressure. This pattern may be attributed to the disappearance of traditional land-use practices such as shrub burning and removal. Our findings prompt land managers to reconsider their initial conservation priority (i.e., the protection of a renowned mountain pine forest) and to implement proactive management strategies in order to preserve landscape heterogeneity and biological diversity. Projecting historical trends in the forest-grassland ecotone to 2030 provides stakeholders with a policy relevant tool for near-term land management.

Variability in mangrove change estimates and implications for the assessment of ecosystem service provision	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim To quantify the variability in estimates of change in mangrove area for key countries throughout the tropics, and to highlight potential implications for the assessment of global mangrove ecology, function and conservation. Location Pan-tropical, covering 15 countries, and accounting for c. 67% of global mangrove area. Methods We review 314 national mangrove area estimates (authoritative statements with defined time periods) from various sources. Linear regression models of mangrove area over time were applied to various data point combinations, defined by data source. These included various FAO resources, as well as academic and government statistics and remote sensing studies. Results National trends of change in mangrove area exhibited high variability depending on which data points were modelled. Many countries showed high variability in deforestation rate when the results of all models were combined, e.g. Indonesia had an average deforestation rate of 331.65 (+/- 222.26) km2 yr-1, Nigeria lost 92.09 (+/- 188.95) km2 yr-1 and Cuba lost 34.82 (+/- 142.17) km2 yr-1. The standard deviations were large due to high variability in national estimates, and hence the number of contradictory trends that could be extracted. Conflicting trends of long-term mangrove loss and gain could be derived for eight of the 15 countries analysed, including Indonesia, Brazil and the Philippines. Main conclusions The great variability in trends of mangrove extent suggests that estimates of ecosystem functional loss, biodiversity threat assessments and science-based conservation policies will be hampered by low confidence in mangrove area dynamics. Variable and inaccurate baseline data feed into various estimates of biodiversity and ecosystem functional loss, such as IUCN Red List assessments and estimates of global carbon emissions from mangrove deforestation. We also require robust information to inform conservation actions and policies hoping to reduce functional loss. Variability has important implications for all ecosystems where statistics are required over large scales.

Training activities observably degrade land condition while also increasing biodiversity and stabilizing ecosystems. Moreover, other anthropogenic activities regularly occur on military lands such as prescribed burns and agricultural haying-adding to the dynamics of land condition. Thus, spatially and temporally assessing the impacts of military training, prescribed burning, agricultural haying, and their interactions is critical to the management of military lands. In this study, the spatial distributions and patterns of military training-induced disturbance frequency were derived using plot observation and point observation-based method, at Fort Riley, Kansas from 1989 to 2001. Moreover, spatial and variance analysis of cumulative impacts due to military training, burning, haying, and their interactions on the land condition of Fort Riley were conducted. The results showed that: (1) low disturbance intensity dominated the majority of the study area with exception of concentrated training within centralized areas; (2) high and low values of disturbance frequency were spatially clustered and had spatial patterns that differed significantly from a random distribution; and (3) interactions between prescribed burning and agricultural haying were not significant in terms of either soil erosion or disturbance intensity although their means and variances differed significantly between the burned and non-burned areas and between the hayed and non-hayed areas.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				JUL	2014	54	1					51	66		10.1007/s00267-014-0284-0								WOS:000337285900006	24817335

Satellite images were used to detect the change in potential crane habitat, from which suitable crane habitat was determined by excluding fragmented habitat. In this study, a principal component analysis (PCA) with seven variables (channel flow, rainfall, temperature, sediment discharge, number of oil wells, total length of roads, and area of settlements) and linear regression analyses of potential and suitable habitat against the retained principal components were applied to explore the influences of natural and anthropogenic factors on the change of the red-crowned crane habitat. The experimental results indicate that suitable habitat decreased by 5,935 ha despite an increase of 1,409 ha in potential habitat from 1992 to 2008. The area of crane habitat changed caused by natural drivers such as progressive succession, retrogressive succession, and physical fragmentation is almost the same as that caused by anthropogenic forces such as land use change and behavioral fragmentation. The PCA and regression analyses revealed that natural factors (e.g., channel flow, rainfall, temperature, and sediment discharge) play an important role in the crane potential habitat change and human disturbances (e.g., oil wells, roads, and settlements) jointly explain 51.8 % of the variations in suitable habitat area, higher than 48.2 % contributed by natural factors.

Assessing the changes in land use and ecosystem services in Changzhou municipality, Peoples' Republic of China, 1991-2006	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Much of the world is experiencing fast urbanization. Many pen-urban open spaces, such as parks, forest, farmland, and wetlands, have been built over, which has resulted in a steep decline of ecosystem services at the municipal and regional levels. Using remote sensing, geography information system (GIS) technology and economic evaluation method for ecosystem services, the evolution of landscape spatial structure in 1991, 1996, 2001 and 2006 of Changzhou City, People's Republic of China, was obtained and the change of ecosystem services resulted from land use change was evaluated. Study results show a continuing expansion of urbanized areas and reduction in ecosystem services. Before 2001, farmland was the main type of land use, accounting for more than 53.3% of the total area within the broadly-drawn municipal boundaries. In 2006, farmland and built-up areas were the main land-use types. The built-up area increased by 122% from 1991 to 2006. From 1991 to 2001, the proportion of ecological land (farmland, forests, grasslands, and water-covered areas) within Changzhou's municipal boundaries decreased 24.1%. Based on the observed changes, the economic value of ecosystem services provided by Changzhou's ecological land decreased by 19.3% from 1991 to 2006 and the annual decrease ratio was approximately 1.3%. Conversion of farmland to other uses was responsible for the largest reduction in the value of ecosystem services, equal to 239.8 million RMB (equivalent to USD 37.8 million). Our research results were already adopted locally by Changzhou Municipal Bureau of Urban Planning and applied for Changzhou Mater Urban Planning. The current study can contribute not only to improvements in the Changzhou environment, but to the study of and improvements to other rapidly-urbanizing cities, as the rapid growth of urban areas is one of the most pronounced environmental trends of recent times.

Trends in plant virus epidemiology: Opportunities from new or improved technologies	VIRUS RESEARCH												This review focuses on new or improved technologies currently being applied, or likely to be applied in the future, to worldwide research on plant virus epidemiology. Recent technological advances and innovations provide many opportunities to improve understanding of the way diverse types of plant virus epidemics develop and how to manage them. The review starts at the macro level by considering how recent innovations in remote sensing and precision agriculture can provide valuable information about (i) virus epidemics occurring at continental, regional or district scales (via satellites) and within individual crops (mostly via lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles), and (ii) exactly where to target control measures. It then considers recent improvements in information systems and innovations in modelling that improve (i) understanding of virus epidemics and ability to predict them, and (ii) delivery to end-users of critical advice on control measures, such as Internet-based Decision Support Systems. The review goes on to discuss how advances in analysis of spatiotemporal virus spread patterns within crops can help to enhance understanding of how virus epidemics develop and validate potentially useful virus control measures. At the micro level, the review then considers the many insights that advances in molecular epidemiology can provide about genetic variation within plant virus populations involved in epidemics, and how this variation drives what occurs at the macro level. Next, it describes how recent innovations in virus detection technologies are providing many opportunities to collect and analyse new types, and ever increasing amounts, of data about virus epidemics, and the genetic variability of the virus populations involved. Finally, the implications for plant virus epidemiology of technologies likely to be important in the future are considered. To address looming world food insecurity and threats to plant biodiversity resulting from climate change and rapid population growth, it is important that new and improved technologies that help understand and control epidemics of damaging plant viruses are adopted as smoothly and speedily as possible.

Knowledge on tree species is relevant for biomass estimation, habitat quality assessment, and biodiversity characterization. Hyperspectral data have been proven to have a high potential for the mapping of tree species composition. However, open questions remain concerning the robustness of existing classification approaches. Here, a number of classification approaches were compared to classify tree species from airborne hyperspectral data across three forest sites to identify a single approach which continuously delivers high classification performances over all test sites. Examined approaches included three feature selection methods [genetic algorithm (GA), support vector machines (SVM) wrapper, and sparse generalized partial least squares selection (PLS)] each combined with two nonparametric classifiers (SVM and Random Forest). Two further setups included classifications applied to the full hyperspectral dataset and to an image transformed with a minimum noise fraction (MNF) transformation. Results showed that SVM wrapper and the GA slightly outperformed the PLS-based algorithm. In most cases, the best classification runs involving a feature selection algorithm outperformed those incorporating the full hyperspectral dataset. However, the best overall results were obtained when using the first 10-20 components of the MNF-transformed image. Selected bands were frequently located in the visual region close to the green peak, at the chlorophyll absorption feature and the red edge rise as well as in three parts of the short-wave infrared region close to water absorption features. These findings are relevant for improving the robustness of tree species classifications from airborne hyperspectral data incorporating feature reduction techniques.

Spatial Decision Analysis on Wetlands Restoration in the Lower Reaches of Songhua River (LRSR), Northeast China, Based on Remote Sensing and GIS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Wetlands in the Lower Reaches of Songhua River (LRSR), Northeast China, are rich in biodiversity and natural resources, which provide crucial staging and wintering habitats for various endangered species. However, in the past five decades, the size of this wetland area has decreased, and its quality has deteriorated because of increased natural and human activities. Wetland restoration is critical to improve these conditions. In this study, hydrological regulation and habitat suitability, the most important wetland functions, were selected and analyzed to identify suitable wetland restoration sites. By using these two function layers, together with the geographic information system (GIS) spatial analysis function and remote sensing (RS) image data, we identified and prioritized suitable sites for wetland restoration in the LRSR. Areas with high hydrological regulation and good or fair waterbirds' habitat suitability can support wetland restoration. The potential sites were prioritized in terms of patch size and proximity to natural wetlands and water bodies. Finally, we obtained two priority classes (high and low) of wetland restoration in a spatial scale. The results from this study showed that the areas with high and low priority classes for wetland restoration are 82,628 and 247,039 ha, respectively, which account for 1.23% and 3.67% of the total study area. The high-priority class areas would be used for the wetland restoration.																	1735-6865	2008-2304				SUM	2014	8	3					849	860										WOS:000339932500034

In addition, CBFM enables greater survey repeatability. Therefore, CBFM should be a fundamental component of national forest monitoring systems and programs to measure, report and verify (MRV) REDD+ activities. To contribute to the development of more effective approaches to CBFM, in this paper we assess: (1) the feasibility of using small, low-cost drones (i.e., remotely piloted aerial vehicles) in CBFM programs; (2) their potential advantages and disadvantages for communities, partner organizations and forest data end-users; and (3) to what extent their utilization, coupled with ground surveys and local ecological knowledge, would improve tropical forest monitoring. To do so, we reviewed the existing literature regarding environmental applications of drones, including forest monitoring, and drew on our own firsthand experience flying small drones to map and monitor tropical forests and training people to operate them. We believe that the utilization of small drones can enhance CBFM and that this approach is feasible in many locations throughout the tropics if some degree of external assistance and funding is provided to communities. We suggest that the use of small drones can help tropical communities to better manage and conserve their forests whilst benefiting partner organizations, governments and forest data end-users, particularly those engaged in forestry, biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation projects such as REDD+.

J	Andrew, ME; Wulder, MA; Nelson, TA				Andrew, Margaret E.; Wulder, Michael A.; Nelson, Trisalyn A.			Potential contributions of remote sensing to ecosystem service assessments	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Ecological and conservation research has provided a strong scientific underpinning to the modeling of ecosystem services (ESs) over space and time, by identifying the ecological processes and components of biodiversity (ecosystem service providers, functional traits) that drive ES supply. Despite this knowledge, efforts to map the distribution of ESs often rely on simple spatial surrogates that provide incomplete and non-mechanistic representations of the biophysical variables they are intended to proxy. However, alternative data sets are available that allow for more direct, spatially nuanced inputs to ES mapping efforts. Many spatially explicit, quantitative estimates of biophysical parameters are currently supported by remote sensing, with great relevance to ES mapping. Additional parameters that are not amenable to direct detection by remote sensing may be indirectly modeled with spatial environmental data layers. We review the capabilities of modern remote sensing for describing biodiversity, plant traits, vegetation condition, ecological processes, soil properties, and hydrological variables and highlight how these products may contribute to ES assessments. Because these products often provide more direct estimates of the ecological properties controlling ESs than the spatial proxies currently in use, they can support greater mechanistic realism in models of ESs. By drawing on the increasing range of remote sensing instruments and measurements, data sets appropriate to the estimation of a given ES can be selected or developed. In so doing, we anticipate rapid progress to the spatial characterization of ecosystem services, in turn supporting ecological conservation, management, and integrated land use planning.

Resulting light pollution from artificial lights obscures the night sky for astronomy and has negative impacts on biodiversity as well as on human health. However, remote sensing studies of night lights to date have been mostly limited to coarse spatial resolution sensors such as the DMSP-OLS. Here we present a new source for high spatial resolution mapping of night lights from space, derived from a commercial satellite. We tasked the Israeli EROS-B satellite to acquire two night-time light images (at a spatial resolution of 1 m) of Brisbane, Australia, and analyzed their radiometric quality and content with r8pect to land cover and land use. The spatial distribution of night lights as imaged by EROS-B corresponded with night-time images acquired by an airborne camera, although EROS-B was not as sensitive to low light levels. Using land cover and land use data at the statistical local area level, we could statistically explain 89% of the variability in night-time lights. Arterial roads and commercial and service areas were found to be some of the brightest land use types. Overall, we found that EROS-B imagery provides fine spatial resolution images of night lights, opening new avenues for studying light pollution in cities worldwide. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Flint; Asner, Gregory P.; Mascaro, Joseph; Uowolo, Amanda; Baldwin, James			Carbon storage landscapes of lowland Hawaii: the role of native and invasive species through space and time	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Tropical forests are important storehouses of carbon and biodiversity. In isolated island ecosystems such as the Hawaiian Islands, relative dominance of native and nonnative tree species may influence patterns of forest carbon stocks and biodiversity. We determined aboveground carbon density (ACD) across a matrix of lava flows differing in age, texture, and vegetation composition (i.e., native or nonnative dominated) in wet lowland forests of Hawaii Island. To do this at the large scales necessary to accurately capture the inherent heterogeneity of these forests, we collected LiDAR data across areas of interest and developed relationships between LiDAR metrics and field-based estimates of forest ACD. This approach enabled us to inventory, rather than merely sample, the entire populations (i.e., forests) of interest. Native Hawaiian wet lowland forests exhibited ACD values similar to those of intact tropical forests elsewhere. In general, ACD of these forests increased with increasing lava flow age, but patterns differed between native and nonnative forest stands. On the youngest lavas, native-dominated forest ACD averaged <60 Mg/ha, compared to similar to 100 Mg C/ha for nonnative-dominated forests. This difference was due to the presence of the nonnative, N-2-fixing trees F. moluccana and C. equisetifolia in the nonnative-dominated forest stands, as well as the corresponding absence of N2-fixing trees in native-dominated forest stands. Following similar to 500 years of primary succession and thereafter, however, both forest types exhibited ACD values averaging similar to 130 Mg C/ha, although it took nonnative forests only 75-80 years of post-establishment succession to reach those values. Given the large areas of early-successional M. polymorpha-dominated forest on young lava flows, further spread of F. moluccana and C. equisetifolia populations would likely increase ACD stocks but would constitute a significant erosion of the invaluable contribution of Hawaii's native ecosystems to global biodiversity.

Conservation policies in JNP include the implementation of two national reforestation programs to increase forest cover and the exclusion of local land-use. We use archaeological excavation, ethnographic interviews, remote sensing and vegetation surveys to examine the implications of these policies for non-forest, montane meadows. We find that Amdo Tibetan people cultivated the valley for > 2,000 years, creating and maintaining meadows through land clearing, burning and grazing. Meadows served as sites for gathering plants and mushrooms and over 40 % of contemporary species are ethnobotanically useful. Remote sensing analyses indicate a substantial (69.6 %) decline in meadow area between 1974 and 2004. Respondents report a loss of their "true history" and connections to the past associated with loss of meadows. Conservation policies intended to preserve biodiversity are unintentionally contributing to the loss of these ecologically and culturally significant meadow habitats.																	0300-7839	1572-9915				JUN	2014	42	3					481	491		10.1007/s10745-014-9650-z								WOS:000337059400010	26097267

Remote sensing studies detect various vegetation trends; however, explanations are rarely studied in detail. We present a methodology using time series, high-resolution imagery and fieldwork to validate trend analyses for two regions in the Sahel of Mali and Senegal. Both study areas show significant greening trends from 1982 to 2010. Reasons can be very site-specific, but several factors are valid for both research areas: (1) farmer-managed agro-forestry, (2) planting programs and protection laws, (3) widespread dispersion of robust species, which replace the former diverse woody vegetation and simulate a greening which conceals a shift in biodiversity and (4) an increase of annual rainfall. However, the situation is still far from the pre-drought conditions, which are reconstructed by Corona imagery (1965) and interviews with the local population. Rather a transformation is observed: a decrease in natural vegetation, tree density and diversity. Reasons are climatic and anthropogenic: (1) drought events, less rain and higher temperatures, (2) increased demand for cropping areas and wood, especially in times of droughts. Our example validates that climatic factors are important drivers of change, but much of today's environment and vegetation composition is controlled by humans. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A retrospective assessment of the hydrological conditions of the Samborombon coastland (Argentina)	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Coastal wetlands are transitional zones that play an important role as buffers between the land and sea in several ways, such as protecting the land from storm surge and reducing the input of nutrients from surrounding watersheds to the sea. Understanding the influence of human activities on the hydrological conditions of coastal wetlands is of paramount importance for preserving the ecological function and biodiversity of these unique ecosystems. In the last century, the Samborombon coastland (Argentina), which is an extensive intertidal wetland, has been affected by hydraulic projects and human activities. In this study, through a retrospective assessment of the hydrologic conditions, we show the impacts of channelization, embankments and mining on the surficial and groundwater hydrology of the Samborombon wetlands. The results indicate that channelization has promoted tidal flooding and seawater encroachment along the channels. The embankments have separated large areas from the estuary tides; during heavy rainfalls, they act as obstacles and cause the inundation of inland regions while allowing the accumulation of sodium chloride by saltwater evaporation after tidal overtopping events. The freshwater resources in the aquifer of the paleo-coastlines have been seriously damaged by mining of the shell ridges. The halophyl vegetation in the marshlands and the native forest of the shell ridges, which depend on tidal flow and fresh water, respectively, have been threatened. Nevertheless, although the hydrology of the Samborombon coastland has undergone changes, the engineering projects did not permanently modify or damage the surrounding ecosystems. The outcomes of this study will be useful for remediating ecosystems that have been impacted by human activities by following the fundamentals of ecological engineering. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Quantifying Tropical Wetlands Using Field Surveys, Spatial Statistics and Remote Sensing	WETLANDS												Tropical wetlands support high biodiversity and ecological services, but in most areas they suffer from a paucity of baseline data to support management. We demonstrate how modern technology can be used to develop ecological baseline data including, landuse/landcover, water depth, water quality, lake-level fluctuation, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). For the first time we quantified and mapped these metrics for the Paya Indah Wetlands, Malaysia using the new high-spatial-resolution World View 2 imagery. Landuse/landcover classifications were validated by field visits and visual interpretation of the imagery. NDVI was extracted based on red and near infra-red 2 bands. Topo to Raster method was used for interpolation of water depths. Annual mean of a water-quality index and annual water-level fluctuation of lakes were interpolated across lakes using the inverse-distance weighting method. Qualitative and quantitative accuracy assessment of classification (75 % overall accuracy, user's accuracies ranged from 60 % to 90 % and producer's accuracy ranged from 60 % to 97 %) was promising and clearly illustrated that World View 2 imagery can yield fast and reasonably precise identification of ecosystem characteristics for ecological baselines.

Interfacing ecology and policy: Developing an ecological framework and evidence base to support wildfire management in South Africa	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												This paper describes the first step in developing an approach to fire risk assessment aimed at balancing the reduction of risks to lives and livelihoods and maintaining fire regimes which protect ecosystem biodiversity and function in fire-prone ecosystems. Wildfires pose a major hazard to people's lives, livelihoods and ecosystems in South Africa with poor communities generally being highly exposed and vulnerable. Although general information exists, an adequate understanding of the fire regimes, how they vary spatially, and the related vegetation management requirements is lacking. This study resolves the environmental variation in fire regimes across South Africa into a systematic framework for wildfire risk assessment and ecologically sound ecosystem management. The available descriptions of fire regimes, vegetation classifications, and fire occurrence data from remote sensing are synthesized to derive a set of 13 distinct fire-ecology types, that is, sets of vegetation units which experience distinct fire regimes. Fuel dynamics, fire-dependence, ecologically acceptable fire regimes, and guidelines for fire management are described for each of these fire-ecology types and they are grouped into three categories: fire dependent, fire independent and fire sensitive. Fire-dependent ecosystems comprise more than 60% of South Africa and fire-independent ones 32%, the latter mainly in the arid west and northwest, while the remainder are fire sensitive. Fire-dependent systems require fires and generally coincide with the greatest rural population densities. The outputs from this framework can be used to analyse wildfire risk and translate the risk into practical management measures which are responsive to local ecological, social and institutional settings.

There is growing interest in transferring ecosystem service value from the existing wetlands studied to other wetlands ecosystems at a large geographic scale. The benefit transfer method uses the known values from wetlands to predict the value of other wetland sites. This methodology requires only limited time and resources. The present study calculated the value of the ecological services provided by lake and marsh wetlands in China in terms of biodiversity indices, water quality indices and economic indices. Basic data on wetlands were obtained through remote sensing images. The results show that: 1) The total ecosystem service value of the lake and marsh wetlands in 2008 was calculated to be 8.1841 x 10(10) United States Dollars (USD), with the marsh and lake wetlands contributing 5.6329 x 10(10) and 2.5512 x 10(10) USD, respectively. Values of marsh ecosystem service were concentrated in Heilongjiang Province (2.5516 x 10(10) USD), Qinghai Province (1.2014 x 10(10) USD), and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (1.1884 x 10(10) USD). The value of the lakes were concentrated in Tibet Autonomous Region (6.223 x 10(9) USD), Heilongjiang (5.810 x 10(9) USD), and Qinghai (5.500 x 10(9) USD). 2) Waste treatment and climate regulation services contributed to 26.29% and 24.74% respectively, of the total ecosystem service value of the marsh wetlands. Hydrological regulation and waste treatment contributed to 41.39% and 32.75%, respectively, of the total ecosystem service value of the lake wetlands. 3) The total ecological service value of the lake and marsh wetlands was 54.64% of the total service value of natural grassland ecosystems and 30.34% of the total service value of forests ecosystems in China.																	1002-0063	1993-064X				JUN	2014	24	3					269	278		10.1007/s11769-013-0648-z								WOS:000336450300001

To illustrate the approach, spatial simulation models, including landscape-level forest dynamics, were developed for a semi-natural grassland of conservation concern in a southern Italian protected area, which was exposed to woody vegetation encroachment. A forest landscape dynamics simulator (LANDIS-II) under conditions of climate change, current fire and alternative management regimes was used to develop scenario maps. Landscape pattern metrics provided data on fragmentation and habitat quality degradation, and quantified the spatial spread of different tree species within grassland habitats. The models indicated that approximately one-third of the grassland area would be impacted by loss, fragmentation and degradation in the next 150 years. Differing forest management regimes appear to influence the type of encroaching species and the density of encroaching vegetation. Habitat modifications are likely to affect species distribution and interactions, as well as local ecosystem functioning, leading to changes in estimated conservation value. A site-scale conservation strategy based on feasible integrated fire and forest management options is proposed, considering the debate on the effectiveness of protected areas for the conservation of ecosystem services in a changing climate. This needs to be tested through further modelling and scenario analysis, which would benefit from the enhancement of current modelling capabilities of LANDIS-II and from combination with remote sensing technologies, to provide early signals of environmental shifts both within and outside protected areas.

Disentangling the role of remotely sensed spectral heterogeneity as a proxy for North American plant species richness	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY												Due to the difficulties of field-based species data collection at wide spatial scales, remotely sensed spectral diversity has been advocated as one of the most effective proxies of ecosystem and species diversity. It is widely accepted that the relationship between species and spectral diversity is scale dependent. However, few studies have evaluated the impacts of scale on species diversity estimates from remote sensing data. In this paper we tested the species versus spectral relationship over very large scales (extents) with a varying spatial grain using floristic data of North America. Spectral diversity explained a low amount of variance while spatial extent of the sampling units (floras) explained a high amount of variance based on results from our variance partitioning analyses. This leads to the conclusion that spectral diversity must be carefully related to species diversity, explicitly taking into account potential area effects.

Murray			Ecohydrodynamics of Cold-Water Coral Reefs: A Case Study of the Mingulay Reef Complex (Western Scotland)	PLOS ONE												Ecohydrodynamics investigates the hydrodynamic constraints on ecosystems across different temporal and spatial scales. Ecohydrodynamics play a pivotal role in the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems, however the lack of integrated complex flow models for deep-water ecosystems beyond the coastal zone prevents further synthesis in these settings. We present a hydrodynamic model for one of Earth's most biologically diverse deep-water ecosystems, cold-water coral reefs. The Mingulay Reef Complex (western Scotland) is an inshore seascape of cold-water coral reefs formed by the scleractinian coral Lophelia pertusa. We applied single-image edge detection and composite front maps using satellite remote sensing, to detect oceanographic fronts and peaks of chlorophyll a values that likely affect food supply to corals and other suspension-feeding fauna. We also present a high resolution 3D ocean model to incorporate salient aspects of the regional and local oceanography. Model validation using in situ current speed, direction and sea elevation data confirmed the model's realistic representation of spatial and temporal aspects of circulation at the reef complex including a tidally driven current regime, eddies, and downwelling phenomena. This novel combination of 3D hydrodynamic modelling and remote sensing in deep-water ecosystems improves our understanding of the temporal and spatial scales of ecological processes occurring in marine systems. The modelled information has been integrated into a 3D GIS, providing a user interface for visualization and interrogation of results that allows wider ecological application of the model and that can provide valuable input for marine biodiversity and conservation applications.

Assessing current and projected suitable habitats for tree-of-heaven along the Appalachian Trail	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												The invasion of ecosystems by non-native species is a major driver of biodiversity loss worldwide. A critical component of effective land management to control invasion is the identification and active protection of areas at high risk of future invasion. The Appalachian Trail Decision Support System (A.T.-DSS) was developed to inform regional natural resource management by integrating remote sensing data, ground-based measurements and predictive modelling products. By incorporating NASA's remote sensing data and modelling capacities from the Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System (TOPS), this study examined the current habitat suitability and projected suitable habitat for the invasive species tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima) as a prototype application of the A.T.-DSS. Species observations from forest surveys, geospatial data, climatic projections and maximum entropy modelling were used to identify regions potentially susceptible to tree-of-heaven invasion. The modelling result predicted a 48% increase in suitable area over the study area, with significant expansion along the northern extremes of the Appalachian Trail.

Oil exploration and exploitation can constitute an important threat to fragmented and remnant desert biodiversity, yet little is known about where and how intensively such developments are taking place. This lack of information hinders local efforts to adequately buffer and protect desert wildlife against encroachment from anthropogenic activity. Here, we investigate the use of freely available satellite imagery for the detection of features associated with oil exploration in the African Sahelo-Saharan region. We demonstrate how texture analyses combined with Landsat data can be employed to detect ground-validated exploration sites in Algeria and Niger. Our results show that site detection via supervised image classification and prediction is generally accurate. One surprising outcome of our analyses is the relatively high level of site omission errors in Niger (43%), which appears to be due to non-detection of potentially small-scale, temporary exploration activity: we believe the repeated implementation of our framework could reduce the severity of potential methodological limitations. Overall, our study provides a methodological basis for the mapping of anthropogenic threats associated with oil exploitation that can be conducted across desert regions.

Imaging spectroscopy links aspen genotype with below-ground processes at landscape scales	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Fine-scale biodiversity is increasingly recognized as important to ecosystem-level processes. Remote sensing technologies have great potential to estimate both biodiversity and ecosystem function over large spatial scales. Here, we demonstrate the capacity of imaging spectroscopy to discriminate among genotypes of Populus tremuloides (trembling aspen), one of the most genetically diverse and widespread forest species in North America. We combine imaging spectroscopy (AVIRIS) data with genetic, phytochemical, microbial and biogeochemical data to determine how intraspecific plant genetic variation influences below-ground processes at landscape scales. We demonstrate that both canopy chemistry and below-ground processes vary over large spatial scales (continental) according to aspen genotype. Imaging spectrometer data distinguish aspen genotypes through variation in canopy spectral signature. In addition, foliar spectral variation correlates well with variation in canopy chemistry, especially condensed tannins. Variation in aspen canopy chemistry, in turn, is correlated with variation in below-ground processes. Variation in spectra also correlates well with variation in soil traits. These findings indicate that forest tree species can create spatial mosaics of ecosystem functioning across large spatial scales and that these patterns can be quantified via remote sensing techniques. Moreover, they demonstrate the utility of using optical properties as proxies for fine-scale measurements of biodiversity over large spatial scales.

The potential for synergies between remote sensing science and ecology, especially satellite remote sensing and conservation biology, has been highlighted by many in the past. Yet, the two research communities have only recently begun to coordinate their agendas. Such synchronization is the key to improving the potential for satellite data effectively to support future environmental management decision-making processes. With this themed issue, we aim to illustrate how integrating remote sensing into ecological research promotes a better understanding of the mechanisms shaping current changes in biodiversity patterns and improves conservation efforts. Added benefits include fostering innovation, generating new research directions in both disciplines and the development of new satellite remote sensing products.

Here, we compare two measures derived from unclassified remotely sensed data, a measure of habitat heterogeneity and a measure of habitat composition, for explaining bird species richness and the spatial distribution of 10 species in a semi-arid landscape of New Mexico. We surveyed bird abundance from 1996 to 1998 at 42 plots located in the McGregor Range of Fort Bliss Army Reserve. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index values of two May 1997 Landsat scenes were the basis for among-pixel habitat heterogeneity (image texture), and we used the raw imagery to decompose each pixel into different habitat components (spectral mixture analysis). We used model averaging to relate measures of avian biodiversity to measures of image texture and spectral mixture analysis fractions. Measures of habitat heterogeneity, particularly angular second moment and standard deviation, provide higher explanatory power for bird species richness and the abundance of most species than measures of habitat composition. Using image texture, alone or in combination with other classified imagery-based approaches, for monitoring statuses and trends in biological diversity can greatly improve conservation efforts and habitat management.

Individual PAs have different roles in maintaining connectivity, depending on their size and location. We measured their contribution to network connectivity (irreplaceability) for carnivores and ungulates and combined it with a measure of vulnerability based on a 30-year trend in remotely sensed vegetation cover (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). Highly irreplaceable PAs occurred mainly in southern and eastern Africa. Vegetation cover change was generally faster outside than inside PAs and particularly so in southern Africa. The extent of change increased with the distance from PAs. About 5% of highly irreplaceable PAs experienced a faster vegetation cover loss than their surroundings, thus requiring particular conservation attention. Our analysis identified PAs at risk whose isolation would disrupt the connectivity of the PA network for large mammals. This is an example of how ecological spatial modelling can be combined with large-scale remote sensing data to investigate how land cover change may affect ecological processes and species conservation.

Assessing the drivers of biodiversity in Madagascar by quantifying its hydrologic properties at the watershed scale	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Motivated by a theory developed by Wilme et al. (2006) according to which, watersheds of Madagascar with headwaters at high altitude respond differently to drought from those with headwaters confined to relatively low elevations, with possibly profound effects on the biodiversity patterns of the island, we analyzed multi-year basin-specific observations of soil moisture and vegetation water content (derived from NRL's WindSat radiometer) and their response to precipitation departures (derived from TRMM 3B42 V7) from its local mean. These datasets were analyzed to investigate the hydrologic properties at the basin scale, including the speed with which vegetation and soil moisture respond to precipitation anomalies. We also looked at the basin-specific normalized radar surface-backscattering cross-sections from NASA's QuikSCAT Scatterometer, to obtain information on the vegetation regimes of the various Malagasy basins. Finally, we correlated the basin response to the precipitation forcing, and compared the amplitude and time lag of the correlations across watersheds with high elevation headwaters versus those with low elevation headwaters in the aim of evaluating the drought-response hypothesis of Wilme et al. (2006). Our results indicate that the vegetation water content time series exhibit several features that are consistent with those of the majority of the bioclimatic zones of the island. Specifically, although the speed of the response of the vegetation water content varies significantly among the different basins, it is inter-annually consistent for each watershed, while the soil-moisture time series are less consistent than the vegetation water content time series. This study is a first step in the quantification of the hydrologic properties derived from microwave remote sensing, and which could potentially shed new light on the different intra-annual responses of watersheds to precipitation anomalies. Furthermore, this analysis offers important insights into the hydro-geomorphologic drivers associated with biodiversity patterns in Madagascar, contributing to a better understanding of the mechanisms that determine biotic diversification across the various bioclimatic regions of the island.

Floodplain inundation and vegetation dynamics in the Alligator Rivers region (Kakadu) of northern Australia assessed using optical and radar remote sensing	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The Alligator Rivers region is located in the wet-dry tropics along the coastal zone of northern Australia and contains Kakadu National Park, which is recognized under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and is a World Heritage listed site. Multiple anthropogenic stressors increasingly affect the floodplains of this region, and baseline information on floodplain inundation dynamics is necessary to manage these threats and develop adaption strategies for sea level rise. This study uses classification tree modeling to combine microwave (ALOS L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) and optical (Landsat Thematic Mapper, TM 5) satellite data with field-sampled aquatic vegetation and depth logger data to predict the seasonal and inter-annual dynamics of aquatic plant cover and extent of inundation in the region. The USGS Landsat TM 5 image archive was sampled between 1985 and 2011 using three seasonal samples per year to create a comprehensive long-term time series of seasonal and inter-annual floodplain inundation extents. Classification accuracy for the inundation mapping was estimated at 86% based on seasonal depth logger data. The mean extent of inundation at the end of the wet season (March/April) was 1784 km(2) (range 2283-1309 km(2)), receding on average to approximately 25% of its extent by August/September. Seasonal inundation patterns exhibit an exponential recession of inundation into 'backswamp' areas on the fringes of the floodplains with hydro-periods on the order of 5 months. The findings of this work significantly improve our understanding of dynamics in this environmentally and culturally unique area and provide a basis for application in other seasonally flooded environments.

Season-dependence of remote sensing indicators of tree species diversity	REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												During recent years, many studies have been undertaken to investigate how spectral characteristics of forests can provide information on spatial patterns of tree species diversity (TSD). Important advances have been made, and significant relationships between TSD and remotely sensed indicators of net primary productivity and environmental heterogeneity have been reported. However, the season-dependence of these relationships has not yet been fully investigated, and the influence of phenology remains poorly understood. In this study, we aim to assess how the relationships between remote sensing indicators and TSD depend on the season of the year. TSD measures, including species richness, Shannon's diversity and Simpson's diversity, were determined for 82 field plots in the Afromontane cloud forests of Taita Hills, Kenya. A time series of 15 Landsat images were used to calculate a set of spectral and heterogeneity metrics. The relationship between remote-sensing metrics and TSD measures was analysed by simple and multivariate regression analysis. We conclude that the relationships between remote-sensing metrics and TSD are season-dependent. Hence, it is demonstrated the date of image acquisition is an important aspect to be considered in biodiversity studies. Given that the dependence of the relationships is closely linked to climate seasonality defining vegetation phenology, the relationships may also vary according to geographical conditions.

Assessing the cross platform performance of marine mammal indicators between two collocated acoustic recorders	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Equipment and deployment strategies for remote passive acoustic sensing of marine environments must balance memory capacity, power requirements, sampling rate, duty-cycle, deployment duration, instrument size, and environmental concerns. The impact of different parameters on the data and applicability of the data to the specific questions being asked should be considered before deployment. Here we explore the effect of recording and detection parameters on marine mammal acoustic data across two platforms. Daily classifications of marine mammal vocalizations from two passive acoustic monitors with different subsampling parameters, an AURAL and a Passive Aquatic Listener (PAL), collocated in the Bering Sea were compared. The AURAL subsampled on a preset schedule, whereas the PAL sampled via an adaptive protocol. Detected signals of interest were manually classified in each dataset independently. The daily classification rates of vocalizations were similar. Detections from the higher duty-cycle but lower sample rate AURAL were limited to species and vocalizations with energy below 4 kHz precluding detection of echolocation signals. Temporal coverage from the PAL audio files was limited by the adaptive sub-sampling protocol. A method for classifying ribbon (Histriophoca fasciata) and bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus) vocalizations from the sparse spectral time histories of the PAL was developed. Although application of the acoustic entropy as a rapid assessment of biodiversity was not reflective of the number of species detected, acoustic entropy was robust to changes in sample rate and window length.

To improve communication in conservation planning, managers and other stakeholders need spatially explicit projections at the landscape scale of future biodiversity under different land-use scenarios. For that purpose, we visualized the potential effect of five forest management scenarios on the avifauna of Kakamega Forest, western Kenya using different measures of bird diversity and GIS data. Future projections of bird diversity combined: (1) remotely sensed data on the spatial distribution of different forest management types; (2) field-based data on the biodiversity of birds in the different management types; and (3) forest management scenarios that took into account possible views of various stakeholder groups. Management scenarios based on the species richness of forest specialists were very informative, because they reflected differences in the proportions of near-natural forest types among the five scenarios. Projections based on community composition were even more meaningful, as they mirrored not only the proportions of near-natural forest types, but also their perimeter to area ratios. This highlights that it is important to differentiate effects of the total area of available habitat and the degree of habitat fragmentation, both for species richness and community composition. Furthermore, our study shows that an approach that combines land-use scenarios, remote sensing and field data on biodiversity can be used to visualize future biodiversity. As such, visualizations of alternative scenarios are valuable for successful communication about conservation planning considering different groups of stakeholders in species-rich tropical forests.																	0006-3606	1744-7429				MAY	2014	46	3					357	366		10.1111/btp.12105								WOS:000335784700014

Artificial restoration projects have been conducted worldwide to repair disaster damage to forests, but the efficacy of such projects in light of naturally occurring recovery processes is rarely evaluated. To fill such an important knowledge gap, we investigated forest recovery and restoration in the world-renowned Wolong Nature Reserve in Sichuan, China after the catastrophic Wenchuan earthquake (magnitude 8.0) in 2008, which caused considerable damage to the forest and habitat of the endangered giant panda. This was the first multi-year field study to document natural recovery of forests in response to this disaster. Forest sampling conducted in panda habitat over a four-year period after the earthquake revealed that natural recovery was rapid, with vegetation covering roughly 70% of once denuded sites by the fourth sampling year. Vegetation recovery was further improved in sampled artificial restoration sites, which recovered from an average of 30% vegetation cover to 70% in only one year. Factors including soil cover and slope were correlated with successful vegetation recovery. New information learned from the multi-year field data provided a finer scale context for understanding the effects of disasters, a novel contribution considering that the majority of previous work has been conducted at the broader scale using remote sensing. Spatial analysis revealed that restoration sites were mainly distributed in areas of suitable slopes and elevations, but a measurable proportion (30-40%) were located too far from the existing panda distribution area and too close to human settlements. The restoration project has thus far had limited direct effect on giant panda conservation, but has indirect effects on improving forest cover in areas previously affected by human disturbances. This study provides a useful reference for understanding conditions affecting forest recovery, which can inform decision-making surrounding the implementation of forest restoration projects and conservation of endangered species, not only in China but also around the world.

J	Akay, AE; Sivrikaya, F; Gulci, S				Akay, Abdullah E.; Sivrikaya, Fatih; Gulci, Sercan			Analyzing riparian forest cover changes along the Firniz River in the Mediterranean City of Kahramanmaras in Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Riparian forests adjacent to surface water are important transitional zones which maintain and enrich biodiversity and ensure the sustainability in a forest ecosystem. Also, riparian forests maintain water quality, reduce sediment delivery, enhance habitat areas for aquatic life and wildlife, and provide ecological corridors between the upland and the downstream. However, the riparian ecosystems have been degraded mainly due to human development, forest operations, and agricultural activities. In order to evaluate the impacts of these factors on riparian forests, it is necessary to estimate trends in forest cover changes. This study aims to analyze riparian forest cover changes along the Firniz River located in Mediterranean city of Kahramanmaras in Turkey. Changes in riparian forest cover from 1989 to 2010 have been determined by implementing supervised classification method on a series of Landsat TM imagery of the study area. The results indicated that the classification process applied on 1989 and 2010 images provided overall accuracy of 80.08 and 75%, respectively. It was found that the most common land use class within the riparian zone was productive forest, followed by degraded forest, agricultural areas, and other land use classes. The results also indicated that the areas of degraded forest and forest openings increased, while productive forest and agricultural areas decreased between the years of 1989 and 2010. The amount of agricultural areas decreased due to the reduction in the population of rural people. According to these results, it can be concluded that special forest management and operation techniques should be implemented to restore the forest ecosystem in riparian areas.

Decadal time-scale monitoring of forest fires in Similipal Biosphere Reserve, India using remote sensing and GIS	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Analyzing the spatial extent and distribution of forest fires is essential for sustainable forest resource management. There is no comprehensive data existing on forest fires on a regular basis in Biosphere Reserves of India. The present work have been carried out to locate and estimate the spatial extent of forest burnt areas using Resourcesat-1 data and fire frequency covering decadal fire events (2004-2013) in Similipal Biosphere Reserve. The anomalous quantity of forest burnt area was recorded during 2009 as 1,014.7 km(2). There was inconsistency in the fire susceptibility across the different vegetation types. The spatial analysis of burnt area shows that an area of 34.2% of dry deciduous forests, followed by tree savannah, shrub savannah, and grasslands affected by fires in 2013. The analysis based on decadal time scale satellite data reveals that an area of 2,175.9 km(2) (59.6 % of total vegetation cover) has been affected by varied rate of frequency of forest fires. Fire density pattern indicates low count of burnt area patches in 2013 estimated at 1,017 and high count at 1,916 in 2004. An estimate of fire risk area over a decade identifies 12.2 km(2) is experiencing an annual fire damage. Summing the fire frequency data across the grids (each 1 km(2)) indicates 1,211 (26 %) grids are having very high disturbance regimes due to repeated fires in all the 10 years, followed by 711 grids in 9 years and 418 in 8 years and 382 in 7 years. The spatial database offers excellent opportunities to understand the ecological impact of fires on biodiversity and is helpful in formulating conservation action plans.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY	2014	186	5					3283	3296		10.1007/s10661-014-3619-7								WOS:000333801200049	24473680

Remote sensing of vegetation cover dynamics and resilience across southern Africa	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Southern Africa supports a significant portion of the world's floral biodiversity but predicted changes in climate are likely to cause adverse impacts on the region's ecosystems and biodiversity. Knowledge regarding the resilience of vegetation cover is important for understanding the potential impact of anthropic or climatic change. The length of time vegetation cover takes to recover from disturbances can provide an indication of ecosystem resilience. We investigated spatial and temporal patterns in the persistence of vegetation cover across southern Africa (1982-2006) and used persistence probability plots to estimate decay times of NDVI trends as a means to characterise the potential resilience of key southern African biomes. Patterns of positive and negative NDVI trend persistence were spatially coherent, indicating collective dynamic behaviour of vegetation cover. Persistence probability plots indicated differences in resilience between biomes. Mean recovery times from negative NDVI trends were shorter than for positive trends in the Savanna and Nama Karoo, whereas the Succulent Karoo exhibited the shortest mean lifetime for positive NDVI trends and one of the longest mean lifetimes for negative trend survival, implying potentially slow recovery from environmental disturbance. The results show the potential of satellite-time series data for monitoring vegetation cover resilience in semi-arid regions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For this purpose, two Landsat images recorded in 1991 and 2009, respectively, were classified using the C5.0 decision tree classifier. A subsequent change detection analysis revealed a significant decrease of 77% of the area classified as seasonally inundated grassland in 1991, mainly due to the conversion into agriculture, aquaculture, and forest. Since these wetlands support a high diversity of flora and a rich avifauna, there should be a focus on the protection of the last remnant patches of seasonally inundated grasslands in the Ha Tien Plain in order to preserve their biodiversity values and ecosystem functions.																	0143-1161	1366-5901				APR 18	2014	35	8			SI		2893	2909		10.1080/01431161.2014.890306								WOS:000333875100009

Tropical islands quick data gap analysis guided by coral reef geomorphological maps	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												A gap analysis is the initial step towards the identification of areas where data are needed. However, often, data coverage cannot be assessed against a reference that objectively guides the identification of both gaps and priority areas for data acquisition. Here, we describe a quick, effective and reproducible spatial data gap analysis approach based on the relationship between location of available metadata and coral reef geomorphological richness. In Solomon Islands, we identified gaps defined by high richness and low biological data coverage. We collected metadata only, to avoid dealing with data ownership, availability, and formats, and to be able to identify gaps in less than two months. This fast method does not replace quantitative and comprehensive gap analysis, but provides effective identification of areas of high natural value and limited knowledge. The method is widely applicable and particularly invaluable for large and complex domains such as the Coral Triangle. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In the last decades, active management has stopped in most of these stands and management goals have changed towards nature conservation purposes. The aim of this work was: (1) to analyze stand dynamics and spontaneous regeneration processes taking place with increasing age in even-aged fir plantations; and (2) to discuss if the above processes may be useful for defining management approaches addressing such conservation purposes. The study was carried out in the Vallombrosa Forest (near Florence, Italy). The relationship between fir stand age and structural parameters was analyzed using inventory data. Gap dynamics were monitored between 1983 and 2007 based on remote sensing data. A field survey of a sample of gaps was carried out. Species composition and density of seedlings and saplings were analysed in relation to gap size and within-gap position. From 1983 to 2007 the number of gaps and their total area increased, following increasing stand age. Significant relationships (p < 0.01) were found between fir stand age and number of trees per hectare (r = -0.30), quadratic mean diameter (r = 0.65) and volume per hectare (r = 0.50). A layer of trees with DBH < 15 cm (composed by 15 different broadleaf species usually mixed with fir) was observed in fir stands with lower stand density. Gap size influenced the presence of young firs (seedlings and fir < 0.5 m), which were significantly more abundant in gaps < 200 m(2), but it had relatively limited influence on species diversity. Within-gap position did not affect the density of recruitments. Results indicate that the creation of small gaps (< 200 m(2)) in the canopy cover may simulate the natural dynamics of aged fir plantations in the Apennines and may be considered as a possible management option for their gradual transformation into mixed, naturally regenerating forests.

J	Tong, LG; Xu, XL; Fu, Y; Li, S				Tong, Laga; Xu, Xinliang; Fu, Ying; Li, Shuang			Wetland Changes and Their Responses to Climate Change in the "Three-River Headwaters" Region of China since the 1990s	ENERGIES												The wetland ecosystem in the "Three-River Headwaters" (TRH) region plays an irreplaceable role in water source conservation, run-off adjustment and biodiversity maintenance. In recent years, assessment of wetland resources affected by climate changes has aroused enormous attention, since it can further protect wetland resources and provide a scientific basis for decision makers. In this study, wetland changes and its response to climate changes in the TRH region from the early 1990s to 2012 were analyzed by remote sensing (RS) image interpretation and climate change trend analysis. The results showed that wetlands occupied 6.3% of the total land area in 2012, and swamps, streams & rivers and lakes were the dominant wetland types in the TRH region. Since the early 1990s, wetlands have undergone great changes, and total wetland area increased by 260.57 km(2) (1.17%). Lakes, reservoir & ponds took on continuous increasing trend, but swamps, streams & rivers had a continuous decreasing trend. On the other hand, the wetland area in the Yangtze River basin showed an overall increasing trend, while in the Yellow River and Langcang River basins, it decreased in general. The climate turned from Warm-Dry to Warm-Wet. The average temperature and precipitation increased by 0.91 degrees C and 101.99 mm, respectively, from 1990 to 2012, and the average humidity index (HI) increased by 0.06 and showing an upward trend and a shifting of the dividing line towards the northwest in both the areas of semi-humid and semi-arid zone. The correlation analysis of wetland changes with meteorological factors from 1990 to 2012 indicated that the regional humidity differences and the interannual variation trend, caused by the change of precipitation and evaporation, was the main driving factor for the dynamic variation of wetland change in the TRH region. In the general, the increase of HI in the THR region since the 1990s, especially in the western TRH region, contributed to wetland increase continuously. The conclusions of this study will provide some scientific references for the management and protection of wetlands in the TRH region, especially for restoration, reconstruction and conservation of degradation wetland.																	1996-1073					APR	2014	7	4					2515	2534		10.3390/en7042515								WOS:000336217000033						
J	Oliveras, I; Anderson, LO; Malhi, Y				Oliveras, Immaculada; Anderson, Liana O.; Malhi, Yadvinder			Application of remote sensing to understanding fire regimes and biomass burning emissions of the tropical Andes	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												In the tropical Andes, there have been very few systematic studies aimed at understanding the biomass burning dynamics in the area. This paper seeks to advance on our understanding of burning regimes in this region, with the first detailed and comprehensive assessment of fire occurrence and the derived gross biomass burning emissions of an area of the Peruvian tropical Andes. We selected an area of 2.8 million hectares at altitudes over 2000m. We analyzed fire occurrence over a 12 year period with three types of satellite data. Fire dynamics showed a large intra-annual and interannual variability, with most fires occurring May-October (the period coinciding with the dry season). Total area burned decreased with increasing rainfall until a given rainfall threshold beyond which no relationship was found. The estimated fire return interval (FRI) for the area is 37years for grasslands, which is within the range reported for grasslands, and 65years for forests, which is remarkably shorter than other reported FRI in tropical moist forests. The greatest contribution (60-70%, depending on the data source) to biomass burning emissions came from burned montane cloud forests (4.5 million Mg CO2 over the study period), despite accounting for only 7.4-10% of the total burned area. Gross aboveground biomass emissions (7.552.14 Tg CO2; 0.430.04 Tg CO; 24,0122685Mg CH4 for the study area) were larger than previously reported for the tropical Andes.

J	Duputie, A; Zimmermann, NE; Chuine, I				Duputie, Anne; Zimmermann, Niklaus E.; Chuine, Isabelle			Where are the wild things? Why we need better data on species distribution	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim The effects of ongoing global change are causing increasing concern about the ability of species or biomes to shift or adapt. Tremendous efforts have been made to develop ever more sophisticated species distribution models to provide forecasts for the future of biodiversity. All these models rely on species occurrence data, either for calibration or validation. Here we evaluate (i) whether distribution data diverge among widely used sources, for supposedly well-known taxa, and (ii) to what extent these divergences affect species distribution models. Location Europe (as an example). Methods We compared the distribution maps of 21 of the most common European trees, according to four large-scale, putatively reliable sources of distribution data. For each species, we compared the outputs of correlative species distribution models built using occurrence data from each of these sources of data. We also investigated how discrepancies in large-scale occurrence data affected the validation scores of two process-based tree distribution models. Results Maps of tree occurrence diverged in 8-74% of the forested area, depending on species. These discrepancies affected projections of niche models: for example, 22-75% of the area projected as suitable by at least one model generated using one source of data was not projected as such by all other models. For most species, this proportion increased under scenarios of climate change, whatever the model used. To a lesser extent, uncertainties on current species distributions also affect the validation score of process-based distribution models. Main conclusions Reliable, widely used sources of occurrence data strongly diverge even for well-known taxa - the most common European trees. Scientists and stakeholders should acknowledge this gap in knowledge, since accurate data are a prerequisite to providing stakeholders with robust forecasts on biodiversity. Participatory science programmes and remote sensing techniques are promising tools for rapidly gathering such data.

However, few comparative studies evaluate the performance of classification algorithms with focus on tropical forests due to cloud effects. Advances in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) techniques and spatial resolution, mapping, and comparison of classification algorithms are possible. This research investigated the accuracy and processing speeds of five supervised classifiers, including Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, multi-layer perceptron, random forest (RF), and support vector machine, for land use-land cover (LULC) classification in a tropical region using time-series Advanced Land Observing Satellite-phased array type L-band SAR (ALOS-PALSAR) 25-m mosaic data. The study area is located in central Sumatra, Indonesia, where abundant forest-related carbon stocks exist. This investigation was intended to aid the implementation of a classification algorithm for the automatic creation of LULC classification maps. We perform object-based and pixel-based analyses to investigate the ability of the classifiers and their accuracies, respectively. RF had the best classification accuracy and processing speed in which the accuracies for 10 classes and 2 classes were 64.07% and 90.22% for pixel-based and 82.94% and 86.23% for object-based evaluations, respectively. These results indicate that RF is a useful classifier for the analysis of PALSAR mosaic data and that the automatic creation of highly accurate classification maps is possible by using time-series data. The outcome of this research will be valuable resources for biodiversity and global-warming mitigation efforts in the region.

Countryside biogeography of Neotropical reptiles and amphibians	ECOLOGY												The future of biodiversity and ecosystem services depends largely on the capacity of human-dominated ecosystems to support them, yet this capacity remains largely unknown. Using the framework of countryside biogeography, and working in the Las Cruces system of Coto Brus, Costa Rica, we assessed reptile and amphibian assemblages within four habitats that typify much of the Neotropics: sun coffee plantations (12 sites), pasture (12 sites), remnant forest elements (12 sites), and a larger, contiguous protected forest (3 sites in one forest). Through analysis of 1678 captures of 67 species, we draw four primary conclusions. First, we found that the majority of reptile (60%) and amphibian (70%) species in this study used an array of habitat types, including coffee plantations and actively grazed pastures. Second, we found that coffee plantations and pastures hosted rich, albeit different and less dense, reptile and amphibian biodiversity relative to the 326-ha Las Cruces Forest Reserve and neighboring forest elements. Third, we found that the small ribbons of "countryside forest elements" weaving through farmland collectively increased the effective size of a 326-ha local forest reserve 16-fold for reptiles and 14-fold for amphibians within our 236-km(2) study area. Therefore, countryside forest elements, often too small for most remote sensing techniques to identify, are contributing similar to 95% of the available habitat for forest-dependent reptiles and amphibians in our largely human-dominated study region. Fourth, we found large and pond-reproducing amphibians to prefer human-made habitats, whereas small, stream-reproducing, and directly developing species are more dependent on forest elements. Our investigation demonstrates that tropical farming landscapes can support substantial reptile and amphibian biodiversity. Our approach provides a framework for estimating the conservation value of the complex working landscapes that constitute roughly half of the global land surface, and which are experiencing intensification pressure worldwide.

Land use has significant effects on the ecosystem structure and functions, even its services. Using the remote sensing (RS), geographical information system and ecological economy theory, this paper analyzed land use changes of different eco-economic functional areas in Manas River Basin during the period 1958-2006 using different stage RS images. This paper selects the evaluation method obtained by Costanza et al. and Xie Gaodi, and the ecological sensitivity coefficient analysis, which analyzed the variation characteristics of eco-service values of different eco-economic functional areas. The results showed that the land use pattern has changed greatly from 1958 to 2006. The area of farmland and industrial area increased rapidly, while the forest area, grassland, water area and unutilized area decreased greatly. The total eco-service value of the river basin decreased from 3,529.64 US$ x 10(6) in 1958 to 2,559.88 US$ x 10(6) in 2006. There was 27.47 % net loss of 969.76 US$ x 10(6). The eco-service values of various land use types in the study area were close to the regional real values and the results were credible. There existed apparent temporal and spatial changes in the eco-service values of different eco-economic functional areas, and this significant change in the eco-service values was driven by economic development. Consequently, in view of eco-economic characteristics and ecological issues of various eco-economic functional areas, relevant strategies of ecological conservation were proposed for enhancing the general eco-service value of the river basin and realizing the regional sustainable development.

In this case study, we evaluated the potential and limitations of remotely sensed data in S-SDMs and addressed the commonly observed overestimation of species richness by S-SDMs. LocationMexico. MethodsPhenological and statistical metrics were derived from remotely sensed time series data (2001-2009) of the Terra-MODIS enhanced vegetation index and land surface temperature products. In a series of climatic and remote sensing-based SDMs, the distribution ranges of 40 species of the genus Pinus (Pinaceae) were modelled based on presence-only herbarium and field data using the maximum entropy algorithm and summed to estimate species richness. Three different species-specific thresholds were applied to convert continuous model predictions into binary maps. Modelled species richness was compared to independent data from the Mexican National Forest Inventory. ResultsThe inclusion of remote sensing data led to significantly better predictions of species richness in comparison to the climate-based models for the summed suitabilities and all thresholds considered. Both climatic and remote sensing-based models allowed us to identify the areas with the highest pine species richness based on presence-only data. Remote sensing-based models compare closely with climate-derived patterns, but provide better spatial resolution and more detailed information on local habitat availability. Main conclusionsThe results of this case study provide general guidance for the potential and limitations of using remote sensing data in S-SDMs. Our results confirmed that remote sensing data may not only have the capability for improving individual SDMs, but also can be a potential tool for reducing the overestimation of species richness by S-SDMs. This approach opens up new possibilities for species richness predictions in areas where biological survey data are scarce and where no species richness inventory data exist.																	0305-0270	1365-2699				APR	2014	41	4					736	748		10.1111/jbi.12225								WOS:000332781100009

A method for estimating colony sizes of Ad,lie penguins using remote sensing imagery	POLAR BIOLOGY												Ad,lie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) are important predators of krill (Euphausia spp.) and Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarctica) during summer, are a key indicator of the status of the Southern Ocean ecosystem, and are therefore a focal species for the Committee for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) Ecosystem Monitoring Program. The ability to monitor the population size of species potentially affected by Southern Ocean fisheries, i.e., the Ad,lie penguin, is critical for effective management of those resources. However, for several reasons, direct estimates of population size are not possible in many locations around Antarctica. In this study, we combine high-resolution (0.6 m) satellite imagery with spectral analysis in a supervised classification to estimate the sizes of Ad,lie penguin breeding colonies along Victoria Land in the Ross Sea and on the Antarctic Peninsula. Using satellite images paired with concurrent ground counts, we fit a generalized linear mixed model with Poisson errors to predict the abundance of breeding pairs as a function of the area of current-year guano staining identified in the satellite imagery. Guano-covered area proved to be an effective proxy for the number of penguins residing within. Our model provides a robust, quantitative mechanism for estimating the breeding population size of colonies captured in imagery and identifies terrain slope as a significant component influencing apparent nesting density. While our high-resolution satellite imagery technique was developed for the Ad,lie penguin, these principles are directly transferrable to other colonially nesting seabirds and other species that aggregate in fixed localities.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				APR	2014	37	4					507	517		10.1007/s00300-014-1451-8								WOS:000332770800006

Increasing tree cover while losing diverse natural forests in tropical Hainan, China	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												To protect biodiversity and improve environmental conditions, China has invested billions of dollars in reforestation and payments for ecosystem service programs. Here, we examine the Sloping Land Conversion Program, the largest such program in the world and found that after 13 years of implementation at our study site, it has had negative impacts on natural tropical forests. GIS and remote sensing techniques revealed that both natural forests and natural shrub and grasslands were replaced by non-native monocultural plantations on Hainan Island, China, a key tropical biodiversity hotspot. Under current Chinese policy, these plantations are classified simply as "forests", with the assumption that they are equivalent to natural forests. This lack of a distinction in forest quality has led to substantial deforestation and plantation expansion, including encroachment into protected areas on Hainan. Additional social and economic drivers of these changes were identified by examining the participants in this program and their actions. Without a new ecologically based definition of forests and new goals for reforestation, such programs designed to improve ecosystem services, and forest quality may actually threaten remaining natural forests and other vegetation types in Hainan and in other areas of mainland China.																	1436-3798	1436-378X				APR	2014	14	2			SI		611	621		10.1007/s10113-013-0512-9								WOS:000333267700014

Proper planning and management of a forest area are essentially needed to protect it from the grasp of burgeoning pressure of urban-industrial sprawl. Establishment of eco-sensitive zones (ESZs), which act as buffer areas around the core forests, is one of the key approaches towards achieving this goal. This paper deals with the applicability of geospatial techniques to identify the ESZ around an Indian wildlife sanctuary following the different rules and acts prescribed by the Government of India. Gumti Wildlife Sanctuary, located in the northeastern state of Tripura in India, has been selected here as a case study. Collected pieces of information on the distribution of biodiversity and human population in the area were also used to make the approach more holistic. As inferred from this study, remote sensing and geographical information systems were found to be easily implementable and time as well as cost-effective tools for this purpose with a distinct advantage of spatial as well as temporal accuracy in identifying the existing land use and land cover patterns in pilot assessments. However, the results indicated that only appropriate hybridization of field-based information on the biodiversity and ecological aspects of the forest as well as patterns of human interferences with the remote sensing and GIS-based data could make this approach more relevant in actual implementations.

One approach to improving the efficacy of natural forest conservation efforts is to refine local forest conservation policies based on insights from the place-based study of conservation policies and land-use and land-cover change (LULC) dynamics. To demonstrate the strength of this approach, this research explores the dynamics of LULC and conservation policies on the forest frontier of Madre de Dios, Peru. The main objectives of this research are to evaluate the efficacy of designated conservation lands in a rapidly expanding frontier landscape and to assess the effect on ecosystem conversion of granting conflicting land-use designations, such as mining concessions, inside conservation areas. Using statistical matching and a GIS-based analysis of LULC, this research shows that for the period 2006-2011, designated conservation lands on the forest frontier of Madre de Dios significantly reduced ecosystem losses compared to non-conservation lands, but the effect was highly variable across conservation designations. Also, when present, conflicting land-use authorizations inside conservation areas, specifically overlapping mining and agricultural titles, eliminated the policy additionality of designating lands for conservation. This finding demonstrates that authorizing conflicting land-use rights inside conservation areas should be avoided to ensure intended land conservation outcomes. This case study also provides examples of how local forest conservation policies can be improved through detailed and frequent analyses of LULC and conservation policies, particularly in dynamic frontier landscapes where LULC and socio-economic conditions are rapidly changing.

Assessment of reservoir sedimentation effect on coastal erosion in the case of Nestos River, Greece	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH												Coastal erosion that is generated by the reduction of the annual sediment yield at river outlets, due to the construction of reservoirs, constitutes one of the main environmental problems in many parts of the world. Nestos is one of the most important boundary rivers, flowing through Bulgaria and Greece, characterized by its great biodiversity. In the Greek part of the river, two reservoirs, the Thisavros Reservoir and the Platanovrysi Reservoir, have already been constructed and started operating in 1997 and 1999, respectively. The present paper constitutes the first attempt where the assessment of reservoir sedimentation effect on the coastal erosion for the case of the Nestos River delta and the adjacent shorelines is addressed in detail, through mathematical modeling, modern remote sensing techniques and field surveying. It is found that the construction and operation of the considered reservoirs have caused a dramatic decrease (about 83%) in the sediments supplied directly to the basin outlet and indirectly to the neighbouring coast and that this fact has almost inversed the erosion/accretion balance in the deltaic as well as the adjacent shorelines. Before the construction of the reservoirs, accretion predominated erosion by 25.36%, while just within five years after the construction of the reservoirs, erosion predominates accretion by 21.26%.

Detection of harvested forest areas in Italy using Landsat imagery	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												This study presents a thorough approach, based on the application of multi-spectral remote sensing Landsat imagery, to determine human-induced forest cover change in Italy during the decade 2002-2011. A total of 785.6 x 1 0(4) ha of forestland was mapped using the main forest classes described within the CORINE land cover 2006 database (3.11 - broad-leaved forest; 3.12 - coniferous forest; 3.13 - mixed forest). The approach employs multi-temporal Landsat imagery to determine large-scale spatiotemporal variations in forest cover with a high degree of precision. The semi-automated procedure is based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) pixel-oriented image differencing technique. The results were validated and rectified as a result of on-screen visual interpretation, whereby all the false-positive forest changes that were incorrectly mapped during the automatic procedure were identified and removed. The derived high-resolution data of forest cover change show that 317,535 ha (4.04% of the total forest area in Italy) were harvested during the period under review. The 125,272 individual clear-cut areas identified are mainly located within protected areas of the European Natura 2000 network. The outcome of this study is a publicly accessible database that can encourage further studies in the framework of international biodiversity and soil protection conventions (http://eusoils.jrc.ec.europa.eu/library/themes/erosion/italy/). The methodology can contribute to the monitoring of human-induced forest changes in support of the Kyoto Protocol. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Our objective was to address this need using an array of bioclimatic and remotely sensed data sets representing vegetation properties and structure, and other aspects of the physical environment. We first build models of bird species richness across breeding bird survey (BBS) routes, and then spatially predict richness across the coterminous US at moderately high spatial resolution (1 km). Predictor variables were derived from various sources and maps of species richness were generated for four groups (guilds) of birds with different breeding habitat affiliation (forest, grassland, open woodland, scrub/shrub), as well as all guilds combined. Predictions of forest bird distributions were strong (R-2 = 0.85), followed by grassland (0.76), scrub/shrub (0.63) and open woodland (0.60) species. Vegetation properties were generally the strongest determinants of species richness, whereas bioclimatic and lidar-derived vertical structure metrics were of variable importance and dependent upon the guild type. Environmental variables (climate and the physical environment) were also frequently selected predictors, but canopy structure variables were not as important as expected based on more local to regional scale studies. Relatively sparse sampling of canopy structure metrics from the satellite lidar sensor may have reduced their importance relative to other predictor variables across the study domain. We discuss these results in the context of the ecological drivers of species richness patterns, the spatial scale of bird diversity analyses, and the potential of next generation space-borne lidar systems relevant to vegetation and ecosystem studies. This study strengthens current understanding of bird species-climate-vegetation relationships, which could be further advanced with improved canopy structure information across spatial scales.

J	Lyons, Y				Lyons, Youna			Prospects for satellite imagery of insular features and surrounding marine habitats in the South China Sea	MARINE POLICY												This paper investigates the extent to which remote sensing data can contribute to the management of two parallel crises in the South China Sea (SCS); first the ongoing disputes related to islands and related maritime boundaries and second the degradation of the marine environment and the decrease in fish stocks. It demonstrates that remote sensing surveys are the only means to lawfully collect independent and verifiable geographic data on the disputed features without the need to consult all the claimants and thereby add to regional frictions and tensions. These surveys can contribute to the determination of whether these features are submerged or above water at high tide and what their physical characteristics are. This would inform the application of the Law of the Sea and help determine entitlements to maritime zones and thus access to resources. The other category of uses for remote sensing surveys which is explored is the identification and classification of marine habitats and the building of a biogeographic platform. This paper shows the limits created by unavoidable uncertainties in the interpretation of satellite imagery. However, many benefits outweigh the downsides: the potential for national and regional marine spatial planning, for the prioritization of marine environments in need of management, for the implementation by the States bordering the SCS of the international treaties which they have ratified and for ecological monitoring.

J	Miller, PI; Christodoulou, S				Miller, Peter I.; Christodoulou, Stelios			Frequent locations of oceanic fronts as an indicator of pelagic diversity: Application to marine protected areas and renewables	MARINE POLICY												Frequent locations of thermal fronts in UK shelf seas were identified using an archive of 30,000 satellite images acquired between 1999 and 2008, and applied as a proxy for pelagic diversity in the designation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Networks of MPAs are required for conservation of critical marine habitats within Europe, and there are similar initiatives worldwide. Many pelagic biodiversity hotspots are related to fronts, for example cetaceans and basking sharks around the Isle of Man, Hebrides and Cornwall, and hence remote sensing can address this policy need in regions with insufficient species distribution data. This is the first study of UK Continental Shelf front locations to use a 10-year archive of full-resolution (1.1 km) AVHRR data, revealing new aspects of their spatial and seasonal variability. Frontal locations determined at sea or predicted by ocean models agreed closely with the new frequent front maps, which also identified many additional frontal zones. These front Maps were among the most widely used datasets in the recommendation of UK MPAs, and would be applicable to other geographic regions and to other policy drivers such as facilitating the deployment of offshore renewable energy devices with minimal environmental impact.

J	Ramdani, F; Moffiet, T; Hino, M				Ramdani, Fatwa; Moffiet, Trevor; Hino, Masateru			Local surface temperature change due to expansion of oil palm plantation in Indonesia	CLIMATIC CHANGE												A high world demand for crude palm oil has caused a reduction in the area of Indonesia's tropical rainforests over the past several decades. Our hypothesis is that the expansion of the area devoted to oil palm plantations at the expense of primary and secondary tropical rainforests will increase the local surface temperature. While similar studies of other crops have been reported, this is the first time this particular hypothesis has been investigated and reported using the remote sensing methods described in this paper. In this study, we used remotely sensed data to quantify land use changes from tropical rainforests to oil palm plantations, calculated the surface temperature from thermal infrared data supplied by band 6 of the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), examined the correlations of surface temperature to foliage cover, and conducted field work to verify the results obtained using the remotely sensed data. For this study, we used a new spectral index, Principal Polar Spectral Greenness (PPSG), that is potentially more sensitive than other index to small changes in foliage cover at high cover levels. The outcome of satellite image processing is only 0.2 A degrees C different from direct temperature measurement in the field. Our study indicated that less density of the closed-canopy composition of oil palm trees resulted in higher surface temperature.

Multi-scale risk assessment of stream pollution by wastewater of olive oil mills in Kolymvari, Crete	EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS												In the streams of the Mediterranean island of Crete (Greece), olive mill wastewater (OMW) has been reported to reduce biodiversity up to 85 %. Mere conduction of impact assessment based on pollutant concentrations, however, cannot reveal how impacted areas may be connected to the pollution sources. In this study, we developed a new methodology which allows for a dynamic cause-effect linking of pollution sources and impacted areas through the pathways of OMW. Risk is hierarchically assessed and mapped at three different scales and more specifically, at the source scale (targeting olive mill units and their waste tanks), at the receptor scale (targeting potential impacted sites in the streams) and at the watershed scale (which is the scale of overall water management). The approach is based mainly on remote sensing data without taking account of groundwater regimes or field measurements. Involvement of local experts for recognizing spatial features of interest and selecting appropriate risk parameters was proved necessary and efficient in order to model the stream pollution risk realistically. Potential impacted sites in the stream network were occasionally verified by a field survey. The results comprise a set of risk maps at the three different scales. The constructed digital geo-database can be updated or modified and thus is considered to be a dynamic tool for future environmental management in the service of the local community.																	1865-0473	1865-0481				MAR	2014	7	1					47	58		10.1007/s12145-013-0133-3								WOS:000332013200005

Assessing deforestation and fragmentation in a tropical moist forest over 68 years; the impact of roads and legal protection in the Cockpit Country, Jamaica	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Historical data on landuse changes are important for interpreting the current status of natural systems such as forests. Analyses of road network dynamics can be particularly useful as network expansion is often a precursor to and an indicator of increased human activity. Legal protection is often seen as the most viable option available for protecting natural forests; but over the past decade, its effectiveness has been questioned. We assessed the impact of roads and the designation of a forest reserve on deforestation and forest fragmentation in a tropical moist forest, Cockpit Country, Jamaica, from 1942 to 2010. Specifically, we classified multi-temporal images (black and white aerial photographs, IKONOS and Geo-Eye images) using an object based image analysis and we included a vector of digitized roads for each year of assessment during the classification process. We then conducted a fragmentation analysis of the classified images and assessed the relationship between road density and several fragmentation metrics over time, and the spatial influence of the reserves (presence/absence) and roads (Euclidean distance from roads) on deforestation and several fragmentation metrics using generalized linear models. Between 1942 and 2010, road density nearly doubled (from 0.67 km/km(2) to 1.22 km/km2), with significant increases occurring within forest reserves, and was significantly related to the area-weighted mean shape index of the forest (forest patches became more regularly shaped and linear). Initially, relatively high deforestation rates and high levels of fragmentation between 1942 and 1961 were likely related to the large increase in road density. Deforestation and forest fragmentation were more likely to occur closer to roads over all time periods, and the magnitude/significance of this relationship peaked in subsequent time periods after road density doubled; but in the final time period, its influence declined. Legal protection afforded to the forest in the 1950s and 1960s coincided with an increase in total and core forest area and a reduction in deforestation rate, and deforestation and forest fragmentation were significantly lower inside the reserve. Therefore, the Forest Reserves were initially effective; however, their effectiveness waned after 1980. Increased deforestation and fragmentation in the 1980s and the 2000s indicate a more complex pattern of human encroachment, as these changes do not appear to have been influenced by changes to the road network, or by the presence of the Forest Reserves. Further research into the factors influencing human use of these forested areas is needed for effective management of the area. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Dynamic connectivity of temporary wetlands in the southern Great Plains	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												We quantified fluctuations in the status of individual patches (wetlands) in supporting connectivity within a network of playas, temporary wetlands of the southern Great Plains of North America that are loci for regional biodiversity. We used remote sensing imagery to delineate the location of surface waters in >8,000 playa basins in a similar to 31,900 km(2) portion of Texas and quantified connectivity in this region from 2007 to 2011. We ranked playas as stepping-stones, cutpoints, and hubs at different levels of environmental conditions (regionally wet, dry, and average periods of precipitation) for dispersal distances ranging from 0.5 to 34 km, representing a range of species' vagilities, to provide baseline dynamics within an area likely to experience disrupted connectivity due to anthropogenic activities. An individual playa's status as a stepping-stone, cutpoint, or hub was highly variable over time (only a single playa was a top 20 stepping-stone, cutpoint, or hub in >50 % of all of the dates examined). Coalescence of the inundated playa network usually occurred at >= 10 km dispersal distance and depended on wetland density, indicating that critical thresholds in connectivity arose from synergistic effects of dispersal ability (spatial scale) and wet playa occurrence (a function of precipitation). Organisms with dispersal capabilities limited to <10 km routinely experienced effective isolation during our study. Connectivity is thus a dynamic emergent landscape property, so management to maintain connectivity for wildlife within ephemeral habitats like inundated playas will need to move beyond a patch-based focus to a network focus by including connectivity as a dynamic landscape property.

Characterizing Shorea robusta communities in the part of Indian Terai landscape	JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH												Shorea robusta Gaertn. f. (Sal) is one of the important timber-yielding plants in India, which dominates the vegetation of Terai landscape of Uttar Pradesh state in India forming various communities based on its associations. The present study deals with delineation, mapping and characterization of various communities of Sal (Shorea robusta) forests in Terai landscape of Uttar Pradesh, India ranging across over 16 districts. Field survey and visual interpretation based forest vegetation type classification and mapping was carried out as part of the project entitled 'Biodiversity characterization at landscape level using remote sensing and GIS'. Indian Remote Sensing-P6 (Resourcesat-1) Linear Imaging Self Scanner-III satellite data was used during the study. The total area covered by different Sal forests was found to be approximately 2256.77 km(2). Sal communities were identified and characterized based on their spectral properties, physiognomy and phytosociological characteristics. Following nine Sal communities were identified, delineated and mapped with reasonable accuracy viz., Chandar, Damar, dry plains, moist plains, western alluvium, western alluvium plains, mixed moist deciduous, mixed dry deciduous and Siwalik. It is evident from the area estimates that mixed moist deciduous Sal is the most dominant community in the region covering around (1613.90 km(2)), other major communities were found as western alluvium plains Sal (362.44 km(2)), mixed dry deciduous Sal (362.44 km(2)) and dry plains Sal (107.71 km(2)). The Terai landscape of Uttar Pradesh faces tremendous anthropogenic pressure leading to deterioration of the forests. Community level information could be used monitoring the status as well as for micro level conservation and planning of the Sal forests in Terai Landscape of Uttar Pradesh.				matin, shafique/F-2111-2015	matin, shafique/0000-0002-8533-2148; CHITALE, VISHWAS/0000-0001-8661-8204												1007-662X	1993-0607				MAR	2014	25	1					121	128		10.1007/s11676-013-0396-z								WOS:000330202600014

This study presents a detailed spatial, quantitative assessment of the variation in the value of ecosystem services based on land use change in national nature reserves of the Ningxia autonomous region in China. We used areas of land use types calculated from the remote sensing data and the adjusted value coefficients to assess the value of ecosystem services for the years 2000, 2005, and 2010, analyzing the fluctuations in the valuation of ecosystem services in response to land use change. With increases in the areas of forest land and water bodies, the value of ecosystem services increased from 182.3x10(7) to 223.8x10(7) US$ during 2000-2010. Grassland and forest land accounted for 90% of this increase. The values of all ecosystem services increased during this period, especially the value of ecosystem services for biodiversity protection and soil formation and protection. Ecological restoration in the reserves had a positive effect on the value of ecosystem services during 2000-2010.																	1932-6203					FEB 19	2014	9	2							e89174	10.1371/journal.pone.0089174								WOS:000331711900100	24586571

PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Recent advances in remote sensing technologies have facilitated the generation of very high resolution (VHR) environmental data. Exploratory studies suggested that, if used in species distribution models (SDMs), these data should enable modelling species' micro-habitats and allow improving predictions for fine-scale biodiversity management. In the present study, we tested the influence, in SDMs, of predictors derived from a VHR digital elevation model (DEM) by comparing the predictive power of models for 239 plant species and their assemblages fitted at six different resolutions in the Swiss Alps. We also tested whether changes of the model quality for a species is related to its functional and ecological characteristics. Refining the resolution only contributed to slight improvement of the models for more than half of the examined species, with the best results obtained at 5 m, but no significant improvement was observed, on average, across all species. Contrary to our expectations, we could not consistently correlate the changes in model performance with species characteristics such as vegetation height. Temperature, the most important variable in the SDMs across the different resolutions, did not contribute any substantial improvement. Our results suggest that improving resolution of topographic data only is not sufficient to improve SDM predictions - and therefore local management - compared to previously used resolutions (here 25 and 100 m). More effort should be dedicated now to conduct finer-scale in-situ environmental measurements (e.g. for temperature, moisture, snow) to obtain improved environmental measurements for fine-scale species mapping and management.

Rapid expansion of croplands in Chihuahua, Mexico threatens declining North American grassland bird species	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Grasslands are one of the most imperiled ecosystems worldwide. Conversion to cropland and desertification, including shrub encroachment, are primary factors behind the loss of temperate grasslands across the globe. Governments and conservation organizations in North America have identified the highest priority grasslands from Canada to Mexico in an effort to conserve grassland biodiversity, particularly migratory birds. Twenty-nine of 33 (88%) grassland-obligate bird species breeding in western North America's Great Plains are migratory and 90% of these overwinter in the Chihuahuan Desert. The 2.7 M ha Valles Centrales is a region of northern Mexico comprised of desert shrublands, mountains and grassland valleys. It supports wintering populations of 28 migratory grassland bird species from the Great Plains, in addition to threatened and endangered species in Mexico such as Aplomado Falcon (Falco femoralis), Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana mexicana) and others. Using remote sensing, we documented a 6.04% annual rate of cropland expansion in the Valles Centrales from 2006 to 2011, resulting in a loss of 69,240 ha of valley-bottom grasslands and shrub lands. Open grasslands are the principle habitat for most declining, grassland-obligate bird species. Expansion of center-pivot irrigated cropland was the primary driver of grassland loss. The area cleared for agriculture, as determined via remote sensing, exceeded the amount of land that had been permitted for land-use change to cropland, according to government records, by >2000%. As a consequence of this habitat loss, we estimate the winter carrying capacity for 28 species of grassland birds in this region has been reduced by approximately 355,142 individual birds. At the current rate, the ongoing expansion of ground-water irrigated cropland could eliminate the remaining low-slope valley bottom grasslands from the Valles Centrales region by 2025. Cumulative grassland losses in the Chihuahuan Desert could have severe impacts on global populations of declining migratory grassland birds, as well as several threatened and endangered species. Our findings demand an urgent call to action by governments and responsible resource management agencies to work with the agricultural sectors to address land use change, sustainable agriculture and grassland ecosystem services in this globally-important region for grassland birds and biodiversity.

However, pressure on these forests is strong and deforestation continues on a large scale. To quantify recent forest loss, we used a series of satellite images (1973-2010) for estimating annual deforestation rates. The overall rate was 0.67 %, but it accelerated during certain periods to over 1.5 % with a maximum of 2.55 % per year between 2008 and 2010. Not all areas within the forest block of the central Menabe are affected similarly. Areas surrounding existing clearings show the highest losses of largely undisturbed forest. If deforestation continues at the same rate as during the last years, 50 % of the 1973 forest cover will be gone within the next 11-37 years.																	1436-3798	1436-378X				FEB	2014	14	1			SI		157	166		10.1007/s10113-013-0475-x								WOS:000333261900014						
J	Yang, F; Matsushita, B; Yang, W; Fukushima, T				Yang, Fan; Matsushita, Bunkei; Yang, Wei; Fukushima, Takehiko			Mapping the human footprint from satellite measurements in Japan	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Due to increasing global urbanization and climate change, the quantification of "human footprints" has become an urgent goal in the fields of biodiversity conservation and regional environment management. A human footprint is defined as the impact of a particular human activity on the Earth's surface, which can be represented mainly by impervious surfaces (related to industry and urbanization) and cropland (related to agriculture). Here we present a method called sorted temporal mixture analysis with post-classification (STMAP) for mapping impervious surfaces and cropland simultaneously at the subpixel level to fill the demand for precise human footprint information on a national scale. The STMAP method applies a four-endmember sorted temporal mixture analysis to provide the initial fractions of evergreen forests, deciduous forests, cropland, and impervious surfaces as a first step. Endmembers are selected from the sorted temporal profiles of the MODIS-normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), as guided by a principal component analysis. The yearly maximum land surface temperatures and averaged stable nighttime light are then statistically analyzed to provide the thresholds for post-classification to further separate cropland from deciduous forest and bare land from impervious surface. As the four outputs of STMAP, the fractions of forest, cropland, impervious surfaces and bare land are derived. We used the reference maps of impervious surfaces and cropland obtained from the Landsat/TM and ALOS precise land-use/land-cover map at the subpixel level to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, respectively. Historical satellite images with high spatial resolution were used to further evaluate the cropland results derived with the STMAP method. The results showed that the STMAP method has promising accuracy for estimating impervious surfaces and cropland in Japan. The root mean square errors obtained with the STMAP method were 6.3% for the estimation of impervious surfaces and 9.8% for the estimation of cropland. Our findings can extend the applications of remote sensing technologies in ecological research and environment management on a large scale.

The decision tree algorithm is based on a number of input variables including matching score and infeasibility images from Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering (MTMF), land-cover maps, tree height information derived from high resolution stereo imagery, polarimetric feature images, Radar Forest Degradation Index (RFDI), polarimetric and InSAR coherence and phase difference images. Spatial distributions of the study organisms are mapped using pixel-based Winner-Takes-All (WTA) algorithm, object oriented feature extraction, spectral unmixing, and compared with the newly developed decision tree approach. Our results show that the InSAR phase difference and PolInSAR HH-VV coherence images of L-band PALSAR data are the most important variables following the MTMF outputs in mapping subcanopy invasive plant species in tropical rainforest. We also show that the three types of invasive plants alone occupy about 17.6% of the Betampona Nature Reserve (BNR) while mixed forest, shrubland and grassland areas are summed to 11.9% of the reserve. This work presents the first systematic attempt to evaluate forest degradation, habitat quality and invasive plant statistics in the BNR, and provides significant insights as to management strategies for the control of invasive plants and conversation in the reserve.

In this study, we investigated this general statement for regulating and supporting services via an assessment of ecosystem functions: climate regulation via carbon sequestration in soil and plant biomass, water cycle and soil erosion regulation via water infiltration in soil, and support for primary production via soil chemical quality and water storage. We tested the hypothesis that patterns of land-cover composition and structure significantly alter ES metrics at two different scales. We surveyed 54 farms in two Amazonian regions of Brazil and Colombia and assessed land-cover composition and structure from remote sensing data (farm scale) from 1990 to 2007. Simple and well-established methods were used to characterize soil and vegetation from five points in each farm (plot scale). Most ES metrics were significantly correlated with land-use (plot scale) and land-cover (farm scale) classifications; however, spatial variability in inherent soil properties, alone or in interaction with land-use or land-cover changes, contributed greatly to variability in ES metrics. Carbon stock in above-ground plant biomass and water infiltration rate decreased from forest to pasture land covers, whereas soil chemical quality and plant-available water storage capacity increased. Land-cover classifications based on structure metrics explained significantly less ES metric variation than those based on composition metrics. Land-cover composition dynamics explained 45 % (P < 0.001) of ES metric variance, 15 % by itself and 30 % in interaction with inherent soil properties. This study describes how ES evolve with landscape changes, specifying the contribution of spatial variability in the physical environment and highlighting trade-offs and synergies among ES.

Sudden large disturbances (e.g., typhoons and earthquakes) can have a significant and immediate impact on landscapes and ecosystem services. This study explored how precipitation variation (PV) and land use/land cover (LULC) changes caused by multiple disturbances can cumulatively impact ecosystem functioning in the Chenyulan watershed in central Taiwan. We simulated four ecosystem services (water yield production, water purification, soil conservation, carbon storage) and biodiversity using the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) model to analyze the spatiotemporal changes and obtain information regarding changes in the ecosystem. Our results indicate that the Chi-Chi earthquake had the greatest impact on the ecosystem. Specifically, the ecosystem was altered by the earthquake and could no longer absorb disturbances of a similar magnitude as before the earthquake. By differentiating the impacts of the PV and LULC changes on ecosystem services and biodiversity, we observe that the PV had a stronger impact on water yield and soil conservation, whereas the LULC change had a stronger impact on water purification. Our results also suggest that a comprehensive ecosystem management plan should consider the cumulative and hierarchical context of disturbance regimes to prevent reductions in ecological variability and ecosystem resilience, particularly in areas that are more sensitive to large disturbances. In this way, ecosystem resilience may be maintained at a level sufficient to preserve ecosystem functioning and ecosystem services in the event of unexpected large-scale environmental disturbances.

However, detailed data about forest habitat characteristics across large areas are often incomplete due to difficulties associated with field sampling methods. To overcome this limitation we employed a nationally available light detection and ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing dataset to develop variables describing forest landscape structure across a large environmental gradient in Switzerland. Using a model species indicative of structurally rich mountain forests (hazel grouse Bonasa bonasia), we tested the potential of such variables to predict species occurrence and evaluated the additional benefit of LiDAR data when used in combination with traditional, sample plot-based field variables. We calibrated boosted regression trees (BRT) models for both variable sets separately and in combination, and compared the models' accuracies. While both field-based and LiDAR models performed well, combining the two data sources improved the accuracy of the species' habitat model. The variables retained from the two datasets held different types of information: field variables mostly quantified food resources and cover in the field and shrub layer, LiDAR variables characterized heterogeneity of vegetation structure which correlated with field variables describing the understory and ground vegetation. When combined with data on forest vegetation composition from field surveys, LiDAR provides valuable complementary information for encompassing species niches more comprehensively. Thus, LiDAR bridges the gap between precise, locally restricted field-data and coarse digital land cover information by reliably identifying habitat structure and quality across large areas.

Remote sensing of plant communities as a tool for assessing the condition of semiarid Mediterranean saline wetlands in agricultural catchments	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Semiarid Mediterranean saline wetlands are unique ecosystems sheltering high biodiversity. In the last decades, the expansion of irrigated lands has led to hydrological imbalances in Mediterranean catchments, causing wetland degradation. Vegetation composition assessment is considered an important tool for evaluating wetland ecological condition and can be mapped using remote sensing. This study aims to develop a condition index based on plant community composition suitable for semiarid Mediterranean saline wetlands, as well as to test the applicability of airborne multispectral remote sensors for discriminating plant communities. Characteristic plant communities of 12 wetlands were identified by means of ordination and classification analysis of plant taxa cover percentages obtained through fieldwork sampling. An index for assessing wetland ecological condition was developed based on the relationship between wetland plant community composition and watershed hydrological condition. Selected wetland plant communities were then mapped by means of remote sensing techniques using random forest algorithm for supervised classification of airborne images. Following this methodology, remote sensing served as a tool for wetland condition assessment at a regional scale. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Cord, AF; Klein, D; Mora, F; Dech, S				Cord, Anna F.; Klein, Doris; Mora, Franz; Dech, Stefan			Comparing the suitability of classified land cover data and remote sensing variables for modeling distribution patterns of plants	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Given the rapid loss of biodiversity worldwide and the resulting impacts on ecosystem functions and services, we more than ever rely on current and spatially continuous assessments of species distributions for biodiversity conservation and sustainable land management. Over the last decade, the usefulness of categorical land cover data to account for the human-induced degradation, transformation and loss of natural habitat in species distribution models (SDMs) has been questioned and the number of studies directly analyzing remotely sensed variables has lately multiplied. While several assumptions support the advantages of remote sensing data, an empirical comparison is still lacking. The objective of this study was to bridge this gap and compare the suitability of an existing categorical land cover classification and of continuous remote sensing variables for modeling the distribution patterns of 30 Mexican tree species. We applied the Maximum Entropy algorithm to predict species distributions based on both data types independently, quantified model performance and analyzed species-land cover relationships in detail. As part of this comparison, we focused on two particular aspects, namely the effects of (1) thematic detail and (2) spatial resolution of the land cover data on model performance. Our analysis revealed that remote sensing data were significantly better model predictors and that the main obstacle of the land cover-based SDMs were their bolder predictions, together with their overall overestimation of suitability. Among the land cover-based models, we found that thematic detail was more important than spatial resolution for SDM performance. However, our results also suggest that the suitability of land cover data differs largely among species and is dependent on their habitat distinctiveness. Our findings have relevant implications for future species distribution modeling studies which aim at complementing their set of topo-climatic predictors by data on land surface characteristics.

Tropical rainforest biodiversity and aboveground carbon changes and uncertainties in the Selva Central, Peru	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Tropical deforestation has reduced the extent of natural forests, which conserve biodiversity, provide essential resources to people, and reduce climate change by storing carbon. Forest conservation projects need tree species data to effectively manage biodiversity while greenhouse gas reduction programs require robust methods to estimate forest carbon. Here, we use field measurements, remote sensing, and Monte Carlo analyses to quantify tree biodiversity and aboveground carbon changes and uncertainties in 5200 km(2) of Amazonian and Yungas rainforest and other land around the Parque Nacional Yanachaga-Chemillen and two other protected areas in the Selva Central, Peru. Field inventories of 17 ha found 438 tree species in 156 families. Field measurements of 10,838 trees and Monte Carlo analyses of uncertainties in measurements, allometric equations, wood density, and the carbon fraction of biomass showed that aboveground live carbon densities were 93 +/- 39 Mg ha(-1) (mean +/- 95% confidence interval [CI]) in old-growth forest and 40 +/- 10 Mg ha(-1) in secondary forest. Carbon density was significantly correlated to tree species richness (P < 0.0001). Supervised classification of Landsat images showed a 1989-2005 net deforestation rate of 0.3% y(-1), reduction of forest cover from three-quarters of the area to two-thirds, and net degradation of additional forest equivalent to half the deforested area. A Monte Carlo analysis that combined carbon density and remote sensing uncertainties showed that forest changes caused statistically significant net emissions of 1.6 +/- 0.4 million Mg carbon. Allometric equations and remote sensing accounted for most of the uncertainty. Multivariate statistical analyses showed that, of six factors examined, distance to roads most explained historical deforestation patterns. The protected areas experienced no net deforestation, very low degradation, and very low change close to roads. Projection of potential forest cover to 2021 indicates that a Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) project could avoid gross emissions of 2.8 +/- 0.8 million Mg carbon. One-eighth of the area would be eligible for afforestation or reforestation under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), with credit for carbon storage occurring above a projected baseline gross reforestation rate of 1.8% y(-1). These activities could conserve tropical forest carbon and biodiversity. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Owers, CJ; Kavanagh, RP; Bruce, E				Owers, Christopher J.; Kavanagh, Rodney P.; Bruce, Eleanor			Remote sensing can locate and assess the changing abundance of hollow-bearing trees for wildlife in Australian native forests	WILDLIFE RESEARCH												Context. Hollow-bearing trees are an important breeding and shelter resource for wildlife in Australian native forests and hollow availability can influence species abundance and diversity in forest ecosystems. A persistent problem for forest managers is the ability to locate and survey hollow-bearing trees with a high level of accuracy at low cost over large areas of forest. Aims. The aim of this study was to determine whether remote-sensing techniques could identify key variables useful in classifying the likelihood of a tree to contain hollows suitable for wildlife. Methods. The data were high-resolution, multispectral aerial imagery and light detection and ranging (Lidar). A ground-based survey of 194 trees, 96 Eucalyptus crebra and 98 E. chloroclada and E. blakelyi, were used to train and validate tree-senescence classification models. Key results. We found that trees in the youngest stage of tree senescence, which had a very low probability of hollow occurrence, could be distinguished using multispectral aerial imagery from trees in the later stages of tree senescence, which had a high probability of hollow occurrence. Independently, the canopy-height model used to estimate crown foliage density demonstrated the potential of Lidar-derived structural parameters as predictors of senescence and the hollow-bearing status of individual trees. Conclusions. This study demonstrated a 'proof of concept' that remotely sensed tree parameters are suitable predictor variables for the hollow-bearing status of an individual tree. Implications. Distinguishing early stage senescence trees from later-stage senescence trees using remote sensing offers potential as an efficient, repeatable and cost-effective way to map the distribution and abundance of hollow-bearing trees across the landscape. Further development is required to automate this process across the landscape, particularly the delineation of tree crowns. Further improvements may be obtained using a combination of these remote-sensing techniques. This information has important applications in commercial forest inventory and in biodiversity monitoring programs.																	1035-3712	1448-5494					2014	41	8					703	716		10.1071/WR14168								WOS:000353148500008

The raw data of the rare animals' habitat areas and the monitoring data are usually in large scale and isolated without any semantic information when to comprehensive analyze. In this paper, we introduce the linked data concept to the knowledge for the biologists to reveal the relationship between ecological environment and biological diversity by the semantic analysis. Our key idea is the notion of linking different raw sources via spatial-temporal continuum based on migration habitats discovered by agglomerative clustering with biologic semantic analysis of the linked biotope data. The first step is to derive the habitats by clustering, and then to link the raw data, at last, to analyze the biological significance based on the linked data. One of our results is the clustering areas, an illusive map depicting the breeding and wintering home range of monitored birds, and the other is the linked data platform based on the clustered habitats, and the linked data sets includes the census data of waterfowl and plant, meteorological data, remote sensing data, video data and so on, the core result is the semantic analysis chart which reveal the interaction of species and environment.																			978-1-60595-198-0				2014							143	156										WOS:000351916000018

Together with standardized ground plots and regular in-situ measurements, remote sensing is a powerful device that can contribute to a better understanding of the diversity of natural and semi-natural habitats and to monitor their phenology. In this paper, we implemented a systematic test of the suitability of multiseasonal remote sensing data for monitoring the phenological variations of natural habitats in a Mediterranean landscape. Six multispectral sensor signals were simulated for comparison based on their spectral response curves and in-situ averaged spectra collected at monthly intervals between February and October 2013 (IKONOS, Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 8, Pleiades, Sentinel-2, and Worldview-2). The simulations and comparisons performed in this study showed that Sentinel-2 sensor has the higher sensitivity to the variations in the coverage of photosynthetic vegetation, thus offering interesting perspectives for operational monitoring of natural habitats.

In several countries the history of NFIs is very long. For these countries a specific challenge is to keep the inventories up-to-date without sacrificing the advantages associated with long time series. At the turn of the 20th century European NFIs faced some major challenges. In this article we describe the history and the recent developments of the Swedish NFI as an example from which general observations are made and discussed. The Swedish NFI started in 1923 and has evolved from an inventory with a narrow focus on wood resources to an inventory today which aims to provide information about all major forest ecosystem services. It can be concluded that the traditional approaches of most European NFIs, e.g. to collect data through sample plot field inventories, has proved to be applicable even for a wide range of new information requirements. Specifically, detailed data about land use, trees, vegetation, and soils has found new important uses in connection with biodiversity assessments and the estimation of greenhouse gas emissions. Though time-consuming and difficult, making NFI information comparable across countries through harmonization appears to be a useful approach. The European National Forest Inventory Network (ENFIN) was formed in 2003 and has been successful in pan-European NFI harmonization.																	0037-5330	2242-4075					2014	48	3							1095	10.14214/sf.1095								WOS:000343873600003						
J	Gokyer, E				Gokyer, Ercan			MONITORING LANDSCAPE CHANGE AND URBAN GROWTH OF BARTIN, TURKEY, AND ITS ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												This study aimed to analyse landscape change (LC)/urban growth and its negative effects during a 27-years period of Bartin, Turkey. Landscapes have been impacted over time as a result of human interventions and natural circumstances in the northern part of Turkey. There is a restricted research on LC/urban growth and its negative effects in the city of Bartin and its environments. LC information was derived from remote sensing images acquired in 1986, 2000, and 2013, respectively. The results showed that the urban area of Bartin has expanded approximately four times between 1986 and 2013. In this study, environmental problems that resulted from LC and urban growth, such as floods, air pollution and water pollution, were highlighted and discussed in the study area.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2014	23	10					2407	2414										WOS:000349805200006

The continuing expansion of plantations has many environmental consequences, including the loss and fragmentation of habitat, alteration of nutrient cycling processes, reduction in environmentally sequestered carbon, increased soil erosion and land degradation, and loss of biodiversity. The primary goal of this research was to develop and test remote sensing methods to detect the expansion of plantations in the southern part of the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR). We used Landsat satellite imagery acquired between 2003 and 2012. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to three Landsat temporal image pairs (2003-2006, 2006-2009 and 2009-2012) to identify areas of change. Change identification accuracy was evaluated by comparison against 1,240 random sample locations which had been independently classified from Google Earth imagery from 2006 and 2012. It was found that one of the principal components detected change in areas of plantation in the study area, with producer's accuracy of 92% and user's accuracy of 79%. This method was relatively easy to implement, involved no image purchase costs, and could be used by ecologists or forestry managers seeking to monitor forest loss or plantation expansion.

The New Caledonia lagoon lies in the Southwestern Tropical Pacific around 21 degrees 30' S and 166 degrees 30' E, with a great marine biodiversity in UNESCO Heritage coral reefs, benthic sea grass, and benthic communities. They are largely connected to the open ocean in the southern and eastern parts, but only by narrow passes in the southwest part. The trophic state is linked to spatial variations in flushing times. High run offs due to rain carrying abundant chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and particle loads may greatly impact the functioning of ecosystems while rivers and sewage effluents may induce localized impacts. Two oceanographic cruises (CALIOPE 1 in 2011 and CALIOPE 2 in 2014) were carried out off the Eastern Coast of New Caledonia during a calm dry period and during high winds, respectively. Multi-and hyper-spectral marine reflectance was measured with a SIMBADA instrument and a TRIOS radiometer system, together with inherent optical properties (total and CDOM absorption coefficients with a PSICAM, in situ absorption and scattering with an AC9, backscattering with a Hydroscat-6). Fluorescence of CDOM (EEM/PARAFAC) was measured on collected 0.2 mu m filtered samples. In 2014, Satlantic and FieldSpec hyper-spectral radiometers were available for in-water profiling of upwelling radiance and downwelling irradiance and above-water reflectance measurements, respectively. Inherent and apparent optical data from the two cruises are compared and used to estimate ocean color algorithms performance and evaluate a Linear Matrix Inversion method, providing tools for remote sensing on this highly under-sampled coastal region of New Caledonia.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-62841-328-1				2014	9261								UNSP 92610M	10.1117/12.2073309								WOS:000348837900014

The geopark has plenty of geoheritage resources, including the quaternary glacier landform, volcanic landscape, hot spring, desert, grassland, rivers, and lakes. It is famous owing to the geodiversity and biodiversity. The wetlands resources are rich and play an important role in maintaining the ecosystem and biodiversity. However, the monitoring and protection of wetlands are rarely reported. In this study, the remotely sensed data coupled with field survey and experimental data are used to systematically reveal the types, characteristics, and protection of the wetlands. The wetlands are classified into three types, i.e., lakes wetlands, river wetlands, meadow marshes, and swamps wetlands. In addition, the spatial distribution and mineral contents of various wetlands are analyzed. Finally, several protection suggestions are proposed. These results will be helpful to promote the management and protection of the wetlands.																	1746-4463		978-1-84564-829-9; 978-1-84564-828-2				2014	46						2521	2526		10.2495/ISME20133413								WOS:000346563503084

A CASE STUDY OF IZMIR HIGHWAY	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												Natural habitats and ecological systems provide living space for one or more living beings, and they are the source of biodiversity on Earth. Integrity of ecosystems impetuously collapse due to unplanned urbanisation, misuse of lands and excessive consumption of natural resources by human beings. Additionally, monitoring studies are not sufficient to plan preventions. The main aim of this study is to set a precedent by monitoring the damage, the pressure and time-dependent changes, which are caused by highway projects planned without analysing ecosystem flexibility, on natural habitats through the use of remote sensing technique and GIS. The effects of highway projects on habitats are investigated with respect to two different points of view. The first one is that highway projects directly invade and divide habitats. The other one is that highways become centre of attractions for residential and industrial zones, and demand for settlements increases around highways. The research area of this study is the most seriously affected natural area in Aegean region where Izmir-Aydin highway passes through. The changes in the research area in terms of land usage from 1984 to 2014 were analysed by satellite images. The size of industrial and residential zones in the research area was 138 ha in 1984. The size of industrial and residential zone has increased by 1.225% and reached to 1.690 ha as industrial and residential zones became denser throughout the highway. As a result of this study, it was determined that Izmir-Aydin highway has irreversibly split and destroyed substantial part of the natural habitat.

J	Wohlfart, C; Wegmann, M; Leimgruber, P				Wohlfart, Christian; Wegmann, Martin; Leimgruber, Peter			Mapping threatened dry deciduous dipterocarp forest in South-east Asia for conservation management	TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE												Habitat loss is the primary reason for species extinction, making habitat conservation a critical strategy for maintaining global biodiversity. Major habitat types, such as lowland tropical evergreen forests or mangrove forests, are already well represented in many conservation priorities, while others are underrepresented. This is particularly true for dry deciduous dipterocarp forests (DDF), a key forest type in Asia that extends from the tropical to the subtropical regions in South-east Asia (SE Asia), where high temperatures and pronounced seasonal precipitation patterns are predominant. DDF are a unique forest ecosystem type harboring a wide range of important and endemic species and need to be adequately represented in global biodiversity conservation strategies. One of the greatest challenges in DDF conservation is the lack of detailed and accurate maps of their distribution due to inaccurate open-canopy seasonal forest mapping methods. Conventional land cover maps therefore tend to perform inadequately with DDF. Our study accurately delineates DDF on a continental scale based on remote sensing approaches by integrating the strong, characteristic seasonality of DDF. We also determine the current conservation status of DDF throughout SE Asia. We chose SE Asia for our research because its remaining DDF are extensive in some areas but are currently degrading and under increasing pressure from significant socio-economic changes throughout the region. Phenological indices, derived from MODIS vegetation index time series, served as input variables for a Random Forest classifier and were used to predict the spatial distribution of DDF. The resulting continuous fields maps of DDF had accuracies ranging from R-2 = 0.56 to 0.78. We identified three hotspots in SE Asia with a total area of 156,000 km(2), and found Myanmar to have more remaining DDF than the countries in SE Asia. Our approach proved to be a reliable method for mapping DDF and other seasonally influenced ecosystems on continental and regional scales, and is very valuable for conservation management in this region.

A broad range of remotely sensed data is available to map these small linear elements in rural landscapes, but only a few of them have been evaluated for this purpose. In this study, we evaluate and compare various optical remote-sensing data including high and very high spatial resolution, active and passive, and airborne and satellite data to produce quantitative information on the hedgerow network structure and to analyse qualitative information from the maps produced in order to estimate the true value of these maps. We used an object-based image analysis that proved to be efficient for detecting and mapping thin elements in complex landscapes. The analysis was performed at two scales, the hedgerow network scale and the tree canopy scale, on a study site that shows a strong landscape gradient of wooded hedgerow density. The results (1) highlight the key role of spectral resolution on the detection and mapping of wooded elements with remotely sensed data; (2) underline the fact that every satellite image provides relevant information on wooded network structures, even in closed landscape units, whatever the spatial resolution; and (3) indicate that light detection and ranging data offer important insights into future strategies for monitoring hedgerows.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2014	35	21					7376	7399		10.1080/01431161.2014.968683								WOS:000346052200003						
J	Bae, S; Reineking, B; Ewald, M; Mueller, J				Bae, Soyeon; Reineking, Bjoern; Ewald, Michael; Mueller, Joerg			Comparison of airborne lidar, aerial photography, and field surveys to model the habitat suitability of a cryptic forest species - the hazel grouse	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Light detection and ranging (lidar) is a useful tool for measuring three-dimensional habitat structure; hence, its use in habitat suitability models has been explored, both as a single resource and in combination with other remote-sensing techniques. Here, we evaluated the suitability of airborne lidar data in comparison with aerial photographs and field surveys for modelling the distribution of an endangered and cryptic forest species, the hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia). The study was conducted in the Bavarian Forest National Park of southeast Germany. Subsequently, a prediction map for conservation planning was generated for a large area, which encompassed the National Park. We examined the utility of lidar data for generating a hazel grouse distribution model by using machine learning (boosted regression trees), and then compared the results to variables derived from field surveys and aerial photographs, both separately and in combination. The cross-validated discrimination ability of the model was slightly higher when using lidar data (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), 0.79) compared to models using aerial photographs (AUC, 0.75) or field survey data (AUC, 0.78). The predictive performance consistently increased when combining the predictors from different sources, with an AUC of 0.86 being produced in the model combining all three data sources. The three data sources complemented one another, with each data source probably having an advantage at deriving one of three key aspects of the hazel grouse habitat, namely, vertically well-structured forest stands, horizontally mixed successional vegetation stages, and certain deciduous trees as food resources such as mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia). In addition, the diverse lidar metrics might be applied to simultaneously characterize vertically and horizontally well-structured forest stands. We conclude that public available airborne lidar data are a viable source for creating habitat suitability maps for large areas and may have increased utility for detecting forest characteristics and valuable wildlife habitats.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2014	35	17					6469	6489		10.1080/01431161.2014.955145								WOS:000345706300006

Rapid assessment and monitoring using remote sensing on biodiversity of tropical forests is needed to predict and evaluate biodiversity loss by human activities. Identification of reliable indicators of forest biodiversity and/or its loss is an urgent issue. In the present paper, we propose the density of road networks in tropical forests can be a good and practical indicator of human impacts on biodiversity in tropical forests through reviewing papers and introducing our preliminary survey in peninsular Malaysia. Many previous studies suggest a strong negative impact of forest roads on biodiversity in tropical rainforests since they changes microclimate, soil properties, drainage patterns, canopy openness and forest accessibility. Moreover, our preliminary survey also showed that even a narrow logging road (6 m wide) significantly lowered abundance of dung beetles (well-known bio-indicator in biodiversity survey in tropical forests) near the road. Since these road networks are readily to be detected with remote sensing approach such as aerial photographs and Lider, regulation and monitoring of the road networks using remote sensing techniques is a key to slow down the rate of biodiversity loss due to forest degradation in tropical forests.																	1755-1307						2014	18								UNSP 012092	10.1088/1755-1315/18/1/012092								WOS:000345268900092

Accurate information about oil palm plantation and the age of plantation is important for a sustainable production, estimation of carbon storage capacity, biodiversity and the climate model. However, the problem is that this information cannot be extracted easily due to the spectral signature for forest and age group of palm oil plantations is similar. Therefore, a noble approach "multi-scale and multi-texture algorithms" was used for mapping vegetation and different age groups of palm oil plantation using a high resolution panchromatic image (WorldView-1) considering the fact that pan imagery has a potential for more detailed and accurate mapping with an effective image processing technique. Seven texture algorithms of second-order Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) with different scales (from 3x3 to 39x39) were used for texture generation. All texture parameters were classified step by step using a robust classifier "Artificial Neural Network (ANN)". Results indicate that single spectral band was unable to provide good result (overall accuracy=34.92%), while higher overall classification accuracies (73.48%, 84.76% and 93.18%) were obtained when textural information from multi-scale and multi-texture approach were used in the classification algorithm.																	1755-1307						2014	18								012181	10.1088/1755-1315/18/1/012181								WOS:000345268900181

However, the implications involved can be minimized through effective disaster management system. Effective disaster management mechanisms can be developed through appropriate early warning system as well as an efficient delivery system. This study tried to focus on two aspects, namely by mapping the potential of forest fire and land as well as the delivery of information to users through WebGIS application. Geospatial technology and mathematical modeling used in this study for identifying, classifying and mapping the potential area for burning. Mathematical models used is the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), while Geospatial technologies involved include remote sensing, Geographic Information System (GIS) and digital field data collection. The entire Selangor state was chosen as our study area based on a number of cases have been reported over the last two decades. AHP modeling to assess the comparison between the three main criteria of fuel, topography and human factors design. Contributions of experts directly involved in forest fire fighting operations and land comprising officials from the Fire and Rescue Department Malaysia also evaluated in this model. The study found that about 32.83 square kilometers of the total area of Selangor state are the extreme potential for fire. Extreme potential areas identified are in Bestari Jaya and Kuala Langat High Ulu. Continuity of information and terrestrial forest fire potential was displayed in WebGIS applications on the internet. Display information through WebGIS applications is a better approach to help the decision-making process at a high level of confidence and approximate real conditions. Agencies involved in disaster management such as Jawatankuasa Pengurusan Dan Bantuan Bencana (JPBB) of District, State and the National under the National Security Division and the Fire and Rescue Department Malaysia can use the end result of this study in preparation for the land and forest fires in the future.																	1755-1307						2014	18								UNSP 012034	10.1088/1755-1315/18/1/012034								WOS:000345268900034

Remote sensing offers most versatile technique to map sea bottom type up to a certain scale. This paper reviews the technical characteristics of signal and light interference within marine features, space and remote sensing satellite. In addition, related image processing techniques that are applicable to remote sensing satellite data for sea bottom type digital mapping is also presented. The sea bottom type can be differentiated by classification method using appropriate spectral bands of satellite data. In order to verify the existence of particular sea bottom type, field observations need to be carried out with proper technique and equipment.

J	Liu, JG; Vina, A				Liu, Jianguo; Vina, Andres			PANDAS, PLANTS, AND PEOPLE	ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN												Plants are essential for the survival and sustainability of both humans and wildlife species around the world. However, human activities have directly and indirectly affected almost all plants, which in turn have produced cascading effects on humans and wildlife through disruption of crucial ecosystem services and wildlife habitat. Understanding such complex interactions is crucial for developing better policies that reconcile the needs of an ever-growing human population with biodiversity conservation. Using the coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) framework, this article synthesizes research on the complex interactions of plant species, giant pandas, and people. The CHANS framework is particularly useful for uncovering key patterns and processes behind plant-animal interactions modified by human activities. Our synthesis shows that many human factors, including socioeconomic and demographic, together with other factors (e.g., projected global climate change), exhibit reciprocal interactions with pandas and the plant species that comprise their habitat. Although substantial efforts have been made to preserve plants and wildlife, much work still remains to be done, including the expansion and more effective management of protected areas, use of native plant species in reforestation/afforestation programs, and active participation of local residents in conservation actions.

Monitoring of a National-Scale Indirect Indicator of Biodiversity Using a Long Time-Series of Remotely Sensed Imagery	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Remote sensing provides continuous, large-area coverage that supports synoptic, consistent, and repeatable monitoring of vegetation and, therefore, can be used to derive indirect indicators of biodiversity. We used a 21-year archive of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) (1987-2007) data to assess changes in an indirect indicator of biodiversity, the Dynamic Habitat Index (DHI), which has proven useful in predicting patterns of species richness and abundance at broad spatial scales (>1 km(2)). The index has 3 components reflecting integrated vegetation greenness, vegetation seasonality, and minimum vegetated cover. We used a Theil-Sen nonparametric rank-based test and computed the proportion of cells with positive or negative DHI trends within both the Canadian protected area network and the Canadian ecoprovinces. In general, the smaller protected and natural areas close to urban development had relatively larger proportions of trending DHI components over the 21-year period, than the larger, more remote protected regions. Most protected areas and ecoprovinces observed an overall increase in integrated greenness and a reduction in vegetation seasonality over the analysis period. We conclude that the ability to derive trends from long time-series of remote sensing data helps focus local biodiversity monitoring programs by guiding actions to areas of the greatest observed change.

In ground-breaking work, Robert MacArthur and his colleagues quantified relationships between bird and vertical vegetation diversity, and found that the diversity of vegetation structure strongly influenced bird species diversity. However, they were limited in spatial extent when describing vertical vegetation structure due to the labor-intensive nature of data collection. Current remote sensing techniques, such as LiDAR, can describe ecologically relevant measurements of forest structure across broad extents, and thus, there are increasing efforts to examine relationships between LiDAR-derived data and patterns of animal biodiversity. LiDAR-based data have been utilized for silvicultural assessments for over a decade, but LiDAR use in biodiversity studies is more recent. LiDAR data can assist in the assessment of local animal diversity across taxa, and might assist in larger scale biodiversity assessments in remote and rugged environments. In the following chapter, we first briefly discuss the role of vegetation structure in biodiversity studies, followed by a description of the variables that are most commonly used in biodiversity studies. We then give an overview of biodiversity studies that have utilized LiDAR in forests to date. Although there is a growing body of literature relating LiDAR-derived variables to single species distributions and habitat quality, we focus this chapter solely on studies that address animal species diversity in forested landscapes. We conclude with a discussion of future directions concerning biodiversity assessments in forested systems that might benefit from the use of LiDAR-based data.

Gap characterization was until recently mostly based on field studies and relied on sampling approaches. ALS (Airborne Laser Scanning) has now revolutionized this field of scientific enquiry by giving researchers the capacity to detect and measure gaps rapidly over large areas. We first provide a brief scientific background on gaps and then succinctly review field and other conventional remote sensing methods to characterize them. We then turn our attention to the principles of ALS-based gap detection and review different methods of automated gap delineation and measurement. We explain how gap types can be automatically classified, and how multitemporal ALS can be used to not only monitor gap dynamics, but also to reveal the complex role of gaps in influencing tree growth within and around them.																	1568-1319		978-94-017-8663-8; 978-94-017-8662-1				2014	27						419	437		10.1007/978-94-017-8663-8_21	10.1007/978-94-017-8663-8							WOS:000344929900022

Illegal encroachment on forest land is one of the major causes of deforestation in Pakistan. This study addresses the issue of forest encroachments in Murree Forest Division (MFD). MFD is a biodiversity-rich popular hill station of Punjab province and hosts thousands of visitors throughout the year. MFD comprises of 19,135 ha (47,285 acres) of state forest land, out of which 1,158.8 ha (2,862 acres) was identified as land encroached upon by the land grabbers, builders, and timber mafia. During the past decade this problem has drastically increased and led to a suo moto initiative by the Lahore High Court (vide Writ Petition No. 1813-2010). For the forensic support to the court, a detailed geographic information system and remote sensing baseline mapping have been carried out in close coordination with the Punjab Forest Department, Survey of Pakistan, Punjab Revenue Department, and WWF-Pakistan. Legal forest boundaries were delineated using high-precision surveying based on a Differential Global Positioning System and total station systems, whereas the encroachments were identified using high-resolution satellite images. The accuracy of these boundaries and encroachments was assessed and validated on the ground as well as on historic maps. The study outcomes were presented to the court as a supporting document of evidence to help them make a better decision against the encroachers and land retrieval. The main goal of the study was to prioritize conversion strategies for sustainable natural resources and segregate them into immediate, mid-term, and long-term process of land retrieval to restoring forests back to their original state. The study prompts the relevant government officials to adopt the latest mapping technologies of GIS, GPS, and RS for efficient forest management practices and sustainable enhancements.																			978-94-017-8757-4; 978-94-017-8756-7				2014	11						263	286		10.1007/978-94-017-8757-4_13	10.1007/978-94-017-8757-4							WOS:000343939800014

Our survey presents an application of utilizing images of a newly launched sensor, Landsat 8, to rapidly identify inland water bodies and produce a screening-level island-wide inventory of wetlands for the first time in Cyprus. The method treats all lentic water bodies (artificial and natural) and areas holding semi-aquatic vegetation as wetland sites. The results show that 179 sites are delineated by the remote sensing application and when this is supplemented by expert-guided identification and ground surveys during favourable wet-season conditions the total number of inventoried wetland sites is 315. The number of wetland sites is surprisingly large since it does not include micro-wetlands (under 2000 m(2) or 0.2 ha) or widespread narrow lotic and riparian stream reaches. In Cyprus, a number of different wetland types occur and often in temporary or ephemerally flooded conditions and they are usually of very small areal extent. Many wetlands are artificial or semi-artificial water bodies, and numerous natural small wetland features are often degraded by anthropogenic changes or exist as remnant patches and are therefore heavily modified compared to their original natural state. The study proves that there is an urgent need for integrated and multidisciplinary study and monitoring of wetlands cover due to either climate change effects and/or anthropogenic interventions. Small wetlands are particularly vulnerable while many artificial wetlands are not managed for biodiversity values. The remote sensing and GIS application are efficient tools for this initial screening-level inventory. The need for baseline inventory information collection in support of wetland conservation is multi-scalar and requires an adaptive protocol to guide effective conservation planning.

Biodiversity of Kargil Cold Desert in the Ladakh Himalaya	INTEGRATIVE OBSERVATIONS AND ASSESSMENTS	Ecological Research Monographs											Biological diversity has long been a source of wonderment and scientific curiosity, but it is now increasingly a source of concern. We attempted to classify, map, and characterize vegetation and its biodiversity content using satellite imagery and field enumeration in the cold desert of the Kargil-Ladakh region located in the Western Himalaya, India. Fair-weather, multi-temporal IRS-P6 LISS III data were subjected to visual interpretation, which estimated rocky barren land as the dominant land cover, followed by vegetation (alpine pasture, alpine scrub, agroforest, and subalpine forest) and snow cover. Asteraceae was reported as the most speciose family, numbering more species than genera. Artemisia emerged as the most speciose genus. Species diversity decreased with increasing altitude, but the maximum was found at transition zones of agroforest and alpine scrub. The highest species similarity was observed between alpine scrub and alpine pastures, indicating pronounced intermixing and interaction. The detailed updated map (at a scale of 1:50,000) with extensive field observation would overcome a long-pending gap in ecological study in the region and may also be used as baseline data for conservation and planning,																	2191-0707		978-4-431-54783-9; 978-4-431-54782-2				2014							253	274		10.1007/978-4-431-54783-9_13	10.1007/978-4-431-54783-9							WOS:000341995800014

It is important to note that biophysical factors and human induced factors are interlinked in determining NPP patterns. Nevertheless, it is difficult to consider some aspects of human management systems in relation to NPP variations on a global scale analysis than on a local scale analysis. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that, at the local scale, particularly in highly intensive systems, land-use/land tenure types influence NPP variations by altering the biophysical conditions of the land. We estimated NPP between 2000 and 2009 using MODIS data and used ANOVA to test the abovementioned hypotheses. Results showed that NPP significantly (p<0.05) varied by land-use/land tenure type. We also found that biophysical factors remained essential in explaining NPP variations even at local scales. These results exhibit the intricacies that exist between the biophysical and human-induced factors in explaining NPP variations within ecological landscapes.																	1010-6049	1752-0762					2014	29	6					671	687		10.1080/10106049.2013.837101								WOS:000340244100008

Application of remote sensing and GIS for detection of long-term mangrove shoreline changes in Mui Ca Mau, Vietnam	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Mui Ca Mau at the southern tip of Vietnam supports a large area of mangroves and has a high value for biodiversity and scenic beauty. This area is affected by erosion along the East Sea and accretion along the Gulf of Thailand, leading to the loss of huge stretches of mangroves along the East Sea and, in some cases, loss of environmental and ecosystem services provided by mangroves. In this study, we used remotely sensed aerial (1953), Landsat (1979, 1988 and 2000) and SPOT (1992, 1995, 2004, 2008, 2009 and 2011) images and the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) to quantify the rate of mangrove shoreline change for a 58 yr period. There were 1129 transects sampled at 100 m intervals along the mangrove shoreline and two statistical methods, namely end point rate (EPR) and linear regression rate (LRR), were used to calculate the rate of change of mangrove shorelines and distance from 1953 to 2011. The study confirms that erosion and accretion, respectively, are significant at the East Sea and Gulf of Thailand sides of Mui Ca Mau. The East Sea side had a mean erosion LRR of 33.24 m yr(-1). The accretion trend at the Gulf of Thailand side had an average rate of 40.65 m yr(-1). The results are important in predicting changes of coastal ecosystem boundaries and enable advanced planning for specific sections of coastline, to minimize or neutralize losses, to inform provincial rehabilitation efforts and reduce threats to coastal development and human safety.																	1726-4170	1726-4189					2014	11	14					3781	3795		10.5194/bg-11-3781-2014								WOS:000339895600005

Remote sensing images of the Poyang Lake wetland landscape representing different water levels are presented for typical years based on long-term water level data sequences from the 5 monitoring hydrological stations at the lake. The structure and composition of the landscape were analyzed with multivariate statistical methods, and the corresponding quantitative relationships between the water level fluctuations and the structure and composition of the landscape were established for different typical years in the wetland area of the lake. In addition, the dynamic response of the waterfowl habitat areas to water level fluctuations was presented for the Poyang Lake wetland. The results suggest the following: (1) the water level of Poyang Lake was influenced by the inflowing water from the "Five Rivers" and the exchange of water with the Yangtze River. Both the intra-annual and the inter-annual water level fluctuations were dramatic; (2) the water level fluctuations showed a positive correlation with area of water included in the lake region and water in the human-controlled area; but a negative correlation with area of the land-water transition zone and meadow area; besides, it influenced greatly the structure and composition of the landscape; and (3) waterfowl occupied most of the major suitable habitat with an area of 1737.223 km(2) when the water level was 10.22 m (in 2006), whereas the fewest major habitat with an area of 152.193 km(2) was available to waterfowl when the water level was 19.29 m (in 1989). These results contribute to the understanding of the specific effects of hydrological changes on wetland landscapes, and to the protection of the biodiversity and richness of waterfowl in the Poyang Lake wetland.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2014	23	7A					1650	1661										WOS:000338692400011

Understanding community-habitat associations of temperate reef fishes using fine-resolution bathymetric measures of physical structure	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Multibeam sonar (MBS) hydro-acoustic technology allows for inexpensive, broad-scale, fine-resolution assessment of marine fish habitats. Parallel advancements in geographic information systems and new analytical techniques are providing researchers with the ability to generate informative surrogate predictors of biodiversity and species responses. The aim of this study was to determine whether fine-scale bathymetric derivatives of MBS survey data could be effectively applied as surrogates to explain spatial patterns in reef fish diversity and species-habitat relationships. In the absence of direct metrics of habitat, these derivatives might prove to be effective tools for marine spatial planning. Species-habitat relationships were examined across a marine reserve on the south-eastern coast of Tasmania at fine spatial scales using boosted regression tree analyses. The most important explanatory variables of community diversity were those describing the degree of reef aspect deviation from east and south (seemingly as a proxy for swell exposure), reef bathymetry (depth), plane and slope. Models could account for up to 30% of the spatial variability in measures of species diversity. Responses in species abundance and occurrence to habitat structure appeared to be largely species-specific at the scales investigated. Models accounted for up to 67% and 58% of the abundance and occurrence, respectively, for the southern hulafish Trachinops caudimaculatus. Our results demonstrate that multibeam-derived metrics of reef habitat structure, employed in combination with modern modelling approaches, have the potential to explain and predict fine-resolution patterns in temperate reef fish community structure. This knowledge is urgently required to effectively manage marine ecosystems and conserve biodiversity and fisheries resources.

Protected areas in boreal Canada: a baseline and considerations for the continued development of a representative and effective reserve network	ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS												Boreal forests maintain regionally important biodiversity and globally important ecosystem services, such as carbon storage and freshwater resources. Many boreal systems have limited anthropogenic disturbances and are preserved, in effect, to date largely by their harsh climates and remoteness. As of 2011, almost 10% of Canada is subject to some manner of formal protection, with 4.5% of this protected area found within the boreal zone. The management of existing parks and protected areas (PPAs) is shared amongst many federal, provincial, and territorial jurisdictions. Although there are currently low levels of anthropogenic development in some portions of the boreal zone (especially the north), if expansion of protected areas is of interest, there are challenges to traditional PPA networks that may be more prominent in the boreal zone than elsewhere: (1) the boreal zone is home to charismatic mammal species with area requirements much larger than typical PPAs; (2) the boreal zone is characterized by natural disturbance regimes that impact large areas; and (3) projected changes to climate for the boreal zone are among the greatest in the world, creating temporal considerations for conservation planning exercises. There is currently no PPA assessment specific to boreal Canada. To address this lack of an assessment, we developed a conservation gap analysis of the current PPA system with respect to a variety of environmental surrogates (ecozones, land cover, vegetation productivity, and landscape structure). The amount of formally protected land varied within each surrogate, with few commonly reported features meeting national or international conservation targets. Furthermore, few reserves met the areal requirements that have been previously recommended to protect large mammals or accommodate the disturbance regimes present. We also discuss considerations and implications of area-based versus value-based protection objectives. While recognizing that there are still scientific challenges around understanding and evaluating the effectiveness of PPAs, based upon our review and assessment, the following considerations should inform conservation options for the boreal zone: (1) representation of the distribution of natural features within the PPA network; (2) effective maintenance of habitat requirements and spatial resilience to both cyclical and directional changes in spatial patterns through large, connected reserves; and (3) implementation of sustainable forest management practices (where applicable) throughout the broader landscape, as traditional on-reserve protection is unlikely to be sufficient to meet conservation goals. The Canadian boreal is unique in possessing large tracts of inaccessible forested lands that are not subject to management interventions, thereby offering functions similar to protected lands. The question of how to more formally integrate these lands into the existing PPA network requires further consideration. Further, the important temporal role of landscape dynamics in designing an effective PPA needs to be further studied as well as development of a better understanding of design needs in the context of a changing climate.

J	Pasher, J; Smith, PA; Forbes, MR; Duffe, J				Pasher, Jon; Smith, Paul A.; Forbes, Mark R.; Duffe, Jason			Terrestrial ecosystem monitoring in Canada and the greater role for integrated earth observation	ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS												Ecosystems are valuable as well as aesthetic. The natural functions of ecosystems can have profound effects on the economy, and human and wildlife health. The aggregate value of these "ecosystem services" may far exceed the economic value derived from resource extraction or industrial development, especially when considering the costs of restoring ecosystems. There is increasing interest, therefore, in monitoring and protecting ecosystems, and accounting for the biodiversity and services they provide. In 2010, Canada undertook a review of ecosystem status and trends that identified the regions and ecosystems where management is most urgently needed. The authors concluded that more large-scale, long-term, standardized, and spatially complete information is needed for effective monitoring and management. Satellite-based earth observation (EO) tools were seen as ameans of addressing this information need. In a separate exercise, a list of priority questions for conservation policy and management at a national level was produced: the resolution of three-quarters of those questions appears to depend on EO tools to a significant or critical extent. Canada has a long and successful history in all aspects of earth observation, placing it amongst the leaders in the international remote sensing community. Whereas the need for measuring ecosystem services to humans and wildlife is increasingly important, the challenges for doing so are increasingly significant and the technology required is increasingly complex. Overcoming these challenges is necessary to address emerging conservation priorities including measurement of ecosystem attributes to support habitat conservation for Species at Risk, measuring functional capacity of ecosystems to mitigate effects of climate change, monitoring and mitigating effects of resource extraction, and supporting industrial development in Canada's north. Addressing emerging priorities requires dialogue among ecologists and decision makers, coordinated at regional and national scales, and requires drawing on the best EO technologies and infrastructure available. This review highlights the urgency of a coordinated approach for innovative applications of EO tools toward conservation and discusses some of the key elements that might be included and opportunities and challenges that might be encountered, by such an approach.																	1208-6053	1181-8700					2014	22	2					179	187		10.1139/er-2013-0017								WOS:000337104900005

Implementing REDD plus in Papua New Guinea: Can biodiversity indicators be effectively integrated in PNG's National Forest Inventory?	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												UNFCCC's "Cancun safeguards" (COP 16, 2010) provide a strong call for comprehensive steps to prevent harm to biodiversity from Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) activities and to support its conservation. However, as non-binding "principles" and due to their general wording, they are not operational in the present form. Additionally, the scientific literature on biodiversity monitoring for REDD+ is still very limited, particularly when it comes to REDD+ in tropical forests and at the national scale. Whereas some authors suggest that biodiversity integration can be achieved by means of standardised protocols and techniques, others consider that an effective monitoring of biodiversity in tropical forests at the national scale may be an impossible task to achieve in a cost-effective way. However, recent research offers some functional approaches to tackle the many challenges involved. This paper explores the perspectives and limits of developing and effectively incorporating appropriate biodiversity objectives and indicators in Papua New Guinea's multipurpose National Forest Inventory (PNG's NFI). The PNG's NFI is currently being designed under the UN-REDD programme as a key component of the National Forest Monitoring System that PNG is required to establish in order to participate in a future REDD+ mechanism. We conclude that the challenge cannot be effectively tackled only at the design stage of the NFI, as it needs to address a number of issues related to different stages of the REDD+ preparedness process: a. If biodiversity integration is carried out directly at the NFI stage, it will need to rely on proxies derived from indicators designed to monitor carbon stock change; b. At the planning stage, a carbon-biodiversity overlay map analysis would allow for a preliminary selection of areas of high biodiversity that could be threatened by REDD+ activities either directly or indirectly through "leakage"; c. During the implementation stage, the selection could be refined by identifying a sub-sample of sites where forests are undergoing the greatest changes; d. A comprehensive biodiversity monitoring programme involving field measurements of key species could only be designed once the priority areas have been clearly defined and limited in both number and size.

Despite their value, world-wide, mangroves are being rapidly degraded and deforested. Madagascar contains approximately 2% of the world's mangroves, >20% of which has been deforested since 1990 from increased extraction for charcoal and timber and conversion to small to large-scale agriculture and aquaculture. Loss is particularly prominent in the northwestern Ambaro and Ambanja bays. Here, we focus on Ambaro and Ambanja bays, presenting dynamics calculated using United States Geological Survey (USGS) national-level mangrove maps and the first localized satellite imagery derived map of dominant land-cover types. The analysis of USGS data indicated a loss of 7659 ha (23.7%) and a gain of 995 ha (3.1%) from 1990-2010. Contemporary mapping results were 93.4% accurate overall (Kappa 0.9), with producer's and user's accuracies >= 85%. Classification results allowed partitioning mangroves in to ecologically meaningful, spectrally distinct strata, wherein field measurements facilitated estimating the first total carbon stocks for mangroves in Madagascar. Estimates suggest that higher stature closed-canopy mangroves have average total vegetation carbon values of 146.8 Mg/ha (+/- 10.2) and soil organic carbon of 446.2 (+/- 36.9), supporting a growing body of studies that mangroves are amongst the most carbon-dense tropical forests.																	1999-4907					JAN	2014	5	1					177	205		10.3390/f5010177								WOS:000335820700006

M.; Padoa-Schioppa, Emilio			How many predictors in species distribution models at the landscape scale? Land use versus LiDAR-derived canopy height	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE												At the local spatial scale, land-use variables are often employed as predictors for ecological niche models (ENMs). Remote sensing can provide additional synoptic information describing vegetation structure in detail. However, there is limited knowledge on which environmental variables and how many of them should be used to calibrate ENMs. We used an information-theoretic approach to compare the performance of ENMs using different sets of predictors: (1) a full set of land-cover variables (seven, obtained from the LGN6 Dutch National Land Use Database); (2) a reduced set of land-cover variables (three); (3) remotely sensed laser data optimized to measure vegetation structure and canopy height (LiDAR, light detection and ranging); and (4) combinations of land cover and LiDAR. ENMs were built for a set of bird species in the Veluwe Natura 2000 site (the Netherlands); for each species, 26-214 records were available from standardized monitoring. Models were built using MaxEnt, and the best performing models were identified using the Akaike's information criterion corrected for small sample size (AICc). For 78% of the bird species analysed, LiDAR data were included in the best AICc model. The model including LiDAR only was the best performing one in most cases, followed by the model including a reduced set of land-use variables. Models including many land-use variables tended to have limited support. The number of variables included in the best model increased for species with more presence records. For all species with 33 records or less, the best model included LiDAR only. Models with many land-use variables were only selected for species with >150 records. Test area under the curve (AUC) scores ranged between 0.72 and 0.92. Remote sensing data can thus provide regional information useful for modelling at the local and landscape scale, particularly when presence records are limited. ENMs can be optimized through the selection of the number and identity of environmental predictors. Few variables can be sufficient if presence records are limited in number. Synoptic remote sensing data provide a good measure of vegetation structure and may allow a better representation of the available habitat, being extremely useful in this case. Conversely, a larger number of predictors, including land-use variables, can be useful if a large number of presence records are available.

J	Cole, B; McMorrow, J; Evans, M				Cole, Beth; McMorrow, Julia; Evans, Martin			Empirical Modelling of Vegetation Abundance from Airborne Hyperspectral Data for Upland Peatland Restoration Monitoring	REMOTE SENSING												Peatlands are important terrestrial carbon stores. Restoration of degraded peatlands to restore ecosystem services is a major area of conservation effort. Monitoring is crucial to judge the success of this restoration. Remote sensing is a potential tool to provide landscape-scale information on the habitat condition. Using an empirical modelling approach, this paper aims to use airborne hyperspectral image data with ground vegetation survey data to model vegetation abundance for a degraded upland blanket bog in the United Kingdom (UK), which is undergoing restoration. A predictive model for vegetation abundance of Plant Functional Types (PFT) was produced using a Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) and applied to the whole restoration site. A sensitivity test on the relationships between spectral data and vegetation abundance at PFT and single species level confirmed that PFT was the correct scale for analysis. The PLSR modelling allows selection of variables based upon the weighted regression coefficient of the individual spectral bands, showing which bands have the most influence on the model. These results suggest that the SWIR has less value for monitoring peatland vegetation from hyperspectral images than initially predicted. RMSE values for the validation data range between 10% and 16% cover, indicating that the models can be used as an operational tool, considering the subjective nature of existing vegetation survey results. These predicted coverage images are the first quantitative landscape scale monitoring results to be produced for the site. High resolution hyperspectral mapping of PFTs has the potential to assess recovery of peatland systems at landscape scale for the first time.

However, remote-sensing-based detection of forest degradation is difficult, as these subtle degradation signals are not easy to detect in the first place and quickly lost over time due to fast re-vegetation. To overcome these shortcomings, a time series analysis has been developed to map and monitor forest degradation over a longer period of time, with frequent updates based on Landsat data. This time series approach helps to reduce both the commission and the omission errors compared to, e.g., bi- or tri-temporal assessments. The approach involves a series of pre-processing steps, such as geometric and radiometric adjustments, followed by spectral mixture analysis and classification of spectral curves. The resulting pixel-based classification is then aggregated to degradation areas. The method was developed on a study site in Cameroon and applied to a second site in Central African Republic. For both areas, the results were finally evaluated against visual interpretation of very high-resolution optical imagery. Results show overall accuracies in both study sites above 85% for mapping degradation areas with the presented methods.																	2072-4292					JAN	2014	6	1					756	775		10.3390/rs6010756								WOS:000335555900034

Forest is an important part of our ecosystem. The main function is to absorb carbon oxide and produce oxygen in their cycle of photosynthesis to maintain a balance and healthy atmosphere. However, forest changes as time changes. Some changes are necessary as to give way for economic growth. Nevertheless, it is important to monitor forest change so that deforestation and development can be planned and the balance of ecosystem is still preserved. It is important because there are number of unfavorable effects of deforestation that include environmental and economic such as erosion of soil, loss of biodiversity and climate change. The forest change detection can be studied with reference of several satellite images using remote sensing application. Forest change detection is best done with remote sensing due to large and remote study area. The objective of this project is to detect forest change over time and to compare forest health indicated by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) using remote sensing and image processing. The forest under study shows depletion of forest area by 12% and 100% increment of deforestation activities. The NDVI value which is associated with the forest health also shows 13% of reduction.																	1755-1307						2014	19								012017	10.1088/1755-1315/19/1/012017								WOS:000335358200017

Deforestation in the Ayeyarwady Delta and the conservation implications of an internationally-engaged Myanmar	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS												Myanmar is a country of huge biodiversity importance that is undergoing major political change, bringing with it new international engagement. This includes access to international markets, which will likely spur investment in export-oriented agriculture, leading to increased pressures on already threatened ecosystems. This scenario is illustrated in the Ayeyarwady Delta, the country's agricultural heartland sustaining high deforestation rates. Using the Delta as a model system, we use an integrated approach to inquire about whether and how imminent agricultural reforms associated with an internationally-engaged Myanmar could introduce new actors and incentives to invest in agricultural expansion that could affect deforestation rates. We use a novel remote sensing analysis to quantify deforestation rates for the Delta from 1978 to 2011, develop business-as-usual deforestation scenarios, and contextualize those results with an analysis of contemporary policy changes within Myanmar that are expected to alter the principal drivers of land-cover change. We show that mangrove systems of Myanmar are under greater threat than previously recognized, and that agriculture has been the principle driver of deforestation on the Delta. The centrality of agriculture to the Myanmar economy indicates that emerging policies are likely to tip the scales towards agricultural expansion, agroindustrial investment and potentially greater rates of deforestation due to the introduction of well-funded investors, insufficient land tenure agreements, and low governance effectiveness. The broad national challenge is to initiate environmental governance reforms (including safeguards) in the face of significant pressures for land grabbing and opportunistic resource extraction.

Drawing on principles of the ecosystem resilience highlighted in the literature, we built on the theory of dissipative structures to develop a conceptual model of the ecosystem resilience of forests. A hierarchical indicator system was designed with the influencing factors of the forest ecosystem resilience, including the stand conditions and the ecological memory, which were further disaggregated into specific indicators. Furthermore, indicator weights were determined with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the coefficient of variation method. Based on the remote sensing data and forest inventory data and so forth, the resilience index of forests was calculated. The result suggests that there is significant spatial heterogeneity of the ecosystem resilience of forests, indicating it is feasible to generate large-scale ecosystem resilience maps with this assessment model, and the results can provide a scientific basis for the conservation of forests, which is of great significance to the climate change mitigation.

However, at landscape scale, it is highly impractical to measure and map all elements of biodiversity, and therefore, biodiversity surrogates are commonly used to represent biodiversity values. Land cover and vegetation are most often used as a biodiversity surrogate. The study investigated how land use change affects the status of the biodiversity surrogates in terms of the loss or gain of habitat (areal extent), loss of habitat condition (degradation) and habitat fragmentation. Effective habitat area (EHA) and raster based cost-benefit analysis (CBA) modeling techniques were used for the assessment of the impact of land use change scenarios on wildlife habitat as biodiversity surrogates. The modeling was carried out on time-series land cover data from 1972 to 2009 for the Liverpool Range of New South Wales (NSW). The model estimated the future condition of vegetation in each and every grid-cell in the region as a function of current condition, existing land cover, and the threatening processes. The results indicated a continuous pattern of clearing in the region, while the habitat conditions were mostly static throughout the study period. There was a decline in EHA after 1993, by 3%. Clearing was identified as the main cause of such decline during the change period. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Stringer, LC; Harris, A				Stringer, L. C.; Harris, A.			LAND DEGRADATION IN DOLJ COUNTY, SOUTHERN ROMANIA: ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES, IMPACTS AND RESPONSES	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Central and Eastern Europe is experiencing significant land degradation, at the same time as social, economic and political transformation, and within the broader context of global climate change. This paper uses satellite data, primary field data and secondary information on Romania's social, political and economic dynamics, in a mixed-method case study analysis of the drivers of, and responses to, environmental change and land degradation over the period 1984-2007. The analytical time frame encompasses the Socialist era, as well as transition to European Union membership, allowing identification of the ways in which the dominant political economic and social systems interact with biophysical factors and play out in the landscape. Although the Socialist era is often portrayed as environmentally destructive, results indicate that management during this time developed a relatively stable landscape, albeit at an economic and social cost. In the lead up to the collapse of Socialist governance, the landscape altered more, resulting in worsening land degradation and land cover change. Responses to land degradation have taken two main routes: land abandonment and tree planting. Although aspects of these responses are now more democratic and participatory, at the same time, they share some common ground with Socialist era approaches. Building on the positive aspects of Socialist management strategies yields important lessons in addressing land degradation challenges more broadly. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Evaluating ecosystem services on a regional scale has presented tremendous theoretical, methodological and policy challenges. This study addresses the challenges by developing an interdisciplinary methodology, based on expert knowledge, and by focusing on the Yangtze River Delta of China. It evaluates the stock of NC, analyzes the characteristics of, and identifies the key drivers for, spatial and temporal change in NC in the deltaic region from 2000 to 2010. A main contribution is the novel incorporation of remote sensing data that explains the dynamics of the spatio-temporal change in land use and a set of ecosystem service indicators derived from it The study focuses on key indicators for key ecosystem services related to carbon sequestration, grain production and water supply. The indictors reflect the spatial heterogeneity of NC across diverse ecosystems in the region. Each indicator builds on land use configuration and land use composition information derived from 250 m 16-day MODE and Landsat TM remote sensing data for 2000 and 2010, with adjustment parameters being constructed. The regional evaluation shows an overall degradation of ecosystem services, reducing total NC by 10.4% (or 8.44 billion yuan) in 2000-2010. The spatial distribution of NC exhibits a declining pattern from the south to the north of the delta. At the city level, 15 out of 16 major cities in the region have experienced dramatic loss of NC, and this pattern is significantly correlated with rapid urbanization, population growth and industrialization. Land use/land cover change and deteriorating water quality are dominant factors causing NC depletion, while increased grain productivity and environmental policies help offset the NC losses. Outcomes of this research are useful to policy makers to mitigate the declines in NC through balancing the growth between economy and population. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Landscape-scale variation in plant community composition of an African savanna from airborne species mapping	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Information on landscape-scale patterns in species distributions and community types is vital for ecological science and effective conservation assessment and planning. However, detailed maps of plant community structure at landscape scales seldom exist due to the inability of field-based inventories to map a sufficient number of individuals over large areas. The Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO) collected hyperspectral and lidar data over Kruger National Park, South Africa, and these data were used to remotely identify >500000 tree and shrub crowns over a 144-km(2) landscape using stacked support vector machines. Maps of community compositional variation were produced by ordination and clustering, and the importance of hillslope-scale topo-edaphic variation in shaping community structure was evaluated with redundancy analysis. This remote species identification approach revealed spatially complex patterns in woody plant communities throughout the landscape that could not be directly observed using field-based methods alone. We estimated that topo-edaphic variables representing catenal sequences explained 21% of species compositional variation, while we also uncovered important community patterns that were unrelated to catenas, indicating a large role for other soil-related factors in shaping the savanna community. Our results demonstrate the ability of airborne species identification techniques to map biodiversity for the evaluation of ecological controls on community composition over large landscapes.

The loss of NPP due to urban expansion was calculated integrating GLO-PEM with remote sensing and GIS techniques in China during the period of 1989-2000. Using urban expansion and the mean NPP for the different land use types in the fourteen regions, the total loss of NPP was calculated as 0.95 Tg C, which accounted for 0.03% of the national NPP of 1989. The total loss of NPP due to the transformation from cropland to urban land accounted for 91.93%, followed by forest (7.17%) and grassland (0.69%). However, the conversion from unused land, industrial and construction land, and water bodies to urban land resulted in an increase in the NPP. The regions locating in eastern China and middle China had large reductions in the total NPP due to urban expansion. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Savanna woody vegetation classification - now in 3-D	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												QuestionThe co-existence of woody plants and grasses characterize savannas, with the horizontal and vertical spatial arrangement of trees creating a heterogeneous biotic environment. To understand the influence of biogeophysical drivers on the spatial patterns of 3-D structure of woody vegetation, these patterns need to be explained over large areas to capture the context. Is there a spatially explicit, ecologically meaningful way to capture the patterns and context of 3-D woody vegetation structure? LocationClassification development and testing sites: landscapes in Bushbuckridge Municipality, Sabi Sand Wildtuin and Kruger National Park, Mpumalanga province, north-east South Africa. MethodsThe aforementioned structural classification approach requires appropriate 3-D and spatially explicit remote sensing data. A LiDAR-based canopy height model (CHM) and volumetric pixel (voxel) data from the Carnegie Airborne Observatory Alpha system were used to create the structural classification. First, we segmented the CHM images using multi-threshold and multi-resolution image segmentation techniques, and classified the image segments into four height classes, namely shrub (1-3m), low tree (3-6m), high tree (6-10m) or tall tree (>10m). A hierarchical a priori approach was used to develop classification criteria. The following metrics were calculated for 0.25-ha grid cells based on the cover and spatial arrangement of the four height classes: canopy cover, sub-canopy cover, canopy layers, Simpson's diversity index and cohesion. Top of canopy vegetation was classified using each metric at the 0.25-ha scale, with canopy cover being the primary classification metric. Subsequently, individual layers identified within the canopy were classified using the voxel data. We use a code system for describing classes to ensure standardization between different regions; a more traditional naming system may be used in addition for interpretation. ConclusionThis system provides a more comprehensive classification of the horizontal and vertical structural diversity of savannas compared to the traditional vegetation classification systems. The description of multi-layers within the canopy should allow for a sensitive change detection method. The classification can be used in many current focus areas, including habitat suitability mapping for biodiversity conservation, strategic adaptive management and monitoring land-cover change.

In this study, the spatiotemporal changes in the land cover system within a Himalayan wetland and its catchment were assessed and correlated using a time series of satellite, historical, and field data. Significant changes in the spatial extent, water depth, and the land system of the Hokersar wetland were observed from the spatiotemporal analysis of the data from 1969 to 2008. The wetland area has shrunk from 18.75 km(2) in 1969 to 13 km(2) in 2008 with drastic reduction in the water depth of the wetland. The marshy lands, habitat of the migratory birds, have shrunk from 16.3 km(2) in 1969 to 5.62 km(2) in 2008 and have been colonized by various other land cover types. The land system and water extent changes within the wetland were related to the spatiotemporal changes in the land cover and hydrometeorological variables at the catchment scale. Significant changes in the forest cover (88.33-55.78 km(2)), settlement (4.63-15.35 km(2)), and water bodies (1.75-0.51 km(2)) were observed in the catchment. It is concluded that the urbanization, deforestation, changes in the hydrologic and climatic conditions, and other land system changes observed in the catchment are the main causes responsible for the depleting wetland extent, water depth, and biodiversity by adversely influencing the hydrologic erosion and other land surface processes in the catchment. All these causes and effects are manifest in the form of deterioration of the water quality, water quantity, the biodiversity changes, and the decreasing migratory bird population in the wetland.

We aim to show that remote sensing (RS), as demonstrated for terrestrial protected areas, has the potential to provide key information to support MPA management. We review existing literature on the use of RS to monitor biodiversity surrogates, e.g. ecological (e.g., primary productivity) and oceanographic (e.g., Sea Surface Temperature) parameters that have been shown to structure marine biodiversity. We then highlight the potential for RS to inform marine habitat mapping and monitoring, and discuss how RS can be used to track anthropogenic activities and its impacts on biodiversity in MPAs. Reasons for low integration of RS in MPA management and current limitations are also presented. This work concludes that RS shows great promise to support wildlife managers in their efforts to protect marine biodiversity around the world, in particular when such information is used in conjunction with data from field surveys.

The Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) and the General Habitat Categories (GHC) System have been proposed by the remote sensing and ecological research community, respectively, for the classification of land covers and habitats across various scales. Linking the two systems can be a major step forward towards biodiversity monitoring using remote sensing. The translation between the two systems has proved to be challenging, largely because of differences in definitions and related difficulties in creating one-to-one relationships between the two systems. This paper proposes a system of rules for linking the two systems and additionally identifies requirements for site-specific contextual and environmental information to enable the translation. As an illustration, the LCCS classification of the Le Cesine protected area in Italy is used to show rules for translating the LCCS classes to GHCs. This study demonstrates the benefits of a translation system for biodiversity monitoring using remote sensing data but also shows that a successful translation is often depending on the degree of ecological knowledge of the habitats and its relationship with land cover and contextual information.

They play an irreplaceable role in biodiversity conservation, control of global climate change, water purification and mitigation of flood disaster. Thus, extracting information of wetlands has become very important. Recent years the rapid development of high spatial resolution remote sensing technology provides great potential for improvement of data sources and advancing methods for quantitative acquisition and analysis of wetland information. It is well known that object-oriented method is a relatively new technology for landscape segmentation. Although there are some reports in application of object-oriented analysis for extraction of wetland information in China, there is still a lack of studies on the impacts of used segmentation techniques on accuracy of classification. In this study, an excellent image region segmentation method which appeared in the recent years, called mean shift segmentation algorithm, was used to extract the information of wetland in the East Dongting Lake of China and the obtained results were compared with those from a conventional segmentation algorithm provided by ENVI EX. The assessment of the results was conducted using four kinds of quantitative indicators and based on the accuracy of interpretation. The results showed that the conventional segmentation algorithm was unable to provide the accurate segmentation results in delineation of wetland areas. Integrating the edge detection information of NDVI and the mean shift segmentation algorithm not only could make it possible segmentation of shallow water bodies, but also could lead to much better classification results than using the traditional method and the mean shift segmentation alone.																	2380-8039		978-1-4799-4184-1				2014																		WOS:000366526900101

How to obtain and monitor spatio-temporal change of spartina alterniflora has great practical significance in managing and protecting Chongming Dongtan. Therefore, the main purpose of this paper was to build up a method to recognize different species of salt marsh vegetation and analyze the spatio-temporal change by interpreting remote sensed data of different period. Considering the complexity of different plant' spectral feature, the feature space was consisted of Normalized Different Vegetation Index (NDVI), Kanth-Thomas transformation (K-T transformation) and an optimal band combination. In order to enhance classification accuracy, a dual-weight support vector machine (SVM) classification model by weighting on different features and classes was proposed. The kernel function of this model was selected as wavelet which satisfied the practical situation better. During the experiment, training and validation data were ground survey points located by GPS. The results from this study indicated that the invasion of spartina alterniflora was serious and it kept expanding to the southern. Furthermore, the method proposed in this paper could get higher detection accuracy than the traditional methods and was suitable for the small-sample experiment. Consequently, using this approach could provide timely analytical data for the time and space distribution change of the Salt Marsh Vegetation in intertidal zones, meanwhile the results will provide sound scientific basis for carrying out some proper management and control of Spartina alterniflora.																	2380-8039		978-1-4799-4184-1				2014																		WOS:000366526900012						
B	Viegas, DX		Viegas, DX		Viegas, Domingos Xavier			Tropical forest degradation in the Brazilian Amazon - relation to fire and land-use change	ADVANCES IN FOREST FIRE RESEARCH												While deforestation represents an obvious ecosystem change, forest degradation is often more difficult to discern or quantify, but it impacts a number of ecosystem functions which are vital for biodiversity and climate feedbacks. In the Brazilian Amazon, land-use changes increase fire occurrence, especially in fragmented forests close to managed land. We used remote sensing imagery to estimate the extent and impact of forest fires in degraded tropical rain-forest in the Brazilian Legal Amazon between 2007 and 2010 and examined land-use establishing in degraded areas. The trends in degraded area vs. burned area were different. Even though degradation increased one year after a high fire year, there was no spatial overlap, which points to other causes for degradation. Up to 11% of the degraded area was burned in the same year, playing escaping fires from managed and deforested lands a significant role in degradation by fire. Eighty-four percent of 2007s degraded area remained forest one year later, whereas the rest was identified as deforestation, secondary vegetation or pasture. Three years after degradation, 80% remained forest, the proportion of deforested area decreased and areas in regeneration after being deforested increased. Monitoring of forest degradation across tropical forests is critical for developing land management policies and for carbon stocks/emissions estimation.																			978-989-26-0884-6				2014							1582	1591		10.14195/978-989-26-0884-6_174	10.14195/978-989-26-0884-6							WOS:000400252000175						
J	Takahashi, R; Todo, Y				Takahashi, Ryo; Todo, Yasuyuki			The impact of a shade coffee certification program on forest conservation using remote sensing and household data	ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW												In recent years, shade coffee certification programs have attracted increasing attention from forest conservation and development organizations. The certification programs could be expected to promote forest conservation by providing a premium price to shade coffee producers. However, little is known about the significance of the conservation efforts generated by certification programs. In particular, the relationship between the impact of the certification and producer characteristics has yet to be examined. The purpose of this study, which was conducted in Ethiopia, was to examine the impact of a shade coffee certification program on forest conservation and its relationship with the socioeconomic characteristics of the producers. Remote sensing data of 2005 and 2010 was used to gauge the changes in forest area. Employing a probit model, we found that a forest coffee area being certified increased the probability of forest conservation by 193 percentage points relative to forest coffee areas lacking certification. We also found that although economically poor producers tended to engage in forest clearing, the forest coffee certification program had a significant impact on these producers. This result suggests that the certification program significantly affects the behaviors of economically poor producers and motivates these producers to conserve the forest. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In this context, ICIMOD and regional partners have evolved Transboundary Landscape concept to address the issues of conservation and sustainable use of natural resources and systems (e.g., biodiversity, rangelands, farming systems, forests, wetlands, and watersheds, etc.). This concept defines the landscapes by ecosystems rather than political/administrative boundaries. The Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region is extremely heterogeneous, with complex inter linkages of biomes and habitats as well as strong upstream-downstream linkages related to the provisioning of ecosystem services. Seven such transboundary landscapes, identified across west to east extent of HKH, have been considered for programmatic cooperation, include: Wakhan, Karakoram-Pamir, Kailash, Everest, Kangchenjunga, Brahmaputra-Salween, and Cherrapunjee-Chittagong. The approach is people centered and considers the cultural conservation as an essential first step towards resource conservation efforts in the region. Considering the multi-scale requirements of study, the geospatial technology has been effectively adopted towards: (i) understanding temporal changes in landscapes, (ii) long term ecological and social monitoring, (ii) identifying potential bio corridors, (iii) assessing landscape level vulnerability due to climatic and non-climatic drivers, and (iv) developing local plans on extractions of high value economic species supporting livelihoods, agroforestry system and ecotourism, etc. We present here our recent experiences across different landscapes on assessment of three decadal changes, vegetation type mapping, assessment of socio-ecological drivers, corridor assessment, ecosystem services assessment, models for optimal natural resource use systems and long term socio-ecological monitoring.																	2194-9034						2014	40-8						1309	1317		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-8-1309-2014								WOS:000368425300208

Detailed investigations of the variability within them can aid in understanding many biogeochemical processes. With the advent of hyperspectral remote sensing having large number of closely spaced channels and highly improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the coastal applications are expected to increase and improve. In India, very less work is done in the field of coastal studies, let alone using hyperspectral remote sensing. HICO, onboard ISS, is the most recent addition to this family of instruments. So, a pilot study was conducted to assess HICO data for coastal studies especially in deriving the shallow water bathymetry estimates. The methodology for deriving bathymetry estimates is based on the different responses of shallow-water reflectance on depth and substrate type because with decreasing water depth in case 2 waters, the spectral contributions arriving from pure water reduce while from other OCAs increase. This variability is typically higher in the wavelength range 480 to 610nm. Using this wavelength range, bathymetric estimates were made at pixel level. Bathymetry estimates were found to vary from 1m to >12m. Spectral variability is clearly observed in the continuum removed spectral plots from waters of different depths and is reported in this paper.																	2194-9034						2014	40-8						1423	1427		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-8-1423-2014								WOS:000368425300223						
J	Magnusson, WE				Magnusson, William E.			Uncertainty and the design of in-situ biodiversity-monitoring programs	NATURE CONSERVATION-BULGARIA												There are many techniques to deal with uncertainty when modeling data. However, there are many forms of uncertainty that cannot be dealt with mathematically that have to be taken into account when designing a biodiversity monitoring system. Some of these can be minimized by careful planning and quality control, but others have to be investigated during monitoring, and the scale and methods adjusted when necessary to meet objectives. Sources of uncertainty include uncertainty about stakeholders, who will monitor, what to sample, where to sample, causal relationships, species identifications, detectability, distributions, relationships with remote sensing, biotic concordance, complementarity, validity of stratification, and data quality and management. Failure to take into account any of these sources of uncertainty about how the data will be used can make monitoring nothing more than monitoring for the sake of monitoring, and I make recommendations as to how to reduce uncertainties. Some form of standardization is necessary, despite the multiple sources of uncertainty, and experience from RAPELD and other monitoring schemes indicates that spatial standardization is viable and helps reduce many sources of uncertainty.																	1314-6947	1314-3301					2014		8					77	94		10.3897/natureconservation.8.5929								WOS:000357780000004

Multi-century changes in vegetation structure and fuel availability in fire-sensitive eucalypt woodlands	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Understanding how communities change with time since fire is critical for identifying appropriate fire return intervals for biodiversity conservation. In infrequently-burnt communities, vegetation structure, habitat features and fuel availability can change over time-scales much longer than can be measured using contemporary remote-sensing approaches, creating challenges for conservation and fire management. To characterize longer-term patterns of vegetation structural change, we measured vegetation cover, ground cover, tree density and stand basal area across a multi-century time-since-fire sequence derived from growth ring-size relationships in fire-sensitive Eucalyptus salubris woodlands of south-western Australia. We hypothesized that: (i) vegetation structural components reflecting fuel availability increase with time since fire; (ii) recovery of vegetation structural components with time since fire requires long time-frames; and (iii) vegetation components indicating senescence are more evident in mature than intermediate fire-age classes. All vegetation structural components showed significant differences between time-since-fire classes (termed 'young', 'intermediate' and 'mature'), and to a lesser extent between years of sampling. The two vegetation structural components with the highest covers overall, and hence likely greatest contributors to fuel availability, were vegetation 4-10 m high and ground fuel. These two layers showed non-monotonic changes indicating a peak at intermediate times since fire (similar to 35-150 or 35-250 years; depending on the model used to estimate stand age), conflicting with the common assumption that fuel availability increases with time since fire. Total stand basal area increased rapidly after fire then appeared to stabilize beyond about 100 years, with competition likely mediating density-dependent thinning such that declining plant density offset increasing trunk size. There was little evidence for an increase in standing dead vegetation in mature woodlands such as would suggest significant senescence when long-unburnt Replacement of mature woodlands with intermediate time-since-fire woodlands with greater cover and connectivity of key fuel layers potentially instigates a self-reinforcing fire regime shift favouring larger and/or more uniform fires. If such changes eventuate, substantial losses in conservation values in E. salubris woodlands are likely. Elucidating these changes in vegetation structure and implications for conservation management only became feasible due to the development of methods to estimate the time since fire of vegetation not burnt for hundreds of years.

Analysing the gross and net deforestation rates in India	CURRENT SCIENCE												Monitoring of forests has gained vital recognition in the international scenario due to realization of its role in carbon sequestration, biodiversity and global warming. Through advancement of remote sensing and GIS technology it is possible to monitor and analyse gross and net changes in forest ecosystems. This article analyses the deforestation rates and drivers of deforestation in India and summarizes the Government initiatives for conservation of forests based on the published literature. It also reviews gross and net rate of deforestation from the national level to locale scale. At the national level, Forest Survey of India has been carrying out mapping of forest cover on a biennial basis. The current estimate of gross deforestation in India is quite low (-0.43%) for 2009-2011 compared to the global average of -0.6%. Even though considerable progress has been made in the protection of forests, gross deforestation rate continues as a focal hindrance. The deforestation studies carried out in various parts of India are found to be fragmentary and far from being comprehensive. From the regional analysis carried out, it can be seen that the overall net rate of deforestation was relatively high in the North East region (-0.90 to -5.29) and Deccan Peninsula (-0.19 to -3.2) followed by the Western Ghats. For precise estimation of gross and net deforestation, consistency in definitions, uniform methodology and new techniques for quantifying forest cover have been realized.																	0011-3891					DEC 10	2013	105	11					1492	1500										WOS:000329537600018

J	Gupta, M				Gupta, Mukesh			Chromaticity analysis of the Chilika lagoon for total suspended sediment estimation using RESOURCESAT-1 AWiFS data - A case study	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The chromaticity analysis of the Chilika lagoon has been attempted using RESOURCESAT-1 AWiFS data (10-bit radiometric resolution) of 26 November 2003. The total suspended sediment (TSS) concentration of surface waters of the lagoon was analyzed using a satellite-based chromaticity technique. The chromaticity coordinates of the entire lagoon were computed. As the lagoon is rich in biodiversity, five chromatically different regions have been identified based on different reflectance signatures. The technique is validated using the ground-truth data of high turbid water, low turbid water, aquatic vegetation, short grasses, and shallow turbid water. Different features clearly separate out on a chromaticity plot. The x-coordinate of the chromaticity shows better correlation with TSS in comparison toy-coordinate of chromaticity. The proposed approach is valuable for a quick estimate of TSS, an important geophysical parameter, which accounts for the water quality of the lagoon. The technique can be applied to compute the moderate TSS (e.g. up to 42 g m(-3)) in a lagoon or any inland water body given the chromaticity image.

J	Dai, XY; Ma, JJ; Zhang, H; Xu, WC				Dai, Xiaoyan; Ma, Junjie; Zhang, Hao; Xu, Wencheng			Evaluation of ecosystem health for the coastal wetlands at the Yangtze Estuary, Shanghai	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Despite the growing awareness of the important ecological functions and values provided by coastal and estuarine wetlands, wetland degradation continues worldwide due to increasing anthropogenic disturbances. Chongming Dongtan wetlands, adjacent to Shanghai, the largest city and industrial and trading port in China in rapid urban expansion and socioeconomic development are currently threatened with biodiversity reduction, wetland loss, contamination, and invasion of exotic plant. Sustainable protection and management of Dongtan Nature Reserve necessitate research to develop diagnostic tools and indicators for a comprehensive and objective assessment of wetland ecosystem health condition. Based on the pressure-state-response framework and ecological and environmental surveys at the Dongtan wetlands, an indicator system was established for evaluating the coastal wetlands ecosystem health, using indicators detected from satellite imagery and current field surveys. Through the establishment of health assessment units and spatial quantification of the indicators, the spatial clustering analysis, integrated with remote sensing and geographic information system technique was applied to make an accurate diagnosis of ecosystem health for Chongming Dongtan wetlands and highlight the areas in subhealthy and unhealthy condition and urgent need of conservation and management. The results from this research indicated that the ecosystem health condition at the Dongtan wetlands showed spatial variation, to a certain extent, corresponding to the distributions of elevation and land cover types. More than 75 % of the total study area was at a relatively healthy level, with 34.19 km(2) for the very healthy zone and 41.08 km(2) for the healthy zone, while the subhealthy and unhealthy zones covered 18.23 and 4.76 km(2), respectively. This study demonstrated the potential for this integrated approach to give objective and effective evaluation of ecosystem health for the dynamic coastal and estuarine wetlands and provide up-to-date information to assist with early warning for ecological security and management decisions for Chongming Dongtan Nature Reserve.																	0923-4861	1572-9834				DEC	2013	21	6					433	445		10.1007/s11273-013-9316-4								WOS:000327861300005

Teixeira			Modeling and mapping diversity of pathogenic fungi of wheat fields using geographic information systems (GIS)	CROP PROTECTION												In this study, geographic information systems and remote sensing tools were integrated and used to investigate the diversity of pathogenic fungi of wheat fields in Qarasoo basin, Golestan province, Iran. Two distinct indices, Shannon-Wiener and Simpson, were employed in order to express species diversity. The relationships between these indices and a number of independent variables such as topographic, soil and climatic variables were investigated to understand the relationships between fungal pathogen diversity and the agroecosystem while 67 georeferenced wheat field data using 0.25 m(2) quadrats were used to calculate the indices. Mallow's Cp statistical method was employed to select the most suitable factors while multiple regressions served to select model development, with two diversity maps being produced using the developed models. Residual maps were used to test the validity of the models. Rainfall and soil factors (zinc and nitrogen) formed the most important components that are effective determinants of pathogenic fungal diversity. High Simpson (0.60-0.69) and high Shannon -Wiener (1.40-1.67) values were detected in areas with higher rainfall at higher altitudes which were considered to be the most endangered areas. Considering the different responses of the models, Shannon -Wiener was found to be suitable for rare species while the Simpson model might be appropriate for a single dominant pathogenic fungus in the study area.

J	Whitman, E; Rapaport, E; Sherren, K				Whitman, Ellen; Rapaport, Eric; Sherren, Kate			Modeling Fire Susceptibility to Delineate Wildland-Urban Interface for Municipal-Scale Fire Risk Management	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The wildland-urban interface (WUI) is the region where development meets and intermingles with wildlands. The WUI has an elevated fire risk due to the proximity of development and residents to wildlands with natural wildfire regimes. Existing methods of delineating WUI are typically applied over a large region, use proxies for risk, and do not consider site-specific fire hazard drivers. While these models are appropriate for federal and provincial risk management, municipal managers require models intended for smaller regions. The model developed here uses the Burn-P3 fire behavior model to model WUI from local fire susceptibility (FS) in two study communities. Forest fuel code (FFC) maps for the study communities were modified using remote sensing data to produce detailed forest edges, including ladder fuels, update data currency, and add buildings and roads. The modified FFC maps used in Burn-P3 produced bimodal FS distributions for each community. The WUI in these communities was delineated as areas within community bounds where FS was greater than or equal to -1 SD from the mean FS value (), which fell in the trough of the bimodal distribution. The WUI so delineated conformed to the definition of WUI. This model extends WUI modeling for broader risk management initiatives for municipal management of risk, as it (a) considers site-specific drivers of fire behavior; (b) models risk, represented by WUI, specific to a community; and, (c) does not use proxies for risk.

Species distribution modelling based on interpolated climate data is a widely applied, time- and cost-effective tool to estimate the potential species richness in a target area. However, high fragmentation, strong environmental gradients on a small-scale, and lack of fine-scale environmental data in tropical urban areas require alternative approaches. In this study we combined a rapid species assessment approach with environmental niche modelling based on high-resolution ASTER satellite imagery to predict species distributions of Bromeliaceae in the city of Merida, Venezuela. Twenty species of Bromeliaceae, e.g. 36% of the total bromeliad diversity of the state of Merida, were observed in the city, including seven species with CAM physiology. CAM species showed significantly higher occurrence probabilities in zones with higher soil sealing, whereas in C3 species a trend across soilsealing zones was not observed. The remarkable urban species richness of Bromeliaceae is here attributed to the species' different adaptive strategies, as well as to the strong elevation gradient of Merida city. Our species modelling approach provides new possibilities for the identification of indicator species in different urban built-up areas. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Aeolian desertification of this area is an important concern. Remote sensing and GIS technology were employed to assess the trends in aeolian desertification from 1975 to 2005. The monitoring results showed that, aeolian desert land increased from 15,112 to 17,214 km(2) during 1975-2005. In addition, it was found that the area of aeolian desertification increased rapidly from 1975 to 1990, was stable from 1990 to 2000, and slightly decreased from 2000 to 2005. Increasing temperature, overgrazing, and drainage of wetlands have been key driving factors of aeolian desertification. Thus, to control the expansion of aeolian desert lands in the source region of the Yellow River and to rehabilitate existing desert areas, the priority should be given to altering human behavior in these areas.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				DEC	2013	70	7					3245	3254		10.1007/s12665-013-2389-9								WOS:000326928600029						
J	Song, CH; Dannenberg, MP; Hwang, T				Song, Conghe; Dannenberg, Matthew P.; Hwang, Taehee			Optical remote sensing of terrestrial ecosystem primary productivity	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Terrestrial ecosystem primary productivity is a key indicator of ecosystem functions, including, but not limited to, carbon storage, provision of food and fiber, and sustaining biodiversity. However, measuring terrestrial ecosystem primary productivity in the field is extremely laborious and expensive. Optical remote sensing has revolutionized our ability to map terrestrial ecosystem primary productivity over large areas ranging from regions to the entire globe in a repeated, cost-efficient manner. This progress report reviews the theory and practice of mapping terrestrial primary productivity using optical remotely sensed data. Terrestrial ecosystem primary productivity is generally estimated with optical remote sensing via one of the following approaches: (1) empirical estimation from spectral vegetation indices; (2) models that are based on light-use-efficiency (LUE) theory; (3) models that are not based on LUE theory, but the biophysical processes of plant photosynthesis. Among these three, models based on LUE are the primary approach because there is a solid physical basis for the linkage between fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (f(APAR)) and remotely sensed spectral signatures of vegetation. There has been much inconsistency in the literature with regard to the appropriate value for LUE. This issue should be resolved with the ongoing efforts aimed at direct mapping of LUE from remote sensing. At the same time, major efforts have been dedicated to mapping vegetation canopy biochemical composition via imaging spectroscopy for use in process-based models to estimating primary productivity. In so doing, optical remote sensing will continue to play a vital role in global carbon cycle science research.

Mediterranean forest mapping using hyper-spectral satellite imagery	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Mediterranean forests are characterized by spatiotemporal heterogeneity that is associated with Mediterranean climate, floristic biodiversity and topographic variability. Satellite remote sensing can be an effective tool for characterizing and monitoring forest vegetation distribution within these fragmented Mediterranean landscapes. The heterogeneity of Mediterranean vegetation, however, often exceeds the resolution typical of most satellite sensors. Hyper-spectral remote sensing technology demonstrates the capacity for accurate vegetation identification. The objective of this research is to determine to what extent forest types can be discriminated using different image analysis techniques and spectral band combinations of Hyperion satellite imagery. This research mapped forest types using a pixel-based Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), nearest neighbour and membership function classifiers of the object-oriented classification. Hyperion classification was done after reducing Hyperion data using nine selected band combinations. Results indicate that the selection of band combination while reducing the Hyperion dataset improves classification results for both the overall and the individual forest type accuracy, in particular for the selected optimum Hyperion band combination. One shortcoming is that the performance of the best selected band combination was superior in terms of both overall and individual forest type accuracy when applying the membership classifier of the object-oriented method compared to SAM and nearest neighbour classifiers. However, all techniques seemed to suffer from a number of problems, such as spectral similarity among forest types, overall low energy response of the Hyperion sensor, Hyperion medium spatial resolution and spatiotemporal and spectral heterogeneity of the Mediterranean ecosystem at multiple scales.

J	Mullerova, J; Pergl, J; Pysek, P				Muellerova, Jana; Pergl, Jan; Pysek, Petr			Remote sensing as a tool for monitoring plant invasions: Testing the effects of data resolution and image classification approach on the detection of a model plant species Heracleum mantegazzianum (giant hogweed)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Plant invasions represent a threat not only to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning but also to the character of traditional landscapes. Despite the worldwide efforts to control and eradicate invasive species, their menace grows. New techniques enabling fast and precise monitoring and providing information on spatial structure of invasions are needed for efficient management strategies to be implemented. We present remote sensing assessment of a noxious invasive species Heracleum mantegazzianum (giant hogweed) that integrates different data sources, spatial and spectral resolutions, and image processing techniques. Panchromatic, multispectral and color very high spatial resolution (VHR) aerial photography (1947-2006, resolution 0.5 m), and medium spatial resolution satellite data (Rapid Eye 2010, resolution 5 m) were analyzed to assess their potential for hogweed monitoring by using pixel- (both supervised and unsupervised) and object-based image analysis (OBIA, automated hierarchical, iterative, and rule-based). Both point and grid based accuracy assessment was carried out. Described methods of object-based image analysis of VHR data enabled monitoring of hogweed at high classification accuracies measured by various means, regardless of the spectral resolution of the data provided that the data came from the species flowering period. Although the proposed automated processing of VHR data is relatively time-effective and standardized, application over large areas would be rather demanding due to the size of datasets, and multispectral satellite data of medium spatial resolution (lower than the size of individuals) was therefore tested. On such imagery, only larger stands could be identified but still the pixel-based supervised classification achieved moderate accuracy. Depending on the size of the area of interest and the detail needed the very high or medium spatial resolution data (acquired at the species flowering period) are to be used. High accuracies achieved for VHR data indicate the possible application of described methodology for monitoring invasions and their long-term dynamics elsewhere, making management measures comparable precise, fast and efficient.

J	Takahashi, R; Todo, Y				Takahashi, Ryo; Todo, Yasuyuki			The impact of a shade coffee certification program on forest conservation: A case study from a wild coffee forest in Ethiopia	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												In recent years, shade coffee certification programs have attracted increasing attention from conservation and development organizations. Certification programs offer an opportunity to link environmental and economic goals by providing a premium price to producers and thereby contributing to forest conservation. However, the significance of the conservation efforts of certification programs remains unclear because of a lack of empirical evidence. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a shade coffee certification program on forest conservation. The study was conducted in the Belete-Gera Regional Forest Priority Area in Ethiopia, and remote sensing data of 2005 and 2010 were used to gauge the change of forest area. Using propensity score matching estimation, we found that forests under the coffee certification program were less likely to be deforested than forests without forest coffee. By contrast, the difference in the degree of deforestation between forests with forest coffee but not under the certification program and forests with no forest coffee is statistically insignificant. These results suggest that the certification program has had a large effect on forest protection, decreasing the probability of deforestation by 1.7 percentage points. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Mapping natural habitats using remote sensing and sparse partial least square discriminant analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												This work presents a novel approach for mapping the spatial distribution of natural habitats in the Foothills of Larzac' Natura 2000 listed site located in a French Mediterranean biogeographical region. Sparse partial least square discriminant analysis was used to analyse two RapidEye data sets (June 2009 and July 2010) with the purpose of choosing the most informative spectral, textural, and thematic variables that allow discrimination of habitat classes. The sparse partial least square discriminant analysis selected relevant and stable variables for the discrimination of habitat classes that could be linked to ecological or biophysical characteristics. It also gave insight into the similarities and differences between habitat classes with comparable physiognomic characteristics. The highest user accuracy was obtained for dry improved grasslands (u=91.97%) followed by riparian ash woods (u=88.38%). These results are very encouraging given that these two classes were identified in Annex 1 of the EC Habitats Directive as of Community interest. Due to limited data input requirements and its computational efficiency, the approach developed in this article is a good alternative to other types of variable selection approaches in a supervised classification framework and can be easily transferred to other Natura 2000 sites.					corbane, christina/0000-0002-2670-1302												0143-1161	1366-5901				NOV 10	2013	34	21					7625	7647		10.1080/01431161.2013.822603								WOS:000324459800012

Comparing field-based monitoring and remote-sensing, using deforestation from logging at Important Bird Areas as a case study	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Monitoring sites of biodiversity conservation importance is essential for their conservation. It allows threats to be identified and quantified, priorities to be set, responses to be developed, and facilitates adaptive management. Field-based monitoring protocols need to be simple enough to be widely applied in countries with limited capacity while being sufficiently robust to provide widely reliable data. A simple, globally standardised monitoring protocol is now being implemented at thousands of sites of global avian conservation significance (Important Bird Areas, IBAs) worldwide, but the consistency of the approach across sites, countries and regions remains untested. We tested the match between estimates of the threat to IBAs from logging derived from such monitoring, with standardised deforestation rates derived from remote sensing data for 2000-2005 to determine if the two were consistently related. We found a significant positive correlation between the impact of the threat from logging and the proportion of forest lost (although the gross forest loss did not differ systematically with the two components of the threat impact: scope and severity). The results give us some confidence that the simple field-based protocol being implemented by a diversity of surveyors with varied technical capacity can generate meaningful and consistent monitoring data across the globe.

J	Zellweger, F; Braunisch, V; Baltensweiler, A; Bollmann, K				Zellweger, Florian; Braunisch, Veronika; Baltensweiler, Andri; Bollmann, Kurt			Remotely sensed forest structural complexity predicts multi species occurrence at the landscape scale	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Along with plant species composition forest structural complexity is an important determinant of forest biodiversity, but difficult to predict in space from field data. We analyzed forest structural complexity based on a comprehensive set of variables derived from nationally available, area-wide remote sensing, particularly LiDAR data. We generated variables related to vertical and horizontal structural heterogeneity, as well as site factors potentially indicating the abundance of weakened trees or snags. We used them to predict the occurrence of four bird species with narrow and complementary structural habitat requirements, together being indicative of structurally diverse forests. Presence/absence data of Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), Hazel Grouse (Bonasa bonasia), Three-toed Woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) and Pygmy Owl (Glaucidium passerinum) from three biogeographic mountain regions in Switzerland were used to calibrate species distribution models (boosted regression trees BRT) for each species individually, as well as for the sympatric occurrence of at least three of the four target species. The predictive deviances explained (D-2) and the AUC values obtained from cross-validation ranged from 15.5% to 63.1% and 0.77% to 0.97% respectively. Sympatric species occurrence reflecting overall forest structural complexity was predicted best, with an outstanding accuracy. To support management and monitoring schemes we identified variable threshold effects based on partial dependence plots. Variables related to vertical foliage distributions were most important, followed by horizontal structural attributes such as canopy height variations, forest edges and gaps. Site factors such as topographic position improved all models and were most important for the species depending on weakened trees and dead wood. We conclude that recent advances in remote sensing allow for large-scale determination of forest structural characteristics suitable for developing species and habitat distribution models of considerable generality, while keeping an unprecedented level of detail. Our approach allows forest managers to amend regional and countrywide management plans with reliable maps depicting areas of high forest structural complexity and habitat quality, which will facilitate the integration of conservation-relevant information into multifunctional forestry.

National assessment of forest fragmentation in India: Landscape indices as measures of the effects of fragmentation and forest cover change	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Forest fragmentation is considered as one of the major conservation issue. The purpose of this study is to contribute to the understanding of the national assessment of spatial patterns of forest fragmentation and influence of deforestation on fragmentation in the Indian forests during three decade interval (1975-2005). Mapping of forest cover was carried out based on Landsat MSS and IRS P6 AWiFS data using hybrid classification techniques on 1:250,000 scale. The present study considered biogeographic zones as a major stratum for national level assessment. The forest fragmentation was analysed based on landscape indices which allow quantification and categorisation of complex forest landscapes and depict landscape composition, structure and scenario of fragmentation. The analysis revealed that in all biogeographic zones, more than 90% of total number of forest fragments consists of patches having area less than 1 km(2). At national level the mean forest patch size stands at 187 ha. The total core area was highest for Islands (87.4%) followed by Eastern Himalayas (82.5%), Deccan (78.9%), Deserts (76.4%) and Eastern Ghats (76%). The temporal analysis shows that the loss of Indian forest area as 5.8% during 1975-2005. The annual rate of deforestation has been computed as 0.20% at national level. The decreased mean patch size, increased edge density and increased number of patches from 1975 to 2005 indicates ongoing fragmentation in biogeographic zones. The very high fragmentation in Trans Himalayas is contributed mostly by the natural factors while in other biogeographic zones, increased fragmentation is due to deforestation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The first objective of the article is to broaden the discussion of fragmentation by addressing social processes that generate it through the construction of roads. Roads impact land cover change worldwide, and their role in Amazonian deforestation is known. The article also seeks to extend the literature on roads to address the social processes and individual behaviors that create the road network architecture. The second objective is to open a discussion about the biodiversity implications of different patterns of forest fragmentation. Our specific focus is the geometry of settlement associated with urban nodes, referred to here as radial fragmentation. The article pursues its objectives by implementing a conceptual framework that extends the pattern-to-process paradigm of landscape ecology by adding a (social) process-to-pattern component. This is accomplished through a mixed-method approach including (1) field-based narratives of the social processes that gave rise to radial fragmentation in the hinterland of the town of Itaituba, an important settlement in the middle Tapajos valley; (2) remote sensing of the evolution of road networks, which we then link to deforestation in a temporal analysis of emergent fragmentation patterns; and (3) computational applications to compare the biodiversity implications of radial and fishbone landscape fragmentation.

In this study, the 3D green biomass could be acquired on basis of a remote sensing inversion model in which each standing wood was first scanned by Terrestrial Laser Scanner to catch its point cloud data, then the point cloud picture was opened in a digital mapping data acquisition system to get the elevation in an independent coordinate, and at last the individual volume captured was associated with the remote sensing image in SPOT5(System Probatoired'Observation dela Tarre) by means of such tools as SPSS (Statistical Product and Service Solutions), GIS (Geographic Information System), RS (Remote Sensing) and spatial analysis software (FARO SCENE and Geomagic studio11). The results showed that the 3D green biomass of Beijing urban forest was 399.1295 million m(3), of which coniferous was 28.7871 million m(3) and broad-leaf was 370.3424 million m(3). The accuracy of 3D green biomass was over 85%, comparison with the values from 235 field sample data in a typical sampling way. This suggested that the precision done by the 3D forest green biomass based on the image in SPOT5 could meet requirements. This represents an improvement over the conventional method because it not only provides a basis to evalue indices of Beijing urban greenings, but also introduces a new technique to assess 3D green biomass in other cities.																	1932-6203					OCT 11	2013	8	10							e75920	10.1371/journal.pone.0075920								WOS:000325819400026	24146792

We tested the algorithm using Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) data for eastern Africa. Using a unique sequence of four statistical change-point detection methods, we identified significant increases or decreases in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), estimated the approximate time of change, and characterized the likely forms of change (i.e. linear trend, abrupt mean and/or variability change, and hockey-stick shaped change). Our method allows not just the identification of the change point but also the manner of change, and it can provide considerable insights into land-cover trajectories. In that sense, our approach has a significant advantage over other types of change-detection methods commonly reported in the remote-sensing literature. Although we demonstrated our algorithm using annual averages for coarse resolution data, our method can be easily adapted to finer spatial or temporal scale data, assuming assumptions of normality and independence are met. Overall, the changes detected by the algorithm are consistent with changes observed by other authors for the East Africa study area. We have demonstrated a powerful new tool for the detection of land-cover change using multi-temporal satellite data.																	0143-1161	1366-5901				OCT 10	2013	34	19					6636	6650		10.1080/01431161.2013.804224								WOS:000321609300011

We studied forest-agriculture transitions in southwestern Ethiopia and hypothesized that the presence of coffee (Coffea arabica)decreases deforestation rates because of coffee's importance to local economies and its widespread occurrence in forests and forest margins. Using satellite images and elevation data, we compared changes in forest cover over 37 years (1973-2010) across elevations in 2 forest-agriculture mosaic landscapes (1100 km(2) around Bonga and 3000 km(2) in Goma-Gera). In the field in the Bonga area, we determined coffee cover and forest structure in 40 forest margins that differed in time since deforestation. Both the absolute and relative deforestation rates were lower at coffee-growing elevations compared with at higher elevations (-10/20% vs. -40/50% comparing relative rates at 1800 m asl and 2300-2500 m asl, respectively). Within the coffee-growing elevation, the proportion of sites with high coffee cover (>20%) was significantly higher in stable margins (42% of sites that had been in the same location for the entire period) than in recently changed margins (0% of sites where expansion of annual crops had changed the margin). Disturbance level and forest structure did not differ between sites with 30% or 3% coffee. However, a growing body of literature on gradients of coffee management in Ethiopia reports coffee's negative effects on abundances of forest-specialist species. Even if the presence of coffee slows down the conversion of forest to annual-crop agriculture, there is a risk that an intensification of coffee management will still threaten forest biodiversity, including the genetic diversity of wild coffee. Conservation policy for Ethiopian forests thus needs to develop strategies that acknowledge that forests without coffee production may have higher deforestation risks than forests with coffee production and that forests with coffee production often have lower biodiversity value. Efectos de la Administracion Cafetalera sobre las Tasas de Deforestacion y la Integridad de los Bosques Resumen El conocimiento sobre como se utilizan los margenes de los bosques puede ser crucial para el entendimiento general de los cambios en la cubierta boscosa, la estructura de los bosques y la biodiversidad en el paisaje. Estudiamos transiciones bosque-agricultura en el suroeste de Etiopia y partimos de la hipotesis de que la presencia del cafe (Coffea arabica) disminuye las tasas de deforestacion por la importancia del cafe para las economias locales y su ocurrencia extensa en los bosques y los margenes de estos. Usando imagenes de satelite e informacion de elevacion, comparamos los cambios en la cubierta boscosa a traves de 37 anos (1973-2010) a lo largo de elevaciones en 2 paisajes mosaico de bosque y sembradios (1100 km(2) alrededor de Bonga y 3000 km(2) en Goma-Gera). En el campo en el area de Bonga determinamos la cobertura de cafe y la estructura del bosque en 40 margenes de bosque que difirieron en el tiempo desde la deforestacion. Tanto la tasa absoluta como la relativa de deforestacion fueron mas bajas en las elevaciones donde se cultiva cafe comparadas con las de elevaciones mas altas (-10/20% vs. -40/50% comparando tasas relativas en 1800 msnm y 2300-2500 msnm, respectivamente). Dentro de la elevacion donde se cultiva cafe, la proporcion de sitios con una alta cobertura de cafe (>20%) fue significativamente mas alta en los margenes estables (42% de los sitios que habian estado en la misma localidad durante el periodo entero) que en los margenes con cambios recientes (0% de los sitios donde la expansion anual de cultivos habian alterado el margen). El nivel de perturbacion y de estructura del bosque no difirio entre los sitios con 30% o 3% de cafe. Sin embargo, un creciente cuerpo de literatura sobre los gradientes de administracion del cafe en Etiopia reportan los efectos negativos del cafe sobre la abundancia de especies especialistas de bosques. Aunque sea cierto que la presencia de cafe disminuye la conversion de bosque a sembradios de cosecha anual, existe el riesgo de que la intensificacion de la administracion de cafe todavia amenace la biodiversidad del bosque, incluyendo la diversidad genetica del cafe silvestre. La politica de conservacion para los bosques etiopes entonces debe desarrollar estrategias que reconozcan que los bosques sin produccion cafetalera pueden tener riesgos mayores de deforestacion que los bosques con produccion cafetalera y que los bosques con produccion cafetalera seguido tienen un valor bajo de biodiversidad.																	0888-8892					OCT	2013	27	5					1031	1040		10.1111/cobi.12079								WOS:000324931700017	23772911

Floristic diversity in fire-sensitive eucalypt woodlands shows a 'U'-shaped relationship with time since fire	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												Understanding ecosystem responses to disturbance is important for effective management of biodiversity. Observed relationships between time since disturbance and diversity have taken a variety of forms, only some of which are explicitly predicted in models of vegetation succession. This makes generalization and predictions for specific communities difficult. Negative relationships have been the predominant diversity response to time since fire in fire-prone Mediterranean-climate ecosystems; however, few studies have analysed responses in infrequently burnt ecosystems such as Mediterranean-climate woodlands dominated by fire-sensitive trees. We used a space-for-time approach and multiple stand-ageing techniques (Landsat imagery, growth ring counts and growth ring-size relationships) to characterize diversity and compositional changes with time since fire (3-370+years) in fire-sensitive Eucalyptus salubris woodlands in south-western Australia. Species density and Pielou's evenness showed an overall U'-shaped response to time since fire, although variability between plots was considerable. Plant functional type and species composition differed with time since fire, with greater richness and cover of ground layer, and long dispersal potential' functional types with increasing time since fire. Conversely, there was an early or intermediate peak in taller and short dispersal potential' functional types. We propose that the unusual U'-shaped diversity-time since fire relationship is driven by competitively dominant tree and shrub layers having maximum cover at intermediate times since fire. Subdominant functional types were able to exploit lower levels of competition in the immediate post-fire period and after density-dependent thinning of the trees and shrubs.Synthesis and applications. Recurrent fire is not required to maintain diversity in these fire-sensitive woodlands as diversity reached a maximum in mature vegetation. Fire intervals of <c. 200years are likely to have adverse consequences on diversity, which is of conservation concern given apparently high recent rates of occurrence of fire. Changes in diversity were not apparent when times since fire were truncated to those available from remote sensing, illustrating that space-for-time studies defined solely by remote sensing may obscure equivalent U'-shaped diversity-time since fire relationships.

What multiscale environmental drivers can best be discriminated from a habitat index derived from a remotely sensed vegetation time series?	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Understanding which environmental conditions are critical for species survival is a critical, ongoing question in ecology. These conditions can range from climate, at the broadest scale, through to elevation and other local landscape conditions, to fine scale landscape patterns of land cover and use. Remote sensing is an ideal technology to monitor and assess changes in these environmental conditions at a variety of spatial and temporal scales, with many studies focusing on the physiological state of vegetation derived from time series of satellite measurements. As vegetation occurs within specific climatic zones, over certain soil, terrain, and land cover types, it can be difficult to decipher the influence of the underlying role of climate, topography, soil, and land cover on the observed vegetation signal. In this article, we specifically addressed this problem by asking the question: what is the relative impact and importance of these different scales of environmental drivers on the temporal and spatial patterns observed on a habitat index derived from remotely sensed data? To find the solution, we utilized a SPOT VEGETATION-normalized difference vegetation index time series of Europe to create a remote-sensing-derived habitat index, which incorporates aspects of productivity, seasonality, and cover. We then compared the observed temporal and spatial variations in the index to a pan-Europe terrestrial classification system, which explicitly incorporates variations in climate, terrain, soil parent material, land cover, and use. Results indicated that the most accurate level of discrimination from the habitat index was at the broadest level of the hierarchy, climate, while the poorest degree of discrimination was associated with elevation. In terms of similarity on the index across time and space, we found that arable and forest cover classes were more similar across elevation and parent materials than across other land cover types within them. Analyzing the remote-sensing index, at multiple scales, provides significant insights into the drivers of satellite-derived greenness indices, as well as highlights the benefit and cautions associated with linking satellite-derived indirect indicators to species distribution modeling and biodiversity.

Recent studies have suggested that, as cities evolve, certain general patterns emerge along the urban-rural gradient although individual cities always differ in details. To help better understand these generalities and idiosyncrasies in urbanization patterns, we analyzed the spatiotemporal dynamics of the Shanghai metropolitan area from 1989 to 2005, based on landscape metrics and remote sensing data. Specifically, the main objectives of our study were to quantitatively characterize the spatiotemporal patterns of urbanization in Shanghai in recent decades, identify possible spatial signatures of different land use types, and test the diffusion coalescence hypotheses of urban growth. We found that, similar to numerous cities around the world reported in previous studies, urbanization increased the diversity, fragmentation, and configurational complexity of the urban landscape of Shanghai. In the same time, however, the urban-rural patterns of several land use types in Shanghai seem unique-quite different from previously reported patterns. For most land use types, each showed a distinctive spatial pattern along a rural-urban transect, as indicated by landscape metrics. Furthermore, the urban expansion of Shanghai exhibited an outward wave-like pattern. Our results suggest that the urbanization of Shanghai followed a complex diffusion-coalescence pattern along the rural-urban transect and in time.

The present study was carried out to understand the vegetation composition and structure in Doda area of Western Himalayas, India. During the study, vegetation types were mapped using on-screen image interpretation technique of multispectral high resolution satellite data. A total of ten types of vegetation were delineated from the satellite data. Phytosociological data was collected for the forest, pasture and scrub classes using nested-quadrat approach to characterize the vegetation. A total of ten phytosociological parameters were analyzed. Pinaceae, Rosaceae and Asteraceae were the dominant plant families with most of the identified plant species having a very high medicinal value. Other important component of the study involved landscape modelling, using the Spatial Landscape Analysis Model for identifying disturbance regimes and biodiversity rich landscapes in the area. The model results indicate that most of the area contains a very rich biodiversity repository with only a few areas showing signs of disturbance where terrain is either complex or where the anthropogenic pressures on forest resources are apparent. The forest and nature conservation managers could use the conservation measures suggested on the basis of these research findings for developing biodiversity conservation strategies in the region.

ISME JOURNAL												Understanding the variability of marine biodiversity is a central issue in microbiology. Current observational programs are based on in situ studies, but their implementation at the global scale is particularly challenging, owing to the ocean extent, its temporal variability and the heterogeneity of the data sources on which compilations are built. Here, we explore the possibility of identifying phytoplanktonic biodiversity hotspots from satellite. We define a Shannon entropy index based on patchiness in ocean color bio-optical anomalies. This index provides a high resolution (1 degree) global coverage. It shows a relation to temperature and mid-latitude maxima in accordance with those previously evidenced in microbiological biodiversity model and observational studies. Regional maxima are in remarkable agreement with several known biodiversity hotspots for plankton organisms and even for higher levels of the marine trophic chain, as well as with some in situ planktonic biodiversity estimates (from Atlantic Meridional Transect cruise). These results encourage to explore marine biodiversity with a coordinated effort of the molecular, ecological and remote sensing communities.

Location: Switzerland, covering 41244km(2) of Central Europe. Methods: We applied linear regressions to model species richness of woody species, herbs, edaphic bryophytes and epiphytic lichens in Swiss forests. We included high-resolution predictors derived from digital height models and from satellite spectral images. Coarser-scaled predictors characterizing climatic and topographic conditions were also included, as were soil properties and geology. We applied hierarchical partitioning to regression models to investigate the independent contribution of each predictor set to species richness models. Results: Predictors derived from high-resolution remote sensing data substantially improved the species richness models (increase 14-55% of R-2). However, coarse-scaled climatic and topographic predictors still explained a high proportion of the variance in the species richness data in all models, independently of other predictors commonly used. The importance of the remotely sensed variables was strongly dependent on the biogeographic region considered. The species richness models of smaller organisms of the forest floor (herbs and edaphic bryophytes) benefited greatly from adding high-resolution topographic predictors, indicating the importance of microtopographic heterogeneity for these groups. Both epiphytic lichens and herbs responded strongly to indicators of structural properties of the forest stand. Conclusions: High-resolution remote sensing data is a proxy for micro-environmental structures and variation in these structures. Our results show that predictors derived from such data can improve species richness models considerably, especially in regions with low climatic and/or topographic variation. High-resolution remote sensing variables excellently complement coarser-scaled predictors, as they are available over large areas at low cost.

G.; Tarantino, Cristina; Adamo, Maria; Mairota, Paola			Remote sensing for conservation monitoring: Assessing protected areas, habitat extent, habitat condition, species diversity, and threats	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Monitoring protected areas and their surrounds at local to regional scales is essential given their vulnerability to anthropogenic pressures, including those associated with climatic fluctuation, and important for management and fulfilment of national and international directives and agreements. Whilst monitoring has commonly revolved around field data, remote sensing can play a key role in establishing baselines of the extent and condition of habitats and associated species diversity as well as quantifying losses, degradation or recovery associated with specific events or processes. Landsat images constitute a major data source for habitat monitoring, capturing broad scale information on changes in habitat extent and spatial patterns of fragmentation that allow disturbances in protected areas to be identified. These data are, however, less able to provide information on changes in habitat quality, species distribution and fine-scale disturbances, and hence data from other spaceborne optical sensors are increasingly being considered. Very High Resolution (VHR) optical datasets have been exploited to a lesser extent, partly because of the relative recency of spaceborne observations and challenges associated with obtaining and routinely extracting information from airborne multi-spectral and hyperspectral datasets. The lack of a shortwave infrared band in many VHR datasets and provision of too much detail (e.g., shadows within and from landscape objects) also present challenges in some cases. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, particularly when used synergistically with optical data, have benefited the detection of changes in the three-dimensional structure of habitats. This review shows that remote sensing has a strong, yet underexploited potential to assist in the monitoring of protected areas. However, the data generated need to be utilized more effectively to enable better management of the condition of protected areas and their surrounds, prepare for climate change, and assist planning for future landscape management.

J	Luck-Vogel, M; O'Farrell, PJ; Roberts, W				Lueck-Vogel, Melanie; O'Farrell, Patrick J.; Roberts, Wesley			Remote sensing based ecosystem state assessment in the Sandveld Region, South Africa	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												We present a remote sensing based approach for assessing ecosystem state or intactness to inform land use management and conservation planning. Using segmented multispectral medium resolution satellite imagery, parameters related to the image objects' spectral brightness and heterogeneity, and compactness are used to derive a scoring system of 0 to 10 for the ecosystem intactness, with 0 being completely degraded and 10 being pristine. Linked to the remote sensing approach we suggest a field validation approach that focuses on 10 ecosystem-relevant visually assessed parameters which, when combined, produce a score out of 10 as well. The approach was tested in the South African Sandveld region using a SPOT 5 image from 2009 and a Landsat 7 ETM+ image from 2011. Field assessments took place in 2011. Both image data sets returned consistent results suggesting an inter-sensor transferability of the approach. Inconsistencies between satellite and field scores occurred mainly on sites where crops were currently being grown and on fields where various stages of succession were underway, following abandonment. Masking out of those sites which are of little interest from an ecosystem state perspective would improve overall accuracies. For regions with vegetation types that differ significantly in cover and structure, a stratified approach is suggested to optimise the results per vegetation type. Outputs suggest that the approach with its standardised and robust results and its repeatability provides a suitable tool for long term monitoring of large regions with a degree of detail sufficiently high to allow for fine scale planning.

Hyperspectral imagery can be an important source of information to assist in the evaluation of the habitats' conservation status, as it can provide continuous maps of habitat quality indicators (e.g., life forms, management activities, grass, shrub and tree encroachment) at the pixel level. Such local level information is highly needed for management purposes, e.g., the location of habitat patches and their sizes and quality within a protected site. This paper focuses on the use of continuous fraction images as derived from spectral mixture analysis of hyperspectral imagery (AHS-160), in combination with segmentation techniques, to facilitate habitat quality assessment in a heathland site in the Netherlands. This combined application of techniques on hyperspectral imagery demonstrates the usefulness of information from continuous fraction maps of grass abundance (Molinia caerulea) in heathlands - at and within the patch level - compared to traditional mapping techniques that assess grass encroachment in a limited number of abundance classes at the patch level. It therefore provides a better basis to monitor large areas for processes such as grass encroachment that largely determine the conservation status of Natura 2000 heathland areas. Timely, accurate and up-to-date spatial information on the encroachment of mosses, grasses, shrubs or trees (dominant species) can help conservation managers to take better decisions and to better evaluate the effect of taken measures. While discrepancies exist between the results of field-based vegetation surveys and the proposed remote sensing approach, we provide a discussion on the uncertainty of determining which of both methods is most accurate in relation to dominant species, which is in our case Molinia caerulea, and set forth several reasons why the remote sensing based approach might form a better basis for the monitoring of abundant species and patch evolution through time.

Using a moving window approach on high-resolution geospatiat data on vegetation, a fragmentation index was computed across the entire Indian landscape. On the basis of the index, the forests areas were categorized as high, moderate, low or intact. It was observed that almost half of the forested land is intact in spite of tremendous population pressures, indicating effective protection. Most of the biodiversity-rich forests, such as evergreen, subtropical broadleaf and temperate broadleaf forests, are relatively intact or have a low degree of fragmentation. But highly fragmented regions across the Indian landscape harbour a number of endemic species, some of them of medicinal importance, that need conservation. This study presents an approach to mapping fragmentation caused by socio-economic drivers, namely shifting cultivation, forest villages, infrastructural development, mining and encroachment. This approach provides critical inputs to prioritization and conservation of forests and the associated biodiversity.																	0011-3891					SEP 25	2013	105	6					774	780										WOS:000325057500022

The goal of this study was to examine the resilience and stability of Cymodocea nodosa-dominated seagrass meadows in Urbino lagoon (Corsica, Mediterranean Sea) by characterizing the spatio-temporal dynamics of seagrass meadows over a 40-year period and comparing (anthropogenic and climatic) environmental fluctuations. The spatio-temporal evolution of seagrass meadows was investigated using previous maps (1973, 1979, 1990, 1994, 1996, 1999) and a 2011 map realized by aerial photography-remote sensing combined with GIS technology. Environmental fluctuation was investigated via physical-chemical parameters (rainfall, water temperature, salinity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen) and human-impact changes (aquaculture, artificial channel). The results showed a severe decline (estimated at -49%) in seagrass meadows between 1973 and 1994 followed by a period of strong recovery (estimated to +42%) between 1994 and 2011. Increased turbidity, induced either by rainfall events, dredging or phytoplankton growth, emerged as the most important driver of the spatio-temporal evolution of Cymodocea nodosa-dominated meadows in Urbino lagoon over the last four decades. Climate events associated to increased turbidity and reduced salinity and temperature could heavily impact seagrass dynamics. This study shows that Urbino lagoon, a system relatively untouched by human impact, shelters seagrass meadows that exhibit high resilience and stability. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Conventional remote sensing tools (such as satellite and aircraft imaging) provide data at limited spatial and temporal resolutions and relatively high costs for small-scale environmental science and ecologically-focussed studies. In this paper, we describe a low-cost, kite-based imaging system and photogrammetric/mapping procedure that was developed for constructing high-resolution, three-dimensional, multi-spectral terrain models of intertidal rocky shores. The processing procedure uses automatic image feature detection and matching, structure-from-motion and photo-textured terrain surface reconstruction algorithms that require minimal human input and only a small number of ground control points and allow the use of cheap, consumer-grade digital cameras. The resulting maps combine imagery at visible and near-infrared wavelengths and topographic information at sub-centimeter resolutions over an intertidal shoreline 200 m long, thus enabling spatial properties of the intertidal environment to be determined across a hierarchy of spatial scales. Results of the system are presented for an intertidal rocky shore at Jervis Bay, New South Wales, Australia. Potential uses of this technique include mapping of plant (micro-and macro-algae) and animal (e.g. gastropods) assemblages at multiple spatial and temporal scales.																	1932-6203					SEP 19	2013	8	9							e73550	10.1371/journal.pone.0073550								WOS:000324777300013	24069206					
J	Yue, DX; Guo, JJ; Hui, C				Yue, Dongxia; Guo, Jianjun; Hui, Cang			Scale dependency of biocapacity and the fallacy of unsustainable development	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Area-based information obtained from remote sensing and aerial photography is often used in studies on ecological footprint and sustainability, especially in calculating biocapacity. Given the importance of the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP; i.e. the scale dependency of area-based information), a comprehensive understanding of how the changes of biocapacity across scales (i.e. the resolution of data) is pivotal for regional sustainable development. Here, we present case studies on the effect of spatial scales on the biocapacity estimated for two typical river basin and watershed in Northwest China. The analysis demonstrated that the area sizes of major land covers and subsequently biocapacity showed strong signals of scale dependency, with minor land covers in the region shrinking while major land covers expanding when using large-grain (low resolution) data. The relationship between land cover sizes and their change ratio across scales was shown to follow a logarithm function. The biocapacity estimated at 10 x 10 km resolution is 10% lower than the one estimated at 1 x 1 km resolution, casting doubts on many regional and global studies which often rely on coarse scale datasets. Our results not only suggest that fine-scale biocapacity estimates can be extrapolated from coarse-scale ones according to the specific scale-dependent patterns of land covers, but also serve as a reminder that conclusions of regional and global un-sustainability derived from low-resolution datasets could be a fallacy due to the MAUP.

Changes in these signals can result in recognition mismatches between individuals living in different habitats, leading to reproductive divergence and speciation. For example, numerous studies have shown that differences in avian song may be a potent prezygotic isolating mechanism. Typically, however, detailed studies of environmental pressures on variation in animal behavior have been conducted only at small spatial scales. Here, we use remote-sensing data to predict animal behavior, in this case, bird song, across vast spatial scales. We use remotely sensed data to predict the song characteristics of the little greenbul (Andropadus virens), a widely distributed African passerine, found across secondary and mature rainforest habitats and the rainforest-savanna ecotone. Satellite data that captured ecosystem structure and function explained up to 66% of the variation in song characteristics. Song differences observed across habitats, including those between human-altered and mature rainforest, have the potential to lead to reproductive divergence, and highlight the impacts that both natural and anthropogenic change may have on natural populations. Our approach offers a novel means to examine the ecological correlates of animal behavior across large geographic areas with potential applications to both evolutionary and conservation biology.

Rocky shore ecosystems comprise a mosaic of habitat types and therefore require good technology to extract fine-scale spatial data on habitat extent and quality. Airborne topographic light detection and ranging data and 0.1-m resolution digital aerial photography were used to map and quantify distinct habitats that influence the distribution of biodiversity on rocky shores. The objectives of this study were to create and test the accuracy of a classification system for the rocky shore habitat, to develop remote sensing techniques useful for the conservation of intertidal rocky shores, and to create detailed digital terrain models for five headlands in the Solitary Island Marine Park, mid-north coast, New South Wales, Australia. The intertidal rocky shore habitats were classified according to tidal heights and substrate type. Ground-truthing of remote sensing data was carried out by visual surveys during low tide. Error assessments using precision analysis and classification accuracy tests confirmed the reliability of the technique with <5% error. The data generated from this research can be used as a platform for spatial analysis of this environment, including modelling changes in biodiversity under different climate change scenarios.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SEP	2013	29	5					1184	1190		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12-00142.1								WOS:000326304800020

Remote-sensing based mapping approaches are needed to monitor gradual changes in grassland composition and biodiversity of remote and inaccessible areas. Hyperspectral remote sensing in combination with regression and ordination techniques is a promising approach to map continuous representations of prominent floristic gradients at the landscape scale. This approach has, however, to date not been tested in alpine environments with difficult terrain. In the present study we tested whether hyperspectral data allows for the differentiation of species-rich grassland types of a subalpine pasture landscape in Georgia, Greater Caucasus. Due to the unavailability of space- or airborne hyperspectral data, we used field-spectrometric in situ data to investigate this potential. We sampled the vegetation of four grassland types (as classified by cluster analysis) using the Braun-Blanquet approach. For these 60 plots we made four measurements of their hyperspectral canopy reflectance (325-1075 nm) on two dates within a seven-day period at biomass peak. Floristic gradients were derived from Non-metric Multi Dimensional Scaling (NMDS) ordination. These gradients were subsequently subjected to Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) to predict NMDS scores from the corresponding canopy reflectance. Cross validated Pearson R-2 values for the PLSR models derived from the four measurements ranged from 0.60 to 0.83. Reflectance data sampled on the same day yielded similar results in the respective models, while temporal transferability within the seven day period was limited. The reflectance values of the significant wavelengths in the best models were subjected to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to display the spectral similarity of plots. The congruency between the similarity of species composition (NMDS) and spectral similarity (PCA) was satisfactorily assessed by Procrustes rotation. The floristic gradients in our study were directly related to pronounced biophysical and environmental gradients, which are responsible for differences in the spectral signatures. Our results indicate that hyperspectral data has the potential to differentiate the composition of Caucasian subalpine grassland types and offers multiple opportunities for very detailed vegetation mapping in difficult terrain.

Rebuilding the Brazilian rainforest: Agroforestry strategies for secondary forest succession	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Does the adoption of agroforestry by small farmers in the Brazilian Amazon promote secondary forest succession on the degraded pastures and crop fields? New results from a small-scale farm agroforestry demonstration project, the Rondonia Agroforestry Pilot Project (RAPP) that began in 1992 are presented in this paper. In 1992, 242 farmers were surveyed by a stratified random sampling protocol, 50 of whom were selected to participate in the RAPP, constituting its experimental group. The remaining 191 farmers served as a control group. Farmers from both groups were re-surveyed in 2002 (after 10 years) and again in 2010 (after 18 years). Annual site visits to the experimental group farms were conducted from 1993 through 2003 to monitor agroforest plot development and management, and changes in pertinent socioeconomic and household demographic characteristics such as household capacity, production systems, and social participation. Differences in property size, number of people permanently residing on the property, and social participation were found between the experimental and control group, with the experimental group having larger properties, more residents, and more participation in mutual aid associations. Control group farmers were also more reliant on cattle production (based on 2009 sales) despite having similar amounts of pasture as farmers in the experimental group. Within the experimental group, very few differences were found between farmers based on the type of agroforestry plot: timber, mixed or non-timber. Remote sensing analyses reveal long-term (10 years+) spectral differences in terms of the similarity to primary forest of both the agroforestry plots and the entire properties of the farms in this study. Experimental group farmers with mixed or timber-based agroforestry plots allowed more secondary forest succession to occur in and around their plots than farmers with non-timber plots. Although, on average, farm properties have become less spectrally similar to primary forest since 1992, properties with agroforestry plots tend to have more secondary succession and/or primary forest on their land in 2011. Several example properties are shown to illustrate the tendency of farmers with agroforestry plots to allow more secondary forest succession to occur on their land. (C) 2013 The Authors.

J	Redowan, M				Redowan, Mohammad			Tree Diversity Detection with Mid-Resolution Images and Environmental Data in a Neural Network	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Biodiversity maps are crucial to conservation management. The present study assesses the accuracy of detecting tree diversity in an Italian forest site by combining mid-resolution images from Landsat-TM or Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS)'s Advanced Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer type 2 (AVNIR-2) sensors with environmental data namely elevation, slope, aspect and solar radiation in an artificial Neural Network (NN) classifier. The map accuracies obtained for Landsat-TM and ALOS images are 60 % and 53 % respectively. Use of environmental data increases accuracies to 91 % and 81 % respectively. Landsat-TM detects tree diversity more accurately than ALOS. Both the coarser pixel size and finer spectral resolution of Landsat-TM contributed to its higher accuracy.																	0255-660X					SEP	2013	41	3					567	576		10.1007/s12524-012-0254-z								WOS:000324249800009

To begin addressing this gap, the North American Forest Dynamics (NAFD) project has examined a geographic sample of 50 Landsat satellite image time series to assess trends in forest disturbance across the conterminous United States for 1985-2005. The geographic sample design used a probability-based scheme to encompass major forest types and maximize geographic dispersion. For each sample location disturbance was identified in the Landsat series using the Vegetation Change Tracker (VCT) algorithm. The NAFD analysis indicates that, on average, 2.77 Mha y(-1) of forests were disturbed annually, representing 1.09% y(-1) of US forestland. These satellite-based national disturbance rates estimates tend to be lower than those derived from land management inventories, reflecting both methodological and definitional differences. In particular, the VCT approach used with a biennial time step has limited sensitivity to low-intensity disturbances. Unlike prior satellite studies, our biennial forest disturbance rates vary by nearly a factor of two between high and low years. High western US disturbance rates were associated with active fire years and insect activity, whereas variability in the east is more strongly related to harvest rates in managed forests. We note that generating a geographic sample based on representing forest type and variability may be problematic because the spatial pattern of disturbance does not necessarily correlate with forest type. We also find that the prevalence of diffuse, non-stand-clearing disturbance in US forests makes the application of a biennial geographic sample problematic. Future satellite-based studies of disturbance at regional and national scales should focus on wall-to-wall analyses with annual time step for improved accuracy.

K.; Phua, Mui-How			Conservation Gap Analysis of Dipterocarp Hotspots in Sarawak Using GIS, Remote Sensing and Herbarium Data	SAINS MALAYSIANA												Dipterocarpaceae is the dominant tree family in the tropical rain forests of Southeast Asia. Borneo (and Sarawak) is the centre of diversity for the dipterocarps. Identification of hotspots is important for forest and biodiversity conservation efforts. Species Occurrence Models (SOMs) were generated for all 247 species of dipterocarps recorded in Sarawak using herbarium occurrence data and based on the best model selected. The species occurrence density map for each genus and category (endemic and non endemic) was generated by overlaying the SOMs of all species in each genus or category. The species occurrence density maps were analyzed with land cover map from Landsat 7-EMT+ images and protected forest areas for identifying hotspots for conservation in Sarawak. Overlaying the SOM maps revealed that areas in central Sarawak and the southwest region (northwest Borneo around Kuching) are the main hotspots of dipterocarp diversity in Sarawak while the coastal lowland areas in the lower Rejang and Baram River which are mainly peat swamp forest are poorer in species occurrence density. In terms of endemism, as with dipterocarp diversity, the mixed diptercarp forest of central Sarawak is also the most important hotspot. Gap analysis revealed that most protected forest areas are in southwest Sarawak (Bako, Kubah, Tanjung Datu and Gunung Gading National Parks) and in the northern part of Sarawak (Niah, Lambir Hills and Mt Mulu National Parks). This leaves the hotspot in the central part of Sarawak least protected. Protected areas only cover between 2 and 4% of the total areas for the different hotspots (75% species density) while majority of the hotspots that are still forested are outside the protected areas.

Remote sensing techniques can support such investigations, by greatly enhancing the temporal and spatial coverage of habitat assessments. This study makes use of freely available earth observation data to evaluate the suitability of the Ouadi Rime-Ouadi Achim Game Reserve in central Chad for the reintroduction of the Scimitar-horned Oryx. The reserve was the last stronghold of the species within its historical range, prior to extinction in the wild in the 1980s, providing a basis for reintroduction. Results show that since the 1980s, there has been a steady increase in average annual precipitation and satellite-derived estimates of primary production. The spatial downscaling of the average trend in primary production showed that the north of the protected area exhibited a drying trend over the period 1982-2008, while the south was associated with intense greening. As a result, the subdesert transition zone preferred by oryx is currently narrowing. If this is correct, this implies a potential reduction of favourable habitat for the oryx, which could have detrimental effects on the success of establishing a self-sustaining reintroduced population.																	0141-6707					SEP	2013	51	3					482	492		10.1111/aje.12060								WOS:000321759300012

In this study, we present a high-resolution vegetation map of the island based on combining vegetation analysis and classification with remote sensing. Two different image classification approaches were tested to assess the most accurate one in mapping the vegetation mosaic of Socotra. Spectral signatures of the vegetation classes were obtained through a Gaussian mixture distribution model, and a sequential maximum a posteriori (SMAP) classification was applied to account for the heterogeneity and the complex spatial pattern of the arid vegetation. This approach was compared to the traditional maximum likelihood (ML) classification. Satellite data were represented by a RapidEye image with 5 m pixel resolution and five spectral bands. Classified vegetation releves were used to obtain the training and evaluation sets for the main plant communities. Postclassification sorting was performed to adjust the classification through various rule-based operations. Twenty-eight classes were mapped, and SMAP, with an accuracy of 87%, proved to be more effective than ML (accuracy: 66%). The resulting map will represent an important instrument for the elaboration of conservation strategies and the sustainable use of natural resources in the island. (c) The Authors.

NASA Goddard's LiDAR, Hyperspectral and Thermal (G-LiHT) Airborne Imager	REMOTE SENSING												The combination of LiDAR and optical remotely sensed data provides unique information about ecosystem structure and function. Here, we describe the development, validation and application of a new airborne system that integrates commercial off the shelf LiDAR hyperspectral and thermal components in a compact, lightweight and portable system. Goddard's LiDAR, Hyperspectral and Thermal (G-LiHT) airborne imager is a unique system that permits simultaneous measurements of vegetation structure, foliar spectra and surface temperatures at very high spatial resolution (approximate to 1 m) on a wide range of airborne platforms. The complementary nature of LiDAR, optical and thermal data provide an analytical framework for the development of new algorithms to map plant species composition, plant functional types, biodiversity, biomass and carbon stocks, and plant growth. In addition, G-LiHT data enhance our ability to validate data from existing satellite missions and support NASA Earth Science research. G-LiHT's data processing and distribution system is designed to give scientists open access to both low- and high-level data products (http://gliht.gsfc.nasa.gov), which will stimulate the community development of synergistic data fusion algorithms. G-LiHT has been used to collect more than 6,500 km(2) of data for NASA-sponsored studies across a broad range of ecoregions in the USA and Mexico. In this paper, we document G-LiHT design considerations, physical specifications, instrument performance and calibration and acquisition parameters. In addition, we describe the data processing system and higher-level data products that are freely distributed under NASA's Data and Information policy.

The relative contribution of terrain, land cover, and vegetation structure indices to species distribution models	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Habitat assessments for biodiversity conservation are often complicated by the lack of detailed knowledge of a study species' distribution. As an alternative to resource-intensive field-based methods to obtain such information, remotely sensed products can be utilized in species distribution models to infer a species' distribution and ecological needs. Here we demonstrate how to arbitrate among a variety of remotely sensed predictor variables to estimate the distribution and ecological needs of an endangered butterfly species occurring mainly in inaccessible areas. We classified 19 continuous environmental predictor variables into three conceptually independent predictor classes, terrain, land cover, and vertical vegetation structure, and compared the accuracy of competing Maxent habitat models consisting of different combinations of each class. Each class contributed, though disproportionately, to our most reliable model that considered all 19 variables. We confirm that variables obtained from remote sensors can effectively estimate the distribution and ecological needs of a relatively unknown imperiled species occurring in inaccessible locations. Importantly, increasing the variety of predictor classes through multi-sensor fusion resulted in greater model accuracy than increasing the absolute number of predictor variables.

However, there is a lack of practical and accurate measures for estimating the continuous distribution of insect diversity across spatially complex landscapes to enforce such conservation strategy. Based on 216 sampling data, we predicted plant and caterpillar species density across a 200 km(2) spatially complex tropical dry forest landscape, using reflectance values of a SPOT 5 satellite imagery, altitude values from a digital elevation model, and improved model performances by incorporating spatial autocorrelation of residuals with kriging interpolation. Spectral information and altitude accounted for 21-25 % of the variation in woody plant species density whereas the residuals did not demonstrate spatial autocorrelation. In contrast, spatial dependence accounted for most of the 35 % explained variation in caterpillar species density; the spatial range of autocorrelation of caterpillars however, is broader than that of host plants. Although local species density of caterpillars and woody plants showed no relationship, specific areas demonstrated an overlap of species diversity for both taxonomic groups. Spatially explicit models with spectral information as predictors have the potential to estimate woody plant species density across complex landscapes, while the prediction of caterpillar diversity could be done analyzing the spatially autocorrelated structure of species density, implicating labor intensive, but not necessarily costly sampling schemes.

REVIEW: Managing urban ecosystems for goods and services	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Concomitant with the rise in the proportion of the global human population that resides in urban areas has been growth in awareness of the importance of the provision of ecosystem goods and services to those people. Urban areas are themselves of significance in this regard because of their areal extent, and hence the quantity of services falling within their bounds, and because of the need for local provision of services to urban residents. 2. Here, we review key challenges to the effective management of ecosystem goods and services within urban areas. 3. These challenges include the structure of green space, its temporal dynamics, spatial constraint on ecosystem service flows, occurrence of novel forms of flows, large numbers of land managers, conflicting management goals, possible differences between perceptions of urban dwellers and the reality of the distribution and flow of ecosystem services, and the wicked' nature of the problem of ecosystem service management. 4. Synthesis and applications. Urban areas present very particular combinations of challenges and opportunities for the management of ecosystem goods and services. The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of green spaces greatly complicates the maintenance and improvement in service provision as well as dramatically inflating costs. Spatial constraints on ecosystem service flows mean that these can be highly dependent on the maintenance of particular areas of connectivity, but also that provision of additional key points of connectivity may be disproportionately beneficial to those flows. The existence of novel forms of flows of ecosystem services in urban areas offers means of overcoming spatial constraints on more natural flows, but will require the development of new kinds of ecosystem process models to inform their design and management. The large numbers of land managers, conflicts between the best approaches for managing for different goods and services, and frequent differences between the perceptions of urban dwellers and the reality of urban landscapes create a complex management context. The management of ecosystem goods and services is closely allied to the challenges of conventional urban planning. However, applied ecology has a broad range of tools available to assist in determining solutions, including the use of high-resolution remote sensing techniques, landscape ecology principles and theory (e.g. patch and matrix frameworks, meta-population models), and systematic conservation planning approaches.																	0021-8901					AUG	2013	50	4					830	840		10.1111/1365-2664.12087								WOS:000321762900003						
J	Hou, W; Walz, U				Hou, Wei; Walz, Ulrich			Enhanced analysis of landscape structure: Inclusion of transition zones and small-scale landscape elements	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Landscape diversity is an essential component of biodiversity because it determines the diversity of habitats and species. It is necessary to adopt an adaptive and realizable landscape structure monitoring model for ecosystem management. However, the existing methods of landscape structure analysis often do not consider the transitions between different types of patch, which are dynamic and play several functional roles in landscape structure. Another component of information that has often been ignored is "small-scale landscape elements" inside patches, which leads to within-patch heterogeneity being underestimated. This paper presents a method for solving these problems by regular landscape monitoring using RapidEye remote sensing data. We incorporate the third altitude dimension in landscape structure analysis, especially for detecting certain small-scale landscape structures such as groves, tree rows, and transitions at forest boundaries. For these detailed structures a number of landscape metrics are computed under a three-dimensional perspective. The results indicate that a more realistic and more precise representation of landscape structure is obtained on the basis of the detailed spatial scale and the true surface geometries of patches. Taking transitions into account helps smooth "edge effects" between patches and leads to more realistic quantification of fragmentation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ali, R; Pelkey, N				Ali, Rauf; Pelkey, Neil			Satellite images indicate vegetation degradation due to invasive herbivores in the Andaman Islands	CURRENT SCIENCE												Recent studies have documented changes in vegetation cover due to invasive herbivores in the Andaman Islands. In this study we demonstrate that the change is large enough and rapid enough to be detected by remotely sensed data. Using the freely available Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) imagery, we examined changes in vegetation cover due to the presence of invasive herbivores in the Andaman Islands. Two time-periods were analysed using different types of imageries. Changes between 1985 and 1995 and also between 2001 and 2005 across four sites with different combinations of introduced chital (spotted deer) and elephants were examined. Results indicate that areas with deer have faster rates of degradation than those without them. The maximum rate of degradation occurred at sites with both elephants and deer, and the minimum where neither of the two animal species occurred. Besides wild pig, all the other herbivores on the islands are invasive, and there is a need to eliminate these invasive herbivores in the islands.																	0011-3891					JUL 25	2013	105	2					209	214										WOS:000322751600022

Spatial Access Priority Mapping (SAPM) with Fishers: A Quantitative GIS Method for Participatory Planning	PLOS ONE												Spatial management tools, such as marine spatial planning and marine protected areas, are playing an increasingly important role in attempts to improve marine management and accommodate conflicting needs. Robust data are needed to inform decisions among different planning options, and early inclusion of stakeholder involvement is widely regarded as vital for success. One of the biggest stakeholder groups, and the most likely to be adversely impacted by spatial restrictions, is the fishing community. In order to take their priorities into account, planners need to understand spatial variation in their perceived value of the sea. Here a readily accessible, novel method for quantitatively mapping fishers' spatial access priorities is presented. Spatial access priority mapping, or SAPM, uses only basic functions of standard spreadsheet and GIS software. Unlike the use of remote-sensing data, SAPM actively engages fishers in participatory mapping, documenting rather than inferring their priorities. By so doing, SAPM also facilitates the gathering of other useful data, such as local ecological knowledge. The method was tested and validated in Northern Ireland, where over 100 fishers participated in a semi-structured questionnaire and mapping exercise. The response rate was excellent, 97%, demonstrating fishers' willingness to be involved. The resultant maps are easily accessible and instantly informative, providing a very clear visual indication of which areas are most important for the fishers. The maps also provide quantitative data, which can be used to analyse the relative impact of different management options on the fishing industry and can be incorporated into planning software, such as MARXAN, to ensure that conservation goals can be met at minimum negative impact to the industry. This research shows how spatial access priority mapping can facilitate the early engagement of fishers and the ready incorporation of their priorities into the decision-making process in a transparent, quantitative way.

In this context, the objective of this study was to evaluate the potential use of satellite images and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to quantify and characterize the spatial evolution of native forests in a semi-arid landscape area at the Region of Maule, Chile. The study was conducted with Landsat-5 TM images of 2004 and 2008, which were classified by the supervised method where it was previously necessary to apply the atmospheric and the geometric corrections to reduce errors of interpretation and measurement. Within the analysis, it was incorporated digital thematic information of land use of the National Forestry Corporation (CONAF) and also it was joined one of the latest techniques derived from remote sensing for studying changes in land cover, that is called Radiometric Rotation Controlled by No-Change Axis (RCNA). Finally, the fragmentation indexes were estimated for characterizing the spatial configuration of landscape. From the results of the digital classification it was possible to estimate landscape metrics that show significant differences in the structure of the study area between the two periods. In addition, it was generated an image of change 2004/2008 that allowed to evaluate the consistency of the RCEN technique, demonstrating the feasibility of using this alternative methodology for the detection of changes in terms of degradation and recovery of woodlands.																	0103-9954	1980-5098				JUL-SEP	2013	23	3					449	460										WOS:000329989400018						
J	Collin, A; Archambault, P; Planes, S				Collin, Antoine; Archambault, Philippe; Planes, Serge			Bridging Ridge-to-Reef Patches: Seamless Classification of the Coast Using Very High Resolution Satellite	REMOTE SENSING												The structure and functioning of coral reef coastal zones are currently coping with an increasing variety of threats, thereby altering the coastal spatial patterns at an accelerated pace. Understanding and predicting the evolution of these highly valuable coastal ecosystems require reliable and frequent mapping and monitoring of both inhabited terrestrial and marine areas at the individual tree and coral colony spatial scale. The very high spatial resolution (VHR) mapping that was recently spearheaded by WorldView-2 (WV2) sensor with 2 m and 0.5 m multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (Pan) bands has the potential to address this burning issue. The objective of this study was to classify nine terrestrial and twelve marine patch classes with respect to spatial resolution enhancement and coast integrity using eight bands of the WV2 sensor on a coastal zone of Moorea Island, French Polynesia. The contribution of the novel WV2 spectral bands towards classification accuracy at 2 m and 0.5 m were tested using traditional and innovative Pan-sharpening techniques. The land and water classes were examined both separately and combinedly. All spectral combinations that were built only with the novel WV2 bands systematically increased the overall classification accuracy of the standard four band classification. The overall best contribution was attributed to the coastal-red edge-near infrared (NIR) 2 combination (Kappa(gain) = 0.0287), which significantly increased the fleshy and encrusting algae (User's Accuracy(gain) = 18.18%) class. However, the addition of the yellow-NIR2 combination dramatically impacted the hard coral/algae patches class (Producer's Accuracy(loss) = -20.88%). Enhancement of the spatial resolution reduced the standard classification accuracy, depending on the Pan-sharpening technique. The proposed composite method (local maximum) provided better overall results than the commonly used sensor method (systematic). However, the sensor technique produced the highest contribution to the hard coral thicket (PA(gain) = 30.36%) class with the coastal-red edge-NIR2 combination. Partitioning the coast into its terrestrial and aquatic components lowered the overall standard classification accuracy, while strongly enhancing the hard coral bommie class with the coastal-NIR2 combination (UA(gain) = 40%) and the green-coastal Normalized Difference Ratio (UA(gain) = 11.06%). VHR spaceborne remote sensing has the potential to gain substantial innovative insights into the evolution of tropical coastal ecosystems from local to regional scales, to predict the influence of anthropogenic and climate changes and to help design optimized management and conservation frameworks.

Geospatial Assessment of Invasive Plants on Reclaimed Mines in Alabama	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Throughout the world, the invasion of nonnative plants is an increasing threat to native biodiversity and ecosystem sustainability. Invasion is especially prevalent in areas affected by land transformation and disturbance. Surface mines are a major land transformation, and thus may promote the establishment and persistence of invasive plant communities. Using the Shale Hills region of Alabama as a case study, we assessed the use of landscape characteristics in predicting the probability of occurrence of six invasive plant species: sericea lespedeza, Japanese honeysuckle, Chinese privet, autumn-olive, royal paulownia, and sawtooth oak. Models were generated for invasive species occurrence using logistic regression and maximum entropy methods. The predicted probabilities of species occurrence were applied to the mined landscape to assess the probable prevalence of each species across the landscape. Japanese honeysuckle had the highest probable prevalence on the landscape (48% of the area), with royal paulownia having the lowest (less than 1%). Overall, 67% of the landscape was predicted to have at least one invasive plant species, with 20% of the landscape predicted to have two or more species, and 3% of the landscape predicted to have three or more species. Japanese honeysuckle, sericea lespedeza, privet, and autumn-olive showed higher occurrence on the reclaimed sites than across the broader region. We found that geospatial modeling of these invasive plants at this scale offered potential for management, both for identifying habitat types at risk and areas that need management attention. However, the most immediate action for reducing the prevalence of invasive plants on reclaimed mines is to remove invasive plants from the reclamation planting list. Three (sericea lespedeza, autumn-olive, and sawtooth oak) out of the six most common invasive plants in this study were planted as part of reclamation activities.																	1939-7291					JUL-SEP	2013	6	3					401	410		10.1614/IPSM-D-12-00045.1								WOS:000324346900009

Specifically, at the landscape scale, spatial models for the occurrences of species of conservation concern may be improved by the inclusion of RS-based predictors, to help managers to better meet different conservation challenges. In this study, we examine whether predicted distributions of 28 red-listed plant species in north-eastern Finland at the resolution of 25 ha are improved when advanced RS-variables are included as unclassified continuous predictor variables, in addition to more commonly used climate and topography variables. Using generalized additive models (GAMs), we studied whether the spatial predictions of the distribution of red-listed plant species in boreal landscapes are improved by incorporating advanced RS (normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference soil index and Tasseled Cap transformations) information into species-environment models. Models were fitted using three different sets of explanatory variables: (1) climate-topography only; (2) remote sensing only; and (3) combined climate-topography and remote sensing variables, and evaluated by four-fold cross-validation with the area under the curve (AUC) statistics. The inclusion of RS variables improved both the explanatory power (on average 8.1 % improvement) and cross-validation performance (2.5 %) of the models. Hybrid models produced ecologically more reliable distribution maps than models using only climate-topography variables, especially for mire and shore species. In conclusion, Landsat ETM+ data integrated with climate and topographical information has the potential to improve biodiversity and rarity assessments in northern landscapes, especially in predictive studies covering extensive and remote areas.

Species distribution modelling for the people: unclassified landsat TM imagery predicts bird occurrence at fine resolutions	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim Assessing the influence of land cover in species distribution modelling is limited by the availability of fine-resolution land-cover data appropriate for most species responses. Remote-sensing technology offers great potential for predicting species distributions at large scales, but the cost and required expertise are prohibitive for many applications. We test the usefulness of freely available raw remote-sensing reflectance data in predicting species distributions of 40 commonly occurring bird species in western Oregon. Location Central Coast Range, Cascade and Klamath Mountains Oregon, USA. Methods Information on bird observations was collected from 4598 fixed-radius point counts. Reflectance data were obtained using 30-m resolution Landsat imagery summarized at scales of 150, 500, 1000 and 2000m. We used boosted regression tree (BRT) models to analyse relationships between distributions of birds and reflectance values and evaluated prediction performance of the models using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values. Results Prediction success of models using all reflectance values was high (mean AUC=0.79 +/- 0.10 SD). Further, model performance using individual reflectance bands exceeded those that used only Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The relative influence of band 4 predictors was highest, indicating the importance of variables associated with vegetation biomass and photosynthetic activity. Across spatial scales, the average influence of predictors at the 2000m scale was greatest. Main Conclusions We demonstrate that unclassified remote-sensing imagery can be used to produce species distribution models with high prediction success. Our study is the first to identify general patterns in the usefulness of spectral reflectances for species distribution modelling of multiple species. We conclude that raw Landsat Thematic Mapper data will be particularly useful in species distribution models when high-resolution predictions are required, including habitat change detection studies, identification of fine-scale biodiversity hotspots and reserve design.																	1366-9516					JUL	2013	19	7					855	866		10.1111/ddi.12093								WOS:000320327500019

Effect of canopy cover and canopy background variables on spectral profiles of savanna rangeland bush encroachment species based on selected Acacia species (mellifera, tortilis, karroo) and Dichrostachys cinerea at Mokopane, South Africa	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The proliferation of woody plant species' on savanna rangelands (i.e. bush encroachment) degrades rangeland quality, thereby threatening the biodiversity conservation effort as well as pastoral farming. Hyperspectral remote sensing offers possibilities for discriminating encroaching bush species in support of management of semi-arid savanna rangelands. As a preliminary step towards establishing a spectral library of common encroaching species on savanna rangelands, the effect of canopy leaf cover, background dry soil and grass on the spectral profiles of the common encroaching species Acacia karroo, Acacia mellifera, Acacia tortilis and Dichrostachys cinerea was analysed. A sample of healthy mature plants in prime, full leaf condition was utilised at an encroached rangeland in Mokopane, South Africa. The spectral signatures were collected in-situ, using a field spectrometer pointed above the sample specimen canopies. The canopy and canopy background variables tended to modify the reflectance of the encroaching bush species in the near infrared (800-1300 nm) in which they were spectrally most separable. Canopy background dry grass tended to increase near infrared reflectance, while dry soil tended to reduce the spectral contrast among the species. These effects were reduced by high leaf content. In a thicket canopy structure, the overall reflectance tended towards the spectral profile of the more dominant species. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Rapid changes in institutional and socio-economic conditions, such as the collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991, often trigger widespread LULCC Yet, it is unclear how effective protected areas are in safeguarding habitat within them during such periods of rapid LULCC. Our goal here was to map changes in forest cover and agricultural lands from 1984 to 2010 in order to assess the effectiveness of two strictly protected areas, Olcsky and Mordovsky State Nature Reserves, in temperate European Russia. We analyzed dense time series of Landsat images for three Landsat footprints and applied a support vector machine classification and trajectory-based change detection to map forest disturbance. We then used matching statistics to quantify the effectiveness of the protected areas. Our analyses highlighted considerable post-Soviet LULCC in European Russia. The LULCC maps revealed disturbances on 5.02% of the total forest area, with strongly declining disturbance rates in post-Soviet times. We also found that 39.89% of the agricultural land used in 1988 was abandoned after 1991, leading to widespread forest regrowth. Oksky and Mordovsky State Nature Reserves had a significantly lower probability of forest disturbance (-0.1 to -3.5% lower) in comparison to their surrounding areas. This suggests that protected areas were relatively effective in limiting human-induced forest disturbance in European Russia, despite lower levels of control and an eroding infrastructure for nature protection. Moreover, we found drastic land-cover changes, particularly forest regrowth, in the surroundings of these protected areas, highlighting conservation opportunities. Protected areas can play a key role in biodiversity conservation during periods of rapid LULCC, and remote sensing coupled with matching statistics provide important tools for monitoring the success and failure of conservation efforts.

The grasslands on the plain have been seriously degraded over the past five decades and this process is continuing. The reliable estimation of grassland aboveground biomass (AGB) provides scientific data for determining the livestock stocking rate on rangeland. AGB is also of considerable significance for biodiversity and environmental protection in this region. Remote sensing is the most effective way to estimate grassland AGB on a regional scale. Multitemporal, remotely sensed data were used for grassland AGB estimation with statistical models and an artificial neural network (ANN), and the accuracy of estimation for these methods was compared. The results demonstrate that the use of multi-temporal remotely sensed data has advantages for grassland AGB estimation, whether with statistical models or ANN methods, compared with single-temporal remotely sensed data, although the ANN had a higher accuracy of estimation for grassland AGB. Finally, the grassland AGB on the Songnen Plain was estimated with the ANN using multitemporal MODIS data. The spatial distribution pattern of grassland AGB showed large variations, and grassland productivity was generally low. The maximum green weight of the grassland AGB was 927.22 g/m(2) and was mainly distributed on the northeast of the West Songnen Plain. The minimum green weight of the grassland AGB was 194.82 g/m(2) and was mainly distributed on the central and southwestern West Songnen Plain. Most of the areas had medium- and low-yielding grasses. The significant increases of population and livestock number were the primary and direct reasons for the decrease in grassland quality. This study will contribute to policy making for the control of grazing and for biodiversity and environmental protection.

The evolution of the discipline in the first decade of the 21st century	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												It has been argued that historical biogeography, the study of how processes that occur over long periods of time influence the distribution of life forms, is in the midst of a scientific revolution. The aim of this paper is to analyze the evolution of historical biogeography during the first decade of the 21st century and to identify major trends for the near future. We constructed a database containing all articles which dealt with historical biogeography published in the Journal of Biogeography during 1998-2010. The database included 610 contributions. Our results indicated that historical biogeography is going through a growth period. The papers analyzed were written by 2018 authors, with a mean of 3.3 authors per paper. Authors from 62 countries were involved, and most of them worked in Europe or North America. The Palearctic was the most analyzed region. Most contributions dealt with terrestrial habitats and were devoted to animal (especially Chordata) and plant taxa. Phylogeography was the most used approach (35%), followed by biota similarity and PAE (13%) and molecular biogeography (12%), with cladistic biogeography and event-based methods at 6% each. Some of the future challenges that historical biogeography faces are summarized: (1) to increase the study of taxa which are underrepresented according to the segment of biodiversity they represent; (2) to balance the amount of work devoted to different biogeographical regions; (3) to increase biogeographical knowledge of aquatic habitats; (4) to maintain the diversity of approaches, preventing the reduction of time, spatial, and taxonomic scales addressed by the discipline; and (5) to continue integrating historical biogeography along with other sources of information from other disciplines (e. g. ecology, paleontology, geology, isotope chemistry, remote sensing) into a richer context for explaining past, present, and future patterns of biodiversity on Earth.

Incorporating uncertainty associated with habitat data in marine reserve design	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												One of the most pervasive forms of uncertainty in data used to make conservation decisions is error associated with mapping of conservation features. Whilst conservation planners should consider uncertainty associated with ecological data to make informed decisions, mapping error is rarely, if ever, accommodated in the planning process. Here, we develop a spatial conservation prioritization approach that accounts for the uncertainty inherent in coral reef habitat maps and apply it in the Kubulau District fisheries management area, Fiji. We use accuracy information describing the probability of occurrence of each habitat type, derived from remote sensing data validated by field surveys, to design a marine reserve network that has a high probability of protecting a fixed percentage (10-90%) of every habitat type. We compare the outcomes of our approach to those of standard reserve design approaches, where habitat-mapping errors are not known or ignored. We show that the locations of priority areas change between the standard and probabilistic approaches, with errors of omission and commission likely to occur if reserve design does not accommodate mapping accuracy. Although consideration of habitat mapping accuracy leads to bigger reserve networks, they are unlikely to miss habitat conservation targets. We explore the trade-off between conservation feature representation and reserve network area, with smaller reserve networks possible if we give up on trying to meet targets for habitats mapped with a low accuracy. The approach can be used with any habitat type at any scale to inform more robust and defensible conservation decisions in marine or terrestrial environments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Schmitt-Harsh, M				Schmitt-Harsh, Mikaela			Landscape change in Guatemala: Driving forces of forest and coffee agroforest expansion and contraction from 1990 to 2010	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												This study examines the land-use/cover change (LUCC) dynamics and drivers for two prominent land-use/cover systems in Guatemala: natural forests (FOR) and coffee agroforests (CAF). To-date, very little research has examined the LUCC dynamics of CAF, in large part due to the high degree of spectral similarity that exists between agroforests and other forest-cover types. Given the ecosystem and livelihood services provided by shade-grown coffee production, it is increasingly necessary to map and identify the dynamics and drivers of CAF changes over space and time. This research uses remote sensing analysis, land transition matrices, and multinomial regression models to examine LUCC dynamics over two ten-year intervals (1990-2000; 2000-2010) in Guatemala. Spatially explicit biophysical (e.g. slope, elevation) and accessibility (e.g. distance to roads) factors are used to model and compare drivers of change for CAF and FOR. Results demonstrate LUCC dynamics and drivers for the two land-use/cover systems to be complex over space and time. For example, FOR losses are evident for both time intervals, largely associated with conversion to CAF and croplands (CPL) in low slope, low altitude areas, and in areas close to existing croplands, respectively. CAF losses are also evident in the 1990s, but are outpaced by expansion in the 2000s. Losses are associated with conversion to CPL, particularly near roads and existing croplands, while expansion and/or persistence of CAF occurs near cities. These results suggest that conservation programs aimed at tree cover preservation and expansion should consider natural forests and managed agroforests separately. Further, such programs should be tailored to specific locations and institutional settings given the influence of topography and accessibility factors in determining localized patterns of landscape transformations over space and time.

J	Altamirano, A; Aplin, P; Miranda, A; Cayuela, L; Algar, AC; Field, R				Altamirano, Adison; Aplin, Paul; Miranda, Alejandro; Cayuela, Luis; Algar, Adam C.; Field, Richard			High rates of forest loss and turnover obscured by classical landscape measures	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Loss of native forest is a key conservation concern globally, for reasons of biodiversity, climate change and ecosystem services. Landscape measures are used widely to characterize forest loss and associated landscape structure, but often without regard for structure imposed by the data used, and associated assumptions. Notably, forest loss is often expressed simply as net change in forest cover over time, but this approach does not account for turnover (i.e. the gross losses and gains of forest). It also ignores forest age (e.g. young regrowth forest or mature forest), which is significant in conservation terms. We investigate the effects of removing common data constraints on landscape characterization, as typically used in landscape dynamic analyses. We produced fine-resolution (0.0225 ha) classified maps from satellite imagery of the temperate Araucania Region of Chile, for 1986, 1999 and 2008. We calculated areas of land-use classes and associated landscape indices. Landscape measures and trends through time varied markedly around the region, with forest loss and fragmentation confined to areas not designated as protected. Net ('headline') figures masked very large turnover through time, with about 30% of unprotected land switching land use each decade. Accounting for this, in unprotected areas the loss of established native forest was 2.4% and 3.5% per year in the two time periods, much higher than equivalent 'standard' figures. Using finer-resolution data increased estimates of native forest loss and reversed temporal trends in patch density and mean patch size, compared with the commonly-used National Vegetation Classification (6.25 and 4.5 ha resolution). Interestingly, mean patch size of native forest actually switched, from a decreasing trend to an increasing one, with continued deforestation. We conclude that landscape characterization can lead to effective conservation practices, but it is necessary to use appropriate data resolution, define the data domain carefully and examine change through time, including the degree of dynamism (turnover) within the landscape: our results suggest a strong need to consider continuity of forest cover as well as overall totals.

J	Rajao, R				Rajao, Raoni			Representations and discourses: the role of local accounts and remote sensing in the formulation of Amazonia's environmental policy	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY												This paper discusses the dynamics behind the establishment of scientific representations (e.g. reports, measurements, experiments) to the detriment of local representations (e.g. oral accounts, metaphors, symbols) in environmental policy-making in the Global South. To this end, the paper attempts to understand why local accounts of the Amazon in recent decades have gradually been replaced by satellite-based remote sensing (RS) technology in the region's policy-making. RS technology is shown to provide representations that match policy-makers discourses as regards the importance of: visibility, since satellite images are believed to provide a transparent window from which the Amazon can be seen by policy-makers working from centres of power; comprehensiveness, since the data obtained through RS claims to represent the entire region; and determinacy, as forecasting and spatial correlation techniques establish deterministic links between particular factors (e.g. the presence of farmers, inflation) and environmental issues (e.g. increases in deforestation). From this examination, it is argued that rather than focusing on identifying the essential differences between local and scientific representation, more attention should be paid to how different kinds of representations are in harmony or conflict with historically rooted governance discourses. The article also indicates that in order to revalue local representations in environmental policy-making it is necessary to challenge particular discourses which are "taken-for-granted" in governance practices at the present time.

Documentation and analysis of land use change in this region is challenging due to very disparate accounts of the state of forest resources and limited accessible data. Such analysis is, however, important due to concerns over the degradation of forest land leading to deterioration of the protection of water catchments and exposure of highly erodible soils. Furthermore, the area is identified as hotspot for biodiversity loss. The aim of this paper is to identify geophysical and geographical factors related to land use change and model how these relationships vary across the district. For three selected zones across the elevation gradient of the district, we analyse land use change by studying land use maps for the years 1968, 1990 and 2007. In the high-altitude zone, the forest area decreased by 30.5 %, a third of which was caused by agricultural expansion. In the mid-elevation zone, agriculture expanded by 70.3 % and forests decreased by 49.7 %. In the lower altitudes, agriculture expansion was 129.9 % consuming 31.7 % of the forest area over the forty-year time period. Annual deforestation rates observed were 0.80, 1.28 and 1.86 % in high, mid and low altitudes, respectively. In the high-altitude ecosystems, accessibility (distance to nearest road and city) had no significant role in agriculture expansion; rather land use change appears significantly related to geophysical factors such as slope, aspect and altitude. In the low-elevation zone, accessibility was the factor showing the closest association with agriculture expansion and abandonment. The analysis illustrates that land use change processes vary quite considerably between different altitudinal and vegetation cover zones of the same district and that environmental constraints and stage of economic development provide important contextual information.

Spectral discrimination of giant reed (Arundo donax L.): A seasonal study in riparian areas	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												The giant reed (Arundo donax L) is amongst the one hundred worst invasive alien species of the world, and it is responsible for biodiversity loss and failure of ecosystem functions in riparian habitats. In this work, field spectroradiometry was used to assess the spectral separability of the giant reed from the adjacent vegetation and from the common reed, a native similar species. The study was conducted at different phenological periods and also for the giant reed stands regenerated after mechanical cutting (giant reed_RAC). A hierarchical procedure using Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Classification and Regression Trees (CART) was used to select the minimum number of optimal bands that discriminate the giant reed from the adjacent vegetation. A new approach was used to identify sets of wavelengths - wavezones - that maximize the spectral separability beyond the minimum number of optimal bands. Jeffries Matusita and Bhattacharya distance were used to evaluate the spectral separability using the minimum optimal bands and in three simulated satellite images, namely Landsat, IKONOS and SPOT. Giant reed was spectrally separable from the adjacent vegetation, both at the vegetative and the senescent period, exception made to the common reed at the vegetative period. The red edge region was repeatedly selected, although the visible region was also important to separate the giant reed from the herbaceous vegetation and the mid infrared region to the discrimination from the woody vegetation. The highest separability was obtained for the giant reed_RAC stands, due to its highly homogeneous, dense and dark-green stands. Results are discussed by relating the phenological, morphological and structural features of the giant reed stands and the adjacent vegetation with their optical traits. Weaknesses and strengths of the giant reed spectral discrimination are highlighted and implications of imagery selection for mapping purposes are argued based on present results.

Bridging natural and social sciences perspectives, and incorporating both quantitative and qualitative analysis, we contribute to a rich, multidisciplinary literature on US forest change by documenting at a fine scale changing land-cover patterns, identifying their key geophysical and social driving forces, and evaluating the strength and character of the on-going forest transition. The interpretation of five sets of aerial photographs spanning the period 19362008 for a town in central New York State shows that 25.8 per cent of the land area reforested. Two approaches explain the trend: (1) spatial analysis of landscape features (e.g. soil type, distance to road) and (2) a land-use history analysis based on secondary and grey literature as well as interviews with longtime landowners. Findings underscore the importance of cross-scalar analysis, with key explanatory variables ranging from local topography to national development patterns. Twentieth-century forest recovery is linked primarily to well-established inter-decadal processes: a decline in the farming sector, changing life and livelihood goals within farming families and associated land abandonment on areas marginal for agriculture. In contrast to historical trends, recent forest recovery is occurring on high-quality soils; in 2008 approximately 15 per cent of all forest occurred on such soils, which may hold implications for biodiversity. In addition, landowners are increasingly engaged in a mix of new land uses, including energy development, and there is a steady rise in the number of amenity-oriented rural residents. The Eaton study contributes detailed mapping of forest-cover change in an understudied part of the northeastern USA. It also informs debates about forest transition theory and the prospects for a regressive tertiary stage' for the study region.

Diversity of insect assemblages is often higher in primary forests than in surrounding secondary forests. However, little is known about how the primary forests affect diversity in surrounding secondary forests in a landscape. In Sarawak, Malaysia, the typical landscape in areas from which lowland tropical rainforests had originally spread consists mainly of primary and secondary forests, with small areas of cultivation. In this study, we examined how the proportion of remnant primary forests in a landscape affects species diversity and species composition of ants and dung beetles in Macaranga-dominated secondary forests. The proportions were quantified based on remote-sensing data at various spatial scales, ranging from 100- to 5,000-m radius from each of the target forests. We found that the proportions of remnant primary forests within a 100-m radius had a significant positive effect on ant species diversity, and those within 100-, 300-, and 500-m radii significantly affected species compositions. However, the proportions of remnant primary forests had no significant relationship with dung beetle diversity, while those within 100- and 1,000-m radii had significant effects on species composition. The different responses to the remnant primary forests are likely to be related to differences in the movement and dispersal traits between the two taxa.																	1366-638X					JUN	2013	17	3					591	605		10.1007/s10841-012-9544-6								WOS:000319070700016

Identifying suitable habitats is critical to wetland management and restoration. In this study, by developing an object-oriented segmentation approach in conjunction with geographic information system (GIS) spatial analysis and remote sensing image data, we analyzed and assessed the suitability of habitat for waterbirds in the West Songnen Plain, China. Nesting locations were used to validate the precision. The results show that the area of good, fair, poor, and not suitable habitat for waterbirds is 216 x 10(3) ha, 329 x 10(3) ha, 109 x 10(3) ha, and 283 x 10(3) ha, respectively. Approximately 23.48% of the total area of the West Songnen Plain is good suitable habitat. The results also indicate the great potential of this approach for objectively and effectively evaluating habitat suitability for waterbirds. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Poor management practices, often triggered by socioeconomic and institutional change, are the main causes of loss. Recent trends in old-growth forest cover in Romania, where some of the last remaining tracts of these forests within Europe are located, are revealed by satellite image analysis. Forest cover declined by 1.3% from 2000 to 2010. Romania's protected area network has been expanded substantially since the country's accession to the European Union in 2007, and most of the remaining old-growth forests now are located within protected areas. Surprisingly though, 72% of the old-growth forest disturbances are found within protected areas, highlighting the threats still facing these forests. It appears that logging in old-growth forests is, at least in part, related to institutional reforms, insufficient protection and ownership changes since the collapse of communism in 1989. The majority of harvesting activities in old-growth forest areas are in accordance with the law. Without improvements to their governance, the future of Romania's old-growth forests and the important ecosystem services they provide remains uncertain.

Effect of image spatial and spectral characteristics on mapping semi-arid rangeland vegetation using multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA)	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Encroachment of invasive shrubs into grassland areas on rangelands in the southwestern United States threatens the viability of livestock production and can severely alter hydrology and biodiversity. Novel remote sensing technologies may provide useful information for monitoring and remediating this threat. The objectives were to investigate multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) as an approach to map rangeland vegetation using hyperspectral remote sensing imagery and to test the sensitivity of MESMA to alternative image spatial resolutions and spectral waveband combinations. Data from two Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) overflights at the Jornada Experimental Range in southwestern New Mexico were used in the analysis. Endmember spectra were selected from a library of ground-based spectral observations collected with a field spectroradiometer. A 4-endmember MESMA was conducted for both AVIRIS images at their native spatial resolutions using 113 10-nm wavebands from 422 to 2339 nm. Additional MESMAs were conducted at 10 multiples of the images' native spatial resolution and for 6 alternative combinations of spectral waveband subregions. Maps of endmember fractional cover for green shrub vegetation, nonphotosynthetic grass vegetation, and bare soil were comparable to an earlier vegetation classification map of Jornada. MESMA fractional cover estimates for the green vegetation endmember were positively correlated with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with correlation coefficients (r) greater than 0.58. Correlation coefficients between the sum of the green and nonphotosynthetic vegetation endmembers and the cellulose absorption index (CAI) were greater than 0.59. Correlation coefficients between MESMA fractional green vegetation cover and NDVI from independent multispectral images were greater than 0.57. Despite losses in spatial detail at coarser image spatial resolutions, MESMA results for images with spatial resolution degraded by a factor of 10 (similar to 150 m) were similar to aggregated results for MESMA at the native spatial resolution (similar to 15 m). Additionally, MESMA results were shown to be substantially more sensitive to the spectral wavebands used in the analysis as compared to the spatial resolution of the images. Considered together, the MESMA results at Jornada indicated that fine spectral resolution with hyperspectral remote sensing was substantially more important than incremental changes in image spatial scale from 15 m to 150 m.

Image Texture Predicts Avian Density and Species Richness	PLOS ONE												For decades, ecologists have measured habitat attributes in the field to understand and predict patterns of animal distribution and abundance. However, the scale of inference possible from field measured data is typically limited because large-scale data collection is rarely feasible. This is problematic given that conservation and management typical require data that are fine grained yet broad in extent. Recent advances in remote sensing methodology offer alternative tools for efficiently characterizing wildlife habitat across broad areas. We explored the use of remotely sensed image texture, which is a surrogate for vegetation structure, calculated from both an air photo and from a Landsat TM satellite image, compared with field-measured vegetation structure, characterized by foliage-height diversity and horizontal vegetation structure, to predict avian density and species richness within grassland, savanna, and woodland habitats at Fort McCoy Military Installation, Wisconsin, USA. Image texture calculated from the air photo best predicted density of a grassland associated species, grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), within grassland habitat (R-2 = 0.52, p-value <0.001), and avian species richness among habitats (R-2 = 0.54, p-value <0.001). Density of field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), a savanna associated species, was not particularly well captured by either field-measured or remotely sensed vegetation structure variables, but was best predicted by air photo image texture (R-2 = 0.13, p-value = 0.002). Density of ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), a woodland associated species, was best predicted by pixel-level satellite data (mean NDVI, R-2 = 0.54, p-value <0.001). Surprisingly and interestingly, remotely sensed vegetation structure measures (i.e., image texture) were often better predictors of avian density and species richness than field-measured vegetation structure, and thus show promise as a valuable tool for mapping habitat quality and characterizing biodiversity across broad areas.

PLOS ONE												In contrast to generally sparse biological communities in open-ocean settings, seamounts and ridges are perceived as areas of elevated productivity and biodiversity capable of supporting commercial fisheries. We investigated the origin of this apparent biological enhancement over a segment of the North Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) using sonar, corers, trawls, traps, and a remotely operated vehicle to survey habitat, biomass, and biodiversity. Satellite remote sensing provided information on flow patterns, thermal fronts, and primary production, while sediment traps measured export flux during 2007-2010. The MAR, 3,704,404 km 2 in area, accounts for 44.7% lower bathyal habitat (800-3500 m depth) in the North Atlantic and is dominated by fine soft sediment substrate (95% of area) on a series of flat terraces with intervening slopes either side of the ridge axis contributing to habitat heterogeneity. The MAR fauna comprises mainly species known from continental margins with no evidence of greater biodiversity. Primary production and export flux over the MAR were not enhanced compared with a nearby reference station over the Porcupine Abyssal Plain. Biomasses of benthic macrofauna and megafauna were similar to global averages at the same depths totalling an estimated 258.9 kt C over the entire lower bathyal north MAR. A hypothetical flat plain at 3500 m depth in place of the MAR would contain 85.6 kt C, implying an increase of 173.3 kt C attributable to the presence of the Ridge. This is approximately equal to 167 kt C of estimated pelagic biomass displaced by the volume of the MAR. There is no enhancement of biological productivity over the MAR; oceanic bathypelagic species are replaced by benthic fauna otherwise unable to survive in the mid ocean. We propose that globally sea floor elevation has no effect on deep sea biomass; pelagic plus benthic biomass is constant within a given surface productivity regime.

Estimating Vegetation Beta Diversity from Airborne Imaging Spectroscopy and Unsupervised Clustering	REMOTE SENSING												Airborne remote sensing has an important role to play in mapping and monitoring biodiversity over large spatial scales. Techniques for applying this technology to biodiversity mapping have focused on remote species identification of individual crowns; however, this requires collection of a large number of crowns to train a classifier, which may limit the usefulness of this approach in many study regions. Based on the premise that the spectral variation among sites is related to their ecological dissimilarity, we asked whether it is possible to estimate the beta diversity, or turnover in species composition, among sites without the use of training data. We evaluated alternative methods using simulated communities constructed from the spectra of field-identified tree and shrub crowns from an African savanna. A method based on the k-means clustering of crown spectra produced beta diversity estimates (measured as Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) among sites with an average pairwise correlation of similar to 0.5 with the true beta diversity, compared to an average correlation of similar to 0.8 obtained by a supervised species classification approach. When applied to savanna landscapes, the unsupervised clustering method produced beta diversity estimates similar to those obtained from supervised classification. The unsupervised method proposed here can be used to estimate the spatial structure of species turnover in a landscape when training data (e.g., tree crowns) are unavailable, providing top-down information for science, conservation and ecosystem management applications.

Studies on forest health and vegetation changes in Greece under the effects of climate changes	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Greece, as part of the Mediterranean Basin, is projected to be among the most vulnerable countries to climate change. It is therefore quite urgent to adapt forest management to the changing climate in order to enhance biodiversity and to enable the conservation of healthy and productive forests. In the framework of the project LIFE+ AdaptFor (www.life-adaptfor.gr), an effort was made to understand the ecological responses and the vulnerability of forest ecosystems in the face of climate change; the overall aim of the project is the development and implementation of appropriate adaptation strategies. Four study areas were selected where changes in vegetation, quite likely attributed to climate change, have already been observed (dieback of Scots pine and Greek fir, intrusion of conifers in broadleaved forests). To investigate the synergism of climatic parameters' alterations in the development of the occurring phenomena, time series of temperature and precipitation for the period 1950-2009 were produced and parameters of forest status were investigated, including mapping of vegetation changes through remote sensing. The findings support the hypothesis that climate change has an impact on forest health; the dieback of tree species can be attributed to outbreaks of pathogens (fungi and insects) which are associated with climatic parameters. However, the intrusion of conifer species into broadleaved forests showed no direct connection to climatic parameters, something that needs to be further investigated. In all cases, insufficient or inappropriate management practices applied in the areas exacerbated the occurring phenomena.																	0960-3115					MAY	2013	22	5			SI		1133	1150		10.1007/s10531-013-0451-2								WOS:000319140500003

The Swan Coastal Plain (SCP) with over 1500 wetlands is a global biodiversity hotspot located in the southwest of Western Australia, where more than 70% of the wetlands have been lost since European settlement. SCP is located in an area affected by recent climate change that also experiences rapid urban development and ground water abstraction. Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery from 1999 to 2011 has been used to automatically derive a spatially and temporally explicit time-series of surface water body extent on the SCP. A mapping method based on the Landsat data and a decision tree classification algorithm is described. Two generic classifiers were derived for the Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 data. Several landscape metrics were computed to summarize the intra and interannual patterns of surface water dynamic. Top of the atmosphere (TOA) reflectance of band 5 followed by TOA reflectance of bands 4 and 3 were the explanatory variables most important for mapping surface water bodies. Accuracy assessment yielded an overall classification accuracy of 96%, with 89% producer's accuracy and 93% user's accuracy of surface water bodies. The number, mean size, and total area of water bodies showed high seasonal variability with highest numbers in winter and lowest numbers in summer. The number of water bodies in winter increased until 2005 after which a decline can be noted. The lowest numbers occurred in 2010 which coincided with one of the years with the lowest rainfall in the area. Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamic of surface water bodies on the SCP constitutes the basis for understanding the effect of rainfall, water abstraction and urban development on water bodies in a spatially explicit way.

This region is characterized by shallow continental shelf subjected to semi-diurnal tides. Industrial activities in this area since the early 1970s may have contributed to the degradation of the biodiversity of the ecosystem with eutrophication problems and disappearance of benthic and planktonic species. To assess the long-term effect of anthropogenic and natural discharges on the Gulf of Gabes, the optical environment of the coastal waters is assessed from in situ measurements of total suspended matter concentration (TSM), Secchi depth and turbidity (TU). This monitoring requires regular seaborne measurements (monthly), which is very expensive and difficult to obtain. The objective of the present study is the evaluation of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) AQUA data compared with two sampling campaigns realized at the study area. To map turbidity data from MODIS images, a semi-empirical algorithm was applied at band 667 nm. This bio-optical algorithm has already been calibrated and validated on the Belgian coast. The validation of this algorithm on the Gulf of Gabes using in situ measurements of turbidity and remotely sensed turbidity obtained from MODIS imagery shows a correlation coefficient of 68.9%. Seasonal and annual average maps for TSM and TU were then computed over the Gulf of Gabes using MODIS imagery. The obtained results of TSM and TU from remotely sensed data are conformable with those obtained through the analysis of in situ measurements. Therefore, remote sensing techniques offer a better and efficient tool for mapping and monitoring turbidity over the whole region.																	1866-7511					MAY	2013	6	5					1527	1535		10.1007/s12517-011-0438-9								WOS:000318443000019

Mapping Tropical Forest Trees Using High-Resolution Aerial Digital Photographs	BIOTROPICA												The spatial arrangement of tree species is a key aspect of community ecology. Because tree species in tropical forests occur at low densities, it is logistically challenging to measure distributions across large areas. In this study, we evaluated the potential use of canopy tree crown maps, derived from high-resolution aerial digital photographs, as a relatively simple method for measuring large-scale tree distributions. At Barro Colorado Island, Panama, we used high-resolution aerial digital photographs (similar to 0.129m/pixel) to identify tree species and map crown distributions of four target tree species. We determined crown mapping accuracy by comparing aerial and ground-mapped distributions and tested whether the spatial characteristics of the crown maps reflect those of the ground-mapped trees. Nearly a quarter (22%) of the common canopy species had sufficiently distinctive crowns to be good candidates for reliable mapping. The errors of commission (crowns misidentified as a target species) were relatively low, but the errors of omission (missed canopy trees of the target species) were high. Only 40 percent of canopy individuals were mapped on the air photographs. Despite failing to accurately predict exact abundances of canopy trees, crown distributions accurately reproduced the clumping patterns and spatial autocorrelation features of three of four tree species and predicted areas of high and low abundance. We discuss a range of ecological and forest management applications for which this method can be useful.

This study was focused on the mapping of the potential areas of forest fire occurrences through a WebGIS application that can relay information to the interested users. The geospatial technology and mathematical modeling were utilized to identify, classify and map the potential forest areas that are prone to fire. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) model and the geospatial technology that consist of remote sensing, geographical information system (GIS) and digital observed field data were utilised for the state of Selangor. AHP is a technique that models a decision, which in this study includes an overall objective of finding a forest area which has the potential of forest fire occurring. Three criteria such as fuel, topography and human factors were selected to build a hierarchical structure and a weight was given to each criterion. The hierarchy was then analysed through a series of pairwise comparisons that is processed mathematically and priority is given to the highest ranking to achieve the desired result. The expert's opinions were obtained from the firemen of the Malaysian Fire and Rescue Department who were directly involved with the forest fire operations. The result from this study showed that 65% of the area in Selangor has a potentially low fire occurrence, while 32.83 km(2) of extremely high risk fire areas were found in places such as Bestari Jaya, Ulu Tinggi and Kuala Langat. The information displayed through the WebGIS application is one of the best ways to assist the relevant authorities make an informed decision with a high confidence as it represents an almost real situation. The various agencies involved with the disaster management operations such as the disaster committees at the district, state and federal levels and the Malaysian Fire and Rescue Department may utilise this output as a tool to alleviate the future risk of forest fires.

Assessment and monitoring of long-term forest cover changes in Odisha, India using remote sensing and GIS	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Deforestation and fragmentation are important concerns in managing and conserving tropical forests and have global significance. In the Indian context, in the last one century, the forests have undergone significant changes due to several policies undertaken by government as well as increased population pressure. The present study has brought out spatiotemporal changes in forest cover and variation in forest type in the state of Odisha (Orissa), India, during the last 75 years period. The mapping for the period of 1924-1935, 1975, 1985, 1995 and 2010 indicates that the forest cover accounts for 81,785.6 km(2) (52.5 %), 56,661.1 km(2) (36.4 %), 51,642.3 km(2) (33.2 %), 49,773 km(2) (32 %) and 48,669.4 km(2) (31.3 %) of the study area, respectively. The study found the net forest cover decline as 40.5 % of the total forest and mean annual rate of deforestation as 0.69 % year(-1) during 1935 to 2010. There is a decline in annual rate of deforestation during 1995 to 2010 which was estimated as 0.15 %. Forest type-wise quantitative loss of forest cover reveals large scale deforestation of dry deciduous forests. The landscape analysis shows that the number of forest patches (per 1,000) are 2.463 in 1935, 10.390 in 1975, 11.899 in 1985, 12.193 in 1995 and 15.102 in 2010, which indicates high anthropogenic pressure on the forests. The mean patch size (km(2)) of forest decreased from 33.2 in 1935 to 5.5 in 1975 and reached to 3.2 by 2010. The study demonstrated that monitoring of long term forest changes, quantitative loss of forest types and landscape metrics provides critical inputs for management of forest resources.

Ecological applications of entropy measures have been primarily focused on structural and functional complexity of systems and less attention has been paid to temporal evolution and dynamics. The aim of this paper is to present "normalized spectral entropy" (Hs(n)), an entropy related index able to measure part of the structural complexity of an ecological time series. Hs(n) quantifies the degree of order and predictability derived by the series' power spectrum. The index sensitivity to data attributes is investigated by means of time-series surrogates of known properties (i.e., time-series length, power spectrum shape, and time-series values distribution). A procedure to calculate confidence intervals is outlined as a preliminary statistical tool to assess differences among values. Three examples of possible application are described using time series of meteorological variables, vegetation physiological responses and remote sensing images. Results show how Hs(n) is able to contribute to the ongoing debate on how to estimate spatio-temporal complexity of ecological systems, thus making a step forward in the proposed use of complexity as an ecological orientor.

Constraining U.S. ammonia emissions using TES remote sensing observations and the GEOS-Chem adjoint model	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Ammonia (NH3) has significant impacts on biodiversity, eutrophication, and acidification. Widespread uncertainty in the magnitude and seasonality of NH3 emissions hinders efforts to address these issues. In this work, we constrain U. S. NH3 sources using observations from the TES satellite instrument with the GEOS-Chem model and its adjoint. The inversion framework is first validated using simulated observations. We then assimilate TES observations for April, July, and October of 2006 through 2009. The adjoint-based inversion allows emissions to be adjusted heterogeneously; they are found to increase in California throughout the year, increase in different regions of the West depending upon season, and exhibit smaller increases and occasional decreases in the Eastern U. S. Evaluations of the inversion using independent surface measurements show reduced model underestimates of surface NH3 and wet deposited NHx in April and October; however, the constrained simulation in July leads to overestimates of these quantities, while TES observations are still under predicted. Modeled sulfate and nitrate aerosols concentrations do not change significantly, and persistent nitrate overestimation is noted, consistent with previous studies. Overall, while satellite-based constraints on NH3 emissions improve model simulations in several aspects, additional assessment at higher horizontal resolution of spatial sampling bias, nitric acid formation, and diurnal variability and bi-directionality of NH3 sources may be necessary to enhance year-round model performance across the full range of gas and aerosol evaluations.

J	Brandolin, PG; Avalos, MA; De Angelo, C				Brandolin, Pablo G.; Avalos, Miguel A.; De Angelo, Carlos			The impact of flood control on the loss of wetlands in Argentina	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												Wetlands are among the most important ecosystems on Earth, but historically they have been degraded and destroyed by humans. The south east of Cordoba province in central Argentina was covered by hundreds of wetlands in a vast matrix of grasslands and savannas. In the last few centuries, this area has been mostly transformed into agriculture, forcing wetlands to become the last refuge for remaining wildlife. Since the mid-1970s, a gradual increase in rainfall has enlarged the area occupied by wetlands. To reverse the situation, vast flooded regions were altered by the construction of artificial drainage channels, including important areas for conservation of biodiversity. A non-supervised classification of satellite images was used to assess the changes in flooded areas of south-eastern Cordoba before the main floods (19871988) and after channelizations occurred (2007). Areas with high channelization (Cordoba) and non-channelization (Santa Fe) were compared for years with the same amount of accumulated rainfall. The pluviometric registers in both regions showed a trend of increasing annual rainfall, and this was reflected in a 65.9% increase (64 837 ha) of the flooded area in Santa Fe. Conversely, the channelized area in Cordoba suffered a loss of 12% of its ponds, corresponding to a 14.7% reduction of the flooded area (11 655 ha). A greater reduction in the flooded area (42.1%) was observed when considering only the western portion of the Cordoba site where most of the channelization occurred. These results indicate that besides the mitigation of floods, the channelization in Cordoba favoured agriculture expansion at the expense of wetlands, thereby destroying these wildlife refuges. Wetlands are important for their biodiversity, ecosystem services, and cultural legacy. In central Argentina the channelization process still continues, so it is of the utmost importance to support conservation actions leading to sustainable management and territorial planning of this region.Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The study was conducted in the Cuitzeo basin located in central Mexico, where charcoal is produced from oak forests covering approximately 10% of the total area (4033 km(2)). Diameters of trees and sprouts in 78 plots of 0.2 ha each was measured. Allometric equations previously developed locally that only require tree diameters were employed to estimate the amount of woody biomass suitable for charcoal making i.e. the amount of wood that is loaded into the kilns. The performance of two statistical techniques for the interpolation of field data was assessed by cross-validation; these techniques were linear regression and regression-kriging, the second taking into account the spatial autocorrelation of data. Spectral bands, vegetation indices, texture measurements and variables derived from a Digital Elevation Model were examined as explanatory variables. Accounting for spatial autocorrelation (regression-kriging) improved the model's R-2 from 0.61 to 0.69, representing a relative error reduction of 11.3% (from 11.01 to 9.77 t ha(-1) of wood suitable for charcoal). The available stock was compared to current estimates of charcoal demand in the Cuitzeo basin and insights were given on how this information can be used to estimate the annual sustainable production potential of oak in order to account for supply-demand balances.

Effects of land use classification on landscape metrics based on remote sensing and GIS	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Landscape metrics are important when studying landscape structure and function. This study investigated the sensitivity of two core sets of landscape metrics to different land use classification systems by analyzing two typical landscapes at a small watershed scale and a county scale on the Loess Plateau, China. The results showed that (1) eight landscape metrics, selected using Spearman's correlation coefficient method and principle component analysis, adequately reflected the major landscape properties at both scales. (2) Land use classification had a significant influence on most of the selected landscape metrics, affecting their magnitude and the way in which they changed with increasing classification details; four general patterns were exhibited, i.e., increasing; decreasing; increasing and then decreasing; and relatively constant at the small watershed scale, while for the county scale, they were increasing; decreasing; increasing and then decreasing; and remaining relatively constant after initially increasing. (3) The general response patterns of most of the selected landscape metrics to the changing land use classification were similar among different years at both scales, which implied that the age of the data source used to generate the land use maps since 1982 had little effect on the landscape metrics, and that the underlying landscape pattern described by the metrics had not notably changed.																	1866-6280					APR	2013	68	8					2229	2237		10.1007/s12665-012-1905-7								WOS:000316749900009

Lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles will revolutionize spatial ecology	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT												Ecologists require spatially explicit data to relate structure to function. To date, heavy reliance has been placed on obtaining such data from remote-sensing instruments mounted on spacecraft or manned aircraft, although the spatial and temporal resolutions of the data are often not suited to local-scale ecological investigations. Recent technological innovations have led to an upsurge in the availability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) - aircraft remotely operated from the ground - and there are now many lightweight UAVs on offer at reasonable costs. Flying low and slow, UAVs offer ecologists new opportunities for scale-appropriate measurements of ecological phenomena. Equipped with capable sensors, UAVs can deliver fine spatial resolution data at temporal resolutions defined by the end user. Recent innovations in UAV platform design have been accompanied by improvements in navigation and the miniaturization of measurement technologies, allowing the study of individual organisms and their spatiotemporal dynamics at close range.

J	Wasige, JE; Groen, TA; Smaling, E; Jetten, V				Wasige, John E.; Groen, Thomas A.; Smaling, Eric; Jetten, Victor			Monitoring basin-scale land cover changes in Kagera Basin of Lake Victoria using ancillary data and remote sensing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												The Kagera Basin is a high value ecosystem in the Lake Victoria watershed because of the hydrological and food services it provides. The basin has faced large scale human induced land use and land cover changes (LUCC), but quantitative data is to date lacking. A combination of ancillary data and satellite imagery were interpreted to construct LUCC dynamics for the last century. This study is an initial step towards assessing the impact of LUCC on sustainable agriculture and water quality in the watershed. The results show that large trends of LUCC have rapidly occurred over the last 100 years. The most dominant LUCC processes were gains in farmland areas (not detectable in 1901 to 60% in 2010) and a net reduction in dense forest (7% to 2.6%), woodlands (51% to 6.9%) and savannas (35% to 19.6%) between 1901 and 2010. Forest degradation rapidly occurred during 1974 and 1995 but the forest re-grew between 1995 and 2010 due to forest conservation efforts. Afforestation efforts have resulted in plantation forest increases between 1995 and 2010. The rates of LUCC observed are higher than those reported in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) and other parts of the world. This is one of the few studies in SSA at a basin scale that combines multi-source spatio-temporal data on land cover to enable long-term quantification of land cover changes. In the discussion we address future research needs for the area based on the results of this study. These research needs include quantifying the impacts of land cover change on nutrient and sediment dynamics, soil organic carbon stocks, and changes in biodiversity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The challenge increases if the floristic variation within vegetation types (i.e., subtype variation of species composition) is the target. A desirable way to deal with this task may be to address such vegetation patterns with remote-sensing approaches. In particular data from multispectral sensors are easy to obtain, globally accessible, and often provide a high temporal resolution. They hence offer a comprehensive basis for vegetation mapping. The potential of such sensors for vegetation mapping has, however, never been thoroughly investigated. In particular, a systematic test regarding the spectral capabilities of these data for an assessment of detailed floristic variation has not been implemented to date. We thus addressed in this study the question how the ability of optical sensors to map floristic variation is affected by their respective spectral coverage and number of bands. To answer this question, we simulated monotemporal and multiseasonal data of eleven multispectral sensors. These data were used to model gradual transitions in species composition (i.e., floristic gradients) within three types of spontaneous vegetation typical for Central Europe using Partial Least Squares regression. Comparison of the model fits (ranging up to R-2 = 0.76 in cross-validation) illustrated the potential of multispectral data for detailed vegetation mapping. The results show that spectral coverage of the entire solar-reflective domain is the most important sensor characteristic for a successful assessment of floristic variation. Model and sensor performances as well as limitations are thoroughly discussed, and recommendations for sensor development are made based on the final conclusions of this study. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The size distribution and return frequency of disturbance events, and subsequent recovery processes, determine to a large extent the spatial scale over which this old-growth steady state develops. Here, we characterize this mosaic for a Central Amazon forest by integrating field plot data, remote sensing disturbance probability distribution functions, and individual-based simulation modeling. Results demonstrate that a steady state of patches of varying successional age occurs over a relatively large spatial scale, with important implications for detecting temporal trends on plots that sample a small fraction of the landscape. Long highly significant stochastic runs averaging 1.0 Mg biomass.ha(-1).y(-1) were often punctuated by episodic disturbance events, resulting in a sawtooth time series of hectare-scale tree biomass. To maximize the detection of temporal trends for this Central Amazon site (e.g., driven by CO2 fertilization), plots larger than 10 ha would provide the greatest sensitivity. A model-based analysis of fractional mortality across all gap sizes demonstrated that 9.1-16.9% of tree mortality was missing from plot-based approaches, underscoring the need to combine plot and remote-sensing methods for estimating net landscape carbon balance. Old-growth tropical forests can exhibit complex large-scale structure driven by disturbance and recovery cycles, with ecosystem and community attributes of hectare-scale plots exhibiting continuous dynamic departures from a steady-state condition.

Seasonal coupling of canopy structure and function in African tropical forests and its environmental controls	ECOSPHERE												Tropical forests provide important ecosystem services in maintaining biodiversity, sequestering carbon and regulating climate regionally and globally. Climate triggers the seasonal transitions of vegetation structure and function in tropical forests. In turn, the seasonal cycles of structure and function in tropical forests feed back to the climate system through the control of land-atmosphere exchange of carbon, water and energy fluxes. Large uncertainties exist in the carbon and water budgets of tropical forests, and environmental controls on phenology are among the least understood factors. Although field studies have identified patterns in the environmental controls on local-scale species-level phenology in the tropics, there is little consensus on large-scale top-down environmental controls on whole-ecosystem seasonality. In this paper, we use both optical and microwave remote sensing to investigate the seasonality of vegetation canopy structure and function in three distinct tropical African forest types, and identify environmental triggers or controls of their variability. For most tropical forests that have a closed canopy and high leaf biomass, optical remote sensing (e. g., vegetation indices) captures canopy photosynthetic capacity (i.e., canopy function), while small-wavelength microwave remote sensing characterizes the leaf biomass and leaf water content of the upper canopy (i.e., canopy structure). Our results reveal a strong coupling of canopy structure with canopy function in the tropical deciduous forests and woody savannas, and their seasonalities are both controlled by precipitation rather than solar radiation. By contrast, tropical evergreen forests in Africa exhibit a decoupling of canopy structure from canopy function revealed by different sensors: canopy photosynthetic capacity shown by the optical remote sensing is linked to the seasonal variation of precipitation, while microwave remote sensing captures semi-annual leaf-flushing that is synchronous with peak insolation intensity at the top of the atmosphere, which is bimodal. The differential coupling of canopy structure and function in tropical forests observed from remote sensing highlights differences inherent in distinct vegetation types within the tropics that may originate in the different life histories of their respective floras. This satellite-based finding encourages more field-based studies to clarify the interpretation of these large scale patterns.

The case of nesting sea turtles in the Mediterranean	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Artificial night lights pose a major threat to multiple species. However, this threat is often disregarded in conservation management and action because it is difficult to quantify its effect. Increasing availability of high spatial-resolution satellite images may enable us to better incorporate this threat into future work, particularly in highly modified ecosystems such as the coastal zone. In this study we examine the potential of satellite night light imagery to predict the distribution of the endangered loggerhead (Caretta caretto) and green (Chelonia mydas) sea turtle nests in the eastern Mediterranean coastline. Using remote sensing tools and high resolution data derived from the SAC-C satellite and the International Space Station, we examined the relationship between the long term spatial patterns of sea turtle nests and the intensity of night lights along Israel's entire Mediterranean coastline. We found that sea turtles nests are negatively related to night light intensity and are concentrated in darker sections along the coast. Our resulting GLMs showed that night lights were a significant factor for explaining the distribution of sea turtle nests. Other significant variables included: cliff presence, human population density and infrastructure. This study is one of the first to show that night lights estimated with satellite-based imagery can be used to help explain sea turtle nesting activity at a detailed resolution over large areas. This approach can facilitate the management of species affected by night lights, and will be particularly useful in areas that are inaccessible or where broad-scale prioritization of conservation action is required.

Algorithm development for predicting biodiversity based on phytoplankton absorption	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Ocean color remote sensing has provided the scientific community with unprecedented global coverage of chlorophyll a, an indicator of phytoplankton biomass. Together, satellite-derived chlorophyll a and knowledge of Phytoplankton Functional Types (PFTs) will improve our limited understanding of marine ecosystem responses to physiochemical climate drivers involved in carbon cycle dynamics and linkages. Using cruise data from the Gulf of Maine and the Middle Atlantic Bight (N = 269 pairs of HPLC and phytoplankton absorption samples), two modeling approaches were utilized to predict phytoplankton absorption and pigments. Algorithm I predicts the chlorophyll-specific absorption coefficient (a*(ph) (m(2) mg chl a(-1))) using inputs of temperature, light, and chlorophyll a. Modeled r(2) values (400-700 nm) ranged from 0.79 to 0.99 when compared to in situ observations with similar to 25% lower r(2) values in the UV region. Algorithm II-a utilizes matrix inversion analysis to predict a(ph)(m(-1), 400-700 nm) and r(2) values ranged from 0.89 to 0.99. The prediction of phytoplankton pigments with Algorithm II-b produced r(2) values that ranged from 0.40 to 0.93. When used in combination, Algorithm I, and Algorithm II-a are able to use satellite products of SST, PAR, and chlorophyll a (Algorithm I) to predict pigment concentrations and ratios to describe the phytoplankton community. The results of this study demonstrate that the spatial variation in modeled pigment ratios differ significantly from the 10-year SeaWiFS average chlorophyll a data set. Contiguous observations of chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biodiversity will elucidate ecosystem responses with unprecedented complexity. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Within the framework of the REBENT network, sediment characteristics, depth, and macrofaunal abundance were determined for 95 stations spread over five subtidal sectors, using a combination of seabed acoustic remote sensing systems and grab sampling. The physico-chemical properties of the water column and the hydrodynamic conditions were generated by validated three-dimensional environmental models which take into account variations over shorter temporal scales. Multivariate analyses ranked 16 natural abiotic variables according to the significance of their influence on the macrofauna. Together these variables explained 51% of spatial variation in the macrofauna, with morpho-sedimentological and hydrological factors contributing 22% and 26%, respectively. The outputs from validated three-dimensional environmental models appear to be useful interpretational tools for benthic ecology studies, especially in estuarine and coastal ecosystems with high environmental variability due to regular freshwater inputs.

Impacts and adaptation options of climate change on ecosystem services in Finland: a model based study	CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY												At a global level, it is estimated that nearly two-thirds of ecosystem services have been degraded in just fifty years. The additional stresses imposed by climate change will require extraordinary adaptation. This paper synthesises main result of a large Finnish project studying the vulnerability of key ecosystem services to climate change and the possibilities for the individual sectors to adapt to these changes. The project based its work on data and infrastructures of nine intensively studied areas belonging to the Finnish LTER (Long-Term Ecological Research) network. The methods developed and used included remote sensing, derivation of impact scenarios, dynamic modelling, laboratory experiments, interactive workshops and expert judgement. The results clearly indicated not only complex interactions between the different ecosystem processes but also trade-offs between the ecosystem services. Climate change was predicted to have both positive and negative effects on key ecosystem services in Finnish conditions, the results being sector-specific and scenario-specific. Provisioning services like food and timber production would largely benefit from increasing temperatures. and prolongation of the growing season in the cool Finnish conditions (with e.g. estimated increases in growth rates of trees up to 80% and the introduction of a wider selection of crops), although increasing occurrence of factors such as fungal diseases and insect outbreaks were estimated to cause increasing risks. On the other hand, climate change was predicted to pose a major threat to several endangered and valuable species, water and air quality, and tourism services dependent on present climate conditions. Goal conflicts between maximising service production and meeting environmental quality objectives were also identified. Adaptation options and impact thresholds identified together with local enterprises and experts are presented.

Quantifying Tropical Dry Forest Type and Succession: Substantial Improvement with LiDAR	BIOTROPICA												Improved technologies are needed to advance our knowledge of the biophysical and human factors influencing tropical dry forests, one of the world's most threatened ecosystems. We evaluated the use of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to address two major needs in remote sensing of tropical dry forests, i.e., classification of forest types and delineation of forest successional status. We evaluated LiDAR-derived measures of three-dimensional canopy structure and subcanopy topography using classification-tree techniques to separate different dry forest types and successional stages in the Guanica Biosphere Reserve in Puerto Rico. We compared the LiDAR-based results with classifications made from commonly used remote sensing data, including Landsat satellite imagery and radar-based topographic data. The accuracy of the LiDAR-based forest type classification (including native- and exotic-dominated forest classes) was substantially higher than those from previously available data (kappa=0.90 and 0.63, respectively). The best result was obtained when combining LiDAR-derived metrics of canopy structure and topography, and adding Landsat spectral data did not improve the classification. For the second objective, we observed that LiDAR-derived variables of vegetation structure were better predictors of forest successional status (i.e., mid-secondary, late-secondary, and primary forests) than was spectral information from Landsat. Importantly, the key LiDAR predictors identified within each classification-tree model agreed with previous ecological knowledge of these forests. Our study highlights the value of LiDAR remote sensing for assessing tropical dry forests, reinforcing the potential for this novel technology to advance research and management of tropical forests in general. Resumo Nuevas tecnologias son necesarias para avanzar en el conocimiento de los factores biofisicos y humanos que afectan a los bosques tropicales secos, uno de los ecosistemas mas amenazados del mundo. En este estudio evaluamos el uso de la tecnologia LiDAR (light detection and ranging) para cubrir dos limitaciones importantes en la teledeteccion de los bosques tropicales secos, incluidas la clasificacion de los tipos de bosques y la delimitacion de estados sucesionales. Especificamente, evaluamos el potencial de las variables tridimensionales de la estructural del bosque y la topografia derivados de LiDAR, mediante tecnicas de arboles de clasificacion, para separar distintos tipos de bosques y estados sucesionales en la Reserva de Biosfera de Guanica, en Puerto Rico. Comparamos los resultados obtenidos de LiDAR con aquellos derivados de fuentes de datos de sensores remotos comunmente utilizados, como las imagenes Landsat y datos topograficos de radar. La precision de la clasificacion de los tipos de bosques obtenida con LiDAR (incluida la presencia de clases dominadas por especies nativas asi como exoticas) fue sustancialmente superior a aquella obtenida con datos de los otros sensores (kappa=0.90 y 0.63 respectivamente). El mejor resultado se obtuvo al combinar variables estructurales del dosel y topografia, todas ellas de LiDAR. La incorporacion de informacion espectral de las imagenes Landsat no mejoro la clasificacion. Como parte del segundo objetivo, encontramos que las variables estructurales de vegetacion de LiDAR lograron separar los estados sucesionales (bosques secundario tardio, medio, y bosque primario), en una forma superior a los datos espectrales de Landsat. Importante, las variables de LiDAR identificadas mediante los modelos de clasificacion como las mas importantes en nuestro estudio, concordaron con aquellas esperadas en base al conocimiento ecologico previo de estos bosques. Nuestro trabajo muestra el valor de la tecnologia LiDAR para el estudio de los bosques tropicales secos, y resalta el potencial de esta tecnologia para avanzar en el manejo y la investigacion de los bosques tropicales en general.

Monitoring land cover changes in African protected areas in the 21st century	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Africa is home to some of the most vulnerable natural ecosystems and species on the planet. Around 7000 protected areas seek to safeguard the continent's rich biodiversity, but many of them face increasing management challenges. Human disturbances permeating into the parks directly and indirectly affect the ecological functioning and integrity of protected areas. With the envisaged expansion of the protected area network and further expected population and economic growth in the region, the competition between nature conservation and resources demands is likely to increase. The regular monitoring of land cover in and around protected areas can support the early detection of conservation conflicts. In this paper, we evaluate the use of the annual time series of MODIS Land Cover (LC) type product between 2003 and 2009 to monitor land cover changes at continental scale. We use the mean classification confidence and change frequency as indicators to assess the temporal consistency of the MODIS LC classifier for accurately monitoring land cover changes. We discuss the perspectives and issues for an automated monitoring of land cover changes in African protected areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Thinking spatially: The importance of geospatial techniques for carnivore conservation	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Today, 27% of the known mammalian carnivore species are either extinct or threatened, undermining the health of many ecosystems, which provide resources and services that are crucial for human development. Carnivore research and management have been limited by the predominantly cryptic nature of carnivores, sometimes also by their large-scale habitat requirements and their remote distributions. As a consequence, many carnivore species currently remain under-studied. The increased availability and facilitated interpretation of remote-sensing imagery, combined with recent developments in landscape ecology and geographic information systems, have provided a wealth of analytical tools to overcome many of these traditional setbacks. These can be coupled with advances in multivariate statistics and species distribution models to formalise the link between spatial patterns in environmental variables and species occurrence. Such methods allow a greater understanding of the processes shaping habitat use, the effects of poaching and land-cover change, and assist in the design and monitoring of more targeted actions towards carnivores' long-term conservation.

Forest patch connectivity diagnostics and prioritization using graph theory	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Landscape level forest connectivity regulates species level biodiversity, wildlife movement, seed dispersal and ecological factors. Geospatial assessment of forest connectivity at the landscape level is realized as one of the important frameworks to prioritize the biodiversity conservation strategies. The paper presents an approach to identify the optimal threshold distance and set of forest patches (component) using graph theory to propose potential connectivity alternatives over fragmented tropical deciduous forest tracts in parts of Eastern Ghats of India. The study analyzed 598 forest patches (derived from remote sensing data) constituting an area of 3502.87 km(2) which is distributed over 10,807 km(2). Optimal threshold distance and components were derived using graph theory based connectivity indices namely, Integral Index of Connectivity importance value (dIIC), Landscape Coincidence Probability importance value (dLCP) and also addressing patch size, number, inter distance and relative importance of each patch in the totality of the landscape. The study identified a total of 191 components at an optimal threshold distance of 250 m for potential connectivity. A component consisting of 145 patches of which 5 patches having high relative importance value within the component were identified for prioritizing the connectivity efforts. Further analysis on the three fractions of dIIC (dIICintra, dIICflux and dIICconnector) justified the importance of individual patches for connectivity. Proposed connectivity could enhance the forest habitat network through these potential patches. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Making better use of accuracy data in land change studies: Estimating accuracy and area and quantifying uncertainty using stratified estimation	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The area of land use or land cover change obtained directly from a map may differ greatly from the true area of change because of map classification error. An error-adjusted estimator of area can be easily produced once an accuracy assessment has been performed and an error matrix constructed. The estimator presented is a stratified estimator which is applicable to data acquired using popular sampling designs such as stratified random, simple random and systematic (the stratified estimator is often labeled a poststratified estimator for the latter two designs). A confidence interval for the area of land change should also be provided to quantify the uncertainty of the change area estimate. The uncertainty of the change area estimate, as expressed via the confidence interval, can then subsequently be incorporated into an uncertainty analysis for applications using land change area as an input (e.g., a carbon flux model). Accuracy assessments published for land change studies should report the information required to produce the stratified estimator of change area and to construct confidence intervals. However, an evaluation of land change articles published between 2005 and 2010 in two remote sensing journals revealed that accuracy assessments often fail to include this key information. We recommend that land change maps should be accompanied by an accuracy assessment that includes a clear description of the sampling design (including sample size and, if relevant, details of stratification), an error matrix, the area or proportion of area of each category according to the map, and descriptive accuracy measures such as user's, producer's and overall accuracy. Furthermore, mapped areas should be adjusted to eliminate bias attributable to map classification error and these error-adjusted area estimates should be accompanied by confidence intervals to quantify the sampling variability of the estimated area. Using data from the published literature, we illustrate how to produce error-adjusted point estimates and confidence intervals of land change areas. A simple analysis of uncertainty based on the confidence bounds for land change area is applied to a carbon flux model to illustrate numerically that variability in the land change area estimate can have a dramatic effect on model outputs.

As such, there is a clear need to map biodiversity at high spatial resolutions across large areas. Airborne and spaceborne optical remote sensing is a potential tool to provide such biodiversity data. The spectral variation hypothesis (SVH) predicts a positive correlation between spectral variability (SV) of a remotely sensed image and biodiversity. The SVH has only been tested on a few terrestrial plant communities. Our study is the first attempt to apply the SVH in the marine environment using hyperspectral imagery recorded by Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI). All coverage-based diversity measures of benthic macrophytes and invertebrates showed low but statistically significant positive correlations with SV whereas the relationship between biomass-based diversity measures and SV were weak or lacking. The observed relationships did not vary with spatial scale. SV had the highest independent effect among predictor variables in the statistical models of coverage-derived total benthic species richness and Shannon index. Thus, the relevance of SVH in marine benthic habitats was proved and this forms a prerequisite for the future use of SV in benthic biodiversity assessments.

Range Management Affects Native Ungulate Populations in Peninsula Valdes, a World Natural Heritage	PLOS ONE												Sheep rearing is the main productive activity in Patagonian rangelands, where guanacos are the only native ungulate. Ranchers perceive a decrease in range carrying capacity as guanaco numbers increase, therefore guanaco conservation within private lands becomes a considerable challenge. This issue is particularly evident in the World Natural Heritage Peninsula Valdes (PV), where there is a need to harmonize livestock production and biodiversity conservation. While sheep rearing prevails as the primary land use in the area, some ecotourism initiatives have been implemented to complement livestock production. In order to study how land use affected guanaco distribution, we characterized PV's ranches in terms of land subdivision, primary productivity, stocking-rate and management type, and assess how these variables affected guanaco encounter rates. Smaller ranches were composed of smaller paddocks (mean size 4.8 km(2)), which showed higher values of the remote-sensing derived Enhance Vegetation Index (EVI) (mean 0.14) and held higher sheep densities (mean 108.0 sheep/km(2)), while larger management units (mean size 23.8 km(2)), showed lower EVI values (mean 0.12) and lower stocking-rates (mean 36.7 sheep/km(2)). This pattern suggests that primary productivity has been a decisive factor to determine the minimal paddock size set by ranchers in PV, apparently precluding excessive land-subdivision in less productive areas. Guanaco encounter rate, expressed as number of guanacos per travelled kilometre, was inversely related to EVI and stocking-rate. However, land subdivision was the better predictor of guanaco encounter-rate within only sheep ranches, finding more guanacos per kilometre as paddock size increased. In contrast, in ranches where ecotourism was implemented as a complementary activity, guanaco encounter-rates were greater, regardless of paddock size. Our results suggest that the implementation of an additional activity by which landowners derive benefits from wildlife has prompted a beneficial outcome for guanacos, presumably through a decrease in harassment intensity. Finally, we propose possible mechanisms by which land subdivision may affect guanaco distribution and potential alternatives for the inclusion of wildlife conservation in a context of extensive livestock production.																	1932-6203					FEB 4	2013	8	2							e55655	10.1371/journal.pone.0055655								WOS:000314691100062	23390546					
J	Sun, J; Southworth, J				Sun, Jing; Southworth, Jane			Remote Sensing-Based Fractal Analysis and Scale Dependence Associated with Forest Fragmentation in an Amazon Tri-National Frontier	REMOTE SENSING												In the Amazon, the development and paving of roads connects regions and peoples, and over time can form dense and recursive networks, which often serve as nodes for continued development. These developed areas exhibit robust fractal structures that could potentially link their spatial patterns with deforestation processes. Fractal dimension is commonly used to describe the growth trajectory of such fractal structures and their spatial-filling capacities. Focusing on a tri-national frontier region, we applied a box-counting method to calculate the fractal dimension of the developed areas in the Peruvian state of Madre de Dios, Acre in Brazil, and the department of Pando in Bolivia, from 1986 through 2010. The results indicate that development has expanded in all three regions with declining forest cover over time, but with different patterns and rates in each country. Such differences were summarized within a proposed framework to indicate deforestation progress/level, which can be used to understand and regulate deforestation and its evolution in time. In addition, the role and influence of scale was also assessed, and we found local fractal dimensions are not invariant at different spatial scales and thus concluded such scale-dependent features of fragmentation patterns are here mainly shaped by the road paving.

Surface water temperature is a key parameter in the physics of aquatic systems processes since it is closely related to the energy fluxes through the water-atmosphere interface. Remote sensing applied to water quality studies in inland waterbodies is a powerful tool that can provide additional information difficult to achieve by other means. The combination of good real-time coverage, spatial resolution and free availability of data makes Landsat system a proper alternative. Many papers have developed algorithms to retrieve surface temperature (principally, land surface temperature) from at-sensor and surface emissivity data. The aim of this study is to apply the single-channel generalized method (SCGM) developed by Jimenez-Munoz and Sobrino (2003) for the estimation of water surface temperature from Landsat 7 ETM+ thermal bands. We consider a constant water emissivity value (0.9885) and we compare the results with radiative transfer classic method (RTM). We choose Embalse del Rio Tercero (Cordoba, Argentina) as case study because it is a reservoir affected by the outlet of the cooling system of a nuclear power plant, whose thermal plume could influence the biota's distribution and biodiversity. These characteristics and the existence of long term studies make it an adequate place to test the methodology. Values of estimated and observed water surface temperatures obtained by the two compared methods were correlated applying a simple regression model. Correlation coefficients were significant (R-2: 0.9498 for SCGM method and R-2: 0.9584 for RTM method) while their standard errors were acceptable in both cases (SCGM method: RMS = 1.2250 and RTM method: RMS = 1.0426). Nevertheless, SCGM could estimate rather small differences in temperature between sites consistently with the results obtained in field measurements. Besides, it has the advantage that it only uses values of atmospheric water vapor and it can be applied to different thermal sensors using the same equation and coefficients. (C) 2012 COSPAR.

When bugs reveal biodiversity	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												One of the fundamental challenges of conservation biology is gathering data on species distribution and abundance. And unless conservationists know where a species is found and in which numbers, it is very difficult to apply effective conservation efforts. In today's age of increasingly powerful monitoring tools, instant communication and online databases, one might be forgiven for thinking that such knowledge is easy to come by. However, of the approximately 5,400 terrestrial mammals on the IUCN Red List, no fewer than 789 (ca. 14%) are listed as Data Deficient (IUCN 2012) IUCN's term for haven't got a clue. Until recently, the only way to gather information of numbers and distribution of terrestrial mammals (and many other vertebrates) was through observational-based approaches such as visual records, the presence of tracks or spoor or even identification from bushmeat or hunters' trophies pinned to the walls in local villages. While recent technological developments have considerably improved the efficacy of such approaches, for example, using remote-sensing devices such as audio- or camera-traps or even remote drones (Koh & Wich 2012), there has been a growing realization of the power of molecular methods that identify mammals based on trace evidence. Suitable substrates include the obvious, such as faecal and hair samples (e.g. Vigilant et al. 2009), to the less obvious, including environmental DNA extracted from sediments, soil or water samples (e.g. Taberlet et al. 2012), and as recently demonstrated, the dietary content of blood-sucking invertebrates (Gariepy et al. 2012; Schnell et al. 2012). In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Calvignac-Spencer et al. (2013) present a potentially powerful development in this regard; diet analysis of carrion flies. With their near global distribution, and as most field biologists know, irritatingly high frequency in most terrestrial areas of conservation concern (which directly translates into ease of sampling them), the authors present extremely encouraging results that indicate how carnivorous flies may soon represent a strong weapon in the conservation arsenal.

A remote sensing approach to biodiversity assessment and regionalization of the Canadian boreal forest	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Successful conservation planning for the Canadian boreal forest requires biodiversity data that are both accessible and reliable. Spatially exhaustive data is required to inform on conditions, trends and context, with context enabling consideration of conservation opportunities and related trade-offs. However, conventional methods for measuring biodiversity, while useful, are spatially constrained, making it difficult to apply over wide geographic regions. Increasingly, remotely sensed imagery and methods are seen as a viable approach for acquiring explicit, repeatable and multi-scale biodiversity data over large areas. To identify relevant remotely derived environmental indicators specific to biodiversity within the Canadian boreal forest, we assessed indicators of the physical environment such as seasonal snow cover, topography and vegetation production. Specifically, we determined if the indicators provided distinct information and whether they were useful predictors of species richness (tree, mammal, bird and butterfly species). Using cluster analysis, we also assessed the applicability of these indicators for broad ecosystem classification of the Canadian boreal forest and the subsequent attribution of these stratified regions (i.e. clusters). Our results reveal that the indicators used in the cluster creation provided unique information and explained much of the variance in tree (92.6%), bird (84.07%), butterfly (61.4%) and mammal (22.6%) species richness. Spring snow cover explained the most variance in species richness. Results further show that the 15 clusters produced using cluster analysis were principally stratified along a latitudinal gradient and, while varied in size, captured a range of different environmental conditions across the Canadian boreal forest. The most important indicators for discriminating between the different cluster groups were seasonal greenness, a multipart measure of climate, topography and land use, and wetland cover, a measure of the percentage of wetland within a 1 km(2) cell.

J	Vaz, ED; Walczynska, A; Nijkamp, P				Vaz, Eric de Noronha; Walczynska, Agnieszka; Nijkamp, Peter			Regional challenges in tourist wetland systems: an integrated approach to the Ria Formosa in the Algarve, Portugal	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												Coastal change and coastal erosion have been a long-existing source of environmental changes. Traditionally, regional changes in wetland systems and their relations to agriculture, industry and urbanization are a major cause for concern. Nowadays, coastal distress has reached even global proportions: the problems of coastal change are strongly linked to the loss of fragile ecosystems, eutrophication and loss of biodiversity. Given that over 70 % of all human activity is in coastal areas, it is clear that many environmental and socio-economic changes occur at a local level and manifest themselves in a spatial context. The physical effect on the geographic morphology is evident in the related consequences for land use. A deep understanding of the changes in land use, and simultaneously in coastal erosion, calls for the integrated monitoring of the most relevant effects in fragile regions. The Ria Formosa wetland system is a unique and very special wetland system in the Algarve (Portugal) and has been integrated in the NATURA 2000 network. The strong symbiosis between nature, agriculture and fisheries, as well as tourism, in the Algarve has led to spatial-ecological synergy. By using coastal recession analysis techniques by means of remote-sensed imagery from 1987, 1989, 2000 and 2007 and by combining this information with available data sets on surface erodibility, a cost surface on multitemporal transitions of land-use classes from the CORINE Land Cover data allows us to assess and integrate a decision-making framework by means of GIS. The novelty of this combined approach to land-use management is the blend of spatial analysis and remote-sensing techniques that share important information on ecosystems at risk. Our findings suggest a growing concern to the area brought by anthropogenic activity. This is studied to a spatial accounting of the distribution of land changes and transitions, where (1) a significant loss of coastal area is witnessed along the Ria Formosa, leading in particular to loss of agricultural land. (2) This loss is underpinned by an increase in leisure facilities to respond to the tourism demand of the region of the Algarve, while landscape metrics suggest that these areas are more volatile for coastal erosion. (3) Simulation through Markov chains on the land use and effects of urban, agricultural, forest and wetland dynamics suggests that by 2026, it is expected to continue to have an increase in urban land, leading to an augmented vulnerability of coastal erosion processes brought by the loss of forest areas which protect from erosion given the root system that directly protects from the existing wave energy and helps sedimentation processes. The above methodology and the availability of data that are freely available render such a combined approach interesting for many other regions of the world, where tourism, coastal change and regional balance are of the utmost importance for sustainable development. The advanced research tools presented here are of critical importance for coastal zone degradation management.
