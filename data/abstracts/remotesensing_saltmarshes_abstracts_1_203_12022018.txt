Unravelling the sedimentary patterns of ancient channels is an expensive process that usually requires high resolution sediment coring. Here we use a novel inversion process of multi-frequency electromagnetic measurements to reveal the signature and characterize the dynamics of a salt-marsh paleo-meander in the Venice Lagoon. We show that the ancient meander migrated laterally while vertically aggrading, developing a peculiar bar geometry which is less common in analogous fluvial meanders. The observed point-bar dynamics and the associated architectural geometry are consistent with remote sensing and borehole data and contrast with current assessments of tidal meander morphodynamics mediated from classical fluvial theories. In addition, the proposed technique, rapid and non-invasive, bears important consequences for detecting buried stratal geometries and reconstructing the spatial distribution of ancient sedimentary bodies, providing quantitative data for the description of landscape evolution in time.																	2045-2322					JAN 26	2018	8								1708	10.1038/s41598-018-20061-5								WOS:000423428300036	29374215					
J	Watson, EB; Corona, AH				Burke Watson, Elizabeth; Hinojosa Corona, Alejandro			Assessment of Blue Carbon Storage by Baja California (Mexico) Tidal Wetlands and Evidence for Wetland Stability in the Face of Anthropogenic and Climatic Impacts	SENSORS												Although saline tidal wetlands cover less than a fraction of one percent of the earth's surface (similar to 0.01%), they efficiently sequester organic carbon due to high rates of primary production coupled with surfaces that aggrade in response to sea level rise. Here, we report on multi-decadal changes (1972-2008) in the extent of tidal marshes and mangroves, and characterize soil carbon density and source, for five regions of tidal wetlands located on Baja California's Pacific coast. Land-cover change analysis indicates the stability of tidal wetlands relative to anthropogenic and climate change impacts over the past four decades, with most changes resulting from natural coastal processes that are unique to arid environments. The disturbance of wetland soils in this region (to a depth of 50 cm) would liberate 2.55 Tg of organic carbon (C) or 9.36 Tg CO(2)eq. Based on stoichiometry and carbon stable isotope ratios, the source of organic carbon in these wetland sediments is derived from a combination of wetland macrophyte, algal, and phytoplankton sources. The reconstruction of natural wetland dynamics in Baja California provides a counterpoint to the history of wetland destruction elsewhere in North America, and measurements provide new insights on the control of carbon sequestration in arid wetlands.																	1424-8220					JAN	2018	18	1							32	10.3390/s18010032								WOS:000423286300032						
J	Zhou, ZM; Yang, YM; Chen, BQ				Zhou, Zaiming; Yang, Yanming; Chen, Benqing			Estimating Spartina alterniflora fractional vegetation cover and aboveground biomass in a coastal wetland using SPOT6 satellite and UAV data	AQUATIC BOTANY												Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) is one of the most serious invasive species in some coastal wetlands of China, and its fractional vegetation cover (FVC) and aboveground biomass (AGB) are important parameters that affect the ecology of these wetlands. Because of inaccessibility, field surveys are time-consuming, labor intensive, and difficult to implement, especially on a regional scale. Thus, satellite remote sensing and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) techniques are the better methods to obtain accurate FVC and AGB information in coastal wetlands. In this study, FVC and AGB of S. alterniflora were estimated based on the SPOT6 satellite remote sensing images with 6 m spatial resolution, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images with 0.1 m spatial resolution, over Sansha Bay, a coastal wetland in China. In addition, some field-based samples were also collected. Results showed that most of the FVC ranged from 40% to 80%, indicated a medium-high and high level; while AGB varied from 0 to 15 kg m(-2). Spatial distribution pattern of FVC and AGB were mainly influenced by the ecological and geographical environment. Meanwhile, the local distribution characteristics in the near-shore area also had close relation with anthropogenic activities. Accuracy analysis showed that, the root mean square errors (RMSE) of FVC and AGB were 0.108 and 0.415, and the coefficients of determination (R-2) were 0.905 and 0.898, respectively. The results suggest that it is feasible and effective to estimate FVC and AGB of S. alterniflora in coastal wetland using SPOT and UAV data with high accuracy.																	0304-3770	1879-1522				JAN	2018	144						38	45		10.1016/j.aquabot.2017.10.004								WOS:000418310300005						
J	Ballanti, L; Byrd, KB; Woo, I; Ellings, C				Ballanti, Laurel; Byrd, Kristin B.; Woo, Isa; Ellings, Christopher			Remote Sensing for Wetland Mapping and Historical Change Detection at the Nisqually River Delta	SUSTAINABILITY												Coastal wetlands are important ecosystems for carbon storage and coastal resilience to climate change and sea-level rise. As such, changes in wetland habitat types can also impact ecosystem functions. Our goal was to quantify historical vegetation change within the Nisqually River watershed relevant to carbon storage, wildlife habitat, and wetland sustainability, and identify watershed-scale anthropogenic and hydrodynamic drivers of these changes. To achieve this, we produced time-series classifications of habitat, photosynthetic pathway functional types and species in the Nisqually River Delta for the years 1957, 1980, and 2015. Using an object-oriented approach, we performed a hierarchical classification on historical and current imagery to identify change within the watershed and wetland ecosystems. We found a 188.4 ha (79%) increase in emergent marsh wetland within the Nisqually River Delta between 1957 and 2015 as a result of restoration efforts that occurred in several phases through 2009. Despite these wetland gains, a total of 83.1 ha (35%) of marsh was lost between 1957 and 2015, particularly in areas near the Nisqually River mouth due to erosion and shifting river channels, resulting in a net wetland gain of 105.4 ha (44%). We found the trajectory of wetland recovery coincided with previous studies, demonstrating the role of remote sensing for historical wetland change detection as well as future coastal wetland monitoring.

Accurately monitoring the distribution of S. alterniflora is urgent and essential for developing cost-effective control strategies. In this study, we applied the One-Class Classification (OCC) methods of Maximum entropy (Maxent) and Biased Support Vector Machine (BSVM) based on Landsat time-series imagery to detect the species on the middle coast of Jiangsu in east China. We conducted four experimental setups (i.e., single-scene analysis, time-series analysis, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series analysis and a compressed time-series analysis), using OCC methods to recognize the species. Then, we tested the performance of a compressed time-series model for S. alterniflora detection and evaluated the expansibility of this approach when it was applied to a larger region. Our principal findings are as follows: (1) Maxent and BSVM performed equally well, and Maxent appeared to have a more balanced performance over the summer months; (2) the Maxent model with the Default Parameter Set (Maxent-DPS) showed a slightly higher accuracy and more overfitting than Maxent with the Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small samples sizes (AICc)-selected parameter set model, but a t-test found no significant difference between these two settings; (3) April and December were deemed to be important periods for the detection of S. alterniflora; (4) a compressed time-series analysis modelincluding only three variables (December NDVI, March green and the third Principal Component in January, PC3)yielded higher accuracy than single-scene analyses, which indicated that time-series analysis can better detect S. alterniflora than single-scene analyses; and (5) the Maxent model using the reconstructed optimal variables and 70 training samples over a larger region produced encouraging results with an overall accuracy of 90.88% and a Kappa of 0.78. The one-class classification method combined with a phenology-based detection strategy is therefore promising for the application of the long-term detection of S. alterniflora over extended areas.					liu, huiyu/0000-0003-3976-481X												2072-4292					NOV	2017	9	11							1120	10.3390/rs9111120								WOS:000416554100035

However, periodic tidal flooding reduces spectral reflectance, especially in the near and short-wave infrared wavelengths. Consequently, marsh vegetation time-series products that lack tidal filtering, such as those provided by MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), may not reflect true vegetation trends. We created a new Tidal Marsh Inundation Index (TMII) for processing daily 500-m MODIS surface reflectance data and calibrated it with a Spartina alterniflora salt marsh pixel on Sapelo Island, GA. Ground-truth data for TMII was extracted from a PhenoCam, which collected high frequency digital photography of the TMII calibration pixel. To identify the best wavelengths to include in the TMII, we compared goodness of fit metrics from generalized linear models (GLMs). Predictors for these GLMs included suites of normalized difference indices from the literature as well as other band combinations. We also explored including a phonology parameter that could scale TMII relative to vegetation development. Ultimately, TMII was based on the normalized difference of green and shortwave infrared reflectance in combination with a phenology parameter composed of the moving average of the normalized difference of near infrared and shortwave infrared reflectance. This final index allowed a single optimized decision boundary to identify flooding across the annual growth cycle. When compared to ground-truth data from the PhenoCam, the TMII classified flooded conditions with 67-82% and dry conditions with 75-81% accuracy, respectively, across training, testing and validation datasets. We applied TMII to new S. alterniflora marsh MODIS pixels on Sapelo Island, GA as well as on Plum Island, MA. For these new pixels, TMII classified marsh flooding with 77-80% overall accuracy. We also demonstrated how users can apply TMII filtering in a MODIS workflow to create vegetation time-series composites within S. alterniflora, Spardrza patens and Juncus roemerianus marshes. We showed how a new user can validate and optimize TMII in their application, either by comparing it to inundation data or by validating the filtered vegetation time series against field data. We also compared TMII-filtered composites to the existing MODIS MOD13 16-d Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) product. TMII-filtered composites generated less noisy time -series that fit field data better than MOD13. TMII filtering was most important on Sapelo Island, where the tide range was high and vegetation was sparse. Results were less dramatic when TMII was applied to different marsh species within the Gulf Coast sites with lower tidal ranges, but TMII-filtering still improved vegetation time series. Thus, preprocessing MODIS imagery with the TMII effectively identified most inundated pixels. The TMII represents a step forward for wetland remote sensing that will be useful for improved estimation of phonology, biomass and carbon storage in coastal marshes.																	0034-4257	1879-0704				NOV	2017	201						34	46		10.1016/j.rse.2017.08.008								WOS:000412866400004

However, these two species have different growth ratios in this area, which increase the difficulty to detect the distribution situation directly by remote sensing. As chlorophyll content is a key indicator of plant growth and physiological status, the objective of this study was to reduce the effect of interspecies competition when estimating Cab content; we evaluated 79 published representative indices to determine the optimal indices for estimating the chlorophyll a and b Cab) content. After performing a sensitivity analysis for all 79 spectral indices, five spectral indices were selected and integrated using an artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate the Cab content of different competition ratios: the Gitelson ratio green index, the transformed chlorophyll absorption ratio index/optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index, the modified normalized difference vegetation index, the chlorophyll fluorescence index, and the Vogelmann chlorophyll index. The ANN method yielded better results (R-2 = 0.7110 and RMSE = 8.3829 mu g cm(-2)) on average than the best single spectral index (R-2 = 0.6319 and RMSE = 9.3535 mu g cm(-2)), representing an increase of 10.78% in R-2 and a decrease of 10.38% in RMSE. Our results indicated that integrating multiple vegetation indices with an ANN can alleviate the impact of interspecies competition and achieve higher estimation accuracy than the traditional approach using a single index.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				NOV	2017	189	11							596	10.1007/s10661-017-6323-6								WOS:000414179500005	29086121

Yet, the contribution of marsh oiling to landscape-scale degradation and subsequent land loss has been difficult to quantify. Here, we applied advanced remote sensing techniques to map changes in marsh land cover and open water before and after oiling. We segmented the marsh shorelines into non-oiled and oiled reaches and calculated the land loss rates for each 10% increase in oil cover (e.g. 0% to >70%), to determine if land loss rates for each reach oiling category were significantly different before and after oiling. Finally, we calculated background land-loss rates to separate natural and oil-related erosion and land loss. Oiling caused significant increases in land losses, particularly along reaches of heavy oiling (>20% oil cover). For reaches with >= 20% oiling, land loss rates increased abruptly during the 2010-2013 period, and the loss rates during this period are significantly different from both the pre-oiling (p < 0.0001) and 2013-2016 post-oiling periods (p < 0.0001). The pre-oiling and 2013-2016 post-oiling periods exhibit no significant differences in land loss rates across oiled and non-oiled reaches (p = 0.557). We conclude that oiling increased land loss by more than 50%, but that land loss rates returned to background levels within 3-6 years after oiling, suggesting that oiling results in a large but temporary increase in land loss rates along the shoreline.																	1932-6203					AUG 2	2017	12	8							e0181197	10.1371/journal.pone.0181197								WOS:000406768200019	28767649					
J	Mo, Y; Kearney, MS; Riter, JCA				Mo, Yu; Kearney, Michael S.; Riter, J. C. Alexis			Post-Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Monitoring of Louisiana Salt Marshes Using Landsat Imagery	REMOTE SENSING												The Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the second largest marine oil spill in history, contaminated over a thousand kilometers of coastline in the Louisiana salt marshes and seriously threatened this valuable ecosystem. Measuring the impacts of the oil spill over the large and complex coast calls for the application of remote sensing techniques. This study develops a method for post-Deepwater Horizon oil spill monitoring of the damaged marsh vegetation using Landsat imagery. This study utilizes 10 years of Landsat data, from 2005 to 2014, to examine the longevity of the oil spill's impacts on the marsh vegetation. AVIRIS data collected between 2010 and 2012 are used to validate the Landsat results. Landsat imagery documents the significant effect of oiling on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of the marsh vegetation in 2010 and 2011 (p < 0.01 in both cases). These results are corroborated by the AVIRIS data, which recorded the most severe impact in May 2011 followed by progressive recovery in October 2011 and October 2012. The Landsat imagery, combined with relevant environmental information and appropriate statistical tools, provides a robust and low-cost method for long-term post-oil spill monitoring of the marshes, revealing that the major aboveground impacts (at 30 m scale) of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on Louisiana salt marshes lasted for two years. The method presented is applicable for other hazardous events whenever pre-event referencing and long-term post-event monitoring are desired, thereby offering an effective and economical tool for disaster management.																	2072-4292					JUN	2017	9	6							547	10.3390/rs9060547								WOS:000404623900038

A large number of wetland databases have been established in the world as well as in China. In this paper, we review China's wetland databases based on remote sensing (RS) technology after introducing the background theory to the application of RS technology in wetland surveys. A key conclusion is that China's wetland databases are far from sufficient in fulfilling protection and management needs. Our recommendations focus on the use of the hyper-spectral imagery, microwave data, multi-temporal images, and automatic classifications in order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of wetland inventory. Further, attention should also be paid to detect major biophysical features of wetlands and build wetland databases in years after the 1980s in China. Considering that great gap exists between RS experts and wetland experts, further cooperation between wetland scientists and RS scientists are needed to promote the application of RS in the foundation of wetland databases.																	1002-0063	1993-064X				JUN	2017	27	3					374	388		10.1007/s11769-017-0872-z								WOS:000404173000004						
J	Mo, Y; Kearney, M; Momen, B				Mo, Yu; Kearney, Michael; Momen, Bahram			Drought-associated phenological changes of coastal marshes in Louisiana	ECOSPHERE												Drought poses serious threats to the valuable coastal marsh ecosystems, especially considering that the frequency, intensity, and acuteness of drought may increase with prospective climate change. We study the drought-associated phenological changes of Louisiana coastal marshes through combining remote sensing-derived phenological record (i.e., Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, or NDVI) and field-based environmental data during the past 30 yr. We find that drought condition in southeast Louisiana is characterized by decreased discharge of the Mississippi River and reduced precipitation, which correlate with the continental weather patterns over the conterminous United States influenced by La Nina. The peak NDVI day of saline marshes delays for two months (P < 0.01), from mid-July to mid-September, and their growth duration consequently shortens for two months (P < 0.01) in drought years. Such phenological changes might result from the inhibition of the growth of Spartina alterniflora, a dominant species in saline marshes whose biomass peaks earlier than the coexisting species, perhaps due to reduced freshwater input and increased water deficit. Drought might also cause Spartina dieback via similar mechanisms. Our results underline the correlation between drought in southeast Louisiana and La Nina and highlight the sensitivity of saline marshes to drought, thereby providing valuable information for coastal marsh management and conservation facing climate change.																	2150-8925					MAY	2017	8	5							e01811	10.1002/ecs2.1811								WOS:000402472300022

Cole; Raposa, Kenneth B.; Ferguson, Wenley S.; Ruddock, Kevin; Watson, Elizabeth Burke			Development and Application of a Method to Identify Salt Marsh Vulnerability to Sea Level Rise	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Wetlands are commonly assessed for ecological condition and biological integrity using a three-tiered framework of landscape-scale assessment, rapid assessment protocols, and intensive biological and physiochemical measurements. However, increased inundation resulting from accelerated sea level rise (SLR) is negatively impacting tidal marsh ecosystem functions for US Northeast coastal wetlands, yet relative vulnerability to this stressor is not incorporated in condition assessments. This article assesses tools available to measure coastal wetland vulnerability to SLR, including measurements made as part of traditional rapid condition assessments (e.g., vegetation communities, soil strength), field and remote sensing-based measurements of elevation, VDatum, and Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) model outputs. A vulnerability metric that incorporates these tools was calibrated and validated using recent rates of marsh vegetation losses (1972-2011) as a surrogate for future vulnerability. The metric includes complementary measures of elevation capital, including the percentage of high vs. low marsh vegetation, Spartina alterniflora height, elevation measurements, and SLAMM outputs that collectively explained 62% of the variability in recent rates of marsh vegetation loss. Stepwise regression revealed that all three elements (elevation, vegetation measures, and SLAMM outputs) explained significant and largely unique components of vulnerability to SLR, with the greatest level of overlap found between SLAMM outputs and elevation metrics. While soil strength varied predictably with habitat zone, it did not contribute significantly to the vulnerability metric. Despite the importance of determining wetland elevation above key tidal datums of mean sea level and mean high water, we caution that VDatum was found to perform poorly in back-barrier estuaries. This factor makes it difficult to compare elevation capital among marshes that differ in tidal range and poses accuracy problems for broad-scale modeling efforts that require accurate tidal datums. Given the pervasive pattern of coastal wetland drowning occurring in the Northeastern USA and elsewhere, we advocate that compilation of regional data on marsh habitats and vulnerability to SLR is crucial as it permits agencies to target adaptation to sites based on their vulnerability or mixture of habitats, it helps match sites to appropriate interventions, and it provides a broader regional context to site-specific management actions. Without such data, adaptation actions may be implemented where action is not necessary and to the disadvantage of vulnerable sites where opportunities for successful adaptation will be missed.

They play a key role in alleviating floods and filtering polluted water and also provide habitats for many plants and animals. Wetlands also interact with climate change. Over the past 50 years, wetlands have been polluted and declined dramatically as land cover has changed in some regions. Remote sensing has been the most useful tool to acquire spatial and temporal information about wetlands. In this paper, seven types of sensors were reviewed: aerial photos coarse-resolution, medium-resolution, high-resolution, hyperspectral imagery, radar, and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. This study also discusses the advantage of each sensor for wetland research. Wetland research themes reviewed in this paper include wetland classification, habitat or biodiversity, biomass estimation, plant leaf chemistry, water quality, mangrove forest, and sea level rise. This study also gives an overview of the methods used in wetland research such as supervised and unsupervised classification and decision tree and object-based classification. Finally, this paper provides some advice on future wetland remote sensing. To our knowledge, this paper is the most comprehensive and detailed review of wetland remote sensing and it will be a good reference for wetland researchers.

J	Wu, WT; Zhou, YX; Tian, B				Wu, Wen-ting; Zhou, Yun-xuan; Tian, Bo			Coastal wetlands facing climate change and anthropogenic activities: A remote sensing analysis and modelling application	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Under high-intensity anthropogenic activities and accelerated climate change globally, estuarine and coastal wetland ecosystems (ECWEs) are facing the great challenge of surviving the destructive effects brought about by human activities and sea level rise (SLR). In this study, time -series Landsat images and object -oriented classifications were adopted to monitor the trends and status of ECWEs in the PNA (Pudong New Area) of Shanghai from 1989 to 2013. To study landward and seaward threats to the ECWEs, two types of models were employed to simulate the dynamics of the ECWEs at different time scales. A Markov Chain model and CLUE-S (Conversion of Land Use and its Effects at a Small regional extent) were used to assess the impact of anthropogenic activities on the ECWEs from the landward direction in 2025. Additionally, SLAMM (Sea Level Affecting Saltmarsh Model) was utilized to evaluate the influence of SLR on the ECWEs from the seaward direction in 2100. The results showed that (1) more than 15,000 ha of the ECWEs were lost or degraded from 1989 to 2013 and (2) most of the ECWEs were transformed into drained lands for agriculture, aquaculture, or industrial or residential use under the rapid expansion of the city. Moreover, 54% of the agricultural land was converted to built-up areas or other uses. (3) The loss of agricultural land and increase in built-up areas will continue in the short-term future (up to 2025), and the sprawl of the built-up areas will extend in every direction in the PNA. (4) As modelled by the process -based SLAMM, the landscape changes in the ECWEs will be slight due to SLR by the end of the century, rather than distinct erosion in tidal flats being caused by SLR. In summary, driven by different forces, the ECWEs will be altered greatly and threatened by the impact of human activities and SLR from landward and seaward directions. On a short-term time scale, human activities will play a more important role in the modification and evolution of the ECWEs through direct exploitation of and interference with the structure and biogeochemical processes of the ECWEs. However, on a long-term time scale, the accelerated SLR will cause the continuous narrowing of the ECWEs. Considering the blockade due to the construction of dikes along the shoreline, destructive effects will influence the ECWEs, despite the feedback among the dominant plant species, geomorphology and hydrology.

Self-organized patchiness of vegetation can often give rise to power law relationships in the frequency distribution of vegetation patch sizes. In cases where the whole distribution does not follow a power law, the variance of scale in its tail may often be disregarded. The deviation from power laws represents stochastic effect that can be hybridized on the basis of a Fuzzy Bayesian (FB) generative algorithm, to emphasize the influence of different physical and climatic variables on the patch size distribution to detect tipping point of the ephemeral life of a salt marsh under frequent disturbance events. Using remote sensing observations, we investigate the statistical distribution of spatial vegetation patterns controlled by changes in environmental variables acting on salt marshes, and we speculate the conditions under which a shift from a scale-invariant (power law) distribution to patterns characterized by a dominant patch size could be expected using channel sinuosity as a parameter. Our results show that the hybrid model without considering channel sinuosity can only detect the pure power law exponent, while considering channel sinuosity detects the exponent in the tail of the patch size distribution. Thus the evolution of vegetation patches (under power law) detected by the hybrid model considering channel sinuosity can then be used to forecast potential deviation from steady states in intertidal systems, taking into account the climatic and hydrological regimes.

Marsh Loss Due to Cumulative Impacts of Hurricane Isaac and the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill in Louisiana	REMOTE SENSING												Coastal ecosystems are greatly endangered due to anthropogenic development and climate change. Multiple disturbances may erode the ability of a system to recover from stress if there is little time between disturbance events. We evaluated the ability of the saltmarshes in Barataria Bay, Louisiana, USA, to recover from two successive disturbances, the DeepWater Horizon oil spill in 2010 and Hurricane Isaac in 2012. We measured recovery using vegetation indices and land cover change metrics. We found that after the hurricane, land loss along oiled shorelines was 17.8%, while along oil-free shorelines, it was 13.6% within the first 7 m. At a distance of 7-14 m, land loss from oiled regions was 11.6%, but only 6.3% in oil-free regions. We found no differences in vulnerability to land loss between narrow and wide shorelines; however, vegetation in narrow sites was significantly more stressed, potentially leading to future land loss. Treated oiled regions also lost more land due to the hurricane than untreated regions. These results suggest that ecosystem recovery after the two disturbances is compromised, as the observed high rates of land loss may prevent salt marsh from establishing in the same areas where it existed prior to the oil spill.

Distribution and Drivers of a Widespread, Invasive Wetland Grass, Phragmites australis, in Wetlands of the Great Salt Lake, Utah, USA	WETLANDS												The introduced grass Phragmites australis (hereafter Phragmites) is one of the most widespread invasive plants in North American wetlands. Phragmites has been extensively studied in some regions of North America, such as the Chesapeake Bay and the Great Lakes. However, little research has evaluated the extent of Phragmites invasion in the Intermountain West and the environmental drivers that have promoted its spread, particularly in the critically important Great Salt Lake (GSL) wetlands. Here we use high-resolution multispectral imagery to map the current distribution of Phragmites around GSL. We then identify factors associated with Phragmites presence in GSL using a species distribution model using the Random Forest algorithm. We contrast these findings with what is known about Phragmites invasion in other regions. We estimate that Phragmites occupies over 93 km(2) around GSL. Phragmites was more likely to be found in wetland areas close to point sources of pollution, at lower elevations with prolonged inundation, and with moderate salinities. Results from our study will assist wetlands managers in prioritizing areas for Phragmites monitoring and control by identifying likely areas of prime Phragmites habitat.

These man-made wetlands maintain some of the ecological functions of natural wetlands in spite of their artificial character: their suitability as complimentary waterbird habitat is well documented. In cases of wetlands composed of mixed natural and man-made areas, similarities in substrate-vegetation-water compositions may pose challenges in the applicability of remote sensing and GIS techniques for the study of landscape changes, requiring tailor-made, case-specific methods. We explored this supposition by testing these techniques for the study of the Bahia de Cadiz Nature Park (Spain). Using Landsat imagery spanning the 1985-2011 period, natural and man-made marsh areas were classified separately and results merged to produce land cover classification maps. Different change dynamics were observed for the natural and man-made areas, the latter exhibiting prominent changes, including widespread vegetative succession. Further, through the overlay of ancillary land use data for 2011, an integrated land use and cover map was produced for this year. Different scenarios arising from the abandonment of extractive activity and structural negligence were highlighted. Furthermore, a methodological framework for the classification of predominantly man-made wetlands was designed. The method is cost-effective and open for integration of additional datasets, and is considered a beneficial input to conservation and land use management. Its applicability for monitoring of landscape change not only pertains to the study area, but also extends to other coastal wetland areas of a similar nature.					perez-hurtado, alejandro/0000-0002-3524-4107; CAMILLERI, SARAH/0000-0003-0107-993X												0923-4861	1572-9834				FEB	2017	25	1					23	43		10.1007/s11273-016-9500-4								WOS:000394165100003						
J	Miller, GJ; Morris, JT; Wang, CZ				Miller, Gwen J.; Morris, James T.; Wang, Cuizhen			Mapping salt marsh dieback and condition in South Carolina's North Inlet-Winyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve using remote sensing	AIMS ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Marsh dieback, or brown marsh, occurs when areas of salt marsh vegetation either thin or completely die. The exact extent and locations of marsh dieback are often unknown due to the difficulty accessing salt marshes for in-field observations. Remote sensing provides a synoptic view of earth surfaces and helps to highlight vegetation thinning or loss covering large spatial areas. In 2002-2003 there was a marsh dieback event that affected South Carolina. While most research focused on causes of the event, its extent has not been mapped. Using satellite data to extract the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for years between 1999 and 2003, this study calculated the change in vegetation greenness of the North Inlet salt marsh in Georgetown, South Carolina. Results showed where the marsh vegetation increased or was lost/thinned. The northern section of the marsh experienced the most vegetation decline, while the southern end of the mash experienced a gain in vegetation. The region with the least amount of vegetation decline occurred within mid elevations of the marsh. It is likely that the vegetation within higher elevations experienced stress due to hypersalinity, while vegetation within the lower marsh experienced stress from hypoxia leading to increased rates of vegetation decline in these zones. The elevation of AIMS Environmental Science Volume 4, Issue 5, 677-689. marshes in the northern section is low, and a significant decline in NDVI there may signal a decline in marsh health due to rising sea level.																	2372-0344	2372-0352					2017	4	5					677	689		10.3934/environsci.2017.5.677								WOS:000418645800003

We used monitoring of salt marsh vegetation and substrate for 3years after the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake (M-W 6.2) to document the biological response to vertical deformation, to provide estimates of the amount of uplift and subsidence and ground-truth remote sensing data. Comparison of vegetation-derived vertical deformation with estimates from remote-sensing techniques (Light Detection and Ranging, Global Positioning System and Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) shows good agreement at sites where several decimetres of vertical movement occurred, and less agreement where smaller amounts of vertical movement occurred and/or where vegetation-monitoring sites were affected by differential movement of artificial structures such as roads and breakwaters. Biological and sedimentological changes observed in salt marshes around the Avon-Heathcote Estuary/Ihutai (AHEI) as a result of the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake are likely to be preserved as subtle geological signatures in restricted locations around the AHEI.

The dynamic nature of the coast makes it difficult to clearly define the borders of coastal zones. Sometimes these zones are referred to as tidewater areas, extending from the coast to approximately 10 miles inland. Ketchum defined a coastal zone as the band of dry land and adjacent ocean space (water and submerged land) in which terrestrial processes and land uses directly affect oceanic processes and uses and vice versa (Ketchum BH, The water's edge: critical problems of the Coastal zone. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1972). Coastal zones are one of the most ecologically valuable and biodiverse regions in the world. They provide food, freshwater and other marine products for human beings, as well as play an important role in the local environment. However, human activities and global climate change have given rise to natural disasters that threaten coastal zones environmental security. In particular, the effect of industrial projects on coastal zones is worsening. Thus, it is important to study these areas to provide guidance for coastal resource management and environmental protection. Numerous researchers have attempted to monitor coastal zone dynamics based on remote sensing data. In this chapter, we summarize various topics concerning the application of remote sensing in coastal zones. We focus on describing several new methods, including coastline automatic extraction, intertidal zone identification, coastal wetland classification and coastal invasive plant detection, using remote sensing.																	2211-0577		978-3-319-42710-2; 978-3-319-42708-9				2017	18						169	203		10.1007/978-3-319-42710-2_8	10.1007/978-3-319-42710-2							WOS:000399043100009

Monitoring salt crusts on an AMD contaminated coastal wetland using hyperspectral Hyperion data (Estuary of the River Odiel, SW Spain)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The aim of this work is to establish preliminary spectral trends focused on the development of salt crusts in the marsh located at the mouth of the River Odiel (SW Spain) based on maps from archive Hyperion data. Temporal monitoring of salt efflorescence on the marshes at the mouth of the contaminated river is carried out using hyperspectral space imagery. Climate variability relationships are made based on well-known spectral features related to vegetation and shallow water, using both archive spectral libraries and field local spectra. The observations point to spectral and geomorphological indicators related to salt crust development that can be monitored through image processing supported by field and laboratory spectral data, on a repeatable basis. Future mapping of a larger sequence of images under different climate regimes and wider tidal ranges would improve the estimation of spectral features and thus ensure routine monitoring of salt crusts with hyperspectral data. The study of acid and salt environments, which limit biota development, could be improved by monitoring that employs hyperspectral remote sensing as a useful tool.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2017	38	12					3735	3762		10.1080/01431161.2017.1302621								WOS:000397995500014

Human encroachment, including land reclamation, drainage, and introduction of invasive species, has direct negative effects on wetlands, mainly through changes in hydrology and vegetation. Additionally, accelerated sea level rise (SLR) can result in flooding of wetlands in low-lying coastal zones. In this study, we present a rapid risk assessment method for coastal wetland loss and degradation. The main stress factors, i.e., urban sprawl, agriculture, coastal erosion, and SLR, have been examined and quantified through remote sensing and geographic information system spatial analysis. A weighted factor-based linear model has been used to evaluate the spatial risk levels of wetland loss. The proposed methodology is applied to the low-lying coastal wetlands of Hangzhou Bay in Shanghai, China. The results show that the regions closer to the sea have relatively higher risk levels on the landward side of the coastline, but relatively low risk levels on the seaward side of the coastline. This work emphasizes the need to sustainably use and protect wetlands in order to reduce disaster risks and contribute to the improvement of human well-being.																	1080-7039	1549-7860					2017	23	1					82	97		10.1080/10807039.2016.1223536								WOS:000393700200007

In this study, the ability of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) discrete light detection and ranging (lidar) was investigated for modeling both the canopy height and fractional cover in Hulunber grassland ecosystem. The extracted mean canopy height, maximum canopy height, and fractional cover were used to estimate the aboveground biomass. The influences of flight height on lidar estimates were also analyzed. The main findings are: (1) the lidar-derived mean canopy height is the most reasonable predictor of aboveground biomass (R-2 = 0.340, root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 81.89 g.m(-2), and relative error of 14.1%). The improvement of multiple regressions to the R-2 and RMSE values is unobvious when adding fractional cover in the regression since the correlation between mean canopy height and fractional cover is high; (2) Flight height has a pronounced effect on the derived fractional cover and details of the lidar data, but the effect is insignificant on the derived canopy height when the flight height is within the range (<100 m). These findings are helpful for modeling stable regressions to estimate grassland biomass using lidar returns.

We flew in tandem a CASI-1500 (368-1052 nm) and an AHS (430-13,000 nm) airborne sensors in an area with presence of S. densiflora. We simplified the processing of hyperspectral data (no atmospheric correction and no data-reduction techniques) to test if these treatments were necessary for accurate S. densiflora detection in the area. We tested several statistical signal detection algorithms implemented in ENVI software as spectral target detection techniques (matched filtering, constrained energy minimization, orthogonal subspace projection, target-constrained interference minimized filter, and adaptive coherence estimator) and compared them to the well-known spectral angle mapper, using spectra extracted from ground-truth locations in the images. The target S. densiflora was easy to detect in the marshes by all algorithms in images of both sensors. The best methods (adaptive coherence estimator and target-constrained interference minimized filter) on the best sensor (AHS) produced 100% discrimination (Kappa = 1, AUC = 1) at the study site and only some decline in performance when extrapolated to a new nearby area. AHS outperformed CASI in spite of having a coarser spatial resolution (4-m vs. 1-m) and lower spectral resolution in the visible and near-infrared range, but had a better signal to noise ratio. The larger spectral range of AHS in the short-wave and thermal infrared was of no particular advantage. Our conclusions are that it is possible to use hyperspectral sensors to map the early spread S. densiflora in the Guadalquivir River marshes. AHS is the most suitable airborne hyperspectral sensor for this task and the signal processing techniques target-constrained interference minimized filter (TCIMF) and adaptive coherence estimator (ACE) are the best performing target detection techniques that can be employed operationally with a simplified processing of hyperspectral images.

Forecasting tidal marsh elevation and habitat change through fusion of Earth observations and a process model	ECOSPHERE												Reducing uncertainty in data inputs at relevant spatial scales can improve tidal marsh forecasting models, and their usefulness in coastal climate change adaptation decisions. The Marsh Equilibrium Model (MEM), a one-dimensional mechanistic elevation model, incorporates feedbacks of organic and inorganic inputs to project elevations under sea-level rise scenarios. We tested the feasibility of deriving two key MEM inputs-average annual suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and aboveground peak biomass-from remote sensing data in order to apply MEM across a broader geographic region. We analyzed the precision and representativeness (spatial distribution) of these remote sensing inputs to improve understanding of our study region, a brackish tidal marsh in San Francisco Bay, and to test the applicable spatial extent for coastal modeling. We compared biomass and SSC models derived from Landsat 8, DigitalGlobe WorldView-2, and hyperspectral airborne imagery. Landsat 8-derived inputs were evaluated in a MEM sensitivity analysis. Biomass models were comparable although peak biomass from Landsat 8 best matched field-measured values. The Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer SSC model was most accurate, although a Landsat 8 time series provided annual average SSC estimates. Landsat 8-measured peak biomass values were randomly distributed, and annual average SSC (30 mg/L) was well represented in the main channels (IQR: 29-32 mg/L), illustrating the suitability of these inputs across the model domain. Trend response surface analysis identified significant diversion between field and remote sensing-based model runs at 60 yr due to model sensitivity at the marsh edge (80-140 cm NAVD88), although at 100 yr, elevation forecasts differed less than 10 cm across 97% of the marsh surface (150-200 cm NAVD88). Results demonstrate the utility of Landsat 8 for landscape-scale tidal marsh elevation projections due to its comparable performance with the other sensors, temporal frequency, and cost. Integration of remote sensing data with MEM should advance regional projections of marsh vegetation change by better parameterizing MEM inputs spatially. Improving information for coastal modeling will support planning for ecosystem services, including habitat, carbon storage, and flood protection.

Groundwater seepage controls salinity in a hydrologically terminal basin of semi-arid northwest Australia	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Very small groundwater outflows have the potential to significantly impact the hydrochemistry and salt accumulation processes of notionally terminal basins in arid environments. However, this limited groundwater outflow can be very difficult to quantify using classical water budget calculations due to large uncertainties in estimates of evaporation and evapotranspiration rates from the surface of dry lake beds. In this study, we used a dimensionless time evaporation model to estimate the range of groundwater outflow required to maintain salinity levels observed at the Fortescue Marsh (FM), one of the largest wetlands of semi-arid northwest Australia (similar to 1100 km(2)). The groundwater outflow from aquifers underlying the FM to the Lower Fortescue catchment is constrained by an extremely low hydraulic gradient of <0.0001 and a small 'alluvial outlet' of 0.35 km2 because of relatively high bedrock elevation. However, FM groundwater salinity is far below saturation with respect to halite (TDS < 160 g/L), episodic flood water is fresh to brackish, and salt efflorescences are very sparse and evident only when the FM is dry. We show that if the FM was 100% "leakage free" i.e., a true terminal basin, groundwater would have achieved halite saturation (>300 g/L) after similar to 45 ka. We calculated that only a very small seepage of similar to 2G L/yr (similar to 0.03% of the FM water volume) is sufficient to maintain current salinity conditions. The minimum time required to develop the current hydrochemical groundwater composition under the FM ranges from similar to 60 to similar to 165 ka. We conclude that a dimensionless time evaporation model versus inflow over outflow ratio model is likely more suitable than classical water budget calculations for determining outflow from large saline lakes and to estimate groundwater seepage from hydrologically terminal basins.

The main objective of the present study is to evaluate the spatial variability of SOC and OCD using geostatistics model as well as field methods at Sagar Island (Sundarban), India. Soil samples at the depths of 0-20 cm were collected from twenty plots at different season to estimate organic carbon concentrations and carbon density in the laboratory. Spatial distributions of SOC and OCD concentrations were estimated using ordinary kriging method. Remote sensing imagery and ground truth helped in identifying different features as well as land use/land cover correctly. Landuse are characterized by coastal water, sand, coastal wetland, salt marsh, agricultural fallow land, sparse vegetation, crop/paddy field, and mixed settlement area. The average value SOC were recorded as 2.80, 1.83, and 2.069 % in post-monsoon, pre-monsoon and monsoon season respectively. Semivariograms models of SOC and OCD in all seasons illustrated strong positive nugget values indicated short scale variability and sampling error. The coefficient of determination (R-2) of the SOC model denoted as 0.71, 0.68 and 0.74 and for OCD calculated as 0.78, 0.67 and 0.83 at pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon season respectively. The results illustrated that mangrove forest portrayed highest amount of SOC concentration in both the pre-monsoon (1.05 kg/m(2)) and post-monsoon (0.94 kg/m(2)) season.																	2366-3286	2366-3294				OCT	2016	24	5					503	514		10.1007/s41324-016-0048-4								WOS:000413299000001

Mapping changing distributions of dominant species in oil-contaminated salt marshes of Louisiana using imaging spectroscopy	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The April 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill was the largest coastal spill in U.S. history. Monitoring subsequent change in marsh plant community distributions is critical to assess ecosystem impacts and to establish future coastal management priorities. Strategically deployed airborne imaging spectrometers, like the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), offer the spectral and spatial resolution needed to differentiate plant species. However, obtaining satisfactory and consistent classification accuracies over time is a major challenge, particularly in dynamic intertidal landscapes. Here, we develop and evaluate an image classification system for a time series of AVIRIS data for mapping dominant species in a heavily oiled salt marsh ecosystem. Using field-referenced image endmembers and canonical discriminant analysis (CDA), we classified 21 AVIRIS images acquired during the fall of 2010, 2011 and 2012. Classification results were evaluated using ground surveys that were conducted contemporaneously to AVIRIS collection dates. We analyzed changes in dominant species cover from 2010 to 2012 for oiled and non-oiled shorelines. CDA discriminated dominant species with a high level of accuracy (overall accuracy = 82%, kappa = 0.78) and consistency over three imaging dates (overall(2010) = 82%, overall(2011) = 82%, overall(2012) = 88%). Marshes dominated by Spartina alterniflora were the most spatially abundant in shoreline zones (<= 28 m from shore) for all three dates (2010 = 79%, 2011 = 61%, 2012 = 63%), followed by Juncus roemerianus (2010 = 11%, 2011 = 19%, 2012 = 17%) and Distichlis spicata (2010 = 4%, 2011 = 10%, 2012 = 7%). Marshes that were heavily contaminated with oil exhibited variable responses from 2010 to 2012. Marsh vegetation classes converted to a subtidal, open water class along oiled and non-oiled shorelines that were similarly situated in the landscape. However, marsh loss along oil-contaminated shorelines doubled that of non-oiled shorelines. Only S. alterniflora dominated marshes were extensively degraded, losing 15% (354,604 m(2)) cover in oiled shoreline zones, suggesting that S. alterniflora marshes may be more vulnerable to shoreline erosion following hydrocarbon stress, due to their landscape position.

Assessment of soil salinity, especially at the landscape scale, is critical to coastal management and restoration. Two data from OLI/TIRS and ETM+ sensors of Landsat satellite were used to compare their ability to invert the spatial pattern of soil salinity in both farmland and salt marsh landscapes in the Yellow River Delta, China, respectively. The results showed that the in situ electrical conductivity (EC (a) ) of soil, representing soil salinity, were closely related with spectral parameters and salinity indices calculated by the remote sensing data. The results of multiple regression models have showed that nearly all the spectral parameters and salinity indices calculated by OLI/TRIS data were more sensitive to soil salinity than those by ETM+ data. Therefore, the models based on OLI/TIRS data are superior to those on ETM+ data in estimating the spatial pattern of soil salinity in farmland and salt marsh landscapes. Our results were very helpful to evaluate the levels of soil salinization in the Yellow River Delta.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				AUG	2016	20	4					271	279		10.1007/s11852-016-0437-9								WOS:000379584400001

S. alterniflora is a foundation species, whose loss decreases ecosystem services and potentiates ecosystem state change. Long-term records of the potential environmental drivers of dieback such as precipitation and tidal inundation did not evidence any particular anomalies, although Hurricane Isabel in fall 2003 may have been related to dieback. Transects were established across the interface between the dieback area and apparently healthy areas of marsh. Plant condition was classified based on ground cover within transects as dieback, intermediate and healthy. Numerous characteristics of S. alterniflora culms within each condition class were assessed including biomass, morphology and spectral attributes associated with photosynthetic pigments. Plants demonstrated evidence of stress in 2004 and 2005 beyond areas of obvious dieback and resilience at a multi-year scale. Resilience of the plants was evident in recovery of ground cover and biomass largely within 3 y, although a small remnant of dieback persisted for 8 y. Culms surviving within the dieback and areas of intermediate impact had modified morphological traits and spectral response that reflected stress. These morphometric and spectral differences among plant cover condition classes serve as guidelines for monitoring of dieback initiation, effects and subsequent recovery. Although a number of environmental and biotic parameters were assessed relative to causation, the reason for this particular dieback remains largely unknown, however.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				AUG	2016	20	4					335	350		10.1007/s11852-016-0445-9								WOS:000379584400008

Leveraging limited information to understand ecological relationships of endangered Florida salt marsh vole	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY												We were able to substantially increase our knowledge of what is likely the least understood endangered terrestrial mammal in the United States, the Florida salt marsh vole (FSMV; Microtus pennsylvanicus dukecampbelli). We developed a predictive landscape model that estimated 264 ha of potential habitat for FSMVs. Evaluating our model, we found voles at 8 of the 36 sites sampled, yielding a model accuracy of 22% for a subspecies that previously was known from only 3 locations. Within areas of potential habitat, FSMVs selected patches of marsh vegetation > 0.49 ha with at least some (>= 16.75% and <= 43.61%) smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) cover. Suggestive of a meta-population dynamic, FSMV activity decreased outside of patches of smooth cordgrass and saltgrass (Distichlis spicata) identified by the predictive landscape model. Our hierarchical approach to studying FSMVs allowed us to leverage a limited amount of data to ultimately produce important ecological information about an endangered species. This approach easily may be adapted to other mammals with similar information needs.																	0022-2372	1545-1542				JUL 25	2016	97	4					1249	1255		10.1093/jmammal/gyw084								WOS:000383262100022

Examination of Abiotic Drivers and Their Influence on Spartina alterniflora Biomass over a Twenty-Eight Year Period Using Landsat 5 TM Satellite Imagery of the Central Georgia Coast	REMOTE SENSING												We examined the influence of abiotic drivers on inter-annual and phenological patterns of aboveground biomass for Marsh Cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, on the Central Georgia Coast. The linkages between drivers and plant response via soil edaphic factors are captured in our graphical conceptual model. We used geospatial techniques to scale up in situ measurements of aboveground S. alterniflora biomass to landscape level estimates using 294 Landsat 5 TM scenes acquired between 1984 and 2011. For each scene we extracted data from the same 63 sampling polygons, containing 1222 pixels covering about 1.1 million m(2). Using univariate and multiple regression tests, we compared Landsat derived biomass estimates for three S. alterniflora size classes against a suite of abiotic drivers. River discharge, total precipitation, minimum temperature, and mean sea level had positive relationships with and best explained biomass for all dates. Additional results, using seasonally binned data, indicated biomass was responsive to changing combinations of variables across the seasons. Our 28-year analysis revealed aboveground biomass declines of 33%, 35%, and 39% for S. alterniflora tall, medium, and short size classes, respectively. This decline correlated with drought frequency and severity trends and coincided with marsh die-backs events and increased snail herbivory in the second half of the study period.

However, some problems of the eco-environment have raised public concern in recent decades. Land use/land cover change (LUCC) has been considered essential reference for studying eco-environment across the world. In the present study, the land use/land cover was divided into natural water, salt marshes, Aeluropus littoralis, natural vegetation, barren land, and desertified land. The LUCC was analyzed using four temporal Landsat images (from around 1975, 1990, 2000, 2010, respectively) and RapidEye images in 2010. Firstly, vegetation degeneration is the most serious problem, and 926.74 km(2) turned into bare land in the past 35 years. The total area of bare land increased mainly occurred during 1975-1990. The area of desertified land increased rapidly from 2000 to 2010. Secondly, wetlands have experienced extreme shrinking; some areas degenerated into salt marshes, subsequently vanished. Salt marsh areas have been continually decreasing and gradually degenerating into saline and alkaline lands and bare land. In relation to the driving forces of LUCC, according to collected data and interpretation results by remote sensing images, the surface water environment is destructive due to three reservoirs impede surface water supplementation to the soil and natural vegetation. In addition, excessive pumping of groundwater occurred in the study area. Based on the local soil profiles of vadose zones and dynamic change of groundwater level, the groundwater flow system is another key factor, which developed along with the spatial distribution of groundwater recharge, runoff, and discharge conditions. Furthermore, large-scale activities connected to the reclamation of commercial farmlands have also promoted the LUCC.

In combination with LiDAR data, we calculated four vegetation indices from 150 Landsat TM images from 1985 to 2011 in order to detect seasonal changes and distinguish them from disturbances due to hurricanes and chilling events in a mangrove-dominated coastal landscape. We found that normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) performed best in identifying both seasonal and event-driven episodic changes. Mangrove responses to chilling and hurricane events exhibited distinct spatial patterns. Severe damage from intense chilling events was concentrated in the interior dwarf and transition mangrove forests with tree heights less than 4 m, while severe damage from intense hurricanes was limited to the mangrove forest near the coast, where tree heights were more than 4 m. It took 4-7 months for damage from intense chilling events and hurricanes to reach their full extent, and took 2-6 yr for the mangrove forest to recover from these -disturbances. There was no significant trend in the vegetation changes represented by NDMI over the -27-yr period, but seasonal signals from both dwarf and fringe mangrove forests were discernible. Only severe damage from hurricanes and intense chilling events could be detected in Landsat images, while damage from weak chilling events could not be separated from the background seasonal change.																	2150-8925					JUN	2016	7	6							e01366	10.1002/ecs2.1366								WOS:000378523100028

Spatial patterns of plant litter in a tidal freshwater marsh and implications for marsh persistence	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												The maintenance of marsh platform elevation under conditions of sea level rise is dependent on mineral sediment supply to marsh surfaces and conversion of above-and belowground plant biomass to soil organic material. These physical and biological processes interact within the tidal zone, resulting in elevation-dependent processes contributing to marsh accretion. Here, we explore spatial pattern in a variable related to aboveground biomass, plant litter, to reveal its role in the maintenance of marsh surfaces. Plant litter persisting through the dormant season represents the more recalcitrant portion of plant biomass, and as such has an extended period of influence on ecosystem processes. We conducted a field and remote sensing analysis of plant litter height, aboveground biomass, vertical cover, and stem density (collectively termed plant litter structure) at a tidal freshwater marsh located within the Potomac River estuary, USA. LiDAR and field observations show that plant litter structure becomes more prominent with increasing elevation. Spatial patterns in litter structure exhibit stability from year to year and correlate with patterns in soil organic matter content, revealed by measuring the loss on ignition of surface sediments. The amount of mineral material embedded within plant litter decreases with increasing elevation, representing an important tradeoff with litter structure. Therefore, at low elevations where litter structure is short and sparse, the role of plant litter is to capture sediment; at high elevations where litter structure is tall and dense, aboveground litter contributes organic matter to soil development. This organic matter contribution has the potential to eclipse that of belowground biomass as the root : shoot ratio of dominant species at high elevations is low compared to that of dominant species at low elevations. Because of these tradeoffs in mineral and organic matter incorporation into soil across elevation gradients, the rate of marsh surface elevation change is remarkably consistent across elevation. Because of the role of plant litter in marsh ecosystem processes, monitoring and assessment of these dynamic geomorphic marsh landscapes might be streamlined through the measurement of plant litter structure, either via LiDAR technologies or field observation.

J	Zheng, ZS; Zhou, YX; Tian, B; Ding, XW				Zheng Zongsheng; Zhou Yunxuan; Tian Bo; Ding Xianwen			The spatial relationship between salt marsh vegetation patterns, soil elevation and tidal channels using remote sensing at Chongming Dongtan Nature Reserve, China	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												The analysis of vegetation-environment relationships has always been a study hotspot in ecology. A number of biotic, hydrologic and edaphic factors have great influence on the distribution of macrophytes within salt marsh. Since the exotic species Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) was introduced in 1995, a rapid expansion has occurred at Chongming Dongtan Nature Reserve (CDNR) in the Changjiang (Yangtze) River Estuary, China. Several important vegetation-environment factors including soil elevation, tidal channels density (TCD), vegetation classification and fractional vegetation cover (FVC) were extracted by remote sensing method combined with field measurement. To ignore the details in interaction between biological and physical process, the relationship between them was discussed at a large scale of the whole saltmarsh. The results showed that Scirpus mariqueter (S. mariqueter) can endure the greatest elevation variance with 0.33 m throughout the marsh in CDNR. But it is dominant in the area less than 2.5 m with the occurrence frequency reaching 98%. S. alterniflora has usually been found on the most elevated soils higher than 3.5 m but has a narrow spatial distribution. The rapid decrease of S. mariqueter can be explained by stronger competitive capacity of S. alterniflora on the high tidal flat. FVC increases with elevation which shows significant correlation with elevation (r=0.30, p < 0.001). But the frequency distribution of FVC indicates that vegetation is not well developed on both elevated banks near tidal channels from the whole scale mainly due to tidal channel lateral swing and human activities. The significant negative correlation (r=-0.20, p < 0.001) was found between FVC and TCD, which shows vegetation is restricted to grow in higher TCD area corresponding to lower elevation mainly occupied by S. mariqueter communities. The maximum occurrence frequency of this species reaches to 97% at the salt marsh with TCD more than 8 m/m(2).																	0253-505X	1869-1099				APR	2016	35	4					26	34		10.1007/s13131-016-0831-z								WOS:000374250700004						
J	Zhu, CM; Zhang, X; Qi, JG				Zhu Changming; Zhang Xin; Qi Jiaguo			Detecting and assessing Spartina invasion in coastal region of China: A case study in the Xiangshan Bay	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												Spartina alterniflora is one of exotic plants along the coastal region in China. It was introduced as an important engineering approach to ecological restoration in the later 1970s. However, owing to its good adaptability and strong reproductive capacity, the introduced species is explosively spreading along the coastal region quickly and resulting in a significant impact on the health and safety of coastal wetland ecosystems. It is imperative to quantify the spatial extent and the rate of S. alterniflora sprawl in order to assess its ecological damages and economic impacts. Remote sensing techniques have been used to address these challenges but large unsuccessful due to mixed spectral properties. In this study, a hybrid method was proposed for S. alterniflora detection using medium resolution remote sensing images by integrating both spatial and spectral features of S. alterniflora. The hybrid method consists of two phases: (1) delineation of intertidal zone as the potential area of S. alterniflora distribution and (2) extraction of S. alterniflora fraction distribution with a mixture pixel analysis. The proposed method was tested at the Xiangshan Bay on the east coastal region of Zhejiang Province, China, and mapped the spatial extent of S. alterniflora with Landsat datasets in the 2003, 2009 and 2014. The results showed that, the S. alterniflora has grown exponentially over past 10 years. In 2003, the total area of S. alterniflora was about 590 hm(2), but quickly reached to 1 745 hm(2) in 2009, and 5 715 hm(2) in 2014. With a rate of approximately 10-folds growth within a decade, the invasive species almost occupied all muddy beaches to become the most dominant coastal salt vegetation in this region. It is believed that the strong biological reproductive capacity was the primary reason for such quick spread and at the same time human reclamation activities were also believed to have facilitated the environmental conditions for S. alterniflora sprawl.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				APR	2016	35	4					35	43		10.1007/s13131-016-0836-7								WOS:000374250700005

Methodology for classification of geographical features with remote sensing images: Application to tidal flats	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Tidal flats generally exhibit ponds of diverse size, shape, orientation and origin. Studying the genesis, evolution, stability and erosive mechanisms of these geographic features is critical to understand the dynamics of coastal wetlands. However, monitoring these locations through direct access is hard and expensive, not always feasible, and environmentally damaging. Processing remote sensing images is a natural alternative for the extraction of qualitative and quantitative data due to their non-invasive nature. In this work, a robust methodology for automatic classification of ponds and tidal creeks in tidal flats using Google Earth images is proposed. The applicability of our method is tested in nine zones with different morphological settings. Each zone is processed by a segmentation stage, where ponds and tidal creeks are identified. Next, each geographical feature is measured and a set of shape descriptors is calculated. This dataset, together with a-priori classification of each geographical feature, is used to define a regression model, which allows an extensive automatic classification of large volumes of data discriminating ponds and tidal creeks against other various geographical features. In all cases, we identified and automatically classified different geographic features with an average accuracy over 90% (89.7% in the worst case, and 99.4% in the best case). These results show the feasibility of using freely available Google Earth imagery for the automatic identification and classification of complex geographical features. Also, the presented methodology may be easily applied in other wetlands of the world and perhaps employing other remote sensing imagery. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, discriminating various types of salt marsh is rather difficult because of their strong spectral similarities. Previous salt marsh mapping studies have focused mainly on high spatial and spectral (i.e., hyperspectral) resolution images combined with auxiliary information; however, the results are often limited to small regions. With a high temporal and moderate spatial resolution, the Chinese HuanJing-1 (HJ-1) satellite optical imagery can be used not only to monitor phenological changes of salt marsh vegetation over short-time intervals, but also to obtain coverage of large areas. Here, we apply HJ-1 satellite imagery to the middle coast of Jiangsu in east China to monitor changes in saltmarsh vegetation cover. First, we constructed a monthly NDVI time-series to classify various types of salt marsh and then we tested the possibility of using compressed time-series continuously, to broaden the applicability of this particular approach. Our principal findings are as follows: (1) the overall accuracy of salt marsh mapping based on the monthly NDVI time-series was 90.3%, which was similar to 16.0% higher than the single-phase classification strategy; (2) a compressed time-series, including NDVI from six key months (April, June-September, and November), demonstrated very little reduction (2.3%) in overall accuracy but led to obvious improvements in unstable regions; and (3) a simple-rule for Spartina alterniflora identification was established using a scene solely from November, which may provide an effective way for regularly monitoring its distribution.

However, rapid changes in the vegetation communities of salt marshes caused by exotic species invasion and plant propagation requires a better understanding of how these shifts affect the landscape-scale variations of gross primary production (GPP). In the Yangtze Estuary of eastern China, we firstly compared 2-years GPP values obtained through eddy covariance measurements, satellite-based estimations and model simulations in two vegetation mixtures consisting of exotic Spartina alterniflora (C-4 plant) and dominant native Phragmites australis and Scirpus spp. (C-3 plants) The results indicated that the low-resolution remote sensing data with light-use efficiency method did not represent well the seasonal course of GPP relative to flux measurements and underestimated the annual amount GPP by 25-32%. In contrast, a detailed process based vegetation model with species-specific parameterizations could identify the proportions of GPP from exotic C-4 and native C-3 vegetation and accurately reproduce the seasonal course and annual amount of GPP in the mixtures. The slopes of the linear regressions between the measured and modeled GPP were close (1.09 and 0.89 for the two mixtures, respectively) to the 1:1 line. To further evaluate the variations in GPP throughout the salt marshes, we coupled high-resolution remote sensing data to the vegetation model by transforming the vegetation index into the leaf area index (LAI) for different species. The coupled model reproduced the spatiotemporal dynamics of GPP in the salt marshes with rapid community change during the period of 2000-2008 and identified the variations of GPP from different species. The simulations indicated that the contribution rate of exotic S. alterniflora to GPP has been greater than that of native species since 2003-2004. Therefore, we suggest that this method is useful for high-resolution estimations of regional GPP in other coastal marshes with invasive S. alterniflora in China. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Relationship Between Biophysical Parameters and Synthetic Indices Derived from Hyperspectral Field Data in a Salt Marsh from Buenos Aires Province, Argentina	WETLANDS												Remote sensing tools allow the environmental evaluation of coastal wetlands at a landscape scale, but a deeper understanding is needed of the interactions between biophysical parameters and the electromagnetic signal. The goal of this work was to analyze and quantify the influence of the aboveground biomass and the Leaf Area Index (LAI) on the spectral response of Spartina densiflora marshes in Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon, Argentina. Spectral reflectance at high resolution was measured in S. densiflora canopies under natural conditions, manipulating standing crop by means of successive harvest. Reflectance data were acquired using a spectroradiometer in visible, near infrared (IR) and shortwave IR bands. Spectral Vegetation Indices (VI) were calculated for each standing crop-LAI situation. Several VI significantly correlated with standing crop and LAI, including indices 1) based on the red-IR edge (IR Index (IRI), 695/760 ratio, Simple Ratio (SR), Red Edge Inflection Point (REIP), and different variations of the Normalized Difference VI (NDVI Rouse, NDVI amber, NDVI NOAA, NDVI Landsat, NDVI Modis), 2) indices based on the sharp change green-IR (green NDVI (GNDVI), 800/550 ratio) and 3) indices with a correction for soil noise (OSAVI: Optimized Soil Adjusted VI (OSAVI), and Modified SAVI (MSAVI). The indices with significant regressions with standing crop and LAI were IRI, NDVIAmber and REIP. The total and green standing crop showed better adjustments than LAI, showing R-2 values of 0.5. These values were obtained with REIP index. Results indicate that LAI and standing crop of S. densiflora stands could be determined from spectral data but estimations should be taken carefully in high biomass scenarios, because of indexes saturation at higher LAI values.

Long-term monitoring of biophysical characteristics of tidal wetlands in the northern Gulf of Mexico - A methodological approach using MODIS	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT					2014 ForestSAT Conference	NOV 04-07, 2014	Riva del Garda, ITALY					Accurate and efficient monitoring is critically important for the effective restoration and conservation of threatened tidal wetlands in the Gulf Coast. The high carbon sequestration potential, habitat for important wildlife and fish, and numerous ecosystem services make these tidal wetlands highly valuable both ecologically and economically to Gulf Coast communities. Our study developed a new methodological approach for mapping biophysical health of coastal tidal wetland habitats in terms of green leaf area index (GLAI), canopy level chlorophyll content (CHL), vegetation fraction (VF), and above ground green biomass (GBM). We measured these biophysical characteristics in tidal wetlands of the northern Gulf of Mexico using a combination of ground data collected from field surveys during the growing seasons of 2010 and 2011 and NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 m and 500 m images. Additionally, we compared and evaluated the performances of both in situ proximal and satellite remote sensing measurements in terms of their potential for mapping the wetland biophysical characteristics. MODIS-based models proved superior at the landscape level compared to models developed from in situ proximal sensing, as species level signals seemed to be diluted at coarser spatial scales. We selected Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI) for MODIS 250 m and Visible Atmospheric Resistant Index (VARI) for MODIS 500 m to map biophysical characteristics of tidal wetlands. Time-series composites and phenological information derived using the MODIS based models captured the impact of the selected disturbances in the last decade on the ecological and physiological status of the tidal wetland habitats in the Gulf Coast. This is the first study to employ MODIS data to analyze the biophysical characteristics of tidal wetlands in the Gulf Coast, which, in turn, has the potential to improve our ability to predict their productivity and carbon sequestration potential. These techniques could also be used to assess the success of previous and ongoing tidal wetland restoration projects, and evaluate the productivity of marshes under threat from developmental activity, sea level rise, and industrial pollution.

Remote Sensing of Submerged Aquatic Vegetation	SEAFLOOR MAPPING ALONG CONTINENTAL SHELVES: RESEARCH AND TECHNIQUES FOR VISUALIZING BENTHIC ENVIRONMENTS	Coastal Research Library											Submerged Aquatic Vegetation (SAV), such as eelgrass, provides important ecological functions including food and habitat for ducks, geese, crabs, fish, clams, and other species. SAV also filters out excess nutrients from storm water that runs off into coastal waters, thus improving water quality. Eelgrass meadows can decrease the damaging effects of waves and reduce shoreline erosion. To protect these vital ecosystems, scientists need to monitor coastal vegetation changes as the sea level continues to rise and the coastal population keeps expanding. New satellites, sensors and data analysis techniques are providing remotely sensed data that are effective for monitoring coastal features and processes. Multispectral and hyperspectral imagers, LiDAR and radar systems are available for mapping coastal marshes, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), coral reefs, beach profiles, water turbidity, chlorophyll concentration and eutrophication. Since coastal ecosystems, such as SAV beds, have high spatial complexity and temporal variability, they must be observed with high spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions. New satellites, carrying sensors with fine spatial (0.4-4 m) or spectral (200 narrow bands) resolution are now more accurately detecting changes in salt marsh and SAV extent, health, productivity and habitat quality. Using time-series of images enables scientists to study the health of SAV and other coastal ecosystems and to determine long-term trends and short-term changes.																	2211-0577		978-3-319-25121-9; 978-3-319-25119-6				2016	13						125	140		10.1007/978-3-319-25121-9_5	10.1007/978-3-319-25121-9							WOS:000376129800006

Different surfaces, as flat sandy areas of contrasted water contents, coastal vegetation (salt marshes), sea surfaces, urban zones, have been investigated to define a general model. Different reflection models have been investigated, like Lommel-Seeliger, Ward, Oren-Nayar, and Hapke laws but either they do not allow to fit specular reflection, or they had too many parameters. The Torrance-Sparrow formulation is the only model that describes the intensity behavior of each representative surface, especially the specular signature of the water surface. This law integrates both diffuse and specular components, the latter being described by a microfacet distribution. Finally, to separate and identify the surfaces, we have established a decomposition method, based on a single microfacet distribution, to characterize, unambiguously, different surfaces.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				JAN	2016	9	1					313	325		10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2510337								WOS:000370541400033

We used remotely-sensed estimates of two aboveground plant characteristics, aboveground biomass and % foliar N to explore biomass allocation in low diversity freshwater impounded peatlands (Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, CA, USA). We developed a hybrid modeling approach to relate remotely-sensed estimates of % foliar N (a surrogate for environmental N and plant available nutrients) and aboveground biomass to field-measured belowground biomass for species specific and mixed species models. We estimated up to 90% of variation in foliar N concentration using partial least squares (PLS) regression of full-spectrum field spectrometer reflectance data. Landsat 7 reflectance data explained up to 70% of % foliar N and 67% of aboveground biomass. Spectrally estimated foliar N or aboveground biomass had negative relationships with belowground biomass and root:shoot ratio in both Schoenoplectus acutus and Typha, consistent with a balanced growth model, which suggests plants only allocate growth belowground when additional nutrients are necessary to support shoot development. Hybrid models explained up to 76% of variation in belowground biomass and 86% of variation in root:shoot ratio. Our modeling approach provides a method for developing maps of spatial variation in wetland belowground biomass.

J	Jung, R; Adolph, W; Ehlers, M; Farke, H				Jung, Richard; Adolph, Winny; Ehlers, Manfred; Farke, Hubert			A multi-sensor approach for detecting the different land covers of tidal flats in the German Wadden Sea - A case study at Norderney	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The tidal flats of the Wadden Sea are a highly dynamic and largely natural ecosystem with high economic and ecological value but which are also at risk due to climate change, rising sea levels, algae blooms, invasive species and marine pollution. There is a need for the detection of emerging changes and the potential loss of the natural or semi-natural ecosystems accompanied by a decrease in water quality. Accessibility both from sea and land is very poor, which makes the monitoring and mapping of tidal flat environments from in situ measurements very difficult In this study, a multi-sensor concept for the classification of intertidal areas in the Wadden Sea is developed. The basis for this method is a combined analysis involving RapidEye (RE) and TerraSAR-X (TSX) satellite data combined with ancillary vector data about the distribution of vegetation, shellfish beds and sediments for the accuracy assessment The overall methodology is based on a hierarchical decision tree. First, the water coverage is separated from the tidal flats by using the normalized difference water index (NDWI). Second, the shellfish beds are estimated with the textural features of the TSX data and morphologic filters (MFs). Third, the classification of vegetation (salt marsh, sea grass/algae) is based on the modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), object-based features and exclusionary criteria. The remaining area is then separated into different sediment types with an algorithm that uses a thresholding technique applied to radiometric values, the MSAVI and a majority filter. The results show that we are able to identify the location and shape of salt marsh and shellfish beds (a true positive rate of 0.63 and a precision of 0.55) by using multi-sensor remote sensing data. A detailed shellfish bed classification can only be done with radar sensors, like TSX. The extraction of the sea grass areas from the multi-sensor approach is difficult Sea grass often grows very sparsely in the study area which, with respect to the spatial resolution of RE, leads to a mixture of the spectral signatures of sediment and sea grass. The classification of the sediment types in tidal flats is a challenge compared to vegetation and shellfish beds. An overall accuracy of 64.53%, 66.85%, 68.22% and 68.2% was achieved. The results emphasize that a sediment-type classification cannot be achieved with high accuracy using spectral properties alone due to their similarity, which is predominately caused by their water content.

Quantifying moderate resolution remote sensing phenology of Louisiana coastal marshes	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Coastal ecosystems are under multiple stresses ranging from global climate change to regional hazardous weather and human interventions. Coastal marshes in Louisiana are inherently vulnerable to these threats because they are microtidal and inhabit a narrow portion of the intertidal zone. Phenological dynamics of the marshes offer valuable information on the stressors' impacts, yet they have rarely been reported or compared. Here, we study the landscape-level phenologies of the marshes under different climatic conditions, using Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) records (30 x 30 m(2) spatial resolution) and a nonlinear mixed model that enables a quantitative analysis of nonlinear and piecewise functions involving repeated measures. In 2007 (a normal year), the Gaussian function was the best phenological model for Louisiana coastal marshes (pseudo R-2 0.56-0.85), showing that: (1) NDVI of all marshes peaked within one month from late July to mid-August; (2) freshwater marshes had the highest peak NDVI, followed by intermediate, brackish, and saline marshes; and (3) saline marshes had the longest growth duration, followed by brackish, and then intermediate and freshwater marshes. Phenological shifts were found in years featuring extreme weather events: (1) a two-month delay in the peak NDVI day of saline marshes in 1999 (a drought year) compared to 2007; and (2) a shortening in growth duration of all marshes by approximately half in 2005 (a hurricane year). This work presents a methodgology to analyze and predict Louisiana coastal marshes' phenological dynamics in response to current and future stresses. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

These ecotones between aquatic and terrestrial environments also provide protection from storm damage, run-off filtering, and recharge of aquifers. Many wetlands along coasts have been exposed to stress-inducing alterations globally, including dredge and fill operations, hydrologic modifications, pollutants, impoundments, fragmentation by roads/ditches, and sea level rise. For wetland protection and sensible coastal development, there is a need to monitor these ecosystems at global and regional scales. Recent advances in satellite sensor design and data analysis are providing practical methods for monitoring natural and man-made changes in wetlands. However, available satellite remote sensors have been limited to mapping primarily wetland location and extent. This paper describes how the HyspIRI hyperspectral and thermal infrared sensors can be used to study and map key ecological properties, such as species composition, biomass, hydrology, and evapotranspiration of tidal salt and brackish marshes and mangroves, and perhaps other major wetland types, including freshwater marshes and wooded/shrub wetlands.

Continuous monitoring bed-level dynamics on an intertidal flat: Introducing novel, stand-alone high-resolution SED-sensors	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Tidal flat morphology is continuously shaped by hydrodynamic forces, resulting in a highly dynamic bed surface. The knowledge of short-term bed-level changes is important both for assessing sediment transport processes as well as for understanding critical ecological processes, such as vegetation recruitment on tidal flats. High frequency bed-level measurements with a high vertical resolution are generally needed for hypothesis testing and numerical model validation. However, conventional manual bed-elevation measurements tend to have a coarse temporal resolution (weeks to months) due to the labor involved. Existing automated methods for continuous monitoring of bed-level changes either lack a high vertical resolution or are very expensive and therefore limited in spatial application. In light of this, we developed a novel instrument called SED (Surface Elevation Dynamics) sensor for continuous monitoring with a high vertical resolution (2 mm). This sensor makes use of light sensitive cells (i.e. phototransistors) and operates stand-alone. The unit cost and the labor in deployments are reduced, facilitating spatial application with a number of units. In this study, a group of SED-sensors is tested on a tidal flat in the Westerschelde Estuary, The Netherlands. The obtained bed-level changes are compared with the data obtained with precise manual measurements using traditional Sedimentation Erosion Bars (SEBs). An excellent agreement between the two methods was obtained, confirming the accuracy and precision of the SED-sensors. Furthermore, to demonstrate how the SED-sensors can be used for measuring short-term bed-level dynamics, two SED-sensors were deployed at two sites with contrasting wave exposure. Daily bed-level changes were obtained including a severe storm event. The difference in observed bed-level dynamics at both sites was statistically explained by their different hydrodynamic conditions. Thus, the stand-alone SED-sensor can be applied to monitor sediment surface dynamics with high vertical and temporal resolution, which provides opportunities to pinpoint morphological responses to various forces in intertidal environment. We expect that this sensor can also be applied in other morphological environments, such as rivers, salt-marsh, beaches and dunes, but the actual applicability remains to be tested. Furthermore, the SED-sensors may also offer opportunities for ground-truthing remote sensing techniques aimed at describing morphological changes. Finally, further improvements in future SED-sensors are discussed, including an inclination and compass sensor, wireless data retrieving function and additional IR-light bar for measurements with poor light availabilities.

Effective LiDAR-based modelling and visualisation of managed retreat scenarios for coastal planning: An example from the southern UK	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												This study presents a visualisation of proposed managed retreat options for a scientifically important estuarine area within the South Downs National Park, United Kingdom. A range of GIS and remote sensing techniques are used to facilitate the manipulation of LiDAR data for landscape visualisation. Landscape and flood modelling methods are incorporated and developed. The extent of inundation and tidal prism are assessed following proposed coastal planning and landscape changes. Ground-truthed LiDAR elevation data are used to model a series of proposed managed retreat scenarios (scenarios A, B, C and D) for the river Cuckmere estuary. Following detailed landscape visualisation and manipulation, a 'pour-point' flood modelling method is used to simulate tidal inundation and calculate the tidal prism for proposed managed retreat scenarios using current tidal data. Further analysis was undertaken to assess the potential impact of sea level rise (for the years 2025, 2050, 2075 and 2100) in this estuarine area if the managed retreat proposals are actioned. The use of GIS-based techniques to alter and visualise landscape features under proposed managed retreat alternatives proved successful. Clear differences in tidal inundation and the tidal prism were observed following the modelling of large scale engineering features. These differences in inundation were apparent both using current tidal data and predicted sea level rise data. The tidal prism was strongly affected by the choice of the managed retreat scenario. Subtle changes in landscape features were shown to strongly affect the water accommodation potential of the estuary. The study demonstrates that high resolution data facilitated the detailed visualisation and modelling of fine-scale landscape change. Furthermore, the alteration of landscape features suggested that the area of inundation could potentially vary by over 20% (>100 ha); and that these landscape changes would noticeably alter tidal impact in this estuary.

Mapping the spread and distribution of S. alterniflora is the first step toward understanding the factors that determine the population expansion patterns. Remote sensing is a promising tool to monitor the expansion of S. alterniflora. Twelve Landsat TM images and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were used to delineate the invasion of S. alterniflora from 1993 to 2009, and SPOT 6 images and Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) were used to map the distribution of S. alterniflora in 2014. In situ data and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images were used as supplementary data. S. alterniflora spread rapidly in Yueqing Bay over the past 21 years. Between 1993 and 2009, the area of S. alterniflora increased by 608 times (from 4 to 2432 ha). The rapid expansion of S. alterniflora covered almost all of the bare mudflats around the mangrove forests and the cultivated mudflats. However, from 2009 to 2014, the rate of expansion of S. alterniflora began to slow down in Yueqing Bay, and the total area of S. alterniflora in Yantian decreased by 275 ha. These phenomena can be explained by the landscape changes and ecological niches. Through the expansion of S. alterniflora, it was found that the ecological significance and environmental impact of S. alterniflora was different in different regions in Yueqing Bay. The conservation plans for Yueqing Bay should consider both the positive and negative effects of S. alterniflora, and the governmental policy should be based on the different circumstances of the regions.																	1932-6203					AUG 11	2015	10	8							e0135538	10.1371/journal.pone.0135538								WOS:000359353300091	26263172

Here, we (1) review the current status of the diversity and distribution of coastal ecosystems in BCS, (2) assess the composition and coverage of these ecosystems in PNAs, and (3) identify coastal ecosystems of special interest for conservation. The combination of spatial analysis techniques was carried out using LandSat TM images and GIS processing, considering ecoregions and ecosystems in the coastal zone, as well as through the application of an ecosystem diversity index. In the BCS coastal zone, 11 ecosystems were identified: scrub, coastal water body, riparian, bare soil, halophyte, beach, salt flat, mangrove, salt marsh, coral reef, and seagrass. The ecosystem diversity in BCS results from the coastal features that differentiate the Pacific and the Gulf coasts. PNAs include 17 % of coastal ecosystems. Bahia Magdalena (Pacific) and Bahia Concepcin (Gulf of California), which are key for conservation (including mangroves and seagrasses), should be considered either for classification as PNAs or for inclusion in coastal management programs. The combination of remote sensing and GIS with biogeographic and ecosystemic approaches in our study enabled to determine ecosystem diversity and set coastal conservation priorities in Baja California Sur, Mexico. Specifically, coastal ecosystems that are not currently included within PNAs and which should be considered as conservation priorities were identified.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				AUG	2015	19	4					609	619		10.1007/s11852-015-0411-y								WOS:000362017900015

Catastrophic shifts between states can be induced by gradual environmental change or by disturbance events. These feedbacks and outcomes are key to the sustainability and resilience of vegetated coastlines, especially as modulated by human activity, sea level rise, and climate change. Whereas multiple stable state theory has been invoked to model salt marsh responses to sediment supply and sea level change, there has been comparatively little empirical verification of the theory for salt marshes or other coastal wetlands. Especially lacking is long-term evidence documenting if or how stable states are established and maintained at ecosystem scales. Laboratory and field-plot studies are informative, but of necessarily limited spatial and temporal scope. For the purposes of long-term, coastal-scale monitoring, remote sensing is the best viable option. This review summarizes the above topics and highlights the emerging promise and challenges of using remote sensing-based analyses to validate coastal wetland dynamic state theories. This significant opportunity is further framed by a proposed list of scientific advances needed to more thoroughly develop the field.

Low water levels predicted for several fluvial systems make wetlands especially vulnerable to the spread of invaders, such as the common reed (Phragmites australis), one of the most invasive species in North America. We developed a model to map the distribution of potential germination grounds of the common reed in freshwater wetlands of the St.Lawrence River (Quebec, Canada) under current climate conditions and used this model to predict their future distribution under two climate change scenarios simulated for 2050. We gathered historical and recent (remote sensing) data on the distribution of common reed stands for model calibration and validation purposes, then determined the parameters controlling the species establishment by seed. A two-dimensional model and the identified parameters were used to simulate the current (2010) and future (2050) distribution of germination grounds. Common reed stands are not widespread along the St.Lawrence River (212ha), but our model suggests that current climate conditions are already conducive to considerable further expansion (>16,000ha). Climate change may also exacerbate the expansion, particularly if river water levels drop, which will expose large bare areas propitious to seed germination. This phenomenon may be particularly important in one sector of the river, where existing common reed stands could increase their areas by a factor of 100, potentially creating the most extensive reedbed complex in North America. After colonizing salt and brackishwater marshes, the common reed could considerably expand into the freshwater marshes of North America which cover several million hectares. The effects of common reed expansion on biodiversity are difficult to predict, but likely to be highly deleterious given the competitiveness of the invader and the biological richness of freshwater wetlands.

Extracting geometric information for tidal creek networks (TCN) geometry from remote sensing is essential to understanding their characteristics, formation, and evolution. Currently, the major obstacles to automated recognition using digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data are low relief, varying widths, high density, strong anisotropy, and complicated patterns. Conventional methods, such as the optimal-elevation threshold method, the optimal-curvature threshold method, and the D8 method, cannot achieve satisfactory performance under these conditions. We propose an automated method for extracting tidal creeks (AMETC) using topographic features detected from LiDAR. Specifically, a multi-window median neighborhood analysis was designed to enhance depressions both in mudflat and marsh environments; a multi-scale and multi-directional Gaussian-matched filtering method was incorporated to enhance width-variant TCs; and a two-stage adaptive thresholding algorithm was implemented to segment low-contrast TCs. The AMETC was tested on two large LiDAR datasets of the Jiangsu coast with different resolutions. The quantitative assessments show that AMETC successfully extracted both small and large TCs from our study areas. The true positive extraction rate reached 95%, outperforming conventional methods. The AMETC is robust and weakly dependent on scale, and rarely requires manual intervention. Further applications suggests that the AMETC has potential for extraction of other types of channel features (e.g., badland networks and ravines). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the last decades, the expansion of agricultural irrigated areas in semiarid Mediterranean catchments has led to altered inputs of water and nutrients to lowland wetlands. Hydrological alterations have affected characteristic plant communities, resulting in the replacement of valuable halophilic salt marsh and salt steppeplant communities by more generalist and opportunistic taxa, such as Phragmites australis (reed beds). A spatio-dynamic model and library were developed that aimed to explain the spatial distribution of three characteristic wetland plant communities in a semiarid Mediterranean wetland site in response to hydrological pressures from the catchment. Wetland plant communities and watershed irrigated agricultural areas were mapped by means of remote sensing at several dates between 1984 and 2008 and were partly used as forcing inputs and validation data. A dynamic model was initially developed using Stella software and then converted into R language by means of the StellaR software. Spatial dimension was added including neighbourhood and spatial flow algorithms representing the dispersion of plant communities. The conversion between plant communities was caused by the increase In water inflows from the watershed, mediated by spatial parameters, such as the distance to ephemeral rivers and the flow accumulation map within the wetland site. Results of the model were in agreement with remote sensing data, showing that in 2008 salt steppe had lost a half of its original area, whereas salt marsh and reed beds expanded extensively. The model developed in this study is available online as an R library, including all necessary input data sets and maps and documentation to run it. The model library offers a flexible tool that suits the needs of both advanced modellers and neophytes. Free and open source software and online code sharing repositories are proposed as modelling tools for future research. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we analyse the relationship between environmental variables estimated by remote sensing and the spatial distribution (presence, abundance and diversity) of seven mosquito species vectors of West Nile and other pathogens (Usutu, avian malaria and dirofilariasis) in the Donana Natural Park, Spain.

We collected mosquitoes once a month from up to 112 locations using BG-Sentinel traps baited with BG-lure and CO2 during March-November 2010. Hydroperiod, NDVI and Inundation surface were estimated at several resolution scales (100, 250, 500, 1000 and 2000 metres) from corrected and normalized Landsat Images. We sampled 972,346 female mosquitoes, the most abundant species being Culex theileri, Ochlerotatus caspius, Culex modestus, Culex perexiguus, Culex pipiens, Anopheles atroparvus and Ochlerotatus detritus. Our results suggest that: (1) hydroperiod, inundation surface and NDVI are strongly related to the spatial distribution of mosquitoes; (2) the spatial scales used to measure these variables affected quantification of these relationships, the larger scale being more informative; (3) these relationships are species-specific; (4) hydroperiod is negatively related to mosquito presence and richness; (5) Culex abundance is positively related to hydroperiod; (6) NDVI is positively related to mosquito diversity, presence and abundance, except in the case of the two salt marsh species (Oc. caspius and Oc. detritus); and (7) inundation surfaces positively condition the abundance and richness of most species except the salt marsh mosquitoes. Remote sensing data provided reliable information for monitoring mosquito populations. Landscape significantly affected mosquito distribution and abundance, and as a result may alter disease risk. These results suggest that while environmental conditions affect the distribution and abundance of mosquitoes, other factors such as human modification of landscapes may give rise to significant changes in mosquito populations and consequently disease risk.

J	Armitage, AR; Highfield, WE; Brody, SD; Louchouarn, P				Armitage, Anna R.; Highfield, Wesley E.; Brody, Samuel D.; Louchouarn, Patrick			The Contribution of Mangrove Expansion to Salt Marsh Loss on the Texas Gulf Coast	PLOS ONE												Landscape-level shifts in plant species distribution and abundance can fundamentally change the ecology of an ecosystem. Such shifts are occurring within mangrove-marsh ecotones, where over the last few decades, relatively mild winters have led to mangrove expansion into areas previously occupied by salt marsh plants. On the Texas (USA) coast of the western Gulf of Mexico, most cases of mangrove expansion have been documented within specific bays or watersheds. Based on this body of relatively small-scale work and broader global patterns of mangrove expansion, we hypothesized that there has been a recent regional-level displacement of salt marshes by mangroves. We classified Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper images using artificial neural networks to quantify black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) expansion and salt marsh (Spartina alterniflora and other grass and forb species) loss over 20 years across the entire Texas coast. Between 1990 and 2010, mangrove area grew by 16.1 km(2), a 74% increase. Concurrently, salt marsh area decreased by 77.8 km(2), a 24% net loss. Only 6% of that loss was attributable to mangrove expansion; most salt marsh was lost due to conversion to tidal flats or water, likely a result of relative sea level rise. Our research confirmed that mangroves are expanding and, in some instances, displacing salt marshes at certain locations. However, this shift is not widespread when analyzed at a larger, regional level. Rather, local, relative sea level rise was indirectly implicated as another important driver causing regional-level salt marsh loss. Climate change is expected to accelerate both sea level rise and mangrove expansion; these mechanisms are likely to interact synergistically and contribute to salt marsh loss.																	1932-6203					MAY 6	2015	10	5							UNSP e0125404	10.1371/journal.pone.0125404								WOS:000354049700066	25946132

The role of elevation, relative sea-level history and vegetation transition in determining carbon distribution in Spartina alterniflora dominated salt marshes	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Spartina alterniflora salt marshes are among the most productive ecosystems on earth, and represent a substantial global carbon sink. Understanding the spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of both above- and below-ground carbon in these wetland ecosystems is especially important considering their potential in carbon sequestration projects, as well as for conservation efforts in the context of a changing climate and rising sea-level. Through the use of extensive field sampling and remote sensing data (Light Detection and Ranging - LiDAR, and aerial images), we sought to map and explain how vegetation biomass and soil carbon are related to elevation and relative sea-level change in a S. altemiflora dominated salt marsh on Galveston Island, Texas. The specific objectives of this study were to: 1) understand the relationship between elevation and the distribution of salt marsh vegetation percent cover, plant height, plant density, above-and below-ground biomass, and carbon, and 2) evaluate the temporal changes in relative sea-level history, vegetation transitions, and resulting changes in the patterns of soil carbon distribution. Our results indicated a clear zonation of terrain and vegetation characteristics (i.e., height, cover and biomass). In the soil profile, carbon concentrations and bulk densities showed significant and abrupt change at a depth of similar to 10-15 cm. This apparent transition in the soil characteristics coincided temporally with a transformation of the land cover, as driven by a rapid increase in relative sea-level around this time at the sample locations. The amounts of soil carbon stored in recently established S. alterniflora intertidal marshes were significantly lower than those that have remained in situ for a longer period of time. Thus, in order to quantify and predict carbon in coastal wetlands, and also to understand the heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of carbon stocks, it is essential to understand not only the elevation, the relative sea-level rise rate, and the vertical accretion rate - but also the history of land cover change and vegetation transition.

The salt marshes in the Liao River Delta of China, dominated by Suaeda heteroptera, experienced a dramatic loss in the 1990s and then recovered in the 2000s. This study investigates these changes of salt marsh using a time series of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images acquired in 1988, 1995, 2000, 2004, 2007, and 2009. The classification tree method was used on these TM images to extract S. heteroptera, and an interactive self-organizing data analysis algorithm was used to determine other land cover types. The conversions between salt marsh and other land cover types were described with conversion matrices. The classification results show that, during 1998-2004, salt marsh decreased dramatically at an average rate of 662.68 ha/y. However, during the period 2004-2009, salt marsh recovered gradually at a rate of 115.51 ha/y. The conversion matrix indicates that, from 1988 to 2004, a large area of former salt marsh was directly replaced by man-made landscape types, such as reed field (5111 ha), aquaculture pond (2655 ha), reservoir (1720 ha), and paddy field (729 ha). In contrast, the result for the period from 2004 to 2009 shows that salt marshes were recovered by the conversion of some areas of former barren beaches and river back to salt marsh. Driving forces analysis suggests that salt marsh dynamics were mainly caused by human activities, with the secondary drivers being climatic warming and dry conditions.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				MAR	2015	31	2					371	377		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-13-00056.1								WOS:000350575300014

Recent advances in understanding Colombian mangroves	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Throughout the last 15 years, researchers at the National University of Colombia at Medellin have studied Colombian mangroves. Remote sensing, pollen analysis of superficial and deep sediments, Holocene coastal vegetation dynamics, sediment dating using C-14 and Pb-210, sampling in temporary plots, sampling in temporary and permanent plots, and other techniques have been applied to elucidate long- and shortterm mangrove community dynamics. The studied root fouling community is structured by several regulatory mechanisms; habitat heterogeneity increases species richness and abundance. Fringe mangroves were related to Ca concentration in the soil and the increased dominance of Laguncularia racemosa and other nonmangrove tree species, while the riverine mangroves were associated with Mg concentration and the dominance of Rhizophora mangle. The seedling and mangrove tree distributions are determined by a complex gradient of natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Mangrove pollen from surface sediments and the existing vegetation and geomorphology are close interrelated. Plant pollen of mangrove and salt marsh reflects environmental and disturbance conditions, and also reveals forest types. Forest dynamics in both coasts and their sensitivity of to anthropogenic processes are well documented in the Late Quaternary fossil record. Our studies of short and long term allow us to predict the dynamics of mangroves under different scenarios of climate change and anthropogenic stress factors that are operating in Colombian coasts. Future research arises from these results on mangrove forests dynamics, sea-level rise at a fine scale using palynology, conservation biology, and carbon dynamics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

As the Changjiang Estuary is located adjacent to the megacity of Shanghai, human activities exert substantial pressures on the coastal wetlands and cause coastal ecosystem degeneration and consequent decreases or loss in ecosystem services. The major stresses from human activities on the coastal wetlands in the Changjiang Estuary include urbanization, reclamation, the introduction of invasive species, overfishing, and environmental pollution. In this chapter, the succession of plant communities in the coastal wetlands of the Changjiang Estuary is described. The spatial and temporal variation of plant communities on salt marshes are analyzed on the basis of remote sensing (RS) and mapping, combined with field inventories of sampling plots. The population expansion of an exotic species, Spartina alterniflora, after its introduction to the coastal wetlands in the Changjiang Estuary in the 1990s, is described and analyzed. The impacts of the invasion of S. alterniflara on benthic communities are examined along intertidal salt marsh gradients, and the invasion history is described. A cellular automaton (CA) model was developed to simulate the expansion of S. alterniflora and to study the interactions between the spatial pattern of expansion and salt marsh vegetation ecosystems. Field experiments and a demonstration project were carried out to control the invasion of S. alterniflora. Finally, this chapter discusses the future development, management, and conservation of coastal wetlands and biodiversity in the Changjiang Estuary.																	2214-1553		978-3-319-16339-0; 978-3-319-16338-3				2015							137	159		10.1007/978-3-319-16339-0_7	10.1007/978-3-319-16339-0							WOS:000373990500009

We model Louisiana salt marshes phenology from 1984-2011 using moderate resolution multispectral remote sensing data (i.e. Landsat imagery). Peak Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), as an indicator of peak biomass, did not show any significant temporal trend. The annual temperature, sea-level, and atmospheric CO2 concentration increased over time, while the annual precipitation shows no temporal trend. Four principal components are calculated from the original environmental variables (what are these?), but r, none of them was significantly correlated with the peak NDVIs. Therefore, it may be concluded that although the marshes' habitat is climatic-sensitive, their peak NDVIs are resilient to climate change. The long-term record of the salt marsh peak NDVI may serve as a baseline for examining effects of other disastrous events.																	2153-6996		978-1-4799-7929-5				2015							1187	1190										WOS:000371696701077

CA models focusing on neighbor effect often failed to account for the influence of environmental factors. This paper proposed a CCA model that enhanced CA model by integrating constrain factors of tidal elevation, vegetation density, vegetation classification, and tidal channels in Chongming Dongtan wetland, China. Meanwhile, a positive feedback loop between vegetation and sedimentation was also considered in CCA model through altering the tidal accretion rate in different vegetation communities. After being validated and calibrated, the CCA model is more accurate than the CA model only taking account of neighbor effect. By overlaying remote sensing classification and the simulation results, the average accuracy increases to 80.75% comparing with the previous CA model. Through the scenarios simulation, the future of Spartina alterniflora expansion was analyzed. CCA model provides a new technical idea and method for salt marsh species expansion and control strategies research.																	1024-123X	1563-5147					2015									875817	10.1155/2015/875817								WOS:000365236000001

Due to its special topography, as they are characterized as salt-marshes, their characterization, both altimetric and volumetric, is quite complex. In this research, Landsat TM and ETM satellite images from the United States Geological Service (USGS) were analyzed for a period of 35 years, which were examined and classified in a certain period of time in order to characterize the dynamic changes (floods and land use changes) in the Tinto Tidal Marshes. The erosion phenomena were studied and analyzed through the use of different DEM and UAV data. All data were integrated into a GIS. Results shown how the forest fires and the oak decline of Quercus are the two processes that accelerate the conversion of forest stands in scrub areas or pastureland. Moreover, the ecological preservation of the Tinto salt-marshes results in a similarity of the volumetric change processes produced in the study periods. Erosion processes are an immediate consequence of the low kinetic energy in the Tinto river and hence of the progressive increase of the negative rate of eroded soil.																	2352-538X		978-94-62520-74-5				2015	9						105	108										WOS:000359721400026

Ecological recovery in an Arctic delta following widespread saline incursion	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Arctic ecosystems are vulnerable to the combined effects of climate change and a range of other anthropogenic perturbations. Predicting the cumulative impact of these stressors requires an improved understanding of the factors affecting ecological resilience. In September of 1999, a severe storm surge in the Mackenzie Delta flooded alluvial surfaces up to 30 km inland from the coast with saline waters, driving environmental impacts unprecedented in the last millennium. In this study we combined field monitoring of permanent sampling plots with an analysis of the Landsat archive (1986-2011) to explore the factors affecting the recovery of ecosystems to this disturbance. Soil salinization following the 1999 storm caused the abrupt dieback of more than 30 000 ha of tundra vegetation. Vegetation cover and soil chemistry show that recovery is occurring, but the rate and spatial extent are strongly dependent on vegetation type, with graminoid- and upright shrub-dominated areas showing recovery after a decade, but dwarf shrub tundra exhibiting little to no recovery over this period. Our analyses suggest that recovery from salinization has been strongly influenced by vegetation type and the frequency of freshwater flooding following the storm. With increased ocean storm activity, rising sea levels, and reduced sea ice cover, Arctic coastal ecosystems will be more likely to experience similar disturbances in the future, highlighting the importance of combining field sampling with regional-scale remote sensing in efforts to detect, understand, and anticipate environmental change.																	1051-0761	1939-5582				JAN	2015	25	1					172	185		10.1890/14-0239.1								WOS:000348667900015	26255366

Evaluation of field-measured vertical obscuration and full waveform lidar to assess salt marsh vegetation biophysical parameters	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Local, high-resolution, accurate data sets are needed to support restoration and other management initiatives in coastal salt marshes, yet field collections of site-specific vegetation data is often impractical. In this study, a novel combination of full-waveform light detection and ranging (lidar) and field techniques for assessing the distribution of aboveground biomass throughout its height and its light blocking properties were investigated. Using new field methods, strong correlations were observed (r > 0.9) between subsamples' vertical biomass (VB), the distribution of vegetation biomass by height, and vertical obscuration (VO), the measure of the vertical distribution of the ratio of vegetation to airspace, for Spartina alterniflora. Also, it was found that simple metrics derived from the lidar waveforms, such as waveform width, can provide new information to estimate salt marsh vegetation parameters. The strong correlations between field-collected biophysical parameters and metrics derived from lidar data suggest that remote sensing methods can be used to estimate some vegetation biophysical parameters such as plant height and proportion of vegetation area (PVA) using smaller, more targeted field surveys. Future work will be needed to verify the extensibility of the methods to other sites and vegetation types.

To recover the increasingly degenerated ecology of the wetland in the estuarine delta of Diaokou River, the eco - water supplement to the wetland during the water and sediment regulation period was decided by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission in 2010. In this study, taking Diaokou River as one of case study, the effects of the Yellow River ecological water regulation were evaluated, and the follow - up assessments and analyses on the factors such as vegetation, wetland, soil salt content, ground water, etc. before and after the eco - water supplement are made with the methods including the real - time monitoring, remote sensing image interpretation and ground water model simulation concerned. The result shows that the eco - efficiency of the eco - water supplement to Diaokou River is remarkable, which not only preliminarily impedes the developing trend of the invasion of salty groundwater into the degenerated wetland area of the river, but also alleviates the soil salinization within the region to a certain extent, i.e. the damaged sensitive habitat and the wetland vegetation structure are restored along with the preliminary formation of the reed marsh and reed meadow-the suitable habitat for the aquatic birds and the obvious increase of the biodiversity of the aquatic birds therein.																			978-7-5509-0399-9				2015							398	406										WOS:000391414600053

Modeling soil parameters using hyperspectral image reflectance in subtropical coastal wetlands	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Developing spectral models of soil properties is an important frontier in remote sensing and soil science. Several studies have focused on modeling soil properties such as total pools of soil organic matter and carbon in bare soils. We extended this effort to model soil parameters in areas densely covered with coastal vegetation. Moreover, we investigated soil properties indicative of soil functions such as nutrient and organic matter turnover and storage. These properties include the partitioning of mineral and organic soil between particulate (>53 mu m) and fine size classes, and the partitioning of soil carbon and nitrogen pools between stable and labile fractions. Soil samples were obtained from Avicennia genninans mangrove forest and Juncus roemerianus salt marsh plots on the west coast of central Florida. Spectra corresponding to field plot locations from Hyperion hyperspectral image were extracted and analyzed. The spectral information was regressed against the soil variables to determine the best single bands and optimal band combinations for the simple ratio (SR) and normalized difference index (NDI) indices. The regression analysis yielded levels of correlation for soil variables with R-2 values ranging from 0.21 to 0.47 for best individual bands, 0.28 to 0.81 for two-band indices, and 0.53 to 0.96 for partial leastsquares (PLS) regressions for the Hyperion image data. Spectral models using Hyperion data adequately (RPD > 1.4) predicted particulate organic matter (POM), silt+ clay, labile carbon (C), and labile nitrogen (N) (where RPD = ratio of standard deviation to root mean square error of cross-validation [RMSECV]). The SR (0.53 mu m, 2.11 mu m) model of labile N with R-2 = 0.81, RMSECV = 0.28, and RAD = 1.94 produced the best results in this study. Our results provide optimism that remote-sensing spectral models can successfully predict soil properties indicative of ecosystem nutrient and organic matter turnover and storage, and do so in areas with dense canopy cover.

Fusion of lidar and multispectral data to quantify salt marsh carbon stocks	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Herbaceous salt marshes are among the most productive ecosystems on earth. Unfortunately, quantification of the above-ground portion of biomass using passive optical remote sensing is constrained by the complexities of mixed spectral appearance in the water land environment. Lidar remote sensing, on the other hand, has been extensively used to estimate forest biomass, and a few studies have reported their use in characterizing short or herbaceous plants. However, no empirical studies have demonstrated the combined use of lidar and spectral data to quantify above-ground biomass in herbaceous environments, including salt marshes. Thus, the findings of this study will contribute substantially to the understanding of potentials and limitations of using lidar and multi-spectral data for vegetation characterization and biomass estimates in salt marshes and other similar herbaceous environments. In this study, we evaluate the increased capability of a data fusion approach using small footprint discrete return lidar and multispectral data to quantify above-ground biomass and thus, carbon stocks in salt marshes. The specific objectives of our study were the following: 1) to understand the interaction between discrete-return airborne lidar and marsh vegetation; 2) to determine the appropriate grid size/s of lidar-derived datasets for characterizing marsh terrain and vegetation; 3) to investigate the applicability of a number of lidar metrics to predict salt marsh vegetation height and above-ground biomass; and 4) to evaluate the utility of integrating multispectral imagery with lidar to improve the predictability of regression models for quantifying above-ground biomass and carbon. Our results showed that salt marsh Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) derived using local minima in a grid spacing of 5 m x 5 m provided the best accuracy in terrain elevation estimates with an RMSE of less than 10 cm. Lidar-derived maximum vegetation heights (Lmax) provided the best agreement with field height measurements, but explained only 41% of the variance in vegetation height measurements (RMSE = 5.85 cm). Regardless of the metrics used, lidar-measured heights underestimated the field vegetation height, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies in short or herbaceous vegetation. The fusion of lidar with multispectral data improved model predictions of live, dead, and total biomass quantities. The improvement provided by the fusion over the use of lidar or multispectral data alone was marginal; the combination explained 47% of the variance, whereas the best models using lidar and multispectral data separately explained 37% and 28% of variances in live biomass measurements, respectively. However, the best biomass prediction models reported considerably low RMSEs and % root square errors (%RSEs). For example, %RSE for the biomass prediction model using lidar-derived maximum vegetation height (Lmax) was closer to 20%, which is the recommended error threshold for remote sensing based forest biomass prediction models that can be repeatedly applicable for estimating forest carbon stock change. Our findings also demonstrate that lidar as compared to spectral data can provide better estimates of above-ground biomass and carbon, even in the herbaceous and low-relief context of a salt marsh.

Monitoring plant response to phenanthrene using the red edge of canopy hyperspectral reflectance	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												To investigate the mechanisms and potential for the remote sensing of phenanthrene-induced vegetation stress, we measured field canopy spectra, and associated plant and soil parameters in the field controlled experiment in the Yellow River Delta of China. Two widely distributed plant communities, separately dominated by reed (Phragmites australis) and glaucous seepweed (Suaeda salsa), were treated with different doses of phenanthrene. The canopy spectral changes of plant community resulted from the decreases of biomass and foliar projective coverage, while leaf photosynthetic pigment concentrations showed no significance difference among treatments. The spectral response to phenanthrene included a flattened red edge, with decreased first derivative of reflectance.

Salt marshes are complex ecosystems that are not well mapped and understood. This research was conducted to assess the potential of high-spatial and high-spectral resolution satellite data to map and monitor salt-marsh vegetation communities of Micalo Island of New South Wales, Australia. The aim of the study was to determine whether different salt-marsh vegetation species could be differentiated using high-spectral and high-spatial resolution imagery and whether these could be linked to wetland condition. To compare sensor capabilities in discriminating salt-marsh vegetation, high-spatial data sets from Quickbird and high-spectral data sets from Hyperion were used. A hybrid unsupervised and supervised classification procedure was used to assess the wetland mapping potential of the Quickbird and Hyperion data. The supervised classification results had greater overall and within-class accuracies and showed greater promise. Most of the vegetation species were identified and mapped correctly. One area of concern was the misclassification of Sporobolus into grass categories while using Quickbird imagery, mainly where the Sporobolus was tall and dry. They look very similar to the tall reedy grass. The mapping results can be useful in establishing baseline information for subsequent studies involving change detection of salt-marsh ecosystems.

The model, which considers the landscape heterogeneity and changes detected by remote sensing, also reveals the relative importance of sexual and asexual reproduction in the spread by global sensitivity analysis. The model was verified as suitable for simulating the range expansion of S. alterniflora. The results show that: (1) although seedling recruitment is low, it significantly contributes to the range expansion of S. alterniflora. Removing sexual propagation greatly reduces the expansion rate. Rapid expansion requires both sexual and asexual reproduction; (2) in the global sensitivity analysis, the most significant affecters of S. alterniflora invasion were seed dispersal distance, adult survival rate and asexual recruitment survival rate. Sexual propagation contributes much more significantly to quick range expansion than asexual reproduction, but asexual reproduction is the main source of recruitment. Invasion control strategies should target a single reproduction mode. Here, limiting the germination and dispersal of seeds is suggested as a realistic strategy for controlling and managing invasion by this species.																	0912-3814	1440-1703				SEP	2014	29	5					905	915		10.1007/s11284-014-1181-y								WOS:000342219200013						
J	van Beijma, S; Comber, A; Lamb, A				van Beijma, Sybrand; Comber, Alexis; Lamb, Alistair			Random forest classification of salt marsh vegetation habitats using quad-polarimetric airborne SAR, elevation and optical RS data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												This research investigated the use of multi-source remote sensing data to map natural coastal salt marsh vegetation habitats. Coastal zones are very dynamic and provide a number of critical ecosystem services, particularly in relation to flood mitigation but they have been found to be difficult to monitor using remotely sensed data. This research analysed combinations of S-band and X-band quad-polarimetric airborne SAR, elevation data and optical remotely sensed imagery. In total 30 variables were analysed. The SAR inputs included backscatter intensity channels and Cloude-Pottier, Freeman-Durden and Van Zyl decomposition SAR descriptors. Classification was carried out using Random Forest classifiers at two thematic resolutions which generated a general mapping of salt marsh vegetation and a high-resolution mapping of thematically detailed salt marsh vegetation habitats. The results indicate that Random Forest models are able to handle multi-source datasets and generate high classification accuracies. Models based on either SAR or optical RS variables alone were found to be less accurate than models that combining variables from multiple sources. The results show that X-band SAR data provided the best information to map vegetation extent and analysis showed that S-band SAR data was better able to differentiate between different vegetation habitats. The methods and analyses suggested in this paper extend previous research into remote monitoring of costal zones and illustrate the opportunities for mapping natural coastal areas afforded through combinations of radar and optical remote sensing data.

A retrospective assessment of the hydrological conditions of the Samborombon coastland (Argentina)	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Coastal wetlands are transitional zones that play an important role as buffers between the land and sea in several ways, such as protecting the land from storm surge and reducing the input of nutrients from surrounding watersheds to the sea. Understanding the influence of human activities on the hydrological conditions of coastal wetlands is of paramount importance for preserving the ecological function and biodiversity of these unique ecosystems. In the last century, the Samborombon coastland (Argentina), which is an extensive intertidal wetland, has been affected by hydraulic projects and human activities. In this study, through a retrospective assessment of the hydrologic conditions, we show the impacts of channelization, embankments and mining on the surficial and groundwater hydrology of the Samborombon wetlands. The results indicate that channelization has promoted tidal flooding and seawater encroachment along the channels. The embankments have separated large areas from the estuary tides; during heavy rainfalls, they act as obstacles and cause the inundation of inland regions while allowing the accumulation of sodium chloride by saltwater evaporation after tidal overtopping events. The freshwater resources in the aquifer of the paleo-coastlines have been seriously damaged by mining of the shell ridges. The halophyl vegetation in the marshlands and the native forest of the shell ridges, which depend on tidal flow and fresh water, respectively, have been threatened. Nevertheless, although the hydrology of the Samborombon coastland has undergone changes, the engineering projects did not permanently modify or damage the surrounding ecosystems. The outcomes of this study will be useful for remediating ecosystems that have been impacted by human activities by following the fundamentals of ecological engineering. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Dynamics of submarine groundwater discharge and associated fluxes of dissolved nutrients, carbon, and trace gases to the coastal zone (Okatee River estuary, South Carolina)	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Multiple techniques, including thermal infrared aerial remote sensing, geophysical and geological data, geochemical characterization and radium isotopes, were used to evaluate the role of groundwater as a source of dissolved nutrients, carbon, and trace gases to the Okatee River estuary, South Carolina. Thermal infrared aerial remote sensing surveys illustrated the presence of multiple submarine groundwater discharge sites in Okatee headwaters. Significant relationships were observed between groundwater geochemical constituents and Ra-226 activity in groundwater with higher Ra-226 activity correlated to higher concentrations of organics, dissolved inorganic carbon, nutrients, and trace gases to the Okatee system. A system-level radium mass balance confirmed a substantial submarine groundwater discharge contribution of these constituents to the Okatee River. Diffusive benthic flux measurements and potential denitrification rate assays tracked the fate of constituents in creek bank sediments. Diffusive benthic fluxes were substantially lower than calculated radium-based submarine groundwater discharge inputs, showing that advection of groundwater-derived nutrients dominated fluxes in the system. While a considerable potential for denitrification in tidal creek bank sediments was noted, in situ denitrification rates were nitrate-limited, making intertidal sediments an inefficient nitrogen sink in this system. Groundwater geochemical data indicated significant differences in groundwater chemical composition and radium activity ratios between the eastern and western sides of the river; these likely arose from the distinct hydrological regimes observed in each area. Groundwater from the western side of the Okatee headwaters was characterized by higher concentrations of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon, dissolved organic nitrogen, inorganic nutrients and reduced metabolites and trace gases, i.e. methane and nitrous oxide, than groundwater from the eastern side. Differences in microbial sulfate reduction, organic matter supply, and/or groundwater residence time likely contributed to this pattern. The contrasting features of the east and west sub-marsh zones highlight the need for multiple techniques for characterization of submarine groundwater discharge sources and the impact of biogeochemical processes on the delivery of nutrients and carbon to coastal areas via submarine groundwater discharge.

We measured changes in salt marsh vegetation structure using remote sensing and its consequences for carbon sequestration, wave attenuation, and sediment trapping ability using remotely sensed imaging, field measurement data, and the published literature data pertaining to the Yangtze Estuary, a rapidly urbanizing area in Eastern China. From 1980 to 2010, the total area of vegetated salt marsh decreased by 17 %, but the vegetation structure changed more dramatically, with the ratio of Phragmites/Spartina/Scirpus changing from 24:0:76, to 77:0:23, 44:13:43, and 33:39:28 in 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010, respectively. Carbon sequestration increased slightly from 1980 to 2010, with the dramatic shifts in plant species composition. The total length of seawall inadequately protected by salt marsh vegetation increased from 44 km in 1980 to 300 km in 2010. Sediment accretion increased (from 8 to 14 million m(3)/year) due to the spread of Spartina, which to some extent compensated the loss of total vegetated area in the salt marsh. Changes in the delivery of functions were not linearly related to the change in the area of vegetated salt marsh, but more from the combined effect of changing vegetation structure, sediment input, and land reclamation. Under threat of sea-level rise, protection and maintenance of vegetation structure outside the seawall are of great importance for the safe economic development inside the seawall.

J	Hladik, C; Alber, M				Hladik, Christine; Alber, Merry			Classification of salt marsh vegetation using edaphic and remote sensing-derived variables	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Salt marsh plant communities are known for their striking patterns of vertical zonation. Two of the most important edaphic parameters that affect species distribution patterns are soil salinity and waterlogging, both of which are related to topographical variations and distance to the water. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate whether information on elevation and distance derived through remote sensing could be used to predict plant distributions in a southeastern United States salt marsh. We classified four marsh vegetation classes (tall Spartina alterniflora, medium S. alterniflora/short S. altemiflora, marsh meadow, and Borrichia frutescens/Juncus roemerianus) based on landscape metrics obtained from a light detection and ranging (LIDAR)-derived digital elevation model (DEM) and compared results to a classification based on field-collected edaphic variables. Our secondary objective was to compare the performance of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) with non-parametric classification and regression trees (CART) for these classifications. Models based on the edaphic variables soil water content, salinity, and redox potential attained accuracies of 0.62 and 0.71 with LDA and CART, respectively. When the remote sensing-derived variables DEM elevation, slope, distance to the mean high water line, and distance to upland area were used, classification accuracies improved to 0.78 for LDA and 0.79 for CART. Our results suggest that remote sensing-derived metrics can capture edaphic gradients effectively, which makes them especially suited to landscape level analyses of salt marsh plant habitats, with potential application for predicting the effects of sea level rise on salt marsh plant distribution.

Impacts of salt marsh plants on tidal channel initiation and inheritance	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												At the transition between mudflat and salt marsh, vegetation is traditionally regarded as a sustaining factor for previously incised mudflat channels, able to conserve the channel network via bank stabilization following plant colonization (i.e., vegetation-stabilized channel inheritance). This is in contrast to recent studies revealing vegetation as the main driver of tidal channel emergence through vegetation-induced channel erosion. We present a coupled hydrodynamic morphodynamic plant growth model to simulate plant expansion and channel formation by our model species (Spartina alterniflora) during a mudflat-salt marsh transition with various initial bathymetries (flat, shoal dense, shoal sparse, and deep dense channels). This simulated landscape development is then compared to remote sensing images of the Yangtze estuary, China, and the Scheldt estuary in Netherlands. Our results propose the existence of a threshold in preexisting mudflat channel depth, which favors either vegetation-stabilized channel inheritance or vegetation-induced channel erosion processes. The increase in depth of preexisting mudflat channels favors flow routing through them, consequently leaving less flow and momentum remaining for vegetation-induced channel erosion processes. This threshold channel depth will be influenced by field specific parameters such as hydrodynamics (tidal range and flow), sediment characteristics, and plant species. Hence, our study shows that the balance between vegetation-stabilized channel inheritance and vegetation-induced channel erosion depends on ecosystem properties.

Remote sensing of plant communities as a tool for assessing the condition of semiarid Mediterranean saline wetlands in agricultural catchments	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Semiarid Mediterranean saline wetlands are unique ecosystems sheltering high biodiversity. In the last decades, the expansion of irrigated lands has led to hydrological imbalances in Mediterranean catchments, causing wetland degradation. Vegetation composition assessment is considered an important tool for evaluating wetland ecological condition and can be mapped using remote sensing. This study aims to develop a condition index based on plant community composition suitable for semiarid Mediterranean saline wetlands, as well as to test the applicability of airborne multispectral remote sensors for discriminating plant communities. Characteristic plant communities of 12 wetlands were identified by means of ordination and classification analysis of plant taxa cover percentages obtained through fieldwork sampling. An index for assessing wetland ecological condition was developed based on the relationship between wetland plant community composition and watershed hydrological condition. Selected wetland plant communities were then mapped by means of remote sensing techniques using random forest algorithm for supervised classification of airborne images. Following this methodology, remote sensing served as a tool for wetland condition assessment at a regional scale. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper describes research focused on the application of Earth Observation for Integrated Coastal Zone Management. The main topic of this research is to explore to which extent salt marsh vegetation habitats can be identified from polarimetric SAR remotely sensed data. Multi-frequency, multi-polarimetric SAR images from airborne (S- and X-Band quad-polarimetric from the Astrium airborne SAR Demonstrator) is used to examine salt marsh habitat classification potential in the Llanrhidian salt marshes in South Wales, UK. This is achieved by (1) using both supervised and unsupervised classification routines, using several polarimetric SAR data layers as backscatter intensity, band ratios and polarimetric decomposition products, and by (2) statistical analysis by regression of these different SAR data layers and botanical parameters acquired from recent ecological fieldwork.					comber, alexis/0000-0002-3652-7846												0277-786X		978-1-62841-306-9				2014	9243								UNSP 92430N	10.1117/12.2066487								WOS:000349373200020

In inland alkali landscapes, elevation is a key factor for understanding patterns of salt accumulation and water table which is therefore considered a good indicator of alkali vegetation types. Remote sensing techniques offer viable solutions for linking elevation data to vegetation patterns by providing an elevation model of extended areas. Our goal was to test the relationships between fine-scale differences in vertical position and vegetation patterns in inland alkali landscapes by vegetation data collected in the field and elevation data generated using airborne laser scanning (ALS). We studied whether vertical position influences vegetation patterns at the level of main vegetation groups (based on alliances) or even at the level of associations. Our study sites were situated in a lowland alkali landscape in Hortobagy National Park (East-Hungary). We grouped the associations into four main vegetation groups: loess grasslands, alkali steppes, open alkali swards and alkali meadows. Even though we detected a very limited range (121 cm) in the vertical position of the main vegetation groups, they were well separated by their vertical positions. At the level of associations, a more detailed elevation-based distinction was also possible in many cases. The revealed elevation vegetation correlations show that high-resolution mapping based on ALS remote sensing techniques is an ideal solution in complex lowland areas, such as alkali landscapes. Our findings suggest that in other types of lowland landscapes, characterised by elevation differences, the applied method might hold a great potential as a supporting tool for vegetation mapping.

J	Stammermann, R; Piasecki, M				Stammermann, Ramona; Piasecki, Michael			Generating meshes for tidal wetland modeling using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data	JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS												A high resolution model mesh was required to numerically simulate sediment transport in tidal marshes. The timing of flooding is dependent on the tidal marsh ground elevation, which requires accurate topographic elevation data. The tidal prism of the marsh is determined by the volume provided by tidal channels in the system. Hence, their location and bathymetry needed to be represented adequately. Due to the high spatial variability and inaccessibility of marshes, remote sensing techniques such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR) are a significant resource for elevation data. LiDAR measures the highest elevation of elements. To determine the bare ground elevation, filter techniques exist but are often inadequate to eliminate elevation errors that are introduced by the vegetation of marshes. We introduce a simple method to remove remaining vertical elevation errors in high resolution digital terrain models (DTMs) of vegetated marshes and present an approach to determine the bathymetry of tidal channels based on a limited number of cross-sectional measurements. Forcing polygons for mesh generation were extracted from the DTMs to assure an accurate spatial representation of the marsh. DTMs (2 x 2 m/1 x 1m) derived from LiDAR data from the Blackbird Creek Reserve and Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge in Delaware, USA, were used.																	1464-7141	1465-1734					2014	16	4					941	951		10.2166/hydro.2014.031								WOS:000348519300014

Estuarine sediment deposition during wetland restoration: a GIS and remote sensing modelling approach	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL												Restoration is currently underway in the industrial salt flats of San Francisco Bay, California. Remote sensing of suspended sediment concentration and other geographical information system predictor variables were used to model sediment deposition within recently restored ponds. Suspended sediment concentrations were calibrated to reflectance values from Landsat TM 5 and ASTER satellite image data using three statistical techniques - linear regression, multivariate regression and artificial neural network (ANN) regression. Multivariate and ANN regressions using ASTER proved to be the most accurate methods, yielding r(2) values of 0.88 and 0.87, respectively. Predictor variables such as sediment grain size and tidal frequency were used in the marsh sedimentation (MARSED) model for predicting deposition rates. MARSED results show a root-mean-square deviation of 66.8mm (<1 sigma) between modelled and field observations. This model was applied to a pond breached in November 2010 and indicated that the pond will reach sediment equilibrium levels after 60 months of tidal inundation.

The plants showed the zonal distribution with different elevation, where Spartina alterniflor a dominated higher tidal flat than Scirpus mariqueter and Phragmites australis. However, there was no obvious correlation with vegetation density/type and accretion rate.

Mangroves facing climate change: landward migration potential in response to projected scenarios of sea level rise	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Mangrove forests prominently occupy an intertidal boundary position where the effects of sea level rise will be fast and well visible. This study in East Africa ( Gazi Bay, Kenya) addresses the question of whether mangroves can be resilient to a rise in sea level by focusing on their potential to migrate towards landward areas. The combinatory analysis between remote sensing, DGPS-based ground truth and digital terrain models ( DTM) unveils how real vegetation assemblages can shift under different projected ( minimum (+ 9 cm), relative (+ 20 cm), average (+ 48 cm) and maximum (+ 88 cm)) scenarios of sea level rise ( SLR). Under SLR scenarios up to 48 cm by the year 2100, the landward extension remarkably implies an area increase for each of the dominant mangrove assemblages except for Avicennia marina and Ceriops tagal, both on the landward side. On the one hand, the increase in most species in the first three scenarios, including the socio-economically most important species in this area, Rhizophora mucronata and C. tagal on the seaward side, strongly depends on the colonisation rate of these species. On the other hand, a SLR scenario of + 88 cm by the year 2100 indicates that the area flooded only by equinoctial tides strongly decreases due to the topographical settings at the edge of the inhabited area. Consequently, the landward Avicennia-dominated assemblages will further decrease as a formation if they fail to adapt to a more frequent inundation. The topography is site-specific; however non-invadable areas can be typical for many mangrove settings.

How to obtain and monitor spatio-temporal change of spartina alterniflora has great practical significance in managing and protecting Chongming Dongtan. Therefore, the main purpose of this paper was to build up a method to recognize different species of salt marsh vegetation and analyze the spatio-temporal change by interpreting remote sensed data of different period. Considering the complexity of different plant' spectral feature, the feature space was consisted of Normalized Different Vegetation Index (NDVI), Kanth-Thomas transformation (K-T transformation) and an optimal band combination. In order to enhance classification accuracy, a dual-weight support vector machine (SVM) classification model by weighting on different features and classes was proposed. The kernel function of this model was selected as wavelet which satisfied the practical situation better. During the experiment, training and validation data were ground survey points located by GPS. The results from this study indicated that the invasion of spartina alterniflora was serious and it kept expanding to the southern. Furthermore, the method proposed in this paper could get higher detection accuracy than the traditional methods and was suitable for the small-sample experiment. Consequently, using this approach could provide timely analytical data for the time and space distribution change of the Salt Marsh Vegetation in intertidal zones, meanwhile the results will provide sound scientific basis for carrying out some proper management and control of Spartina alterniflora.																	2380-8039		978-1-4799-4184-1				2014																		WOS:000366526900012

The marsh is in the Biosphere Reserve of the Upper Gulf of California and Delta of the Colorado River, and supports a high abundance and diversity of wildlife. Over 95% of its water supply originates as agricultural drain water from the USA, sent for disposal in Mexico. This study was conducted from 2009 to 2011, before, during and after a trial run of the Yuma Desalting Plant in the USA, which will divert water from the wetland and replace it with brine from the desalting operation. The goal was to estimate the main components in the water budget to be used in creating management scenarios for this marsh. We used a remote sensing algorithm to estimate ET from meteorological data and Enhanced Vegetation Index values from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) sensors on the Terra satellite. ET estimates from the MODIS method were then compared to results from a mass balance of water and salt inflows and outflows over the study period. By both methods, mean annual ET estimates ranged from 2.6 to 3.0 mm d(-1), or 50 to 60% of reference ET (ETo). Water entered at a mean salinity of 2.6 g L-1 TDS and mean salinity in the wetland was 3.73 g L-1 TDS over the 33 month study period. Over an annual cycle, 54% of inflows supported ET while the rest exited the marsh as outflows; however, in winter when ET was low, up to 90% of the inflows exited the marsh. An analysis of ET estimates over the years 2000-2011 showed that annual ET was proportional to the volume of inflows, but was also markedly stimulated by fires. Spring fires in 2006 and 2011 burned off accumulated thatch, resulting in vigorous growth of new leaves and a 30% increase in peak summer ET compared to non-fire years. Following fires, peak summer ET estimates were equal to ETo, while in non-fire years peak ET was equal to only one-half to two-thirds of ETo. Over annual cycles, estimated ET was always lower than ETo, because T. domingensis is dormant in winter and shades the water surface, reducing direct evaporation. Thus, ET of a Typha marsh is likely to be less than an open water surface under most conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Klemas, V				Klemas, Victor			Remote Sensing of Coastal Wetland Biomass: An Overview	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Wetlands are highly productive and provide critical habitat to animals and plants. Coastal wetlands have been affected by human-created alterations and, more recently, by losses due to sea-level rise. To protect and restore tidal wetlands, scientists need to monitor the changes in the wetlands as the sea level continues to rise and the coastal population keeps expanding. Advances in sensor design and data-analysis techniques are making remote-sensing systems practical and cost effective for obtaining quantitative biophysical information, such as wetland extent, live aerial biomass, leaf area index, percentage of canopy closure, etc. This article reviews biomass mapping techniques and illustrates their use for wetland-change detection. The results show that analysis of satellite and aircraft data, combined with a small number of on-the-ground observations, allows researchers to map biomass and determine long-term changes in tidal marshes.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SEP	2013	29	5					1016	1028		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12-00237.1								WOS:000326304800005

Landscape Estimates of Habitat Types, Plant Biomass, and Invertebrate Densities in a Georgia Salt Marsh	OCEANOGRAPHY												Salt marshes often contain remarkable spatial heterogeneity at multiple scales across the landscape. A combination of advanced remote-sensing approaches (hyperspectral imagery and lidar) and conventional field survey methods was used to produce detailed quantifications and maps of marsh platform geomorphology, vegetation composition and biomass, and invertebrate patterns in a Georgia (USA) salt marsh. Community structure was largely related to hydrology, elevation, and soil properties. Both abiotic drivers and community patterns varied among subwatersheds and across the landscape at larger spatial scales. The authors conclude that measurements of marsh ecosystem structure and processes are spatially contextual and not scalable without detailed geospatial analysis. Efforts to protect and restore coastal marshes must strive to document, understand, and conserve this inherent spatial complexity.

J	Klemas, V				Klemas, Victor			Using Remote Sensing to Select and Monitor Wetland Restoration Sites: An Overview	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Coastal and estuarine wetlands represent highly productive and critical habitats for a wide variety of plants and animals and provide protection from storms and wave damage. However, wetland acreage in the continental United States has been steadily decreasing mainly as a result of human activities and sea level rise. Major efforts are being made by federal, state, and local agencies to protect existing wetlands, restore lost wetlands, and improve those stressed by human activities. The restoration process can involve removing exotic plants, removing bulkheads and fill, elevation grading, creating flushing channels, and planting native vegetation. Having developed criteria for selecting wetland sites to be restored or enhanced, wetland managers must prioritize the sites based on ecological and economic considerations. Remote sensing techniques can provide a cost-effective means for selecting restoration sites and observing their progress over time. The objective of this paper is to review airborne and satellite remote sensing techniques for identifying suitable wetland restoration sites and monitoring their progress.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JUL	2013	29	4					958	970		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12-00170.1								WOS:000321162100018

This study examines changes in land cover and land use from 1942 to 2007 using remote sensing technology, geographic information systems (GIS) and extensive field surveys. Land cover maps were produced for 1942, 1957, 1986, 1994, 2003 and 2007 from aerial photos and high resolution satellite imagery. Caroni Swamp's hydrology was altered in the 1920's to facilitate rice cultivation. This resulted in the formation of large tracts of freshwater marsh. From 1942 to 1957, freshwater marsh and agriculture lands increased, but after this period there was a steady decline in both, as freshwater was diverted away from the wetland and salt water intruded further inland. Although mangrove forest was cleared for built development, its coverage has consistently increased in the Swamp from 1957, with the exception of 2003 when there was a decrease by less than 100 ha. This is in contrast to most areas in the tropics where mangrove coverage continue to decline. In this case, the mangrove trees are out-competing/shading marsh vegetation, causing shift in the wetland communities. In the Caroni Ramsar Site, the natural wetland communities generally increased from 1942 to 2003, but declined in 2007, as built development more than doubled. The paper provides spatial coverage, and quantifies land cover from 1942 to 2007. It also identifies reasons for the changes in land cover and uses, and the implications for management.																	1400-0350					MAR	2013	17	1					133	141		10.1007/s11852-012-0225-0								WOS:000315336900012

Spectroscopic remote sensing of the distribution and persistence of oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill in Barataria Bay marshes	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												We applied a spectroscopic analysis to Airborne Visible/InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data collected from low and medium altitudes during and after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill to delineate the distribution of oil-damaged canopies in the marshes of Barataria Bay, Louisiana. Spectral feature analysis compared the AVIRIS data to reference spectra of oiled marsh by using absorption features centered near 1.7 and 23 mu m, which arise from C-H bonds in oil. AVIRIS-derived maps of oiled shorelines from the individual dates of July 31, September 14, and October 4, 2010, were 89.3%, 89.8%, and 90.6% accurate, respectively. A composite map at 3.5 m grid spacing, accumulated from the three dates, was 93.4% accurate in detecting oiled shorelines. The composite map had 100% accuracy for detecting damaged plant canopy in oiled areas that extended more than 1.2 m into the marsh. Spatial resampling of the AVIRIS data to 30 m reduced the accuracy to 73.6% overall. However, detection accuracy remained high for oiled canopies that extended more than 4 m into the marsh (23 of 28 field reference points with oil were detected). Spectral resampling of the 3.5 m AVIRIS data to Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) spectral response greatly reduced the detection of oil spectral signatures. With spatial resampling of simulated Landsat ETM data to 30 m, oil signatures were not detected. Overall, similar to 40 km of coastline, marsh comprised mainly of Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus, were found to be oiled in narrow zones at the shorelines. Zones of oiled canopies reached on average 11 m into the marsh, with a maximum reach of 21 m. The field and airborne data showed that, in many areas, weathered oil persisted in the marsh from the first field survey. July 10, to the latest airborne survey. October 4, 2010. The results demonstrate the applicability of high spatial resolution imaging spectrometer data to identifying contaminants in the environment for use in evaluating ecosystem disturbance and response.

Due to its special topography, as they are characterized as salt-marshes, their characterization, both altimetric as volumetric, is quite complex. In this research, 40 Landsat satellite images from the United States Geological Service (USGS) were analyzed for the 1975 to 2010 period, each of which was examined and classified in a certain period of time in order to characterize right way the dynamic changes in the Odiel Marshes. Likewise, the Landsat satellite images were integrated into a GIS in order to obtain suitably using iterative processes the flood depth depending on rainfall data estimated for a period of 110 years (from 1900 to 2010). As regards temporal characterization was obtained a map of changes detected in the marshes by difference between the NDVI values of the image corresponding to the end date and the start date of each period. The results show how the greater integration of remote sensing and GIS technologies, with regression model, was most useful to describe, analyze and predict the volumetric change process in the Odiel Marshes.																	2078-0958		978-988-19252-8-2				2013							1335	1339										WOS:000335869700118

Relating Biophysical Parameters of Coastal Marshes to Hyperspectral Reflectance Data in the Bahia Blanca Estuary, Argentina	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Gonzalez Trilla, G.; Pratolongo, P.; Beget, M.E.; Kandus, P.; Marcovecchio, J., and Di Bella, C., 2013. Relating biophysical parameters of coastal marshes to hyperspectral reflectance data in the Bahia Blanca Estuary, Argentina. Journal of Coastal Research, 29(1), 231-238. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Salt marshes occupying the tidal fringe of estuaries and protected coasts provide valuable ecosystem services, and remote sensing is a powerful tool for their large-scale monitoring. However, in order to apply remote sensing techniques to evaluate the ecological state of salt marshes, a deeper understanding is needed about the interactions between field biophysical parameters and the sensor's reflectance. The main objective of this work is to analyze and quantify the influence of different biophysical parameters characterizing stands of Spartina alterniflora marshes in the Bahia Blanca Estuary, Argentina, on their spectral response. Spectral reflectance at high resolution was measured in S. alterniflora canopies under natural conditions, manipulating standing biomass by means of successive harvestings. Reflectance data were acquired using a FieldSpec (R) spectroradiometer, which measures in the visible, near-infrared, and shortwave-infrared spectral bands. Based on these reflectance data, spectral indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were calculated for each biomass condition. Biomass, leaf area index (LAI), percent canopy cover (PCC), water content, and soil properties were also evaluated. LAI, PCC, and biomass were positively correlated between each other. As a general trend, as biomass decreased, absorption in red wavelengths decreased and reflectance in near-infrared increased. Several indices explained the variability in LAI, biomass, and PCC. For example, NDVIRouse had a positive regression with PCC (R-2 = 0.80, N = 75) and LAI (R-2 = 0.67, N = 75). Results indicate that LAI, biomass, and PCC of Spartina alterniflora could be accurately determined from spectral data.

S	Craft, C		DeLaune, RD; Reddy, KR; Richardson, CJ; Megonigal, JP		Craft, Christopher			Emergent Macrophyte Biomass Production	METHODS IN BIOGEOCHEMISTRY OF WETLANDS	Soil Science Society of America Book Series											Emergent macrophyte plant production is an important process in many wetlands, especially marshes. It adds organic matter to the soil, enriches it, and sustains the heterotrophic food web. Aboveground biomass produced by emergent vegetation can be substantial, 1 to 4 kg dry matter m(-2) yr(-1) or more, with comparable amounts produced belowground. Emergent macrophyte production is estimated by indirect and direct methods. Indirect methods include end-of-season measurement of aboveground biomass in plots by destructive (harvest) and nondestructive (stem density and height) methods. Belowground biomass, roots and rhizomes, is estimated using cores. Direct methods include harvesting of aboveground biomass from replicate plots at fixed intervals (monthly or seasonally) and by repeated collection of root cores. Repeated measurements of stem height and density from fixed plots provide a nondestructive estimate of emergent production. Belowground production is directly measured by root ingrowth into core excavations backfilled with sieved peat, sand, or native soil, or by burial of porous nylon bags filled with sieved soil. Minirhizotrons are used to measure belowground production in terrestrial ecosystems, but their application may be limited in flooded and saturated soils. Likewise, chamber methods, where CO2 flux from the soil-plant system under light (photosynthesis and respiration) and dark (respiration only) conditions is measured, are problematic because of the difficulty in partitioning root from soil-microbial respiration. Emerging methods include remote sensing technology, especially light detection and ranging (Lidar) from fixed-wing aircraft and hand-held devices, to estimate aboveground biomass at larger spatial scales.																	1047-4986		978-0-89118-961-9; 978-0-89118-960-2				2013	10						137	153		10.2136/sssabookser10.c9	10.2136/sssabookser10							WOS:000370800500011

Distinguishing wetland vegetation and channel features with object-based image segmentation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Mapping landscape features within wetlands using remote-sensing imagery is a persistent challenge due to the fine scale of wetland pattern variation and the low spectral contrast among plant species. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) is a promising approach for distinguishing wetland features, but systematic guidance for this use of OBIA is not presently available. A sensitivity analysis was tested using OBIA to distinguish vegetation zones, vegetation patches, and surface water channels in two intertidal salt marshes in southern San Francisco Bay. Optimal imagery sources and OBIA segmentation settings were determined from 348 sensitivity tests using the eCognition multiresolution segmentation algorithm. The optimal high-resolution (<= 1 m) imagery choices were colour infrared (CIR) imagery to distinguish vegetation zones, CIR or red, green, blue (RGB) imagery to distinguish vegetation patches depending on species and season, and RGB imagery to distinguish surface water channels. High-resolution (1 m) lidar data did not help distinguish small surface water channels or other features. Optimal segmentation varied according to segmentation setting choices. Small vegetation patches and narrow channels were more recognizable using small scale parameter settings and coarse vegetation zones using larger scale parameter settings. The scale parameter served as a de facto lower bound to median segmented object size. Object smoothness/compactness weight settings had little effect. Wetland features were more recognizable using high colour/low shape weight settings. However, an experiment on a synthetic non-wetland image demonstrated that, colour information notwithstanding, segmentation results are still strongly affected by the selected image resolution, OBIA settings, and shape of the analysis region. Future wetland OBIA studies may benefit from strategically making imagery and segmentation setting choices based on these results; such systemization of future wetland OBIA approaches may also enhance study comparability.

Here, we report results from a field study tracking the effects of contaminating oil across space and time in resident killifish during the first 4 mo of the spill event. Remote sensing and analytical chemistry identified exposures, which were linked to effects in fish characterized by genome expression and associated gill immunohisto-chemistry, despite very low concentrations of hydrocarbons remaining in water and tissues. Divergence in genome expression coincides with contaminating oil and is consistent with genome responses that are predictive of exposure to hydrocarbon-like chemicals and indicative of physiological and reproductive impairment. Oil-contaminated waters are also associated with aberrant protein expression in gill tissues of larval and adult fish. These data suggest that heavily weathered crude oil from the spill imparts significant biological impacts in sensitive Louisiana marshes, some of which remain for over 2 mo following initial exposures.

Human Impacts on Geological and Cultural Heritage in the Coastal Zone West of Alexandria to Al-Alamein, Egypt	GEOHERITAGE												A combination of remote sensing and field surveying is used to detect changes within the coastal zone west of Alexandria towards Al-Alamein. The satellite images used are Landsat Thematic Mapper and SPOT images acquired in 1984, 2003 and 2007. The results show considerable changes due to human impacts. The research reveals that seven land cover features (seawater, salt marshes, sabkha, agricultural land, road, bare land and urban land) can be identified in the Landsat data sets. The unplanned urban and agricultural growth that was detected from 1984 to 2007 has been by 309.3 and 445.4 km(2), respectively, in the vicinity of coastal areas rich in natural beauty, geological interests and cultural heritage. Most of the coastal ridge, which records Holocene shorelines and yields Neolithic pottery and bones, has been obliterated due to the increased construction of tourism and recreational facilities. Such a case was also observed for the Abu Sir ridge, where the remains of Graeco-Roman villages (e. g. Taposiris Magna) are bordered with resorts. Recently, the Bahig drain which cuts the Gebel Maryut ridge has been partially damaged. The drain cut is unique because it demonstrates outcrops of the Last Interglacial highstand (Oxygen Isotope Stage 5e). During this stage the sea level reached more than 8 m above the present level. The construction of the Marina Resort to the east has caused the accelerated erosion of the shoreline and the removal of Holocene platforms and evidence of sea-level highstands. The relevance of this northwestern coast as a geological and cultural heritage resource site is proposed.																	1867-2477	1867-2485				DEC	2012	4	4					263	274		10.1007/s12371-012-0066-0								WOS:000324991500003

In order to be effectively employed, remote-sensing based cover maps must be accurate and meet the spatial scale inherent to the phenomena of interest. In this study, we employed the Random Forests algorithm in a supervised classification approach to construct a fine-scale (i.e., 1.0 meter pixel resolution) remote-sensing based cover map of coastal dune and salt marsh ecosystems at Cape Cod National Seashore, USA. We achieved high overall classification accuracies (i.e., 75.1% and 86.8% correct classification rate for the dune and salt marsh study areas, respectively) with a large proportion of the misclassified holdout validation assessment points being errors of commission between overlapping and/or ecologically similar cover classes. In addition, we were able to considerably reduce the predictor variable set by using a forward selection variable reduction method while achieving modestly higher classification accuracies compared to the global model. Our results suggest that coastal dune and salt marsh ecosystems can be mapped at a fine spatial resolution with reasonably high classification accuracy using a supervised Random Forests-based approach such as ours.

J	Houser, C				Houser, Chris			Feedback between ridge and swale bathymetry and barrier island storm response and transgression	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The shoreface of Santa Rosa Island in northwest Florida is characterized by a ridge and swale bathymetry that forces an alongshore variation in beach and dune morphology. The alongshore variation in dune morphology in turn controls the modern island response to and recovery from tropical storms and hurricanes, and is therefore, an important control on island transgression with relative sea-level rise. Field sampling and remote sensing are used in the present study to describe the geologic framework of Santa Rosa Island, and to elucidate on the origins of the shore-attached ridge and swale bathymetry. Vibracores and seismic and GPR surveys were completed along 42 cross-shore transects and 3 shore-parallel transects to examine the structure of the 21 ridge and swale structures found along Santa Rosa Island. The shore-parallel seismic surveys reveal strong near-horizontal reflectors through the ridges at depths consistent with thick back-barrier muds extracted from vibracores taken across and along the ridges. Near-horizontal reflectors are identified in ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveys between the ridges and cuspate spits along the back-barrier shoreline, but are not present in the narrow sections of the island landward of the swales. Continuation of the seismic surveys in the back-barrier also reveals near-horizontal reflectors at the cuspate spits that are characterized by seagrass beds, salt marsh and maritime forest. Consistent with the GPR survey, there is an absence of horizontal reflectors between cuspate spits where the washover deposits extend to the back-barrier shoreline. It is argued that the ridge and swale bathymetry is a transgressive surface and the remnants of cuspate spits that are present along the back-barrier shoreline. In this respect, the cuspate spits had to first develop along the back-barrier shoreline and eventually evolve into the mud-cored ridges as the island transgressed with relative sea-level rise. Once the ridge and swale bathymetry emerged on the Gulf of Mexico shoreface it was able to reinforce the alongshore variation in dune height and storm response. It is further argued that the cuspate spits are reinforced by the shoreface ridges through alongshore transport of sediment from adjacent washover fans although the ridge orientation suggests that the spits have migrated westward by similar to 750 m. In this respect, the alongshore variation in beach and dune morphology on this island is the expression of this large-scale feedback and suggests a top-down model in which meso-scale processes and landforms depend on the geologic context.

J	Collin, A; Long, B; Archambault, P				Collin, Antoine; Long, Bernard; Archambault, Phillippe			Merging land-marine realms: Spatial patterns of seamless coastal habitats using a multispectral LiDAR	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												A lack of spatially, structurally and thematically accurate habitat data complicates conservation and management planning as well as ecological research within structurally complex littoral enviromnents. The Scanning Hydrographic Operational Airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) Survey (SHOALS) has considerable potential to provide such data, by means of its proficiency in generating high-resolution measurements of emerged and immersed elevations and to create thematic maps. Return signals, i.e., waveforms, contain signatures and structural information of salt-marsh and benthic cover. This paper focuses on the capability of the SHOALS to assess the structural complexity of emerged and immersed coastal habitats, and to define the contribution of SHOALS data, both elevation and intensity, in order to accurately and seamlessly map these habitats from supratidal to nearshore levels. The study area was selected based upon the variety of littoral cover types, encompassing kelp habitat, eelgrass meadow, beach, salt-marsh, farm and urban coastal environments. Firstly, the LiDAR-derived green waveform, through an ad hoc decision-tree, satisfactorily assessed the structural complexity of littoral habitats (r = 0.75, p<0.01). Secondly, synergistic combination between NDLVI (LiDAR-derived red and near-infrared data) and topographic/bathymetric surfaces (LiDAR-derived near-infrared and green, respectively) enabled the accurate mapping of 19 littoral habitats (overall accuracy and kappa coefficient equaled to 90.09% and 0.8883, respectively). Accordingly, a single multispectral (three bands) LiDAR survey holds significant potential for monitoring small-scale structural complexity, as well as constructing spatially and temporally seamless patterns of coastal habitats.

Remote sensing of geomorphological and ecological change in response to saltmarsh managed realignment, The Wash, UK	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												An integrated remote sensing approach quantified saltmarsh dynamics in response to a sudden change in surface elevation due to a saltmarsh restoration scheme. The biogeomorphological relationship between surface elevation and saltmarsh presence occurs over the long-term so can be difficult to observe, though the 'managed realignment' of coastal defences provides a unique experimental opportunity to study this relationship. Realignment at Freiston Shore, Lincolnshire, UK in August 2002 caused a sudden and high-magnitude sediment input into the local coastal system, significantly increasing the intertidal surface elevation. The resulting impacts on the external, fronting saltmarsh were quantified by aerial photography and airborne multispectral imagery. Algal and pioneer saltmarsh boundary positions were calculated from 1984 to 2006, with the latter zone migrating slowly seaward pre-realignment (3.8 m a(-1)), but advancing significantly post-realignment (21.3 m a(-1)). Classification of five-year multispectral imagery accurately showed subtle changes in vegetation community composition within these boundaries. The realignment site was also colonized rapidly compared to other restoration sites, due to its high starting surface elevation. This study shows how, with sufficient sediment input and accommodation space, coastal management decisions can release intertidal surfaces from physical constraints to saltmarsh colonization.

Laboratory measured emissivity spectra in the mid infrared (MIR; 2.5 mu m-6 mu m) and the thermal infrared (TIR; 8 mu m-14 mu m) domain of different plant species, however, reveal significant differences. It is anticipated that with the advances in airborne and space borne hyperspectral thermal sensors, differentiation between plant species may improve. The laboratory emissivity spectra of thirteen common broad leaved species, comprising 3024 spectral bands in the MIR and TIR, were analyzed. For each wavelength the differences between the species were tested for significance using the one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the post-hoc Tukey HSD test. The emissivity spectra of the analyzed species were found to be statistically different at various wavebands. Subsequently, six spectral bands were selected (based on the histogram of separable pairs of species for each waveband) to quantify the separability between each species pair based on the Jefferies Matusita GM) distance. Out of 78 combinations, 76 pairs had a significantly different JM distance. This means that careful selection of hyperspectral bands in the MIR and TIR (2.5 mu m-14 mu m) results in reliable species discrimination. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Remote sensing, in conjunction with geographical information systems (GIS), global positioning systems (GPS), and on-site investigations were used to map salt marsh vegetation along the entire coast. Species recognitions were checked subsequently using in situ field surveys of selected areas. Results showed that the distribution of Spartina anglica has been greatly degraded from 33,333 ha in 1981 to only 16 ha in 2007. By contrast, Spartina alterniflora had spread widely from being absent in 1981 to an area of 34,451 ha by 2007 from Liaoning Province to Guangxi Province. Nearly 94% area of the area covered by S. alterniflora is distributed in Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Fujian Provinces, representing the most highly concentrated areas in China. Knowing the current expanse of this species, including its quantity and spatial patterns, is useful for predicting the future proliferation of S. alterniflora. Coastal ecosystem health of the China coast can thus be better assessed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A method to calculate heterogeneous evapotranspiration using submeter thermal infrared imagery coupled to a stomatal resistance submodel	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing of vegetation temperature, combined with surface energy balance modeling, allows efficient estimation of spatially distributed evapotranspiration (ET). Many ET models are sensitive to the parameterization of stomatal control; yet, modelers often employ spatially uniform stomatal resistance values, even in distributed applications. Unfortunately, assuming uniform resistance across a canopy with large temperature variance is physically unrealistic and may produce artifacts in ET magnitude. To account for spatial variations in stomatal control that likely accompany temperature variations, we propose nesting a new submodel within some well-established ET models. The submodel derives, for the canopy patch of interest, a concave-downward relationship between stomatal conductance and temperature, as expected from plant biology. Using the submodel, each pixel's contribution to the total canopy patch ET is influenced both by its observed temperature and by its locationspecific estimated stomatal resistance. The submodel requires only one more parameter than the unmodified ET models, which can be obtained from the literature; it conserves energy between the pixel and image scales, unlike single-valued resistance approaches; it produces realistic ET values at extreme temperature locations; and provides a remote sensing-based way to estimate the in situ canopy stomatal conductance-temperature relationship, which otherwise must be measured under controlled conditions. Since very high-resolution TIR data provide one means to observe large temperature variance, the submodel was tested using data with cm-scale pixels collected over 1.5 m(2) patches of two vegetation types. The biophysical relationships derived by the submodel were successfully verified against laboratory data.																	0043-1397	1944-7973				JAN 31	2012	48								W01545	10.1029/2011WR010407								WOS:000300009400001

Dynamics of coastal landform features along the southern Tamil Nadu of India by using remote sensing and Geographic Information System	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL												This article reveals an application of multi-spectral satellite data for analysing the dynamics of different coastal landform features along the southern coastal Tamil Nadu of India. An integrated approach comprising visual image interpretation and maximum-likelihood supervised classification has been employed to classify the coastal landforms by using IRS data (during the period 1999-2006). The quality of image classification has been assessed by performing the accuracy assessments with the existing thematic maps and finally the coastal landforms have been mapped. The study reveals that the dynamics of coastal landforms such as sandy beaches, mud-flats, sand dunes and salt marshes along the study area are mostly influenced by the coastal processes, sediment transport, geomorphology and anthropogenic activities. Major anthropogenic sources for the perturbation of beach sediment budgets and a cause of beach erosion along the study area are excessive sand mining, removal of sand dunes, coastal urbanization, tourism and developmental activities.																	1010-6049						2012	27	4					347	370		10.1080/10106049.2011.638988								WOS:000314594100005

Mapping phytoplankton chlorophyll in turbid, Case 2 estuarine and coastal waters	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES												We tested variants of semianalytic algorithms for estimating phytoplankton chlorophyll pigment in Case 2 waters. Since 2002 we sampled 279 stations in 22 estuaries, bays, and near shore at seven National Estuarine Research Reserves between Delaware and Texas (USA). The following median values and ranges were observed: chlorophyll a = 17.4 mu g/L-3 (0.2-490.1); total suspended solids = 23.4 mg/L dry weight (0.7-191.1); and CDOM absorbance (440 nm) = 3.11 m(-1) (0.00-21.08). Spectroradiometers measured volume reflectance at each station. Sampling was designed to capture upriver to coastal mixing gradients. Algorithms utilized features in the red and lower NIR, with interference adjustments for CDOM absorption and non-algal particle scatter using bands in either the green (550 nm) or NIR between 723-739 nm. Data from an additional 53 inland lake, reservoir, and river stations were included for comparison in algorithm testing. Our best two algorithms were re-parameterized using matchups with AISA Eagle imagery. Examples of pigment classification using these adjusted models are presented for five studies: dinoflagellate bloom in Maryland, tidal watershed in Georgia, estuarine reserve and neighboring refinery in Mississippi, shallow ponds important to Whooping Cranes in Texas, and a transect capturing transitions between the Nueces River and Corpus Christi Bay in Texas. These analyses were useful in addressing issues important to coastal management.

GIS Modelling of Intertidal Wetland Exposure Characteristics	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												CROWELL, N.; WEBSTER, T., and O'Driscoll, N.J., 2011. GIS modelling of intertidal wetland exposure characteristics. Journal of Coastal Research, 27(6A), 44-51. West Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Exposure to solar radiation and tidal inundation are important factors for a wide variety of chemical and ecological processes in coastal ecosystems. Accurate quantification of these factors is often difficult on a local scale. To address this research gap, a remote-sensing approach was developed to model inundation and radiation characteristics within an intertidal zone located in the Minas Basin (Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia, Canada). A light detection and ranging (LIDAR) derived elevation model was subjected to tidal modelling based on hourly sea level predictions and solar modelling based on sunrise and sunset times for 2009. Model results indicated an intertidal zone of 145.8 km(2) with an elevation between 6.9 m and 6.8 m. The intertidal zone was determined to contain three unique wetland classes: (1) 4.4 km(2) of high salt marsh, dominated by Spartina patens; (2) 5.0 km(2) of low salt marsh, dominated by Spartina alterniflora; and (3) 63.1 km(2) of nonvegetated marine flat (73.3 km(2) unclassified intertidal). Detailed exposure characteristics were calculated for each of the classes within the intertidal zone at 10-cm vertical intervals. Exposure calculations for 2009 showed that an average of 4.2 km(2) of salt marsh were exposed to solar radiation and 8.4 km(2) were exposed to the atmosphere each hour. Similarly, 11.7 km(2) of marine flat were exposed to solar radiation and 22.9 km(2) were exposed to the atmosphere each hour. The developed remote-sensing techniques successfully established intertidal zones, uniquely identified wetland classes, and modelled inundation and solar exposure characteristics within the study area.

Such information is unavailable for Louisiana at sufficient spatial and thematic detail. We prepared mangrove forest distribution maps of Louisiana (prior to the oil spill) at 1 m and 30 m spatial resolution using aerial photographs and Landsat satellite data, respectively. Image classification was performed using a decision-tree classification approach. We also prepared land-cover change pairs for 1983, 1984, and every 2 y from 1984 to 2010 depicting "ecosystem shifts" (e.g., expansion, retraction, and disappearance). This new spatiotemporal information could be used to assess short-term and long-term impacts of the oil spill on mangroves. Finally, we propose an operational methodology based on remote sensing (Landsat, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer [ASTER], hyperspectral, light detection and ranging [LIDAR], aerial photographs, and field inventory data) to monitor the existing and emerging mangrove areas and their disturbance and regrowth patterns. Several parameters such as spatial distribution, ecosystem shifts, species composition, and tree height/biomass could be measured to assess the impact of the oil spill and mangrove recovery and restoration. Future research priorities will be to quantify the impacts and recovery of mangroves considering multiple stressors and perturbations, including oil spill, winter freeze, sea-level rise, land subsidence, and land-use/land-cover change for the entire Gulf Coast.																	0749-0208					NOV	2011	27	6					1059	1064		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-11-00028.1								WOS:000297278300005						
J	Chassereau, JE; Bell, JM; Torres, R				Chassereau, Jessica E.; Bell, Joseph M.; Torres, Raymond			A comparison of GPS and lidar salt marsh DEMs	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Digital elevation models (DEMs) were compared to characterize how well airborne lidar (light detection and ranging) data depict the microtopography of a salt marsh. 72,000 GPS points and 700,000 lidar points from a 1 km(2) salt marsh island were linearly interpolated using identical DEM configurations. Overall, 78% of lidar elevations were within +/- 0.15 m of the high precision GPS elevations. Spatial arrangement of difference values reveal that lidar performed best on the marsh platform, and poorly along tidal creeks and creek heads. Also, the overall shape of the salt marsh was poorly defined, even where lidar data were within the reported range of accuracy. These observations indicate that lidar appears to be a robust tool for mapping intertidal landscapes. However, lidar DEMs may not adequately resolve the microtopographic variations of a salt marsh, and for research questions that require accurate depiction of small-scale tidal creek networks and subtle terrain features lidar data should be augmented with other information.

Evaluation of space adequateness of shrimp farms in Southern Brazil	ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS												In Rio Grande do Sul State, there are four marine shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) farms in the municipal districts of Sao Jose do Norte and Rio Grande, and other four with previous license for operation. Thus, the present study aimed to identify and characterize areas for marine shrimp farming located in the Southern portion of the Patos Lagoon estuary (32 degrees 00'S 52 degrees 00'W) by employing the analysis of satellite remote sensing (Landsat TM and ETM+/Google Earth), airborne remote sensing (35mm system ADAR 1000), terrestrial remote sensing (RICOH 500SE), and field expeditions, integrating data in a Geographical Information System (IDRISI Andes). As a result, the enterprises were built on coastal fields or in obliterated dune areas, which are favorable for cultivation. The proximity of possible consuming markets and local labor, relatively good access roads and local technical support also favor the projects. However, there must be caution in terms of changes in the original projects, which could cause environmental impacts and noncompliance of environmental norms, such as the occupation of salt marsh areas. Based on the obtained information, instruments can be created to help inherent legal decision-making to manage the activity for futures enterprises.				freitas, rodrigo/H-3130-2011	Poersch, Luis/0000-0002-1663-6252; Digorandow, Rodrigo Randow de Freitas/0000-0003-0170-6892												0001-3765					SEP	2011	83	3					1069	1076		10.1590/S0001-37652011005000024								WOS:000294126600025	21808923					
J	Kearney, MS; Riter, JCA				Kearney, Michael S.; Riter, J. C. Alexis			Inter-annual variability in Delaware Bay brackish marsh vegetation, USA	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Reports of sudden marsh browning, or even dieback, suggest that the many heretofore "healthy" coastal marshes have reached some tipping point with respect to sea level rise, necessitating better and more widespread monitoring. In this paper, we examine spatial and temporal variations in marsh vegetation cover, substrate wetness, and sediment exposure for mesohaline to oligohaline marshes in Delaware Bay over a 15-year period (1993-2008) using three spectral indices (the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, the Normalized Difference Water Index, and the Normalized Difference Soil Index) based on Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper + imagery. In general, degrading marsh areas show low percentages of vegetation cover compared to bare marsh substrate, and substrate wetness tends to be high. But this characterization is not consistent from one year to the next, and in marshes that are in incipient stages of degradation, apparent vegetation health can improve substantially for a few years. Detailed transect data collected from July to September in an area of Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge, where little marsh loss was evident, document considerable variability in vegetation dynamics. The marshes along the transect kept pace with the major transgressive pulse of the 1990s, but as the rate of sea level rise decreased after 2000, vegetation vigor fell, especially in 2004, the year after Hurricane Isabel. The years of maximum vegetation cover, 2003 and 2005, coincided with short-term, sea level high stands and/or very wet and cooler summers. We theorize that after keeping up with the dramatic rise in sea level during the 1990s, marsh surface elevations in these microtidal systems are now too high to allow adequate flushing of sulfides and low dissolved oxygen waters except for high precipitation events or short-term sea level rises. If this situation were to continue, it could affect the "health" of marshes that otherwise were accommodating high rates of sea level rise well.																	0923-4861					AUG	2011	19	4					373	388		10.1007/s11273-011-9222-6								WOS:000292938100006

We mapped vegetation at six tidal marshes (two natural, four restored) in the San Francisco Estuary, CA, USA, between 2003 and 2004 using detailed vegetation field surveys and high spatial-resolution color-infrared aerial photography. Vegetation classes were determined by performing hierarchical agglomerative clustering on the field data collected from each tidal marsh. Supervised classification of the CIR photography resulted in vegetation class mapping accuracies ranging from 70 to 92%; 10 out of 12 classification accuracies were above 80%, demonstrating the potential to map emergent wetland vegetation. The number of vegetation classes decreased with salinity, and increased with size and age. In general, landscape diversity, as measured by the Shannon's diversity index, also decreased with salinity, with an exception for the most saline site, a newly restored marsh. Vegetation change between years is evident, but the differences across sites in composition and pattern were larger than change within sites over two growing seasons.

Estimating sediment and caesium-137 fluxes in the Ribble Estuary through time-series airborne remote sensing	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY												High spatial and temporal resolution airborne imagery were acquired for the Ribble Estuary, North West England in 1997 and 2003, to assess the application of time-series airborne remote sensing to quantify total suspended sediment and radionuclide fluxes during a flood and ebb tide sequence. Concomitant measurements of suspended particulate matter (SPM) and water column turbidity were obtained during the time-series image acquisition for the flood and ebb tide sequence on the 17th July 2003 to verify the assumption of a vertically well mixed estuary and thus justifying the vertical extrapolation of spatially integrated estimate of surface SPM. The (137)Cs activity concentrations were calculated from a relatively stable relationship between SPM and (137)Cs for the Ribble Estuary. Total estuary wide budgets of sediment and (137)Cs were obtained by combining the image-derived estimates of surface SPM and (137)Cs with estimates of water volume from a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model (VERSE) developed for the Ribble Estuary. These indicate that around 10,000 tonnes of sediment and 2.72 GBq of (137)Cs were deposited over the tidal sequence monitored in July 2003. This compared favourably with bed height elevation change estimated from field work. An uncertainty analysis on the total sediment and (137)Cs flux yielded a total budget of the order of 40% on the final estimate. The results represent a novel approach to providing a spatially integrated estimate of the total net sediment and radionuclide flux in an intertidal environment over a flood and ebb tide sequence.

J	Kelly, M; Tuxen, KA; Stralberg, D				Kelly, Maggi; Tuxen, Karin A.; Stralberg, Diana			Mapping changes to vegetation pattern in a restoring wetland: Finding pattern metrics that are consistent across spatial scale and time	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Tidal salt marshes in the San Francisco Estuary region display heterogeneous vegetation patterns that influence wetland function and provide adequate habitat for native or endangered wildlife. In addition to analyzing the extent of vegetation, monitoring the dynamics of vegetation pattern within restoring wetlands can offer valuable information about the restoration process. Pattern metrics, derived from classified remotely sensed imagery, have been used to measure composition and configuration of patches and landscapes, but they can be unpredictable across scales, and inconsistent across time. We sought to identify pattern metrics that are consistent across spatial scale and time - and thus robust measures of vegetation and habitat configuration - for a restored tidal marsh in the San Francisco Bay, CA, USA. We used high-resolution (20 cm) remotely sensed color infrared imagery to map vegetation pattern over 2 years, and performed a multi-scale analysis of derived vegetation pattern metrics. We looked at the influence on metrics of changes in grain size through resampling and changes in minimum mapping unit (MMU) through smoothing. We examined composition, complexity, connectivity and heterogeneity metrics, focusing on perennial pickleweed (Sarcocornia panfica), a dominant marsh plant. At our site, pickleweed patches grew larger, more irregularly shaped, and closely spaced over time, while the overall landscape became more diverse. Of the two scale factors examined, grain size was more consistent than MMU in terms of identifying relative change in composition and configuration of wetland marsh vegetation over time. Most metrics exhibited unstable behavior with larger MMUs. With small MMUs, most metrics were consistent across grain sizes, from fine (e.g. 0.16m(2)) to relatively large (e.g. 16m(2)) pixel sizes. Scale relationships were more variable at the landcover class level than at the landscape level (across all classes). This information may be useful to applied restoration practitioners, and adds to our general understanding of vegetation change in a restoring marsh. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Use of Multi-Sensor Data to Identify and Map Tropical Coastal Wetlands in the Amazon of Northern Brazil	WETLANDS												Recognizing and mapping wetlands in the Amazon coastal from optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is critical to understand coastal evolution. Multispectral optical images are obtained only during the dry season, while SAR images can be acquired throughout the year, but present low spectral resolution. The aim of this paper was to investigate the use of remote sensing images, which allowed the accurate identification and mapping of coastal environments based on the complementary information provided by the synergism of multisensory data and supervised classifications with statistical validation from the overall accuracy and Kappa index. The mapping of these environments was based on the supervised classification of Landsat ETM+ images and ETM+-SAR product, which permitted the identification of eight classes: coastal plateau, mangroves, floodplain + freshwater marshes, tidal sandflats + sandbars + ebb-tidal delta, macrotidal beaches, water, frontal dunes + paleodunes + interdunes + mobile dunes, and salt marshes. Overall accuracy and Kappa indices for the classification maps of the wetland study area were 93.3% and 0.909 for Landsat ETM+ and 93.8% and 0.917 for the ETM+-SAR product. This indicates that the integrated product provides additional information, which permits the more efficient identification and mapping of tropical coastal wetlands.

Tasmanian coastal saltmarsh community transitions associated with climate change and relative sea level rise 1975-2009	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Coastal saltmarshes are reputed to be one of the most vulnerable communities to global warming, with widespread evidence of retreat and movement of lower marsh vegetation into areas previously occupied by upper marsh vegetation in response to rising sea levels, and potential changes in community composition from changes in rainfall, temperature and wind. We undertook an investigation of decades scale change in the distributions of saltmarsh communities defined by dominant species, using historic vegetation maps, remote sensing imagery and extensive field data collection. Our study area in south-eastern Tasmania has suffered a marked increase in temperatures and wind speeds and a marked decrease in rainfall since 1975, with sea level rising at a rate of 0.8 mm per annum. We therefore tested the hypothesis that these changes would result in a shift in saltmarsh community composition towards more salt- and inundation-tolerant communities and salt scalds. Eighteen percent of the 1975 marsh was lost to direct human modification and a net 4% was lost to coastal retreat. One large marsh was cut off from the sea then burned, then reconnected with the sea. The vegetation change between 1975 and 2009 in other parts of the saltmarshes occurred in 21% of their 1975 area. Most of the community transitions were consistent with increasing aridity. Thus, our results indicate that global warming has already caused marked changes in community composition in saltmarsh in Tasmania.

These maps indicate not only vegetation types, plant associations and sediment types but also hard structures, such as quays, locks, sluices and roads. Different remote sensing techniques were used to collect the data necessary to produce the required detailed maps. During the months of July and August 2007 an airborne flight campaign took place to collect hyperspectral and LiDAR data of the Scheldt basin and the Nete catchments. These rivers have a total length of about 240 km. The Airborne Imaging Spectrometer for Applications (AISA) Eagle sensor acquired hyperspectral data in 32 spectral bands covering the visible/near-infrared (VIS/NIR) part of the electromagnetic spectrum with a ground resolution of 1 m. A multiple binary classification algorithm based on Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to map the salt marshes and riverbank vegetation. Ground truth information, that is vegetation and sediment types, together with their geographical locations collected around the time of the flight campaign, was used to train the classifier in the later classification step. Laser scanning was performed using the Riegl LMS-Q560. The LiDAR dataset obtained had a resolution of at least 1 point per m2 and was used to produce a digital elevation model (DEM) that contains all elements of the terrain. From this DEM a digital terrain model (DTM) was derived by applying appropriate filtering techniques. The elevation models were used primarily to derive information on the height, slope and aspect of the banks and dikes, but they also served as expert knowledge in the classification of the mud flats and bank vegetation. Overall, this work illustrates how airborne hyperspectral and LiDAR data can be used to derive highly detailed maps of the sediments, vegetation and hard structures along tidal rivers in large river basins. It also shows how large datasets can be handled in an expert system, in combination with different classification techniques, to produce the required result and accuracy.																	0143-1161						2011	32	10					2905	2918	PII 937948087	10.1080/01431161003745632								WOS:000290985000013

The proposed classifier generalizes the properties of SVMs to the identification and modeling of the abundances of classes in mixed pixels by using fuzzy logic. This results in the definition of a fuzzy-input fuzzy-output support vector machine (F-2 SVM) classifier that can: 1) process fuzzy information given as input to the classification algorithm for modeling the subpixel information in the learning phase of the classifier and 2) provide a fuzzy modeling of the classification results, allowing a relation many-to-one between classes and pixels. The presented binary F SVM can address multicategory problems according to two strategies: the fuzzy one-against-all (FOAA) and the fuzzy one-against-one (FOAO) strategies. These strategies generalize to the fuzzy case techniques based upon ensembles of binary classifiers used for addressing multicategory problems in crisp classification problems. The effectiveness of the proposed F SVM classifier is tested on three problems related to image classification in presence of mixed pixels having different characteristics. Experimental results confirm the validity of the proposed subpixel classification method.

J	Brisson, J; de Blois, S; Lavoie, C				Brisson, Jacques; de Blois, Sylvie; Lavoie, Claude			Roadside as Invasion Pathway for Common Reed (Phragmites australis)	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												The rapid progression of an invasive genotype of common reed along roads and other linear infrastructures in North America provides one of the most spectacular examples of the role of transportation corridors as invasion pathways. In this paper, we discuss ecological patterns and processes in roadside habitats important for understanding the invasion dynamics of common reed from coastal areas inland. Frequent disturbances in roadsides combined with potentially high levels of nutrients from adjacent land and stress conditions (from deicing salt and other pollutants) mimic the conditions unfortunately found more and more in natural wetlands. The novel contribution of roads is the creation of linear wetlands with an unprecedented level of connectivity. Genetic evidence shows that invasion inland coincides with the intensification of the road network. Time series analysis of remote sensing data reveals impressive rates of invasion of roadsides and other linear infrastructures, suggesting prime conditions for common reed in these novel habitats. Whereas reed dispersal along roads was thought to be largely due to rhizome transport, new evidence suggests a significant contribution of sexual reproduction and seedling establishment, likely enhanced by climate warming at northern latitudes. There is little evidence that other wetland plants can slow down vegetative expansion of common reed in roadside habitats, but plant cover could prevent seedling establishment and shading by shrubs and trees limit lateral clonal expansion. The fact that common reed possibly provides water treatment and other ecosystem services in roadsides must be carefully weighed against the threat to biodiversity in natural systems. All this begs for investigating urgently if, where, and how we should intervene without compromising the great value of wetlands of conservation interest intersected by roads.

Recently developed technologies and methods introduce the capability to create fine-scale, system-wide databases to quantitatively characterize salt marsh geomorphology in support of improved understanding of the evolution of intertidal systems. This study combines the use of 20-cm AIMS-1 multispectral imagery flown at spring high and low tides with a LIDAR-derived digital elevation mode (DEM) of a New England estuarine system to quantify relationships among marsh features, their metrics, elevations, and tidal datums. The methods used to quantify features across an intertidal watershed in its entirety represent a significant advance in support of future development of process-driven models to explain these observations. Geomorphological analyses of the distribution of marsh features at the Great Marsh, Massachusetts, study area support field observations that water-filled ponds are concentrated in regions of the marsh around and above mean higher high water (MHHW), whereas drained ponds and pannes are distributed across the marsh platform; pannes are most abundant in the high marsh. These analyses are complicated by human interference in the form of ditches, which have the general effect of both draining ponds and inhibiting pond formation, altering the natural distribution of drained ponds, pannes, and water-filled ponds. However, the geomorphic distribution of pannes and ponds indicates strong elevational control on feature formation, most likely as a function of depth and duration of inundation.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SEP	2010	26	5					809	816		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-09-00101.1								WOS:000282358200003						
J	Kearney, MS; Rogers, AS				Kearney, M. S.; Rogers, A. S.			Forecasting sites of future coastal marsh loss using topographical relationships and logistic regression	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The last two assessments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predict that rates of sea level rise will begin to accelerate by c. 2030-2040 CE. Considering that many marsh systems are already under threat from existing sea level trends, a dramatic upswing in rate only a few decades away poses critical questions about what the future may hold for these marshes (and those yet to manifest sea level impacts) requires coast-wide assessments. Extrapolations of detailed historical trends traditionally have provided the least equivocal way of providing such information, but the necessary data required for this approach are often lacking. In this paper, we describe how logistic regression analysis applied to spatial data on marsh loss and degradation-in this case derived from a validated Landsat-based marsh condition model-and its relation to such readily determined parameters as distance from shorelines or tidal creeks can be used to predict where future marsh losses may occur, even in those systems not presently affected. As such, it affords more targeted information for planning than can be had from general submergence versus accretion/elevation change models (e.g., SLAMM) that are limited by the paucity of vertical accretion data. The results also reinforce the concept that marsh adjustment to sea level rise can be broadly deduced at the landscape level, which in some respects is independent of marsh type and is responsive to tidal frame and coastal profile.																	0923-4861					AUG	2010	18	4					449	461		10.1007/s11273-010-9178-y								WOS:000280074900004						
J	Feilhauer, H; Oerke, EC; Schmidtlein, S				Feilhauer, Hannes; Oerke, Erich-Christian; Schmidtlein, Sebastian			Quantifying empirical relations between planted species mixtures and canopy reflectance with PROTEST	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Mapping plant species composition of mixed vegetation stands with remote sensing is a complicated task. Uncertainties may arise from similar spectral signatures of different plant species as well as from variable influences of prevailing plant states (e.g., growth stages, vigor, or stress levels). Despite these uncertainties, empirical approaches may often be able to take up the challenge. However, their performance is likely to be affected by the temporal variability of empirical relations between reflectance and plant species composition. To assess some aspects of this temporal variability, we performed a greenhouse study. Three mixed stands of grassland species were planted with defined spatial variation in species proportions. The canopy reflectance of these mixed stands was measured with a field spectrometer over a period of three months. Confounding external influences on plant states apart from maturation were minimized. The suitability of canopy reflectance and derivative reflectance to draw conclusions on differences in qualitative species mixtures between the stands was tested with a classification approach (Spectral Angle Mapper, SAM). Procrustean randomization test (PROTEST), which is to our knowledge new to the field of remote sensing, was applied in combination with Isometric Feature Mapping to quantify the spectral variation caused by within-stand spatial variation in species proportions. Model fits in both analyses increased with progressing plant development; further, utilization of derivative reflectance improved the model fits. Regardless of the within-stand variation, SAM enabled a successful discrimination of the three stands with an average overall accuracy of 85% (reflectance) and 92% (derivative reflectance). In PROTEST analysis, spatial variation in reflectance was successfully related to within-stand variation in species proportions. However, observed influences of variable growth stages and health states on these relations were considerable. The temporal variation of these relations (r=0.27-0.73 for reflectance and 0.48-0.73 for derivative reflectance) was quantified for the first time under controlled conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

As part of an interdisciplinary wetland monitoring project in San Francisco Bay, we developed a suite of 1-m pixel-level spatial metrics describing patterns in marsh vegetation and geomorphology for six sites across a large salinity gradient. These metrics, based on multi-spectral aerial imagery and derived vegetation maps, provided a basis for fine-scale spatial modeling of avian habitat potential. Using common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas), song sparrow (Melospiza melodia), and black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis) abundance data, we developed statistical models with relatively high explanatory power. In each case, models were improved by including vegetation-map variables, but variables directly extracted from aerial imagery were more reliable indicators of avian abundance. Although results varied by species, our models achieved reasonable within-site predictive success. When predicting to sites not used in the training set, however, validation results were inconsistent and often poor, suggesting that these models should be used with caution outside of the original study sites. As remotely sensed data become more readily available, our methods may be applied to a diverse range of sites, resulting in improved model generality and applicability.

J	Li, J; Gao, S; Wang, YP				Li Jing; Gao Shu; Wang Yaping			Invading cord grass vegetation changes analyzed from Landsat-TM imageries: a case study from the Wanggang area, Jiangsu coast, eastern China	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												Cord grass colonization on the Jiangsu coast, eastern China, modifies the native salt marshes in terms of ecosystem structure. The Landsat TM images from 1992 to 2003 were analyzed to identify salt-marsh vegetation distribution patterns and their changes over this coastal region, in order to evaluate the effects of the spreading of the artificially introduced halophyte Spartina. Supervised classification was performed using Bands 3, 4 and 5 in conjunction with in situ training samples, to derive the distribution pattern of the vegetation in the study area. Further, in order to identify the intertidal areas with different tidal elevations, a data treatment procedure was designed to combine regional water level data using harmonic analysis with the waterlines on the TM images extracted by density slice. The results show that: (1) the Spartina alterniflora area has been expanding towards the sea rapidly since it was introduced, especially at initial stages; (2) in the upper part of the inter-tidal zone, the local marsh plant Suaeda salsa and the exotic species Spartina anglica were present only near the sea dyke, occupying only a small part of the entire salt marsh, and the area of these two species has been reduced by land reclamation; (3) there has been a trend for Spartina alterniflora to become the dominant species in the salt marshes in the study area; and (4) the elevation of Spartina alterniflora's seaward fringe was close to mean high water on neaps, and its landward boundary was slightly higher than mean high water. The salt marsh environment of the study area has been modified rapidly by the Spartina vegetation for the last 12 years.

Balloon imagery verification of remotely sensed Phragmites australis expansion in an urban estuary of New Jersey, USA	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												The invasion of the exotic common reed (Phragmites australis) is increasingly displacing local native species from northeastern coastal estuaries. This study evaluates the accuracy of a remote sensing technique to map the distribution of common reed, monitor the rate of invasion and determine areas of natural resistance to invasion. The current invasion footprint of Phragmites in the Hackensack Meadowlands District in Northern New Jersey was determined using high spectral and spatial resolution hyperspectral imagery. A tethered balloon-based imaging device with limited coverage area was used to assess the accuracy of the hyperspectral imagery classification. The accuracy assessment based on true color balloon images revealed that the hyperspectral classification technique from images covering hundreds of hectares was 90% accurate in separating the dominant common reed-invaded areas from the native vegetation. Furthermore, linear spectral un-mixing techniques for sub-pixel classification revealed that for mixed areas where Phragmites covered 75% or more of a pixel, the classification was correct 96% of the time. The accuracy dropped to 52% for pixels that contained 25% or less of Phragmites cover, and was only 4% for pixels where invasive and native species cover was the same (50-50%). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J	Collin, A; Long, B; Archambault, P				Collin, Antoine; Long, Bernard; Archambault, Phillippe			Salt-marsh characterization, zonation assessment and mapping through a dual-wavelength LiDAR	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Linking intertidal processes to their natural patterns within a framework of coastal erosion requires monitoring techniques providing high-resolution spatio-temporal data from the scale of processes to this of patterns. The Scanning Hydrographic Operational Airborne LiDAR Survey (SHOALS) consists of a ubiquitous topographic and bathymetric LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) system that has become an important technology for generating high-resolution Digital Terrain Models (DTM) and Digital Surface Models (DSM) over intertidal landscapes. The objectives of this project are i) to highlight the capacity of SHOALS Topography and intensity data (Red and Near-InfiraRed) to detect intertidal vegetation, ii) to assess the salt-marsh zonation, and iii) to map intertidal habitats and its adjacent coastal areas (Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada). The study area was selected based on the spectrum of land cover types, encompassing beach, salt-marsh, arable farm and urban coastal environments. Surfaces constructed from the LiDAR survey included DSM, DTM, Normalized Surface Model (NSM), Digital Intensity Model for InfraRed (DIMI), Digital Intensity Model for Red (DIMR), and Normalized Difference LiDAR Vegetation Index Model (NDLVIM), derived from the two previous models. The correlation between the so-called NDLVI and the amount of salt-marsh vegetation, measured in situ, was 0.87 (p<0.01). Then, LiDAR-assessed salt-marsh ecological zonation allowed finding out intermediate and strong relationships between NDLVI and Topography (r(2) = 0.89, p<0.038) and Topographic heterogeneity (r(2) = 0.54, p<0.1394), respectively. Finally, NDLVI and Topography surfaces were classified using maximum likelihood algorithm into 17 classes. whose overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were 91.89% and 0.9088, respectively. These results support that (1) intertidal vegetation can be discriminated by NDLVI, (2) salt-marsh ecological zonation pattern, and (3) accurate coastal land cover maps can be satisfactorily generated from a single LiDAR survey using the NDLVIM and DTM approach.

PATAGONIAN SALT MARSHES: THE SOIL EFFECTS ON THE NDVI RESPONSE	THALASSAS												Patagonian and Fueguian salt marshes extend from 39 to 55 degrees S with different tidal and climatic effects. These effects conditioned their behaviour, and remote sensing is a useful tool to analyse these latitudinal trends, being the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) the most common parameter recommended. One of the most difficult issue is to recognize the cord grass (Spartina) from the Sarcocornia plains. Both plants have similar response to the near infrared (NIR) and red bands although Spartina can cover entirely the tidal flat only when it is tall enough. In the semiarid Patagonia, NDVI should be adjusted to soil effects in order to evaluate marsh distribution. However, marshes do not cover entirely the tidal flats and there are differences that could be envisaged to the sediment composition of these flats but also to the silting capacity of these plants.

Habitat suitability modelling of an invasive plant with advanced remote sensing data	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim Lepidium latifolium (Brassicaceae; perennial pepperweed) is a noxious Eurasian weed invading riparian and wetland areas of the western USA. Understanding which sites are most susceptible to invasion by L. latifolium will allow more efficient management of this weed. We assessed the ability of advanced remote sensing techniques to develop habitat suitability models for L. latifolium. Location San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, California, USA. Methods Lepidium latifolium distribution was mapped with hyperspectral image data of Rush Ranch Open Space Preserve, providing presence/absence data to train and validate habitat models. A high-resolution light detection and ranging digital elevation model was used to derive predictor environmental variables (distance to channel, distance to upland, elevation, slope, aspect and convexity). Aggregate decision tree models were used to predict the potential distribution of this species. Results Lepidium latifolium infested two zones: near the marshland-upland margin and along channels within the marsh. Topographical data, which are typically strongly correlated with wetland species distributions, were relatively unimportant to L. latifolium occurrence, although relevant microtopography information, particularly relative elevation, was subsumed in the distance to channel variable. The map of potential L. latifolium distribution reveals that Rush Ranch contains considerable habitat that it is susceptible to continued invasion. Main conclusions Lepidium latifolium invades relatively less stressful sites along the inundation and salinity gradients. Advanced remote sensing datasets were shown to be sufficient for species distribution modelling. Remote sensing offers powerful tools that deserve wider use in ecological research and management.																	1366-9516	1472-4642				JUL	2009	15	4					627	640		10.1111/j.1472-4642.2009.00568.x								WOS:000266874700008						
J	McKinney, RA; Charpentier, MA; Wigand, C				McKinney, Richard A.; Charpentier, Michael A.; Wigand, Cathleen			Assessing the wildlife habitat value of New England salt marshes: I. Model and application	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												We developed an assessment model to quantify the wildlife habitat value of New England salt marshes based on marsh characteristics and the presence of habitat types that influence habitat use by terrestrial wildlife. Applying the model to 12 salt marshes located in Narragansett Bay, RI resulted in assessment scores that ranged over a factor of 1.5 from lowest to highest. Pre-classifying the results based on marsh size and morphology helped to compare assessment scores between marshes, and demonstrated that even the lower ranking marshes had substantial habitat value. Stepwise multiple regression analysis of assessment scores and model components demonstrated that salt marsh morphology, the degree of anthropogenic modification, and salt marsh vegetative heterogeneity were significant variables and accounted for 91.3% of the variability in component scores. Our results suggest that targeting these components for restoration may lead to improved assessment scores for our study marshes. We also examined the use of lower resolution remote sensing data in the assessment in order to minimize the time and effort required to complete the model. Scores obtained using smaller-scale, lower resolution data were significantly lower than those obtained using larger-scale, higher resolution data (df = 11; t = 2.2; p < 0.001). The difference was significantly positively correlated with the portion of the assessment score that could be attributed to trees, pools, and pannes and marsh size (r (2) =0.50, F = 4.6, p = 0.04), and could indicate a bias against smaller, more heterogeneous marshes. We conclude that potential differences need to be weighed against the time benefit of using this type of data, bearing in mind the marsh size and the goals of the assessment. Overall, our assessment can provide information to aid in prioritizing marshes for protection and restoration, identify marshes that may harbor significant biodiversity, or help monitor changes in habitat value over time.																	0167-6369					JUL	2009	154	1-4					29	40		10.1007/s10661-008-0375-6								WOS:000267824400004	18592388

Since 1978, the increasing of the activities of Le Havre port, located at the mouth of the estuary, has accelerated the construction work rate. Several dykes, a bridge, and new port facilities have been constructed in rapid succession, modifying considerably the hydrodynamic conditions which sustain a partially vegetated sandy-muddy tidal flat located in the North bank of the estuary between the new port of Le Havre and the Normandy bridge achieved in 1995. The present study deals with the morphological evolution of this zone from 1978 to 2005. The use of a low altitude remote sensing technique combined with traditional methods of ground survey and probes allow to demonstrate the impact of human activities on sedimentary and vegetation dynamics. The Northern mudflat of the estuary is the most affected by these human activities, which surface have reduced of 62% during the last 27 years with an intensified local erosion during the last 27 months corresponding to a loss 1250 000 m(3) of fine-grained sediment. At the same time, the general sanding up in the channel of the zone has caused a loss of more than 31% of the tidal prism, more than three quarters of which occurred during the last three years. Results also establish that the response times of the sedimentary or topographic readjustment to an installation depend on the extent and the nature of the construction. In fact, the sedimentary readjustments to an installation can be delayed by up to 10 years in the case of the Seine estuary. This delay is explained by a rapid succession of construction works which may occult the effect of a single installation. Except in the case of a dyke built perpendicular to ebb and flood currents, the impacts of these installations reach a hydro-sedimentary equilibrium on the level between 1 and 7 years after their completion.

The launch of novel remote sensor MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer) provided us with an opportunity to make a new trial of studying the rapid vegetation succession in estuarine wetlands. In this study, the spatiotemporal variations of vegetation cover and tidal flat elevation along a transect (covering 6 pixels of MODIS) of an estuarine wetland at Dongtan, Chongming Island, in Yangtze River estuary, China were investigated to assess its rapid vegetation succession and physical conditions. By combining the field data collected, the time series of MODIS-based VIs (vegetation indices), including NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), EVI (enhanced vegetation index) and MSAVI (modified soil adjusted vegetation index), and a water index, LSWI (land surface water index) were utilized to characterize the rapid vegetation succession between 2001 and 2006. We found that NDVI, EVI and MSAVI exhibited significant spatial and temporal correlations with vegetation succession, while LSWI behaved in a positive manner with surface water and soil moisture along with the successional stages. In order to take the advantages of both VIs and water index, a composite index of VWR (vegetation water ratio) combining LSWI and EVI or MSAVI was proposed in this paper. This index facilitates the identification of vegetation succession by simply comparing the values of VWR at different stages, and therefore it could track vegetation succession and estimate community spread rate. Additionally, this study presented an attempt of using MODIS datasets to monitor the change of tidal flat elevation, which demonstrated a potential remote sensing application in geodesy of coastal and estuarine areas.

Effects of the Herbicide Diuron on Cordgrass (Spartina foliosa) Reflectance and Photosynthetic Parameters	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Early indicators of salt marsh plant stress are needed to detect stress before it is manifested as changes in biomass and coverage. We explored a variety of leaf-level spectral reflectance and fluorescence variables as indicators of stress in response to the herbicide diuron. Diuron, a Photosystem II inhibitor, is heavily used in areas adjacent to estuaries, but its ecological effects are just beginning to be recognized. In a greenhouse experiment, we exposed Spartina foliosa, the native cordgrass in California salt marshes, to two levels of diuron. After plant exposure to diuron for 28 days, all spectral reflectance indices and virtually all fluorescence parameters indicated reduced pigment and photosynthetic function, verified as reduced CO(2) assimilation. Diuron exposure was not evident, however, in plant morphometry, indicating that reflectance and fluorescence were effective indicators of sub-lethal diuron exposure. Several indices (spectral reflectance index ARI and fluorescence parameters EQY, Fo, and maximum rETR) were sensitive to diuron concentration. In field trials, most of the indices as well as biomass, % cover, and canopy height varied predictably and significantly across a pesticide gradient. In the field, ARI and Fo regressed most significantly and strongly with pesticide levels. The responses of ARI and Fo in both the laboratory and the field make these indices promising as sensitive, rapid, non-destructive indicators of responses of S. foliosa to herbicides in the field. These techniques are employed in remote sensing and could potentially provide a link between landscapes of stressed vegetation and the causative stressor(s), which is crucial for effective regulation of pollution.																	1559-2723					JAN	2009	32	1					146	157		10.1007/s12237-008-9114-z								WOS:000262504600011

Remote monitoring of hypersaline environments in San Francisco Bay, CA, USA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												As part of a historic remediation project, approximately 61km2 of salt evaporation ponds in the southern portion of San Francisco Bay, CA (USA) are scheduled for restoration to natural tidal marsh habitat over the next several decades. We have investigated the correlation of remotely sensed infrared spectral information with in situ field measurements and sampling, and evaluated the usefulness of a remote sensing approach to monitor salinity and population distributions of microbial communities in the hypersaline ponds. The Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) instrument operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory has created a ten-year archive of spectral information concerning these ponds. We utilized spectral signatures of microbial populations that are sensitive to salinity, and trained a supervised classification algorithm to identify physical parameters from an AVIRIS scene based upon microbe spectra gathered in the field using a portable visible to near-infrared (VNIR) spectrometer. Our results indicate that automated analyses of hyperspectral observations are capable of detecting variations in microbial populations and discriminating corresponding salinity levels.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2009	30	11					2933	2949	PII 912620353	10.1080/01431160802558642								WOS:000267263000013

An equilibrium profile model for retreating marsh shorelines in southeast Louisiana	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Louisiana's coastal marshes are experiencing the highest wetland loss rates in the U.S., in part due to subsidence-driven relative sea-level rise. These marshes are also vulnerable to the erosive power of wave attack: 1) on the marsh edge adjacent to open-water bodies, and 2) after the marsh platform is Submerged. Marsh shorelines in Barataria Bay, Breton Sound, and the active Balize delta of southeastern Louisiana were examined in areas where the subaerial marsh platform had disappeared since 1932. Vibracore transects of marsh and adjacent bay surface sediments (to similar to 2 m depth) were analyzed using geotechnical, stratigraphic, and radiochemical (137-Cs and 210-Pb) methods, and the subaerial-to-subaqueous transition of the marsh was mapped for elevation using standard stadia rod transit and fathometer measurements. Results indicate that marsh edge erosion of the platform takes place subaqueously until water depths of similar to 1.5 m are reached. This is observed even in interior pond regions, but the shoreface elevation profiles are a function of fetch: exposed open bay sites display greater incision (depth and rate) of the marsh platform than protected interior bay or pond sites. Core stratigraphy reveals that the outer part of the subaqueous platform switches from erosional to depositional as retreat proceeds, covering the incised marsh deposits unconformably with estuarine shelly muds. 137-Cs and excess 210-Pb activity indicates that these muds are deposited within a few decades of subaerial marsh loss. The consistency of the cross-shore profile results suggests that a single profile of equilibrium can approximate the morphology of eroding marsh edges in southeast Louisiana: platform stratigraphy and resistance to erosion have a limited effect on profile shape. This equilibrium profile and remote sensing images of shoreline change are used to estimate the sediment yield to adjacent estuarine areas by this process. On average, 1.5 m(3) of sediment are yielded per m shoreline length annually from both Barataria Bay and Breton Sound. Due to the highly organic nature of the eroded sediment (similar to 30%), this supply of organic-rich material could significantly impact estuarine productivity and hypoxia on the Louisiana continental shelf.

Using both satellite imagery and field spectral measurements, this study examines plant productivity at the assemblage and individual specimen level. Longer term growth trends (basal area increase in tree cores) were also studied. Leaf chlorophyll content within the hardwood assemblage showed a threshold model for metal tolerance, decreasing significantly beyond a soil total metal load (TML) of 3.0. Biomass production (calculated with RG - Red/Green Ratio Index) in Betula populifolia (gray birch), the co-dominant tree species, had an inverse relationship with the Zn concentration in leaf tissue during the growing season.

Visible to near-infrared (VNIR) reflectance spectra were measured in the field over the 2004-2006 growing seasons to assess the phenological variability of the dominant marsh plant species, Spartina patens, Phragmites australis and Typha spp. Phragmites was best distinguished from other species by its high NIR response late in the growing season. Typha spp. had a high red/green ratio and S. patens had a unique green/blue ratio relative to other species throughout the bulk of the growing season. The field spectra and single date (2004) LiDAR canopy height data were used to define an object-oriented classification methodology for the three plant communities in multi-temporal QuickBird multispectral imagery collected over the same time interval. The classification was validated using an extensive field inventory of marsh species. Overall maximum fuzzy accuracy for the classification was 97% for Phragmites, 63% for Typha spp. and 80% for S. patens meadows and improved to 97%, 76%. and 92%, respectively, using a fuzzy acceptable match measure. This study demonstrated the importance of the timing of image acquisition for the identification of targeted plant species in a heterogeneous marsh. These datasets and protocols may provide coastal resource managers, municipal officials and researchers a set of recommended guidelines for remote sensing data collection for marsh inventory and monitoring.

The use of hyperspectral remote sensing to assess vascular plant species richness on Horn Island, Mississippi	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Relationships of plant species richness with spectral indices derived from airborne hyperspectral image data were evaluated for several habitat-types on Horn Island, Mississippi, northern Gulf of Mexico. A 126-band hyperspectral data cube of Horn Island acquired by the HyMap imaging system covered the 450-2500 nm spectrum at a 3 m Ground Sample Distance (GSD). Reflectance spectra were extracted from 5-11 HyMap pixels representing each of 95,15-m vegetation line transects that were established randomly on the island. In simple regressions, no index related to richness when data from all habitat-types were combined. a number of reflectance and spectral derivative indices related significantly (p <= 0.05) with richness However, when habitat-types were considered separately. Only those indices which passed a fidelity test based on the consistency of index response to changes in plant and environmental moisture were selected as potentially reliable indicators of richness. Transect coefficient of variation (CV) for R-1056/R-966 and R-920/R-834 related negatively with richness in meadows and transition zones, respectively. The CV of R-951/R-1100 and R-904 related negatively with woodland richness. Negative regression slopes, field observations and spectral mixtures indicated that richness in these habitats declined with increased bare soil exposure. In marsh habitat, positive relationships of richness with mean R-618/R-2475 or the CV of R-514/R-2459 were explained by the increasing presence and patchy distribution of broadleaved vegetation in the progression from wetter, low-richness sites to slightly-elevated, higher-richness sites. Present results combined with those of a previous grassland study suggested that remotely-sensed indicators of soil exposure may be generally useful in the assessment of plant species richness in mesic habitats.

Field investigation, profile analysis, geographical information analysis, and remote sensing were employed in combination to study the effect of sediment on Spartina alterniflora salt marshes of the coast in Jiangsu Province, East China. The results indicated that the propagation of Spartina alterniflora salt marshes was closely related to regional sediment conditions, especially the supply of fine-grained materials. Additionally, because of the dense and high grass in Spartina alterniflora salt marshes, wave energy and tidal currents were baffled and weaker than those of the adjacent, unvegetated mud flats.

Besides field observations, it is necessary to analyze the land cover of wetlands through the color infrared (CIR) aerial photography or remote sensing image. In this paper, we designed an evolving neural network classifier using variable string genetic algorithm (VGA) for the land cover classification of CIR aerial image. With the VGA, the classifier that we designed is able to evolve automatically the appropriate number of hidden nodes for modeling the neural network topology optimally and to find a near-optimal set of connection weights globally. Then, with backpropagation algorithm (BP), it can find the best connection weights. The VGA-BP classifier, which is derived from hybrid algorithms mentioned above, is demonstrated on CIR images classification effectively. Compared with standard classifiers, such as Bayes maximum-likelihood classifier, VGA classifier and BP-MLP (multi-layer perception) classifier, it has shown that the VGA-BP classifier can have better performance on highly resolution land cover classification.																	1002-0063					JUN	2008	18	2					162	170		10.1007/s11769-008-0162-x								WOS:000256419600008

Vegetation colonization in a restoring tidal marsh: A remote sensing approach	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Although remote sensing offers the ability to monitor wetland restoration, few have tested automated methods for quantifying vegetation change. We implemented a semiautomated technique using color infrared aerial photography and a common vegetation index, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), to document vegetation colonization in a restoring salt marsh. Change in vegetation over a period of 10 years was analyzed using a postclassification comparison technique where each image year was classified individually into vegetated and nonvegetated areas using NDVI thresholds and then differenced between years to identify areas of vegetation change. Vegetated and nonvegetated areas were identified using this technique, as were areas and time periods of vegetation change. By comparing classified NDVI imagery, we calculated that 90% of our study site was vegetated 10 years after restoration. This study demonstrated that high-resolution remotely sensed data can be analyzed with common geospatial software to monitor change in a rapidly vegetating wetland and that long time frames with yearly image acquisition are needed to quantify plant colonization rates. This method was effective at detecting change in vegetation over time in a variable tidal marsh environment using imagery that had inconsistent specifications and quality across years. Inconsistencies included interannual climate variation, phenology, and presence of algae, as well as differences in pixel size and image brightness. Our findings indicate that remote sensing is useful for postrestoration monitoring of tidal marsh ecosystems.

Riparian marshland composition and biomass mapping using Ikonos imagery	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) employs mostly field-based visual assessments of wetland extent, composition, and productivity as primary indicators in determining which wetlands should be considered provincially significant and protected. A given wetland is generally assigned single attributes that are assumed to represent the whole wetland extent. High spatial resolution satellite remote sensing offers potential to map and monitor spatial variability of given attributes within a wetland. In this study, Ikonos imagery was used to map vegetation composition and biomass in three riparian marshes near Ottawa, Ontario. For vegetation composition mapping, separability and correlation analyses aided the selection of an optimum set of spectral and texture input variables. Several maximum likelihood classification tests for sets of terrestrial and aquatic vegetation classes gave best accuracies from 61% for seven classes to 88% for five classes. As an alternative, neural network classification was tested using various configurations of input variables and data. However, the best results did not match those from the maximum likelihood classification. For biomass mapping, dried green and senescent biomass collected at 75 locations were modelled using stepwise forward multiple regression. The best model produced was the logarithm of green biomass against a combination of texture and spectral variables (R-2 = 0.61). It was applied to the image data to map green biomass with an absolute error of 213 g/m(2), or approximately 40% of the mean field-measured biomass. Based on this error magnitude, the output map was aggregated into three classes of biomass (high, medium, and low) that showed a strong visual correspondence with the spatial distributions observed in the field. These results indicate strong potential for monitoring of vegetation composition and biomass changes within wetlands which may contribute to improvement of wetlands evaluation and monitoring in Ontario.

Expansion of Spartina alterniflora, a non-native species, on the intertidal mudflats of Jiuduansha Shoals at the Yangtze River Estuary is a prime example of a spatially-structured invasion in a relatively simple habitat, for which strategic control efforts can be modeled and applied. Here, we developed a Cellular Automata (CA) model, in conjunction with Remote Sensing and Geographical Information Systems, to simulate the expanding process of S. alterniflora for a period of 8 years after being introduced to the new shoals, and to study the interactions between spatial pattern and ecosystem processes for the saltmarsh vegetation. The results showed that the CA model could simulate the population dynamics of S. alterniflora and Phragmites australis on the Jiuduansha Shoals successfully. The results strongly support the hypothesis of space pre-emption as well as range expansion with simple advancing wave fronts for these two species. In the Yangtze River Estuary, the native species P. australis shares the same niche with the exotic species S. alterniflora. However, the range expansion rate of P. australis was much slower than that of S. alterniflora. With the accretion of the Jiuduansha Shoals due to the large quantity of sediments deposited by the Yangtze River, a rapid range expansion of S. alterniflora is predicted to last for a long period into future. This study indicated the potential for this approach to provide valuable insights into population and community ecology of invasive species, which could be very important for wetland biodiversity conservation and resource management in the Yangtze River Estuary and other such impacted areas.

The purpose of this study was to examine the utility of airborne hyperspectral imagery in mapping salt marsh vegetation in Humboldt Bay, California, USA. An unmixing algorithm was applied to spatial and spectral image subsets. Overall accuracy among Spartina densiflora, Salicornia virginica, and Distichlis spicata was assessed at 85.1%. Algorithm prediction between observed and predicted percent cover ranged from r(2) = 0.32 to r(2) = 0.53, an improvement on comparable studies. Percent cover prediction was least accurate for Distichlis spicata, due to initial endmember selection. Use of the Pixel Purity Index in conjunction with field work likely aided in identifying the best candidates for the linear unmixing technique.

After the construction of the salt marsh, a network of volunteer creeks established themselves away from an artificially constructed main channel (with mean and maximum annual headward-growth rates of 11 m/yr and 18 m/yr, respectively). The rapid formation of this system of tidal creeks provides a unique opportunity to test the reliability of a model of tidal network initiation and development, previously proposed by the authors. The restored marsh presents the characteristics of a controlled environment analogous to a large-scale field laboratory, as it allows comparison of the morphologic features of real and simulated network structures under the reasonable assumption of neglecting accretion and deposition processes over the timescales of observation. Our results compare favorably with observational evidence, showing that the model proves reasonably capable of reproducing the main features of the actual channel-network patterns.

J	Huang, H; Zhang, L				Huang, Huamei; Zhang, Liquan			A study of the population dynamics of Spartina alterniflora at Jiuduansha shoals, Shanghai, China	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												This study investigated the population expansion pattern of an exotic species of Spartina alterniflora for a period of 7 years, after it had been newly introduced to the neonatal shoals of Jiuduansha (GPS), in the Yangtze Estuary, Shanghai. Remote sensing, in conjunction with geographical information systems (GIS) and global positioning systems (GPS) was used to map saltmarsh vegetation on the Jiuduansha shoals and the classifications were then checked using in situ field surveys of selected areas. The results showed that the S. alterniflora population had expanded from 55 hm(2) when first introduced in 1997, to 1014 hm(2) in 2004. The population expansion pattern of S. alterniflora on the Jiuduansha shoals was compatible with the common feature of invasions, i.e. the initial colonization, a lag time and the onset of rapid population growth and range expansion. In the first year of plantation (1997), about 35 hm(2) of S. alterniflora was successfully colonized on the Jiuduansha shoals. The period between 1998 and 2000 was characterized by a lag time, and the area of S. alterniflora increased only to 101.6 hm(2). The year 2000 marked an onset of rapid population growth and range expansion and the annual expanding rate reached 25-116%, which exceeded any of the indigenous species and indicated the strong competitive capability, rapid range expansion and wide ecological niche of S. alterniflora. The advent of remote sensing, in conjunction with geographical information systems and global positioning systems, provides a potential tool for mapping vegetation, and for monitoring population dynamics and range expansion of invasive species on a large scale. The implications for population and community dynamics, biodiversity conservation and wetland management in terms of the analysis of the sequence of events associated with the initial colonization, a lag time, rate of geographic spread and features of geographic spread of the exotic S. alterniflora and the native R australis on the Jiuduansha shoals are discussed.

Temporal and spatial relationships between watershed land use and salt marsh disturbance in a pacific estuary	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Historical and recent remote sensing data can be used to address temporal and spatial relationships between upland land cover and downstream vegetation response at the watershed scale. This is demonstrated for sub-watersheds draining into Elkhorn Slough, California, where salt marsh habitat has diminished because of the formation of sediment fans that support woody riparian vegetation. Multiple regression models were used to examine which land cover variables and physical properties of the watershed most influenced sediment fan size within 23 sub-watersheds (1.4 ha to 200 ha). Model explanatory power increased (adjusted R-2 = 0.94 vs. 0.75) among large sub-watersheds (> 10 ha) and historical watershed variables, such as average farmland slope, flowpath slope, and flowpath distance between farmland and marsh, were significant. It was also possible to explain the increase in riparian vegetation by historical watershed variables for the larger sub-watersheds. Sub-watershed area is the overriding physical characteristic influencing the extent of sedimentation in a salt marsh, while percent cover of agricultural land use is the most influential land cover variable. The results also reveal that salt marsh recovery depends on relative cover of different land use classes in the watershed, with greater chances of recovery associated with less intensive agriculture. This research reveals a potential delay between watershed impacts and wetland response that can be best revealed when conducting multi-temporal analyses on larger watersheds.

On the contrary, investigations in non-neutral dynamics have in the past been limited by the complexity arising from heterogeneous demographic behaviours and by the relative paucity of detailed observations of the spatial distribution of species diversity (beta-diversity): These circumstances prevented the development and testing of explicit non-neutral mathematical descriptions linking competitive strategies and observable ecosystem properties. Here we introduce an exact non-neutral model of vegetation dynamics, based on cloning and seed dispersal, which yields closed-form characterizations of beta-diversity. The predictions of the non-neutral model are validated using new high-resolution remote-sensing observations of salt-marsh vegetation in the Venice Lagoon (Italy). Model expressions of beta-diversity show a remarkable agreement with observed distributions within the wide observational range of scales explored (5.10(-1) m divided by 10(3) m). We also consider a neutral version of the model and find its predictions to be in agreement with the more limited characterization of beta-diversity typical of the neutral theory (based on the likelihood that two sites be conspecific or heterospecific, irrespective of the species). However, such an agreement proves to be misleading as the recruitment rates by propagules and by seed dispersal assumed by the neutral model do not reflect known species characteristics and correspond to averages of those obtained under the more general non-neutral hypothesis. We conclude that non-neutral beta-diversity characterizations are required to describe ecosystem dynamics in the presence of species-dependent properties and to successfully relate the observed patterns to the underlying processes.

Remote sensing and GIS integration for modelling the Paranagua estuarine complex -Brazil	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Before implementation hydrodynamical and ecological models in estuarine systems it is necessary a set of morphological and hydrological information at different spatial scales. The quality of this information will affect directly the model quality. A classification with three hierarchical levels was done for the Paranagua Estuarine Complex focusing on both the morphological and hydrological characteristics. This classification allowed a physical characterization in different spatial scales, which is necessary for the watershed and coastal waters zonation, as well as the application of models, at each level. Remote sensing and GIS techniques were used to extract features from Landsat ETM such as the coastline, the upper limit of wetlands; the vegetated flooded area, composed basically of mangroves and salt marshes on upper areas; and mud flats. The top level in the hierarchy is the Paranagua Estuarine Complex as a whole. The next level consists in a division of the system in five sections, and in the last hierarchy level seven sub-estuaries were delimited. Attributes were obtained for all the units defined in each hierarchy level, such as area, perimeter, depth (when available), water body area (without wetlands), wetlands area, tidal flat, drainage area, drainage density, hydraulic gradient and river discharge (when available).

Such patterns arise through the elaboration of a network structure driven by the tidal forcing and through the interaction between hydrodynamical, geophysical and ecological components (chiefly vegetation). Intertidal morphological and ecological structures possess characteristic extent (order of kilometers) and small-scale features (down to tens of centimeters) which are not simultaneously accessible through field observations, thus making remote sensing a necessary observation tool. This paper describes a set of remote sensing observations from several satellite and airborne platforms, the collection of concurrent ground reference data and the vegetation distributions that may be inferred from them, with specific application to the Lagoon of Venice (Italy). The data set comprises ROSIS, CASI, MIVIS, IKONOS and QuickBird acquisitions, which cover a wide range of spatial and spectral resolutions. We show that spatially-detailed and quantitatively reliable vegetation maps may be derived from remote sensing in tidal environments through unsupervised (K-means) and supervised algorithms (Maximum Likelihood and Spectral Angle Mapper). We find that, for the objective of intertidal vegetation classification, hyperspectral data contain largely redundant information. This in particular implies that a reduction of the spectral features is required for the application of the Maximum Likelihood classifier. A large number of experiments with different feature extraction/selection algorithms show that the use of four bands derived from Maximum Noise Fraction transforms and four RGBI broad bands obtained by spectral averaging yield very similar classification performances. The classifications from hyperspectral data are somewhat superior to those from multispectral data, but the close performance and the results of the features reduction experiments show that spatial resolution affects classification accuracy much more importantly than spectral resolution. Monitoring schemes of tidal environment vegetation may thus be based on high-resolution satellite acquisitions accompanied by systematic ancillary field observations at a relatively limited number of reference sites, with practical consequences of some relevance.

J	Mason, DC; Scott, TR; Wang, HJ				Mason, David C.; Scott, Tania R.; Wang, Hai-Jing			Extraction of tidal channel networks from airborne scanning laser altimetry	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Tidal channel networks are important features of the inter-tidal zone, and play a key role in tidal propagation and in the evolution of salt marshes and tidal flats. The study of their morphology is currently an active area of research, and a number of theories related to networks have been developed which require validation using dense and extensive observations of network forms and cross-sections. The conventional method of measuring networks is cumbersome and subjective, involving manual digitisation of aerial photographs in conjunction with field measurement of channel depths and widths for selected parts of the network. This paper describes a semi-automatic technique developed to extract networks from high-resolution LiDAR data of the inter-tidal zone. A multi-level knowledge-based approach has been implemented, whereby low-level algorithms first extract channel fragments based mainly on image properties then a high-level processing stage improves the network using domain knowledge. The approach adopted at low level uses multi-scale edge detection to detect channel edges, then associates adjacent anti-parallel edges together to form channels. The higher level processing includes a channel repair mechanism. The algorithm may be extended to extract networks from aerial photographs as well as LiDAR data. Its performance is illustrated using LiDAR data of two study sites, the River Ems, Germany and the Venice Lagoon. For the River Ems data, the error of omission for the automatic channel extractor is 26%, partly because numerous small channels are lost because they fall below the edge threshold, though these are less than 10 cm deep and unlikely to be hydraulically significant. The error of commission is lower, at 11%. For the Venice Lagoon data, the error of omission is 14%, but the error of commission is 42%, due partly to the difficulty of interpreting channels in these natural scenes. As a benchmark, previous work has shown that this type of algorithm specifically designed for extracting tidal networks from LiDAR data is able to achieve substantially improved results compared with those obtained using standard algorithms for drainage network extraction from Digital Terrain Models.

J	Hilbert, KW				Hilbert, Kent W.			Land cover change within the Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve: 1974-2001	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Estuarine water bodies provide a land to sea (freshwater to saltwater) transition zone. Protected from the full force of waves, winds, and storms by topographic features, e.g., reefs and barrier islands, estuaries provide habitats for countless numbers of plant and animal species. An estuary's wetlands, including salt marshes, naturally improve,all water quality by acting as filters. Thus, there are societal benefits to preserving estuaries. The U.S. government, in fact, passed the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, creating the National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) System. The present study documents temporal land cover change occurring during the period 1974-2001 within the Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (GBNERR)-the 24th NERR, designated in 1999. Occupying an area of 7284 hectares, it is one of the largest relatively undisturbed estuarine marsh-pine savanna habitats remaining on the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Results were obtained by applying both unsupervised classification and change detection techniques to data derived from Landsat satellite imagery acquired in 1974, 1991, and 2001, respectively. Land cover classes included open water, herbaceous wetland, forest, and barren land. For change detection analysis, change matrices were derived from postclassified pairs of successive image dates, yielding two change matrices. A map of overall cover change between 1974 and 2001 was also produced. Submersion of wetlands by water, attributed to a combination of factors, including rising sea levels, land subsidence, and historical geomorphologic changes that increased wave action and decreased sedimentation, caused a majority of the observed changes. Such a broad land cover analysis provides resource managers with information regarding the estuary's land cover types and spatial distributions, allowing for more informed decisions with regard to preserving biodiversity and planning restoration efforts.																	0749-0208					NOV	2006	22	6					1552	+		10.2112/05-0582.1								WOS:000242695100023

Existing and new observations are described, with particular emphasis on remote sensing and ancillary field surveys, which are shown to allow reliable, accurate and repeatable quantitative characterizations of landform and vegetation properties over the spatial scales of interest. The observed channel network morphological characters are then used as the basis and validation of models describing the emergence of channel network and vegetation spatial patterns. In particular, with reference to observations performed in the Venice Lagoon, the note describes: (i) new, 2-cm resolution, characterizations of channel network geometry obtained from "proximal sensing" photographic observations; (ii) the reliable quantitative maps of salt-marsh vegetation which may be retrieved from hyperspectral remote sensing data and field ancillary observations; (iii) a synthesis of recent and new analyses of the statistical properties of vegetation and landform spatial organization, that may be inferred from the maps so derived; (iv) recent and new conceptual and quantitative ecological and geomorphic models developed and validated by remote-sensing and field observations. A coherent observational and theoretical eco-morphodynamic framework is then proposed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Gao, ZG; Zhang, LQ				Gao, Z. G.; Zhang, L. Q.			Multi-seasonal spectral characteristics analysis of coastal salt marsh vegetation in Shanghai, China	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Remote sensing technology has become the primary tool for ecological research on a large scale. The spectral characteristics of the salt marsh vegetation canopy, including four main communities, Phragmites australis community, Spartina alterniflora community, Scirpus mariqueter community and Carex scabrifiolia community, were measured in the seasons of spring, summer and autumn by a ground FieldSpec (TM) Pro JR spectroradiometer, at the Chongming Dongtan Nature Reserve in Shanghai. The spectral data were converted to the reflectance curves, and their first derivative curves between 350 nm and 1000 nm were calculated. The differences in the reflectance and first derivative curves were then analyzed, with particular attention paid to the characteristics in the bands of visible, "green peak", "red edge" and near infrared. The results from this study showed that the different salt marsh communities had different and rather unique spectral characteristics during the three seasons studied. The near-ground spectral reflectance varied with the growing season, community type and its phenology. The discrimination ability, in terms of variations in the spectral reflectance, among the four major salt marsh communities was highest in autumn. It is proposed that a realistic strategy for classifying the salt marsh vegetation could be adopted by integrating and analyzing their remotely sensed images of multi-seasons. The implications of the results from this study in terms of serving as a tool for monitoring and mapping the distribution pattern and dynamics of salt marsh vegetation on the eastern coast of China are discussed.

The medians of the reflectance spectra collected from canopies of dominant marsh vegetation (Phragmites australis, Spartina patens, Spartina alterniflora. and Distichlis spicata) in the New Jersey Meadowlands were compared using a set of statistical metrics. Results show that these marsh species are distinct and separable spectrally in the near infrared (NIR) region of the spectrum. The two Spartina species are similar in spectra and are the most difficult pairs to separate. However, the distribution of, red-edge parameter (maximum inflection) suggests that red-edge may be useful for discriminating these two species. The results of this Study can be applied to classify marsh vegetation at species level using remote sensing and to map ecotypes along salinity or oxygen gradients as a way to assess coastal wetlands health and condition.																	0277-5212					MAR	2006	26	1					271	277		10.1672/0277-5212(2006)26[271:SDOMVT]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000236603100024						
J	Wang, AJ; Gao, S; Ja, JJ				Wang Aijun; Gao Shu; Ja Jianjun			Impact of the cord-grass Spartina alterniflora on sedimentary, and morphological evolution of tidal salt marshes on the Jiangsu coast, China	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												The tidal flats of the Wanggang area, on the Jiangsu coast, represent the largest continuously distributed coastal wetland in terms of area coverage in China, and the dynamics of tidal flat accretion and erosion is highly complicated. The cord-grass Spartina alterniflora, which was introduced artificially into the Jiangsu coast, has significant influences on the regional tidal flat evolution in terms of deposition rate, spacial sediment distribution patterns and tidal creek morphology. On the basis of the data set of bed elevation and accumulation rate for different periods of time, the applicability of the Pethick - Allen model to the Jiangsu tidal salt marshes is discussed. In addition, caesium-137 dating was carried out for sediment samples collected from the salt marsh of the Wangang area. In combination with the caesium-137 analysis and the data collected from literature, the Pethick - Allen model was used to derive the accumulation rate in the Wanggang tidal flat for the various periods. The results show that the pattern of tidal flat accretion has been modified, due to more rapid accretion following the introduction of S. alterniflora to the region. Surficial sediment samples were collected from representative profiles and analyzed for grain size with a laser particle analyzer. The result shows that fine-grained sediment has been trapped by the plant, with most of the sediment deposited on the Suaeda salsa and Spartina angelica flats being derived from drainage creeks rather than the from gently sloping tidal flats. Remote sensing analysis and in situ observations indicate that the creeks formed in the S. alterniflora flat have a relatively small ratio of width to depth, a relatively high density, and are more stable than the other tidal flat creek systems in the study area.																	0253-505X						2006	25	4					32	42										WOS:000240112900004

This research classified a high spatial resolution Airborne Data Acquisition and Registration (ADAR) digital camera image of a salt marsh landscape at North Inlet, South Carolina, USA using an artificial neural network. The remote sensing-derived thematic map was cross-referenced with Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) elevation data to compute the frequency distribution of marsh elevation relative to tidal elevations. At North Inlet, the median elevation of the salt marsh dominated by Spartina alterniflora was 0.349 m relative to the North American Vertical Datum 1988 (NAVD88), while the mean high water level was 0.618 m (2001 to May, 2003) with a mean tidal range of 1.39 m. The distribution of elevations of Spartina habitat within its vertical range was normal, and 80% of the salt marsh was situated between a narrow range of 0.22 m and 0.481 m. Areas classified as Juncus marsh, dominated by Juncus roemerianus, had a broader, skewed distribution, with 80% of the distribution between 0.296 m and 0.981 m and a median elevation of 0.519 m. The Juncus marsh occurs within the intertidal region of brackish marshes and along the upper fringe of salt marshes. The relative elevation of the Spartina marsh at North Inlet is consistent with recent work that predicts a decrease in equilibrium elevation with an increasing rate of sea-level rise and suggests that the marshes here have not kept up with an increase in the rate of sea-level rise during the last two decades.

J	Bromberg, KD; Bertness, MD				Bromberg, KD; Bertness, MD			Reconstructing New England salt marsh losses using historical maps	ESTUARIES												Analyses of habitat loss are often restricted to the past 75 years by the relative youth of aerial photography and remote sensing technologies. Although photographic techniques are highly accurate, they are unable to provide measurements of habitat loss prior to the 1950s. In this study, historical maps from the late 1700s and early 1800s covering portions of Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine were used to approximate naturally occurring salt marsh cover in New England. Historical data was compared to current salt marsh coverage available in public geographic information system (GIS) data sets. The average loss in New England is estimated at 37% using this technique. Rhode Island has lost the largest proportion of salt marshes by state, a staggering 53% loss since 1832. Massachusetts has also experienced large losses, amounting to a 41% loss of salt marsh since 1777. The Boston area alone has lost 81% of its salt marshes. Salt marsh loss was highly correlated with urban growth. Restoration and preservation efforts have resulted in the retention of salt marsh in less populated areas of New England. Although historical maps are difficult to verify, they represent an extremely valuable and underused data repository. Using historical maps to trace land use practices is an effective way to overcome the short-term nature of many ecological studies. This technique could be applied to other habitats and other regions, wherever accurate historical maps are available. Analysis of historic conditions of habitats can help conservation managers determine appropriate goals for restoration and management.

J	Hinkle, RL; Mitsch, WJ				Hinkle, RL; Mitsch, WJ			Salt marsh vegetation recovery at salt hay farm wetland restoration sites on Delaware Bay	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Public Service Enterprise Group's (PSEG) Estuary Enhancement Program (EEP) restored normal daily tidal inundation and drainage to three previously diked farm sites totaling 1780 ha during the period 1996-1998 along the shoreline of the Delaware Estuary in New Jersey, USA. Normal tidal exchange was either prevented or altered by the construction of dikes and water control structures that were used to promote the growth of high marsh "salt hay" species, such as salt meadow cordgrass (Spartina patens) and salt grass (Distichlis spicata) at elevations below mean high tide. These elevations would normally support low marsh species, such as smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora). Prior to restoration these sites were either un-vegetated due to excessive ponding associated with poor drainage or vegetated with "salt hay" species as well as common reed (Phraginites australis). Extensive S. alterniflora marshes occur in the vicinity of each site at similar elevations and these marshes were relied on as the source of seed for the re-establishment of S. alterniflora on the restoration sites; thus, no other planting or seeding was implemented to initiate re-vegetation. Vegetation coverage at the restoration sites as well as a naturally restored reference marsh was determined during 1996-2003 utilizing geo-referenced remote sensing data and geographic information system (GIS) analyses. Coverage by S. alterniffora or other desirable low marsh vegetation exceeded that required by New Jersey authorities to meet the restoration goal at two sites 8 years ahead of the anticipated 12-year period and re-vegetation of the third site is expected to meet its goal within the established 12-year period. Annual vegetation coverage data have been integral components of an adaptive management program utilized by PSEG to manage the restoration process at each of the sites. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The issues addressed pertain to the statistical measures and the morphodynamic implications of topological or metric properties of the observed landforms, in particular their scale-dependent ( or invariant) characters that might suggest self-organized dynamical origins. Field surveys and remote sensing are employed here to accurately characterize different morphodynamic features of a lagoonal environment. Of particular novelty and interest is the structure of landscape-forming shear stresses ( properly calculated in unchanneled portions of the landscape) which suggests the viability of threshold models of incision for the formation of tidal channel networks. Distinctive geomorphic indicators, suitable for comparative purposes with modeling of the long-term evolution of tidal systems, are also pointed out. We finally discuss space-distributed analyses of ecogeomorphological properties which strongly suggest the dominance of subvertical processes in the control of the distribution of halophytic vegetation, a key morphodynamic factor.

Scientists are challenged to detect and quantify both the drivers of ecosystem change and ecosystem responses, including positive and negative feedbacks that will determine the future states of inland waters. Predicting ecosystem shifts over large temporal and spatial scales has proven difficult or impossible, even in well-studied systems, where the drivers of change are known. New remote-sensing, monitoring, and tracer technologies, however, offer glimpses of watershed processes at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales. Several interdisciplinary groups, including scientists, information specialists, and engineers, are exploring the best ways to design sampling schemes using these new technologies, to interpret the extensive, spatially explicit dynamic data they will yield, and to use these data to formulate models useful for forecasting. Economists, in turn, can use this information to design management and policy tools for sustaining critical ecosystem components and processes.

The establishment of North American east coast native Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) in Willapa Bay, Washington is a specific example of broad-scale invasion following local introduction. In this study, we examined a 120-y historical record of aerial photographs, oral histories, museum records, and publications to reconstruct the spatial, temporal, and historical elements of this invasion. We conclude that the most likely means for S. alterniflora to have reached Willapa Bay was the transport and translocation of oysters from New York harbour. Our data and analysis suggest that multiple areas were colonized between 1894 and 1920 coincident with sustained import of oysters from the Atlantic seaboard. We have evidence that S. alterniflora had been long established and growing in multiple widely spread locations by 1945, which is in contrast to a widely reported single introduction. Multiple foci would not only explain the colonization patterns we have observed, but could also increase the heterogeneity of the founding populations, helping to overcome barriers to reproduction that may have initially slowed the colonization in isolated populations during the first 50-70 y.																	1195-6860						2005	12	3					330	338		10.2980/i1195-6860-12-3-330.1								WOS:000232582200005

The observation and analysis of network and vegetation patterns in a tidal environment, from accurate topographic surveys and remote sensing, provide significant insight both into the hydrodynamic regimes and the interactions of geomorphic and ecological processes. A dynamically based procedure for watershed delineation may be introduced which identifies the 'divides' for every subnetwork, and allows the objective study of the parts and the whole, in particular the network. Techniques for the study of channel meandering through the objective identification of their geometric properties are also reviewed and discussed. Mapping of halophytic vegetation from remote sensing and analyses of its spatial patterns are also discussed. Links between vegetation patterns and gcomorphic features indicate an important role of vegetation in the dynamics of tidal marshes. We suggest that the great diversity exhibited by the residual tidal landforms in the Venice lagoon sterns from pronounced spatial gradients of landscape-forming hydrodynamics and from the imprinting of several crossovers related to competing eco-geomorphic processes. We also rationalize the observed variability, in particular of marsh vegetation patterns, and indicate links with interacting geomorphic processes-and thus we supposedly provide elements for the prediction of the morphological fate of the Venice lagoon.

More than 15 000 ships per year use it to access the Belgian port of Antwerp. A major dredging operation along the Westerschelde in the late 1990s has changed the tidal regime and increased tidal inundation of the salt marshes at high tide. Airborne remote sensing (CASI) has been acquired in 1998 and 2000 for three salt marsh sites in the Westerschelde estuary. An additional dataset exists for one site for 1993. The CASI data have been classified into maps of salt marsh vegetation. These provide an input for GIS-based modelling of sediment erosion/accretion. Maps of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values allow change detection: successional change of salt marsh vegetation is clearly demonstrated. The 1993, 1998 and 2000 data show a successional trend between 1993 and 1998 that is, in part, reversing between 1998 and 2000. Data also showed significant erosion of the salt marsh edge. Data are being used to extrapolate field measurements and help produce sediment budgets for the individual salt marshes.

A number of species were strongly associated with one cover type and negatively with others. The major variation was for preferences for covers in upland or lowland parts of the region. Other distinct preferences for some species were covers such as those at the coast whilst a number of common species showed no strong preference for any cover variable.

J	Novakowski, KI; Torres, R; Gardner, LR; Voulgaris, G				Novakowski, KI; Torres, R; Gardner, LR; Voulgaris, G			Geomorphic analysis of tidal creek networks	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The purpose of this study is to determine if concepts in terrestrial channel network analysis provide insight on intertidal creek network development and to present new metrics for their analysis. We delineated creek network geometry using high-resolution digital images of intertidal marsh near Georgetown, South Carolina. Analyses reveal that intertidal creek networks may be topologically random. Length-area relationships suggest that salt marsh and terrestrial networks have similar scaling properties, although the marsh networks are more elongate than terrestrial networks. To account for recurrent water exchange between creek basins at high tide, we propose that the landscape unit of geomorphic analyses should be the salt marsh island as opposed to salt marsh creek drainage basin area. Using this approach, the relationship between maximum channel length per island and island area is well described by a power function. A similar power relationship exists for cumulative channel length versus island area, giving a nearly unit slope; this implies that marsh islands have a spatially uniform drainage density. Since the island boundaries are easily identified in remote sensing, taking the island as the unit of geomorphic analysis will eliminate discrepancies in delineating basin boundaries and preclude the need for defining basin area in intertidal landscapes. Analyses and results presented here may be used to quantify salt marsh reference condition and provide indicator variables to assess salt marsh disturbance.

J	Ramsey, EW; Rangoonwala, A				Ramsey, EW; Rangoonwala, A			Remote sensing and the optical properties of the narrow cylindrical leaves of Juncus roemerianus	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												To develop a more complete foundation for remote sensing of the marsh grass Juncus roemerianus, we measured the optical properties of its cylindrical leaves at sites of different canopy height, biomass composition and amount, and connectivity to ocean flushing. To measure the leaf optical properties, we adapted a technique used for conifer needles. After establishing the reliability and limits of the adapted technique to the wider J. roemerianus leaves, mean transmittance and reflectance spectra were compared to associated leaf diameters from two dates in 1999 and 2002 and at each site. Transmittance was inversely related to leaf diameter. Mean transmittance and reflectance generated from reoccupation of many field sites in 2002 indicated little or no difference in transmittance between years, a slight reflectance difference in the visible (<2%) and a slightly higher reflectance difference in the near infrared (NIR) (<4%). Site comparison indicated limited ability to separate leaf transmittance but not reflectance by marsh type (e.g., low, medium, high) or biomass. Excluding one outlier, we found leaf transmittances could be adequately represented as 1% +/- 0.2% in the visible and 9% +/- 1% in the NIR and leaf reflectances represented from 14% to 16% in the visible and 71% to 75% in the NIR (the reflectance ranges represent 1999 and 2002 means). Reflectance and transmittance spectra associated with the dead J. roemerianus leaves displayed a spectrally flat increase from the visible to the NIR wavelengths. In total, we documented the atypical optical properties of the cylindrical J. roemerianus leaves and showed that to a first approximation, single means could represent leaf transmittance and visible leaf reflectance across all marsh zones and, after accounting for sample standardization, possibly the NIR reflectance as well.																	0196-2892					MAY	2004	42	5					1064	1075		10.1109/TGRS.2003.823283								WOS:000221466200014

If these methodologies work well on leaf-level data, then there is hope that they will also work well on data from air- and spaceborne platforms. The classification methods compared were support vector classification (SVC) of exposed and nonexposed plants based on the spectral reflectance data, and partial least squares compression of the spectral reflectance data followed by classification using logistic discrimination (PLS/LD). The statistic we used to compare the effectiveness of the methodologies was the leave-one-out cross-validation estimate of the prediction error. Our results suggest that both techniques perform reasonably well, but that SVC was superior to PLS/LD for use on hyperspectral data and it is worth exploring as a technique for classifying heavy-metal or petroleum exposed plants for the more complicated data from air- and spaceborne sensors.

The research method was based on (i) recording land cover characteristics by means of a vegetation indicator, and (ii) classifying and mapping coastal wetlands utilizing a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image of Cukurova Deltas in Turkey. Vegetation characteristics of various habitats, such as sand dunes, salt marshes, salty plains and afforestation areas, were identified by field surveys. A Landsat TM image of 4 July 1993 was preprocessed and then classified using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithm and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). As a result of this supervised classification, the land cover types were classified with a largest accuracy of 90.2% by ANN. The classified satellite sensor imagery was linked to vegetation and bird census data, which were available through literature in a Geographical Information System (GIS) environment to determine the spatial distribution of plant and bird biodiversity in this coastal wetland. The resulting data provide an important baseline for further investigations such as monitoring, change detections and designing conservation policies in this coastal ecosystem.																	0960-3115					MAR	2004	13	3					615	633		10.1023/B:BIOC.0000009493.34669.ec								WOS:000187427000009						
J	Schmidt, KS; Skidmore, AK				Schmidt, KS; Skidmore, AK			Smoothing vegetation spectra with wavelets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												In hyperspectral remote sensing, spectra are increasingly analysed using methods developed for laboratory studies, such as derivative analysis. These techniques require smooth reflectance spectra. Therefore, there is a need for smoothing algorithms that fulfil the requirement of preserving local spectral features while simultaneously removing noise. Noise occurs in variable intensity and over different band widths. Several methods for smoothing a signal exist, including the widely used median and mean filters, the Savitzky-Golay filter applied to laboratory spectra, the cubic spline, and the recently developed transform-based thresholding using the wavelet transform. We compare all these methods using reflectance spectra of the canopy of salt marsh vegetation. The best trade-off between noise reduction and the preservation of spectral features was found to be the wavelet transform, specifically using a translation invariant de-noising based on the non-decimated or stationary wavelet transform.

In this investigation, a RADARSAT1-1 C-HH SAR image acquired in 1998 was used for coastal mapping and land-cover assessment in the Braganca area, in the northern Brazil. The airborne GEMS 1000 X-HH radar image acquired in 1972 during the RADAM Project was also used for evaluating coastal changes occurring over the last three decades. The research has confirmed the usefulness of RADARSAT-1 image for geomorphological mapping and land-cover assessment, particularly in macrotidal man-rove coasts. It was possible to map mangroves, salt marshes, chenier sand ridges, dunes, barrier-beach ridges, shallow water morphologies and different forms of land-use. Furthermore, a new method to estimate shoreline changes based on the superimposition of vectors extracted from both sources of SAR data has indicated that the shoreline has been subjected to severe coastal erosion responsible for retreat of 32 km(2) and accretion of 20 km(2) resulting in a mangrove land loss of almost 12 km(2). In an application perspective, orbital and airborne SAR data proved to be a fundamental source of information for both geomorphological mapping and monitoring coastal changes in moist tropical environments.

J	Shuman, CS; Ambrose, RF				Shuman, CS; Ambrose, RF			A comparison of remote sensing and ground-based methods for monitoring wetland restoration success	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Efficient and accurate vegetation sampling techniques are essential for the assessment of wetland restoration success. Remotely acquired data, used extensively in many locations, have not been widely used to monitor restored wetlands. We compared three different vegetation sampling techniques to determine the accuracy associated with each method when used to determine species composition and cover in restored Pacific coast wetlands dominated by Salicornia virginica (perennial pickleweed). Two ground-based techniques, using quadrat and line intercept sampling, and a remote sensing technique, using low altitude, high resolution, color and color infrared photographs, were applied to estimate cover in three small restoration sites. The remote technique provided an accurate and efficient means of sampling vegetation cover, but individual species could not be identified, precluding estimates of species density and distribution. Aerial photography was determined to be an effective tool for vegetation monitoring of simple (i.e., single-species) habitat types or when species identities are not important (e.g., when vegetation is developing on a new restoration site). The efficiency associated with these vegetation sampling techniques was dependent on the scale of the assessment, with aerial photography more efficient than ground-based sampling methods for assessing large areas. However, the inability of aerial photography to identify individual species, especially mixed-species stands common in southern California salt marshes, limits its usefulness for monitoring restoration success. A combination of aerial photography and ground-based methods may be the most effective means of monitoring the success of large wetland restoration projects.

J	Greer, K; Stow, D				Greer, K; Stow, D			Vegetation type conversion in Los Penasquitos Lagoon, California: An examination of the role of watershed urbanization	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The objective of this study was to examine the role that watershed urbanization has played in changes to the vegetation types within Los Penasquitos Lagoon, San Diego, California. Aerial photographs taken between 1928 and 1999 were used to examine changes in vegetation types. The aerial photographs were scanned into digital format and incorporated into a geographic information system (GIS). A combination of image classification techniques was used to differentiate the vegetation types. Land use/cover of the Carmel Valley watershed of the Los Penasquitos Lagoon was mapped for the same dates as the aerial photographs. A temporal geographic analysis was conducted on the conversion of areal extent of lagoon vegetation types compared to areal extent of urban development in the watershed. Soil salinity and dry season (June-September) stream discharge were measured. The results show that approximately 80.3% of the vegetation in the study area has changed types between 1928 and 1999. Increases in the areal extent of urban development within the watershed show a strong positive relationship compared to the areal extent of brackish marsh and riparian vegetation, and a strong negative relationship to the areal extent of salt panne and mudflats. There was no significant relationship between urban development and salt marsh vegetation. Dry season stream discharge has increased by an order of magnitude. The increase in stream discharge supports the hypothesis that increased freshwater has lowered soil salinity, allowing for invasion by glycophytic species. Hydrology and soil salinity appear to be significant factors for maintaining the distribution of the lagoon vegetation types and the biotic communities that rely upon them.																	0364-152X					APR	2003	31	4					489	503		10.1007/s00267-002-2849-6								WOS:000181602700004	12677295

Field measurements indicate that salt marsh vegetation species (halophytes) are reliable indicators of ground elevation and live within typical elevation ranges characterised by standard deviations of less than 5 cm. A model is then developed which uses vegetation as a morphological indicator of soil topography to estimate ground elevation from fractional cover values of each vegetation type. The use of data from an airborne remote hyperspectral sensor is presented as a means of discriminating between different salt marsh vegetation communities. Vegetation maps obtained from unmixing techniques have then been used to produce digital elevation maps (DEM) of salt marsh areas. The DEM based on halophytes cover estimates and extracted from high spatial and spectral resolution data allows a high estimation accuracy, with an error standard deviation of a few centimetres in the considered study area within the Venice lagoon. The accuracy and resolution attainable through this method are comparable and often superior to those obtained through state of the art laser altimetry. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	van der Wal, D; Pye, K; Neal, A				van der Wal, D; Pye, K; Neal, A			Long-term morphological change in the Ribble Estuary, northwest England	MARINE GEOLOGY												Morphological change in the Ribble Estuary (northwest England) has been studied, using bathymetric charts, topographical surveys and remote sensing data. A sediment budget has been prepared from the analysis of these data. The results reveal a net accretional trend over the last 150 years. The main channels experienced major infilling. Sediment also accumulated in higher parts of the intertidal zone (salt marshes and sand banks), while the sediment volume in the lower intertidal zone remained essentially the same. There were both zones of net erosion and deposition in the outer estuary, with a small net gain in subtidal sediment volume. Infilling, associated with major morphological change, was accelerated in the nineteenth century and early twentieth century, principally as a result of human activities. The triggering factors for increased sedimentation were embankment construction and reclamation after 1810, which progressively reduced the intertidal area, tidal prism and current velocities within the estuary. Additionally, construction of a trained channel between 1847 and 1910 to secure navigation, and maintenance of this channel by dredging, concentrated the ebb flow in this overdeepened channel and reduced periodic scour over the sand banks on both sides, enhancing sedimentation. Thus, the effects of human activities have outstripped those of changes in natural forcing factors on the morphological development in the area. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Rankey, EC; Morgan, J				Rankey, EC; Morgan, J			Quantified rates of geomorphic change on a modern carbonate tidal flat, Bahamas	GEOLOGY												Comparison of aerial photographs and ultrahigh-resolution remote sensing data reveals changes in the geomorphology of a modern carbonate tidal flat. In the 58 yr between acquisition of the two data sets, several tidal channels have extended headward more than 100 m, channel bars have stabilized, the shoreline has eroded as much as 50 m, the inland algal marsh locally has prograded as much as 90 m, and many mangrove ponds have increased in size. These changes over the known time interval allow quantification of the rates of these geomorphic processes and suggest rates of migration of landforms to several meters per year. Some observed rates appear to be different than rates averaged over the past several thousand years, however, possibly because of changes in storm activity or circulation patterns. These data illustrate the dynamic nature of the entire coastal tidal-flat system, not just the shoreline, and reflect the system's response to factors including relative rises in sea level.

The study is carried out on data collected in the Lagoon of Venice (Italy). Spectral angle mapping proves to be a reliable classification procedure, and spectral differentiation is seen to improve separability of vegetation types. Further, scaling relationships are derived to link the value of the variance of data aggregated at different scales, allowing the deteremination of data variability at course resolution on the basis of ground measurements. The comparison between the theoretical, upscaled, values of standard deviation and those computed from remote sensing data shows a good agreement supporting the derived relations. Finally, a scaling relationship is established for spectral angles, which may be useful in determining an optimal threshold angle from ground data. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

J	Gadallah, FL				Gadallah, FL			Historical vegetation reconstruction of a degraded sub-arctic coastal marsh using Landsat imagery and ancillary data	ECOSCIENCE												In recent decades, increasing numbers of Lesser Snow Geese have severely damaged the sub-arctic coastal marshes on which they feed in summer. Because the geese are an economic, aesthetic and visible species, plans for population control via increased harvest are controversial, and accurate vegetation maps are needed both for management decision-making and for public education. Documentation of the extent, pattern, and timing of habitat damage over large spatial and temporal scales requires reconstruction of the previously-existing vegetation. Satellite imagery is increasingly used for mapping and monitoring vegetation change over large areas, and archives of Landsat imagery provide consistent, spatially-extensive historical data. Previously-existing vegetation at La Perouse Bay, Manitoba, was mapped using unsupervised classification of a 1984 Landsat TM image and ancillary information. Using a commercial clustering algorithm, sixty-three spectral clusters were produced and subsequently identified using a combination of historical and current aerial photos, current vegetation data, and knowledge of local vegetation trajectories in time. These initial clusters were then aggregated into 14 classes, resulting in a detailed map of vegetation as it was before degradation by the geese. The map was compared to earlier results documenting change in the study area. Vegetation degradation between 1973 and 1993 occurred earliest and most extensively in the salt marsh and other classes containing salt marsh vegetation. Map accuracy was assessed with current vegetation data collected independently at a number of precisely located points.																	1195-6860						2002	9	2					271	279		10.1080/11956860.2002.11682713								WOS:000176529900016						
J	Simas, T; Nunes, JP; Ferreira, JG				Simas, T; Nunes, JP; Ferreira, JG			Effects of global climate change on coastal salt marshes	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												A methodology combining ecological modelling with geographical information analysis and remote sensing was employed to determine the effects of sea-level rise in estuarine salt marshes, using the Tagus estuary (Portugal) as a case study. The development of salt marsh vegetation was simulated separately for C3 and C4 plants, using a combined biogeochemical and demographic model. This simulation, which provided small-scale (m(2)) results of annual above-ground primary production, was upscaled to the whole salt marsh area, using bathymetry data, remote sensing and Geographic information System (GIS) for assessing vegetation cover and determining areal distribution of C3 and C4 vegetation. Based on IPCC data, several sea-level rise scenarios were considered, and the coupled ecological model-GIS were applied to these in order to determine changes in global salt marsh productivity. The results indicate that the salt marshes of the mesotidal estuaries such as the Tagus are susceptible to sea-level rise only in a worst case scenario, which is more likely to occur if the terms set out by the Kyoto protocol are not met by several industrialised nations. The low vulnerability of salt marshes supports the suggestion that areas with high tidal ranges are less vulnerable to sea level change, due to greater sediment transport and accretion. Nevertheless, the precautionary principle should always be applied by coastal planners, due to the great uncertainty surrounding forecasts of sea-level rise. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Hester, MW; Mendelssohn, IA				Hester, MW; Mendelssohn, IA			Long-term recovery of a Louisiana brackish marsh plant community from oil-spill impact: vegetation response and mitigating effects of marsh surface elevation	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Oil spills can have significant, short-term, negative impacts on coastal marshes, but the long-term effects and eventual recovery are not well documented, particularly in brackish marshes. The goals of this investigation were to: (1) document the long-term recovery of a Louisiana brackish marsh plant community impacted by a 1985 oil spill; (2) separate the effect of the oil spill on marsh deterioration from ambient rates of marsh deterioration; and (3) assess the relative importance of residual oil in the sediment and decreased marsh surface elevation in the failure of certain areas to recover. A total of 68 permanent plots previously established in 1985 were re-surveyed for plant and soil recovery in the fall of 1989. Although substantial (and near total) vegetative recovery was evident by significant increases in live and total vegetative cover,many of the plots that were initially heavily impacted by oil still displayed elevated levels of total saturated hydrocarbons in the soil. August 1990 measurements of plant photosynthetic response and edaphic variables revealed no significant differences between control plots and plots heavily impacted by oil that displayed vegetative regrowth. Rates of wetland land loss in the oiled marsh during an 8-year period that bracketed the time of the spill were within the historical range measured for this site and similar to the land loss rates of adjacent reference marshes. Results from a manipulative field transplant experiment indicated that the long-term failure of certain small areas to revegetate was primarily due to a decrease of marsh surface elevation (increased flooding stress), not a residual oil effect.

J	Wang, YP; Zhang, RS; Gao, S				Wang, YP; Zhang, RS; Gao, S			Velocity variations in salt marsh creeks, Jiangsu, China	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Velocity variations in a tidal cycle were measured in four salt marsh creeks on the Jiangsu coast, eastern China. Results of regressional analysis show that a marked linear relationship is present between the tidal current velocity and the rate of water level changes. Further, two or three significant velocity surges exist in a tidal cycle. A theoretical analysis indicates that one of the regressional coefficients of the linear equations represents the effect of a component of progressive tidal waves (the tidal waves over the study area are not purely standing waves) and the other coefficient is affected by the geomorphology (i.e. bed slope) of the creeks and the marsh surface. The observed tidal current velocity surges can be related to a rapid water level change las observed during the initial stage of the flood within a creek) or the combined effects of water level changes and bed morphology las observed at the end of the flood or during the ebb). Towards the end of the ebb, the surges may be influenced also by the ground water which flows from the marsh surface into the creeks. The established linear relationships may be utilised to develop new techniques to calculate current velocities in the creeks using remote sensing images.

It also shows how Geographic Information Systems, combined with remote sensing analysis, have the potential to assist in minimizing disease risk. Examples are used from subtropical Queensland, Australia, where the salt marsh mosquito, Aedes vigilax, and the freshwater species, Culex annulirostris, are vectors of human arbovirus diseases such as Ross River and Barmah Forest virus disease. Culex annulirostris is also implicated in the transmission of Japanese Encephalitis. Mapping the breeding habitats of the species facilitates assessment of the risk of contracting the diseases and also assists in control of the vectors. First, it considers a simple risk model that is applied to data for the city of Brisbane in southeast Queensland. This is then linked to computer-aided analysis of remotely sensed data to map potential ephemeral freshwater breeding sites of Cx. annulirostris. This has the potential to guide control at critical times, for example after heavy summer rainfall or when there is an outbreak of Ross River virus disease. Second, the use of color infrared aerial photography is used to identify the specific parts of the salt marsh in which larvae and eggs of Ae. vigilax are found. Finally. we explore novel ways to map the detailed pattern of water under mangrove forest canopy to identify where mosquitoes are breeding and as an aid to planning modification. For each we discuss the limitations and advantages and the possibilities for combining methods and/or using a single method for multiple objectives.

The foraging activities of the birds on Arctic breeding grounds are leading to loss of vegetation and habitat destruction, particularly in coastal areas bordering the Hudson and James Bays. 2 Multitemporal analysis of LANDSAT data has been carried out to detect vegetational change from 1973 to 1993 at La Perouse Bay and its vicinity, the site of a breeding colony of snow geese. 3 Difference vegetation images (DVI) (difference between infra-red and red images) were prepared from images obtained in late summer in 1973, 1984 and 1993, in order to enhance vegetation density.

J	Sanderson, EW; Zhang, M; Ustin, SL; Rejmankova, E				Sanderson, EW; Zhang, M; Ustin, SL; Rejmankova, E			Geostatistical scaling of canopy water content in a California salt marsh	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Remote sensing data are typically collected at a scale which is larger in both grain and extent than traditional ecological measurements. To compare with remotely sensed data on a one-to-one basis, field measurements frequently must be rescaled to match the grain of image data. Once a one-to-one correspondence is established, it may be possible to extrapolate site based relationships over a wider extent. This paper presents a methodology for rescaling the grain of ecological field data to match the grain of remotely sensed data and gives an example of the method in verification of remote sensing estimates of canopy water content in a tidal salt marsh. We measured canopy water content at 169 points on a semi-regular grid in the Petaluma Marsh, CA. A variogram describing the spatial correlation structure of the canopy water content was calculated and modeled. Ordinary kriging estimates of the canopy water content were calculated over blocks corresponding to image pixels acquired by the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). A water content index was determined from the reflectance data by calculating the area of a water absorption feature at 970 nm. A regression developed between the blocks and the pixels at the site was extrapolated over the image to obtain an estimate of canopy water content for the entire marsh. The patterns of canopy water content at the site and landscape levels suggest that different processes are important for determining patterns of canopy water content at different spatial extents. The errors involved in the rescaling procedures and the remote sensing interpretation are discussed.																	0921-2973					APR	1998	13	2					79	92		10.1023/A:1007961516096								WOS:000077256800002

J	White, WA; Morton, RA				White, WA; Morton, RA			Wetland losses related to fault movement and hydrocarbon production, southeastern Texas coast	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Time series analyses of surface fault activity and nearby hydrocarbon production from the southeastern Texas coast show a high correlation among volume of produced fluids, timing of fault activation, rates of subsidence, and rates of wetland loss. Greater subsidence on the downthrown sides of faults contributes to more frequent flooding and generally wetter conditions, which are commonly reflected by changes in plant communities leg., Spartina patens to Spartina alterniflora) or progressive transformation of emergent vegetation to open water. Since the 1930s and 1950s, approximately 5,000 hectares of marsh habitat has been lost as a result of subsidence associated with faulting. Marshes have expanded locally along faults where hydrophytic vegetation has spread into former upland areas. Fault traces are linear to curvilinear and are visible because elevation differences across faults alter soil hydrology and vegetation. Fault lengths range from 1 to 13.4 km and average 3.8 km. Seventy-five percent of the faults visible on recent aerial photograph are not visible on photographs taken in the 1930's, indicating relatively recent fault movement. At least 80% of the surface faults correlate with extrapolated subsurface faults; the correlation increases to more than 90% when certain assumptions are made to compensate for mismatches in direction of displacement. Coastal wetlands loss in Texas associated with hydrocarbon extraction will likely increase where production in mature fields is prolonged without fluid reinjection.																	0749-0208					FAL	1997	13	4					1305	1320										WOS:A1997XZ99900033						
J	Zhang, M; Ustin, SL; Rejmankova, E; Sanderson, EW				Zhang, M; Ustin, SL; Rejmankova, E; Sanderson, EW			Monitoring Pacific coast salt marshes using remote sensing	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												The rapid decline in the extent and health of coastal salt marshes has created a need for nondestructive methods for evaluating the condition of salt marsh ecosystems. This paper describes simultaneous uses of held sampling and remote sensing approaches to understand salt marsh ecosystem functions and species distributions and discusses the implications for salt marsh monitoring using remote sensing. Three sites along the Petaluma River near the entrance into San Pablo Bay, California, which represented a range of soil salinity, water content, and nutrients, were studied. Standing biomass was directly assessed by field sampling and indirectly estimated through canopy reflectance. The sites were dominated by almost monotypic stands of Salicornia virginica, Spartina foliosa, and Scirpus robustus. For Salicornia, we found a positive relationship between salinity and biomass up to a threshold of 42 g/kg, after which biomass declined monotonically with increasing salinity. No Scirpus or Spartina were found at soil salinities >20 g/kg. Although significantly different levels of nitrate and ammonium nitrogen were found in the interstitial water and soils at these sites, no strong relationships were found between biomass and nitrate nitrogen. Soil ammonium nitrogen, in contrast, was positively related to biomass. Soil redox and salinity increased with elevation and distance from the shoreline, while soil moisture and H2S decreased. Canopy biomass was estimable using remotely sensed spectral vegetation indices at 58-80% accuracy depending on. species. Simple Vegetation Index (VI) and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI) measured by handheld field spectrometers were the best estimators of green biomass for high cover of Salicornia. Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Soil Adjusted and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (SARVI) gave the best estimates for Spartina while the Global Environment Monitoring Index (GEMI) was the best estimate for Scirpus. The relationships between vegetation indices and biomass were developed from field spectra. The VI was used to estimate spatial patterns of biomass across the salt marsh from Landsat satellite Thematic Mapper (TM) data. The TM image showed spatial patterns corresponding with species zones and biomass abundance. Narrow band reflectance features measured with a handheld spectrometer can be used to predict canopy plant water content (R-2 = 63%). Interpolated estimates of water content from field-measured canopy reflectance were shown to relate to variation in salinity and soil moisture. Canopy water content was estimated from Airborne Advanced Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer data, which showed similar spatial patterns at the site. Results indicate that both biomass production and canopy water content can be accurately determined from remotely sensed spectral measures. Species-specific differences in these characteristics may be used for monitoring species distribution and abundance from airborne or satellite images.																	1051-0761					AUG	1997	7	3					1039	1053										WOS:A1997XQ08100026

The limitations of a model developed in an earlier study to predict the effect of salt-marsh reclamation on shelduck (Tadorna tadorna) and seven wader species (Charadrii) feeding on the Wash, east England, are addressed. The model related the numbers of each species feeding down-shore of the marsh in a 1-km broad transect to the area of mud or sand present, and thus to the width of the shore itself. 2. Three censuses of the intertidal feeding grounds were made during the winters of 1989-90. 1990-91 and 1991-92, in addition to one made in 1985-87 on which the earlier model was based, to incorporate annual variations in bird numbers into the model and to re-affirm the constancy in bird distribution. Sediment distribution was determined by satellite image analysis, The model was reformulated to include quadratic relationships. 3. The model was tested both within the Wash and on the Essex coast of east England, Within the Wash. its predictions improved as each year's census was incorporated and as predictions were made for areas of increasing size. Outside the Wash, the model predicted the numbers of all species with reasonable precision, suggesting it can be applied over a wider geographical area. 4. It was concluded that the model gives satisfactory predictions of how, in general, bird numbers would change in response to changes in shore width and sediment composition. BY converting numbers to percentages, its predictions can be applied to particular areas for which the pre-change bird numbers are known. The model may also be applicable to predicting the effect of other changes that directly or indirectly reduce the shore width: for example, barrage construction, sea-level rise and disturbance.																	0021-8901					OCT	1996	33	5					944	954		10.2307/2404676								WOS:A1996VY72900004

The Louisiana Gulf coast, a complex region of deltas, estuaries, and marshy wetlands, is the setting for this work. Gulf inner shelf and Mississippi River waters are the primary source water types, but four additional water types are formed locally and are readily detectable with MAMS including: shallow ambient bay water, fresh marsh water drainage, salt marsh drainage, and soil water drainage. In situ measurements of suspended sediment concentration and sea surface temperature in the Atchafalaya and adjacent bays have verified the characteristics of these water types. It is found that under the forcing of atmospheric cold front passages, water type differentiation is enhanced, creating a mosaic of water types in these coastal waters. Multispectral remote sensing of these complex, variably turbid coastal waters, provides data useful for studies of water type formation and coastal circulation processes.				Menzel, W.

Two study areas in South Carolina were selected to test various C-CAP change detection protocols using near-anniversary Landsat Thematic Mapper data obtained in 1982 and 1988. Fort Moultrie (dominated by salt and brackish marsh) and Kittredge (40 river miles inland and dominated by bottomland hardwoods and riverine aquatic beds) study areas were used to evaluate a modified C-CAP classification scheme, image classification procedures, change detection algorithm alternatives, and the impact of tidal stage on coastal change detection. The modified CoastWatch Classification Scheme worked well and can be adapted for South Carolina with minor adjustments. Unsupervised ''cluster-busting'' techniques coupled with ''threshold 3 majority filtering'' yielded the most accurate individual date classification maps (86.7 to 92.3 percent overall accuracy; Kappa coefficients of 0.85 to 0.90). The best change detection accuracy was obtained when individual classification maps were majority filtered and subjected to ''post-classification comparison'' change detection (85.2 percent overall accuracy, kappa coefficient of 0.82). Suggestions are made concerning appropriate change detection matrix logic and the format of change detection legends. The multiple date images selected for coastal change detection should meet stringent tidal stage guidelines which have yet to be fully documented.																	0099-1112					JUN	1993	59	6					1039	1046										WOS:A1993LH90400016

Often, methane pore water concentration and atmospheric flux are positively correlated. If correlations can be found among wetland plant biomass, reflectance, and methane concentrations or flux, it may be possible to study the global methane cycle ming remote sensing. Our study had two objectives: (1) to determine if remote sensing could be used to estimate biomass of Typha angustifolia plants in a Delaware (U.S.A.) brackish marsh, and (2) to determine if Typha plants influence dissolved pore water methane concentrations throughout a year. Canopy reflectance was correlated (r = 0.887) with live aerial biomass, which was correlated with live belowground biomass (r = 0.809). Dissolved pore water methane concentrations were generally lower in vegetated than in unvegetated areas. In vegetated areas only, concentrations were much lower in the top 10 cm of sediments than at greater depths. Since over 60 % of the live root/rhizome biomass is in the top 10 cm, it is likely that an oxygenated rhizosphere and methane transport through roots kept the methane concentration low near the soil surface. Substantial growing season increases in methane at depths of 10-20 cm, where the remaining live tissue is, suggest the release of enough methanogenic substrates to cause methane production to exceed methane emission/oxidation. Overall, methane concentrations diminished in winter and increased in late spring, but lagged changes in soil temperature and in live aerial biomass by two months, and were not significantly correlated with substrate salinity. Since remote sensing can be used to estimate Typha biomass, and since live root biomass influences the sedimentary methane reservoir, it might be possible to estimate methane concentrations indirectly based on remote sensing measurements.																	0749-0208					SPR	1993	9	2					339	355										WOS:A1993KW24300003						
J	GOSSCUSTARD, JD; YATES, MG				GOSSCUSTARD, JD; YATES, MG			TOWARDS PREDICTING THE EFFECT OF SALT-MARSH RECLAMATION ON FEEDING BIRD NUMBERS ON THE WASH	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. The intertidal feeding grounds of shelduck Tadorna tadorna and seven wader species (Charadrii) on the Wash were censused in 1985-87 to determine the numbers of birds whose downshore feeding grounds would be affected by a narrowing of the shore through further salt-marsh reclamation. 2. Bird distribution was reasonably constant over time, both between seasons within years and between years when 1985-87 was compared with 1972-74. In general, larger numbers of birds fed on wide shores than narrow ones, the species concerned depending on the area of either mud or sand present. 3. Satellite image analysis of the surface sediments showed that shores less than 1.5 km wide (marsh edge to Low Water Mark) were almost entirely muddy whereas wider shores (maximum width of 5 km) were either predominantly sandy or muddy, depending on their position around the Wash. 4. A simple model related the numbers of each species feeding downshore of the marsh in a standardized 1-km wide transect to the area of either sand or mud present, and thus to the width of the shore itself. It was concluded that the model provided a basis for predicting the numbers of birds whose feeding area would be affected by a marsh reclamation of any-given distance down the shore. However, further extensive data collection and model testing are required before this can be done.																	0021-8901						1992	29	2					330	340		10.2307/2404502								WOS:A1992JJ44300008
