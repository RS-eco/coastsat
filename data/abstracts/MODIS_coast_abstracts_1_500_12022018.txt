J	Rao, NS; Ali, MM; Rao, MV; Ramana, IV				Rao, NS; Ali, MM; Rao, MV; Ramana, IV			Estimation of ship velocities from MODIS and OCM	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												Detection of ships and their tracks in the atmosphere from satellites was earlier demonstrated by Porch, Noone, and Kaufman, among others. In this letter, we have gone one step further to estimate the ship speed and direction by locating them and their tracks from multisatellite imagery. Exhausts from the ships create streaks of clouds in the atmosphere that help identify the same ship from two satellites. Ship velocities are estimated from displacements of ships. We have used optical sensors data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Ocean Color Monitor (OCM) to demonstrate this technique. Estimated velocities of ships are within the expected range. Application of this approach has general interest to the navy, coast guards, shipping corporations, commercial ship owners, and fishermen. More satellite observations can be used to continuously monitor the ship velocities.					, Ali/0000-0002-3821-6099												1545-598X					OCT	2005	2	4					437	439		10.1109/LGRS.2005.853572								WOS:000232897100014						
J	Wang, MH; Shi, W				Wang, MH; Shi, W			Estimation of ocean contribution at the MODIS near-infrared wavelengths along the east coast of the US: Two case studies	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Atmospheric correction for the ocean color products derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) uses two near-infrared (NIR) bands centered at 748 and 869 nm. Ocean is usually assumed to be black at these two NIR wavelengths. For Case-2 and high productive Case-1 waters, however, ocean could have significant contributions in the NIR, leading to significant under-estimation of the MODIS-derived water-leaving radiances. This is often the case in coastal regions. In this paper, measurements from the MODIS Terra at the short wave infrared (SWIR) wavelengths (1240 and 1640 nm) are used to evaluate the ocean contributions at wavelengths 748 and 869 nm. The ocean is black in coastal regions in these SWIR bands due to much stronger water absorption. Studies of two MODIS granules off the east coast of the U. S. show that the ocean could have reflectance values of similar to 3.1% and similar to 1.8% at the top of atmosphere (TOA) for bands 748 and 869 nm in the Outer Banks, while these values are similar to 0.15% and similar to 0.1% in the Chesapeake Bay region. Thus, for the turbid waters, it is important to accurately account for the ocean contributions in the NIR bands for the atmospheric correction of ocean color remote sensing.

During CLAMS, aerosol particle mass was measured at two ground stations and on the University of Washington's Convair 580 research aircraft. Physical and chemical characteristics of the aerosols were identified and quantified. Three main aerosol regimes were identified in the region and are discussed in this work: local pollution/sea salt back,ground, long-range transported dust, and long-range transported pollution. The major component measured in the fine mode of the aerosol on the ground at Wallops Island, Virginia, was sulfate, estimated as NH4HSO4, which accounted for 55% +/- 9% on average of the fine particle mass (FPM) during the experiment period. Black carbon concentrations accounted for 3% +/- 1% of FPM; soil dust was also present, representing on average 6% +/- 8% of FPM. The difference between the sum of the masses of the measured compounds and the total fine particle mass was 36% +/- 10% of FPM, which is attributed primarily to nitrates and organic carbon that were not measured. Aerosol chemical composition in the atmospheric column is also discussed and compared with ground-based measurements. Aerosol dust concentration reached 40% of FPM during an incursion of Saharan dust between 24 and 26 July. Sulfate aerosol reached 70% of FPM during the transport of regional pollution on 17 July. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical thickness, coupled with air parcel back trajectories, supported the conclusion of episodes of long-range transport of dust from the Sahara Desert and pollutants from the continental United States.

This experiment was designed mainly for validating instruments and algorithms aboard the Terra satellite platform, including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Over the ocean, MODIS retrieved aerosol optical depths (AODs) at seven wavelengths and an estimate of the aerosol size distribution. Over the land. MODIS retrieved AOD at three wavelengths plus qualitative estimates of the aerosol size. Temporally coincident measurements of aerosol properties were made with a variety of sun photometers from ground sites and airborne sites just above the surface. The set of sun photometers provided unprecedented spectral coverage from visible (VIS) to the solar near-infrared (NIR) and infrared (IR) wavelengths. In this study. AOD and aerosol size retrieved from MODIS is compared with similar measurements from the sun photometers. Over the nearby ocean, the MODIS AOD in the VIS and NIR correlated well with sun-photometer measurements, nearly fitting a one-to-one line on a scatterplot. As one moves from ocean to land, there is a pronounced discontinuity of the MODIS AOD, where MODIS compares poorly to the sun-photometer measurements. Especially in the blue wavelength, MODIS AOD is too high in clean aerosol conditions and too low under larger aerosol loadings. Using the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) radiative code to perform atmospheric correction. the authors find inconsistency, in the surface albedo assumptions used by the MODIS lookup tables. It is demonstrated how the high bias at low aerosol loadings can be corrected. By using updated urban/industrial aerosol climatolog for the MODIS lookup table over land, it is shown that the low bias for larger aerosol loadings can also be corrected. Understanding and improving MODIS retrievals over the East Coast may point to strategies for correction in other locations, thus improving the global quality of MODIS. Improvements in regional aerosol detection could also lead to the use of MODIS for monitoring air pollution.

One of the main research goals in CLAMS was the validation of satellite-based retrievals of aerosol properties. The goal of this study in particular was to perform true over-ocean validations (rather than over-ocean validation with ground-based, coastal sites) at finer spatial scales and extending to longer wavelengths than those considered in previous studies. Comparisons of aerosol optical depth (AOD) between the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) Cimel instrument at the Chesapeake Lighthouse and airborne measurements by AATS-14 in its vicinity showed good agreement with the largest r-square correlation coefficients at wavelengths of 0.38 and 0.5 mu m (> 0.99). Coordinated low-level flight tracks of the CV-580 during Terra overpass times permitted validation of over-ocean Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) level 2 (MOD04_L2) multi-wavelength ACID data (10 km x 10 km, nadir) in 16 cases on three separate days. While the correlation between AATS-14- and MODIS-derived ACID was weak with an r square of 0.55, almost 75% of all MODIS AOD measurements fell within the prelaunch estimated uncertainty range Delta tau = +/- 0.03 +/- 0.05 tau. This weak correlation may be due to the small AODs (generally less than 0.1 at 0.5 mu m) encountered in these comparison cases. An analogous coordination exercise resulted in seven coincident over-ocean matchups between AATS-14 and Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) measurements. The comparison between AATS-14 and the MISR standard algorithm regional mean AODs showed a stronger correlation with an r square of 0.94. However, MISR AODs were systematically larger than the corresponding AATS values, with an rms difference of similar to 0.06. AATS data collected during nine extended low-level CV-580 flight tracks were used to assess the spatial variability in AOD at horizontal scales up to 100 km. At UV and midvisible wavelengths, the largest absolute gradients in AOD were 0.1-0.2 per 50-km horizontal distance. In the near-IR, analogous gradients rarely reached 0.05. On any given day, the relative gradients in AOD were remarkably similar for all wavelengths, with maximum values of 70% (50 km)(-1) and more typical values of 25% (50 km)(-1). The implications of these unique measurements of AOD spatial variability for common validation practices of satellite data products and for comparisons to large-scale aerosol models are discussed.

J	Jeong, MJ; Li, ZQ; Chu, DA; Tsay, SC				Jeong, MJ; Li, ZQ; Chu, DA; Tsay, SC			Quality and compatibility analyses of global aerosol products derived from the advanced very high resolution radiometer and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												There exist numerous global aerosol products derived from various satellite sensors, but little insight has been gained about their compatibility and quality. This study presents a comparison of two prominent global aerosol products derived over oceans from the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) under the Global Aerosol Climatology Project (GACP) (Mishchenko et al., 1999) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) ( Tanre et al., 1997). The comparisons are for monthly mean aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and angstrom ngstrom exponent (alpha) at a spatial resolution of 1 x 1 degree. The two monthly AOT products showed substantial discrepancies, with a tendency of higher values from MODIS than from GACP/AVHRR, especially near the coasts of major aerosol outbreak regions. Individual monthly AOT values have poor correlation, but their regional means are moderately correlated ( correlation coefficient 0.5 < R < 1.0). While cloud screening has often been argued to be a major factor explaining large discrepancies, this study shows that differences in aerosol models in the two retrieval algorithms can lead to large discrepancies. Contributions of the size distribution are more significant than the refractive index. The noisiness of the GACP/AVHRR aerosol retrievals seem to be partially influenced by radiometric uncertainties in the AVHRR system, but it is unlikely a major factor to explain the observed systematic discrepancies between the MODIS and GACP/AVHRR AOTs. For alpha, correlations between MODIS and GACP/AVHRR are lower (0.2 < R < 0.7) than AOT. The MODIS alpha shows a well-behaved dependence on the AOT contingent upon the aerosol type, while the GACP/AVHRR alpha has little correlation with the AOT. The high sensitivity in the selection of aerosol models to radiometric errors may be a primary reason for the worse comparison of alpha. Part of the discrepancies in a is attributed to different aerosol size distributions.

Properties of the smoke aerosol were measured in situ from aircraft, complementing operational Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) remotely sensed aerosol retrievals. This study compares single scattering albedo and phase function derived from the in situ measurements and AERONET retrievals in order to evaluate their consistency for application to satellite retrievals of optical depth and radiative forcing. These optical properties were combined with MODIS reflectance observations to calculate optical depth. The use of AERONET optical properties yielded optical depths 2 - 16% lower than those directly measured by AERONET. The use of in situ - derived optical properties resulted in optical depths 22 - 43% higher than AERONET measurements. These higher optical depths are attributed primarily to the higher absorption measured in situ, which is roughly twice that retrieved by AERONET. The resulting satellite retrieved optical depths were in turn used to calculate integrated radiative forcing at both the surface and top of atmosphere. Comparisons to surface ( Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) and ISIS) and to satellite ( Clouds and Earth Radiant Energy System CERES) broadband radiometer measurements demonstrate that the use of optical properties derived from the aircraft measurements provided a better broadband forcing estimate (21% error) than those derived from AERONET (33% error). Thus AERONET-derived optical properties produced better fits to optical depth measurements, while in situ properties resulted in better fits to forcing measurements. These apparent inconsistencies underline the significant challenges facing the aerosol community in achieving column closure between narrow and broadband measurements and calculations.

Isabel hit the east coast of the USA on IS September 2003 causing excessive rainfall and unprecedented flooding. This resulted in drastic changes in land and coastal ocean water bodies. The present study involves the use of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for mapping the changes in ocean colour brought by Isabel. Significant increases in the chlorophyll and suspended matter concentrations were found along the entire eastern coastline. Higher rainfall estimated by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI) and wind speed estimated by the Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) were found, associated with hurricane Isabel, and are responsible for the changes in ocean colour properties.

J	Huot, Y; Brown, CA; Cullen, JJ				Huot, Y; Brown, CA; Cullen, JJ			New algorithms for MODIS sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and a comparison with present data products	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												We discuss important sources of variability in sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and examine difficulties in deriving fluorescence data products from satellite imagery, with a focus on the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. Our results indicate that there are limitations in the present MODIS algorithms that could lead to biases in the interpretation of the fluorescence products across gradients of chlorophyll concentration. To avoid some of these limitations, we suggest replacing the calculation of absorbed radiation by phytoplankton (ARP) over a finite depth with integration over the entire water column, and including a term accounting for cellular reabsorption of fluoresced light. These suggestions are incorporated into two new algorithms, based on established bio-optical models for case 1 waters (most open ocean waters), to retrieve chlorophyll concentration and the quantum yield of fluorescence. We compare our results to the results using MODIS algorithms for two regions: one located off the coast of Central America, including the Costa Rica Dome, and the other in the Arabian Sea. The new algorithms provide a similar field for the quantum yield of fluorescence in the first region, while they provide a different and more uniform field in the second region. We suggest that this discrepancy originates from the use of the water leaving radiance at 412 nm in the MODIS standard algorithm, which is not used in our algorithm and can be problematic under certain environmental conditions (e.g., absorbing aerosols or highly scattering waters).

The main goal is to determine the extent to which the routine surface meteorological observations (including visibility) and satellite data can be used to characterize the spatiotemporal distribution of dust plumes at a range of scales. We also examine the potential of meteorological time series for constraining the dust emission schemes used in aerosol transport models. Thirty-five dust events were identified in the source region during March and April of 2001 and characterized on a case-by-case basis. The midrange transport routes were reconstructed on the basis of visibility observations and observed and MM5-predicted winds with further validation against satellite data. We demonstrate that the combination of visibility data, TOMS aerosol index, MODIS aerosol optical depth over the land, and a qualitative analysis of MODIS and SeaWiFS imagery enables us to constrain the regions of origin of dust outbreaks and midrange transport, though various limitations of individual data sets were revealed in detecting dust over the land. Only two long-range transport episodes were found. The transport routes and coverage of these dust episodes were reconstructed by using MODIS aerosol optical depth and TOMS aerosol index. Our analysis reveals that over the oceans the presence of persistent clouds poses a main problem in identifying the regions affected by dust transport, so only partial reconstruction of dust transport routes reaching the west coast of the United States was possible.

Dust sources are calculated using both mean wind speeds with model resolution T63 and subgrid wind speeds. Different data sets are used to describe soil erodibility. We explain how the different assumptions about dust production affect atmospheric dust burden and deposition. Some aspects of the annual dust cycle, such as the east Asian dust emissions, are largely dependent on the data used to determine soil erodibility. Other aspects, such as the timing of the maximum in the African plume at Northern Hemisphere summer, are well modeled with all data sets applied here. We show that the daily variation in optical depth at Cape Verde on the west coast of Africa is well simulated when we assume that erodibility is correlated with surface reflectivity from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spetroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data. Using a subgrid probability density function of wind speed to drive the dust sources facilitates dust emissions in areas with low wind speeds. Dust concentrations in remote areas are sensitive to the parameterization of wet deposition. Our results point out the need for a detailed soil erodibility data set for global dust modeling, and they suggest that surface reflectivity is potentially valuable for producing or evaluating such data sets.

The 2002 and other cruises generated a small database of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) profiles that enabled investigation of the performance of a variety of standard and regional bio-optical algorithms for remote sensing retrievals of chl-a in the region. The standard SeaWiFS OC4V4 and MODIS chlor_a2 algorithms overestimated chl-a as previously reported while a regional algorithm proposed by Bricaud et al. [2002. Algal biomass and sea surface temperature in the Mediterranean basin: intercomparison of data from various satellite sensors, and implications for primary production estimates. Remote Sensing Environment 81, 163-178] and the semi-analytical MODIS chlor_a3 gave improved retrievals. SeaWiFS mean chl-a maps are presented for the Eastern Mediterranean for each month between September 1997 and August 2004 and as multi-annual "climatological" images. The former showed that chl-a in the region decreased over the duration of the time series with reductions in the centre of the eddy, tracked using a quasi-Lagrangian approach, of approximately 33% between 1997 and 1998 and 2002 and 2003. This was not correlated with deep winter mixing represented as heat loss from the sea-surface or dust deposition represented as daily EP-TOMS aerosol index and annual aluminium deposition on the Israeli coast. It is hypothesised that the variations in chl-a are partly a function of the eddy dynamics. Daily SeaWiFS observations show that the 2002 phosphate release was conducted at a period of decreasing chl-a between the winter maximum and summer oligotrophic conditions; however, the rate of seasonal decrease was less than that observed in situ during the week following the phosphate release.

J	Wood, R; Bretherton, CS				Wood, R; Bretherton, CS			Boundary layer depth, entrainment, and decoupling in the cloud-capped subtropical and tropical marine boundary layer	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Estimates of marine boundary layer (MBL) depth and degree of decoupling for two regions of the subtropical and tropical east Pacific are presented using satellite observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI). These data are combined in a novel way with NCEP reanalysis data and a mixing line parameterization to estimate the mean entrainment rate w(e) over the two regions. Mean entrainment rates vary geographically and have maxima just downwind of the Californian coast ((w(e)) over bar approximate to 4-5 mm s(-1)), and also in the core of the equatorial east Pacific cold tongue where mean w(e) exceeds 6 mm s(-1). Entrainment exceeds subsidence by 30% or less in the subtropical stratocumulus regions. North of the equatorial cold tongue entrainment greatly exceeds subsidence, producing a rapid deepening of the MBL as air flows over a marked SST gradient. Shallow MBLs (z(i) < 500 - 700 m) are found to be well mixed in general. The decoupling increases markedly for deeper boundary layers and is well parameterized as a function of the thickness of the layer extending from the top of the surface mixed layer to the MBL inversion. This study demonstrates new ways in which large-scale observational and reanalysis datasets may be used to aid understanding of MBL boundary layer and cloud systems.

The data linked the bloom to high nutrient coastal runoff caused by heavy rainfall in June and August. Total N and P required for the bloom, which may contain some Karenia brevis cells, was estimated to be 2.3 x 10(7) and 1.5 x 10(6) moles, respectively. The dark color became increasingly dominated by colored dissolved organic matter, toward the Dry Tortugas, where CDOM absorption coefficients (0.08-0.12 m(-1) at 400 nm) were 2-3 times higher than the surrounding shelf waters, while chlorophyll and inorganic nutrients decreased to negligible levels.				hu, chuanmin/J-5021-2012; Johns, Elizabeth/I-3547-2013	Johns, Elizabeth/0000-0002-2181-5052												0094-8276					AUG 10	2004	31	15							L15307	10.1029/2004GL020382								WOS:000223342200006

Cleveland, Alaska	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH					Fall Meeting of the American-Geophysical-Union	DEC 10-14, 2001	SAN FRANCISCO, CA	Amer Geophys Union				Satellite data were the primary source of information for the eruption of Mt. Cleveland, Alaska on 19 February, and 11 and 19 March 2001. Multiple data sets were used pre-, syn- and post-eruption to mitigate the hazard and determine an eruption chronology. The 19 February eruption was the largest of the three, resulting in a volcanic cloud that formed an arc over 1000 km long, moved to the NE across Alaska and was tracked using satellite data over more than a 50-h period. The volcanic cloud was "concurrently" detected on the GOES, AVHRR and MODIS data at various times and their respective signals compared. All three sensors detected a cloud that had a very similar shape and position but there were differences in their areal extent and internal structural detail. GOES data showed the largest volcanic cloud in terms of area, probably due to its oblique geometry. MODIS bands 31 and 32, which are comparable to GOES and AVHRR thermal infrared wavelengths, were the least effective single channels at detecting the volcanic cloud of those investigated (MODIS bands 28, 29, 31 and 32). MODIS bands 28 and 29 detected the largest volcanic clouds that could easily be distinguished from weather clouds. Of the split-window data, MODIS bands 29 minus band 32 detected the largest cloud, but the band 31 minus band 32 data showed the volcanic cloud with the most internal structural detail. The Puff tracking model accurately tracked the movement, and predicted the extent and shape of this complex cloud even into areas beyond satellite detection. Numerous thermal anomalies were also observed during the eruption on the twice-daily AVHRR data and the high spatial-resolution Landsat data. The high-resolution Radarsat data showed that the AVHRR thermal anomalies were due to lava and debris flow features and a newly formed fan along the west coast of the island. Field observations and images from a hand-held Forward Looking Infrared Radiometer (FLIR) showed that the flow features were a a lava, debris flows and a warm debris fan along the west coast. Real-time satellite data were the primary tool used to monitor the eruption, track changes and to mitigate hazards. High-resolution data, even though coverage is infrequent, were critical in helping to identify volcanic processes and to compile an eruption chronology. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) is assessed from comparisons with AERONET/AEROCAN ground-based sunphotometer AOD measurements over North America. The results show that the POLDER polarization retrieval method for AOD at 865 nm yields large scatter with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.11 for single pixels, and RMSE = 0.092 for 3 x 3 windows and a systematic mean overestimation of +0.036 and +0.031 for single pixels and 3 x 3 windows, respectively. The correlation statistics can be significantly improved by employing the Size Weighted Aerosol Index (SWAI) defined as the product of the AOD times the Angstrom exponent, showing a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.68 with RMSE = 0.072 for single pixels and R = 0.75 with RMSE = 0.065 for the 3 x 3 windows. We have checked the reliability of the POLDER inversion scheme by comparing the aerosol polarized radiance (i.e., corrected for ground and molecular contributions) with AOD sunphotometer measurements at 670 nm for five different sites (R = 0.36). The MODIS capability for monitoring seasonal and long-term aerosol dynamics is assessed by analyzing the 8-day MODIS AOD product at 550 nm (Level-3 product). The retrieved AOD accuracy is variable depending on sites and observed AOD dynamic range; for the overall database (N = 1200 points), R = 0.37, RMSE=0.17 and Bias = +0.088. We illustrate how satellite-derived AOD images can be used to monitor spatial and temporal aerosol dynamics at the regional scale (anthropogenic pollution events over the North-Eastern American coast) and at the continental scale (dust storm events and mean seasonal background atmospheric aerosol loading). It appears that aerosol mapping from satellite images is still difficult over North America; particularly at high latitudes where AOD variations are generally relatively small. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Li, F; Vogelmann, AM; Ramanathan, V				Li, F; Vogelmann, AM; Ramanathan, V			Saharan dust aerosol radiative forcing measured from space	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												This study uses data collected from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) instruments to determine Saharan dust broadband shortwave aerosol radiative forcing over the Atlantic Ocean near the African coast (15degrees-25degreesN, 45degrees-15degreesW). The clear-sky aerosol forcing is derived directly from these data, without requiring detailed information about the aerosol properties that are not routinely observed such as chemical composition, microphysical properties, and their height variations. To determine the diurnally averaged Saharan dust radiative forcing efficiency (i.e., broadband shortwave forcing per unit optical depth at 550 nm, W m(-2) tau(alpha)(-1)), two extreme seasons are juxtaposed: the high-dust months [June-August (JJA)] and the low-dust months [November-January (NDJ)]. It is found that the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) diurnal mean forcing efficiency is -35 +/- 3 W m(-2) tau(alpha)(-1) for JJA, and -26 +/- 3 W m(-2) tau(alpha)(-1) for NDJ. These efficiencies can be fit by reducing the spectrally varying aerosol single-scattering albedo such that its value at 550 nm is reduced from 0.95 +/- 0.04 for JJA to about 0.86 +/- 0.04 for NDJ. The lower value for the low-dust months might be influenced by biomass-burning aerosols that were transported into the study region from equatorial Africa. Although the high-dust season has a greater ( absolute value of the) TOA forcing efficiency, the low-dust season may have a greater surface forcing efficiency. Extrapolations based on model calculations suggest the surface forcing efficiencies to be about -65 W m(-2) tau(alpha)(-1) for the high-dust season versus -81 W m(-2) tau(alpha)(-1)for the low-dust season. These observations indicate that the aerosol character within a region can be readily modified, even immediately adjacent to a powerful source region such as the Sahara. This study provides important observational constraints for models of dust radiative forcing.

We compare MODIS fluorescence and sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS) chlorophyll data, using a simple theoretical model of the expected variation of fluorescence emission with variations in chlorophyll concentration. The results show good agreement with the model and appear to allow separation of water masses according to fluorescence yield.

CALIPSO will fly in formation with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MODIS) on the Aqua satellite. Here we present inversions of combined aircraft lidar and MODIS data to study the properties of smoke off the southwest coast of Southern Africa. The inversion derives profiles of the aerosol extinction due to fine and coarse particles. Comparisons with three sets of airborne in situ measurements show excellent agreement of the aerosol extinction profiles; however the inversion derives smaller spectral dependence of the extinction than the in situ measurements. The inversion is sensitive to the aerosol backscattering-to-extinction ratio (BER). Due to nonsphericity of the coarse aerosols, the range of BERs of the smoke aerosol is 0.014 to 0.021 sr(-1) for the fine and coarse particles at 0.53 and 1.06 mum wavelengths, which do not differ much from the value for dust (0.016 sr(-1)) at these wavelengths.																	0094-8276					AUG 16	2003	30	16							1831	10.1029/2003GL017068								WOS:000184867700001

The measurements are sensitive to the vertical distribution of aerosols. However, the information is insufficient to be mapped into unique aerosol physical properties and vertical distribution. Spectral radiances measured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) on the Aqua spacecraft, acquired simultaneously with the CALIPSO observations, can constrain the solutions. The combination of the MODIS and CALIPSO data can be used to derive extinction profiles of the fine and coarse modes of the aerosol size distribution for aerosol optical thickness of 0.1 and larger. Here we describe a new inversion method developed to invert simultaneously MODIS and CALIPSO data over glint-free ocean. The method is applied to aircraft lidar and MODIS data collected over a dust storm off the coast of West Africa during the Saharan Dust Experiment (SHADE). The backscattering-to-extinction ratio (BER) (BER = omega(o)P(180)/4pi) can be retrieved from the synergism between measurements avoiding a priori hypotheses required for inverting lidar measurements alone. For dust, the resultant value of BER = 0.016 sr(-1) is over 50% smaller than what is expected using Mie theory, but in good agreement with recent results obtained from Raman lidar observations of dust episodes. The inversion is robust in the presence of 10% and 20% noise in the lidar signal at 0.53 and 1.06 pm, respectively. Calibration errors of the lidar of 5% to 10% can cause an error in optical thickness of 20% to 40%, respectively, in the tested cases.																	0196-2892					AUG	2003	41	8					1743	1754		10.1109/TGRS.2003.814138								WOS:000184861700001						
J	Hutchison, KD				Hutchison, KD			Applications of MODIS satellite data and products for monitoring air quality in the state of Texas	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												The Center for Space Research (CSR), in conjunction with the Monitoring Operations Division (MOD) of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), is evaluating the use of remotely sensed satellite data to assist in monitoring and predicting air quality in Texas. The challenges of meeting air quality standards established by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) are impacted by the transport of pollution into Texas that originates from outside our borders and are cumulative with those generated by local,sources. In an attempt to quantify the concentrations of all pollution sources, MOD has installed ground-based monitoring stations in rural regions along the Texas geographic boundaries including the Gulf coast, as well as urban regions that are the predominant sources of domestic pollution. However, analysis of time-lapse GOES satellite imagery at MOD, clearly demonstrates the shortcomings of using only ground-based observations for monitoring air quality across Texas. These shortcomings include the vastness of State borders, that can only be monitored with a large number of ground-based. sensors, and gradients in pollution concentration that depend upon the location of the point source, the meteorology governing its transport to Texas, and its diffusion across the region. With the launch of NASA's MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the transport of aerosol-borne pollutants can now be monitored over land and ocean surfaces. Thus, CSR and MOD personnel have applied MODIS data to several classes of pollution that routinely impact Texas air quality. Results demonstrate MODIS data and products can detect and track the migration of pollutants. This paper presents one case study in which continental haze from the northeast moved into the region and subsequently required health advisories to be issued for 150 counties in Texas. It is concluded that MODIS provides the basis for developing advanced data products that will, when used in conjunction with ground-based observations, create a cost-effective and accurate pollution monitoring system for the entire state of Texas.

The ocean color parameters (K-490 and suspended solid concentration) and SST clearly indicate a penetrating front originating from the coastal water within the inner shelf. The front is triangular shaped with its broad base on the coast and its sharp end penetrating into the outer shelf and merging into the Gulf Stream, depicting a passage of coastal water transport across the shelf. This passage changes in position and orientation (from southwest-northeast to west-east). The horizontal Ekman number was estimated to be outside the limit of baroclinic instability, suggesting that the process is deterministic. Thus, the water transport passage may play a significant role in a non-diffusive transport process of heat and land-derived biogeochemical materials.																	0094-8276					MAR 14	2003	30	5							1257	10.1029/2002GL016496								WOS:000182152000003

Algorithm performance	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												[1] The first consistent year (November 2000 to November 2001) of global albedo product was produced at 1-km resolution every 16 days from the observations of the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument aboard NASA's Terra spacecraft. We evaluated the quality of the operational albedo retrievals in two ways: (1) by examining the algorithm performance using the product quality assurance (QA) fields (this paper) and (2) by comparing retrieved albedos with those observed at ground stations and by other satellite instruments (in a companion paper). The internal diagnostics of the retrieval algorithm adequately reflect the goodness of the model fit and the random noise amplification in the retrieved albedo. Global QA statistics show that the RossThick-LiSparse-Reciprocal model fits the atmospherically corrected surface reflectances very well, and the random noise amplification factors for white sky albedo and reflectance are generally less than 1.0. Cloud obscuration is the main reason for the activation of the backup magnitude retrieval algorithm. Over the 60degreesS to 60degreesN latitude band, 50% of the land pixels acquire more than six clear looks during 14-29 September 2001, and only 5% of these pixels are inverted with the backup algorithm. The latitude dependence and temporal distribution of the QA fields further demonstrate that the retrieval status mainly follows the pattern of angular sampling determined by cloud climatology and the instrument/orbit characteristics. A case study over the west coast of the United States shows that white sky shortwave albedos retrieved from magnitude inversions agree on average with those from full inversions to within 0.033 in reflectance units and have a slightly lower bias ranging from 0.014 to 0.023. We also explored the effect of residual cloud and aerosol contamination in the atmospherically corrected surface reflectance inputs in another case study over southern Africa. The quality assurance procedure of the operational MODIS bidirectional reflectance distribution function and albedo algorithm compensates for some of these residual effects and improves the albedo retrieval results by an order of 0.005 (10%) in the visible for more than 12% of pixels.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) launched on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Terra and Aqua spacecrafts is equipped with narrow channels located within a wider wavelength range between 0.4-2.5 mum for a variety of remote sensing applications. The wide spectral range can provide improved capabilities for remote sensing of the more complex and turbid coastal waters (Case 2 water) and for improved atmospheric corrections for ocean scenes. In this paper, we describe an empirical algorithm that uses this wide spectral range to identify areas with suspended sediments in turbid waters and shallow waters with bottom reflections. The algorithm takes advantage of the strong water absorption at wavelengths longer than 1 mum that does not allow illumination of sediments in the water or a shallow ocean floor. MODIS data acquired over the east coast of China, west coast of Africa, Arabian Sea, Mississippi Delta, and west coast of Florida are used in this study.																	0196-2892					MAR	2003	41	3					559	566		10.1109/TGRS.2003.810227								WOS:000182871300006

After achieving final orbit, MODIS began earth observations in late February 2000 and has been acquiring data since that time. The instrument is also being flown on the Aqua spacecraft, launched in May 2002. A comprehensive set of remote sensing algorithms for cloud detection and the retrieval of cloud physical and optical properties have been developed by members of the MODIS atmosphere science team. The archived products from these algorithms have applications in climate change studies, climate modeling, numerical weather prediction, as well as fundamental atmospheric research. In addition to an extensive cloud mask, products include cloud-top properties (temperature, pressure, effective emissivity), cloud thermodynamic phase, cloud optical and microphysical parameters (optical thickness, effective particle radius, water path), as well as derived statistics. We will describe the various algorithms being used for the remote sensing of cloud properties from MODIS data with an emphasis on the pixel-level retrievals (referred to as Level-2 products), with 1-km or 5-km spatial resolution at nadir. An example of each Level-2 cloud product from a common data granule (5 min of data) off the coast of South America will be discussed. Future efforts will also be mentioned.

J	Gasso, S; Hegg, DA				Gasso, S; Hegg, DA			On the retrieval of columnar aerosol mass and CCN concentration by MODIS	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												A parameterization is introduced for the derivation of columnar aerosol mass concentration (AMC) and cloud condensation nucleus concentration (CCNC) from the primary aerosol products of Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The method relies on the scaling between AMC and optical depth with a proportionality constant dependent on MODIS-derived r(eff), eta (contribution of the accumulation mode radiance to the total radiance), ambient RH, and an assumed constant aerosol composition. The CCNC is derived from a parameterization of concentration as a function of the retrieved aerosol volume. By comparing with in situ data, it is shown that retrievals in dry ambient conditions (dust) are improved when using a proportionality constant dependent on r(eff) and eta obtained in the same pixel. In high-humidity environments, the improvement in the new method is inconclusive because of the difficulty in accounting for the uneven vertical distribution of relative humidity. Additionally, two detailed comparisons of AMC and CCNC retrieved by the MODIS Airborne Simulator (MAS) algorithm and the new method are shown. The new method and MAS retrievals of AMC are within the same order of magnitude with respect to the in situ measurements of aerosol mass. However, the proposed method is closer to the in situ measurements than the MODIS retrievals. The retrievals of CCNC are also within the same order of magnitude for both methods. Finally, the new method is applied to an actual MODIS retrieval. Although no in situ data is available for comparison, it is shown that the proposed method yields more credible values than the MODIS retrievals.

Since late 1996, the Ocean Color-Temperature Sensor (OCTS), the Polarization Detection Environmental Radiometer (POLDER), the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS), and the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) have provided a nearly continuous record of biological processes in this region for the first time. This study summarizes the SeaWiFS observations of the tropical Pacific from September 1997 through March 2000, with particular emphasis on equatorial and mesoscale variability, the influence of biological processes on penetrating irradiance, and the performance of primary production algorithms in this region. Specific mesoscale phenomena described are the phytoplankton blooms along the west coast of Central America, in the vicinity of the Costa Rica dome, and south of the equator. The coastal Central American and Costa Rica dome blooms result from orographically steered coastal winds and Ekman divergence, respectively. An unusual bloom event occurred south of the equator and persisted for several months in 1999; specific mechanisms that would have sustained the bloom could not be identified. Also, the time-evolution of the equatorial bloom during the May August 1998 transition from El Nino to La Nina is discussed. Again, no concise and broadly accepted explanation of the bloom's genesis and migration has yet emerged. During this transition, the monthly mean diffuse attenuation coefficient decreased by a factor of 3 at some locations along the equator. This change in water transparency, coupled with large changes in mixed-layer depth, resulted in significant changes in surface layer heating rates that were substantiated with field observations. Finally, certain primary production algorithms designed to use remotely sensed chlorophyll-a concentrations are evaluated.

J	Gagliardini, DA; Clemente-Colon, P; Bava, J; Milovich, JA; Frulla, LA				Gagliardini, DA; Clemente-Colon, P; Bava, J; Milovich, JA; Frulla, LA			Complementary use of SAR and thermal IR observations in the Brazil-Malvinas confluence region	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The Western South Atlantic Ocean is characterized by the confluence of the Brazil Current and the Malvinas (Falkland) Current. along the western margin of the Argentine Basin. The so-called Brazil-Malvinas Confluence occurs near the entrance of the La Plata River estuary; roughly between 35 degrees S and 40 degrees S. A significant number of papers related to different oceanographic and biological aspects of the confluence has been published with many based on thermal infrared (IR) and/or visible satellite imagery. The NOAA-AVHRR sensor, which has been most commonly used, observes this area four or five times per day in the visible and IR bands. However: this frequency, is often insufficient, given the high probability of cloud cover in the region. In contrast, an active sensor such as the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can be used day and night and under cloudy conditions to observe a variety of sea surface signatures. A GlobeSAR-2 project was carried out during 1997-1998 to monitor the confluence using ScanSAR Wide Beam Mode RADARSAT-1 images. The project aimed at determining the possibility of using these data to provide complementary information to AVHRR and defining their capability, to detect ocean dynamic patterns in the region. RADARSAT-1 images were acquired during 1997 and 1998. Two 1998 images corresponding to July 19 and September 5 are presented here. Complex patterns associated with the ocean surface circulation, biological productivity; and atmospheric conditions were analyzed The results show that tinder adequate wind speed conditions SAR can be used in a complementary way with NOAA-AVHRR, and provide details about different aspects of the dynamics of the region, such as fronts,,filaments and eddies. The observations suggest that SAR imagery may, also be able to provide a useful link between physical oceanography, information derived from thermal sensors and biological information from visible sensors like SeaWiFS and MODIS.

Data are also visualized in maps by a tool properly developed, named GOMEView. The validation procedure is based on ground measurements obtained by sunphotometers. Results show that calibration of the surface reflectance is crucial to obtain the best results, i.e. in agreement with the ground measurements. Aerosol data have also been classified on the basis of their optical properties evidencing for instance, the presence of desert aerosol over the sea along the west coast of Sahara. Cloud retrievals were also analyzed in terms of their occurrence and amount. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Garcia, M; Ustin, SL				Garcia, M; Ustin, SL			Detection of interannual vegetation responses to climatic variability using AVIRIS data in a coastal savanna in California	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												Ecosystem responses to interannual weather variability are large and superimposed over any long-term directional climatic responses making it difficult to assign causal relationships to vegetation change. Better understanding of ecosystem responses to interannual climatic variability is crucial to predicting long-term functioning and stability. Hyperspectral data have the potential to detect ecosystem responses that are undetected by broadband sensors and can be used to scale to coarser resolution global mapping sensors, e.g., advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) and MODIS. This research focused on detecting vegetation responses to interannual climate using the airborne visible-infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) data over a natural savanna in the Central Coast Range in California. Results of linear spectral mixture analysis and assessment of the model errors were compared for two AVIRIS images acquired in spring of a dry and a wet year. The results show that mean unmixed fractions for these vegetation types were not significantly different between years due to the high spatial variability within the landscape. However, significant community differences were found between years on a pixel basis, underlying the importance of site-specific analysis. Multitemporal hyperspectral coverage is necessary to understand vegetation dynamics.

Here we apply a similar technique for ocean areas over the glint region. The glint, or oceanic specular reflection, has a high value of surface reflectance and thus, can work as well as or better than applications over land regions. The method is applied for glint regions measured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) simulator, an imager flown on the NASA. ER-2 research aircraft and simulating the expected measurements from the MODIS instrument on board the Earth Observing System (EOS)-Terra satellite. The measurements are made for the Atlantic coast of the United States during the Tropospheric Aerosol Radiative Forcing Observational Experiment (TARFOX). The remote sensing technique is compared with measurements of water vapor column by the Lidar Atmospheric Sensing Experiment (LASE) Differential Infrared Absorption Lidar (DIAL) lidar system also on board the ER-2. Water vapor was derived with an error of +/-5 mm PW (precipitable water vapor). Most of the errors are associated with the limitations of an experiment that was not originally designed for this purpose. Much better performance is expected from the actual MODIS instrument.																	0094-8276					SEP 1	2000	27	17					2657	2660		10.1029/1999GL011156								WOS:000089254700018

On July 17 and 24 the LASE profiles of aerosol extinction and aerosol optical thickness (AOT) had a bias difference of 0.0055 km(-1) (10%) and a root-mean-square difference of 0.026 km(-1) (42%) when compared to corresponding profiles derived from the airborne in situ data when the nephelometer measurements are adjusted to ambient relative humidities. Larger differences for two other days were associated with much smaller aerosol optical thicknesses (July 20) and differences in the locations sampled by the two aircraft (July 26). LASE profiles of AOT are about 10% higher than those derived from the airborne Sun photometer, which in turn are about 10-15% higher than those derived from the airborne in situ measurements. These differences are generally within the error estimates of the various measurements. The LASE measurements of AOT generally agree with AOT derived from both the Along-Track and Scanning Radiometer 2 (ATSR 2) sensor flown on the European Remote Sensing Satellite 2 (ERS-2) and from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) airborne simulator (MAS) which flew with LASE on the NASA ER-2 aircraft. Effective particle sizes derived from the MAS data indicate that the LASE retrievals of AOT are valid for effective particle radii less than 0.4 mu m. Variations in the relative humidity derived from the LASE water vapor measurements on July 26 are found to be highly correlated with Variations in the effective particle size derived from the MAS.																	2169-897X					APR 27	2000	105	D8					9935	9947		10.1029/1999JD901201								WOS:000086658600013

It will be produced globally at single-pixel resolution; the algorithm uses as many as 14 of the MODIS 36 spectral bands to maximize reliable cloud detection and to mitigate past difficulties experienced by sensors with coarser spatial resolution or fewer spectral bands. The MODIS cloud mask is ancillary input to MODIS land, ocean, and atmosphere science algorithms to suggest processing options. The MODIS cloud mask algorithm will operate in near real time in a limited computer processing and storage facility with simple easy-to-follow algorithm paths. The MODIS cloud mask algorithm identifies several conceptual domains according to surface type and solar illumination, including land, water, snow/ice, desert, and coast for both day and night. Once a pixel has been assigned to a particular domain (defining an algorithm path), a series of threshold tests attempts to detect the presence of clouds in the instrument field of view. Each cloud detection test returns a confidence level that the pixel is clear ranging in value from 1 (high) to zero (low). There are several types of tests, where detection of different cloud conditions relies on different tests. Tests capable of detecting similar cloud conditions are grouped together. While these groups are arranged so that independence between them is maximized, few, if any, spectral tests are completely independent. The minimum confidence from all tests within a group is taken to be representative of that group. These confidences indicate absence of particular cloud types. The product of all the group confidences is used to determine the confidence of finding clear-sky conditions. This paper outlines the MODIS cloud masking algorithm. While no present sensor has all of the spectral bands necessary for testing the complete MODIS cloud mask, initial validation of some of the individual cloud tests is presented using existing remote sensing data sets.

J	Zhang, M; Ustin, SL; Rejmankova, E; Sanderson, EW				Zhang, M; Ustin, SL; Rejmankova, E; Sanderson, EW			Monitoring Pacific coast salt marshes using remote sensing	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												The rapid decline in the extent and health of coastal salt marshes has created a need for nondestructive methods for evaluating the condition of salt marsh ecosystems. This paper describes simultaneous uses of held sampling and remote sensing approaches to understand salt marsh ecosystem functions and species distributions and discusses the implications for salt marsh monitoring using remote sensing. Three sites along the Petaluma River near the entrance into San Pablo Bay, California, which represented a range of soil salinity, water content, and nutrients, were studied. Standing biomass was directly assessed by field sampling and indirectly estimated through canopy reflectance. The sites were dominated by almost monotypic stands of Salicornia virginica, Spartina foliosa, and Scirpus robustus. For Salicornia, we found a positive relationship between salinity and biomass up to a threshold of 42 g/kg, after which biomass declined monotonically with increasing salinity. No Scirpus or Spartina were found at soil salinities >20 g/kg. Although significantly different levels of nitrate and ammonium nitrogen were found in the interstitial water and soils at these sites, no strong relationships were found between biomass and nitrate nitrogen. Soil ammonium nitrogen, in contrast, was positively related to biomass. Soil redox and salinity increased with elevation and distance from the shoreline, while soil moisture and H2S decreased. Canopy biomass was estimable using remotely sensed spectral vegetation indices at 58-80% accuracy depending on. species. Simple Vegetation Index (VI) and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI) measured by handheld field spectrometers were the best estimators of green biomass for high cover of Salicornia. Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Soil Adjusted and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (SARVI) gave the best estimates for Spartina while the Global Environment Monitoring Index (GEMI) was the best estimate for Scirpus. The relationships between vegetation indices and biomass were developed from field spectra. The VI was used to estimate spatial patterns of biomass across the salt marsh from Landsat satellite Thematic Mapper (TM) data. The TM image showed spatial patterns corresponding with species zones and biomass abundance. Narrow band reflectance features measured with a handheld spectrometer can be used to predict canopy plant water content (R-2 = 63%). Interpolated estimates of water content from field-measured canopy reflectance were shown to relate to variation in salinity and soil moisture. Canopy water content was estimated from Airborne Advanced Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer data, which showed similar spatial patterns at the site. Results indicate that both biomass production and canopy water content can be accurately determined from remotely sensed spectral measures. Species-specific differences in these characteristics may be used for monitoring species distribution and abundance from airborne or satellite images.																	1051-0761					AUG	1997	7	3					1039	1053										WOS:A1997XQ08100026
