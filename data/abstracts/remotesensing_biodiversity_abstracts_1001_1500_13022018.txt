J	Becker, RH; Zmijewski, KA; Crail, T				Becker, Richard H.; Zmijewski, Kirk A.; Crail, Todd			Seeing the forest for the invasives: mapping buckthorn in the Oak Openings	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Landsat TM and ETM+ satellite images from 2001 to 2011 were used to map the extent and change of the invasive shrubs common and glossy buckthorn (Frangula alnus and Rhamnus cathartica) at Irwin Prairie State Nature Preserve (IPSNP), and throughout Oak Openings, a 1,500 km(2) region, located in NW Ohio, USA and SE Michigan near Lake Erie. In the Oak Openings, buckthorn directly threatens native biodiversity and habitat health of this globally rare ecosystem. Buckthorn that forms as dense shrub thicket in the understory is often obscured from satellite view by other canopy and is not spectrally dissimilar enough to be characterized using multispectral images. To address this, time series tasseled cap greenness images of land surface areas dominated by buckthorn thicket (which exhibit early leaf-out, late senescence) was used to identify areas covered by thicket with a heterogeneous background. A time series of vegetation index values was calculated from 49 Landsat images and combined with in-situ observations to define the land surface phenology of buckthorn thicket and other vegetation types. The phenological differences among land surfaces dominated by distinct vegetation types in the Oak Openings Region were used to map the extent of buckthorn thicket using a supervised classification method. Buckthorn thicket was identified in 0.43 % of the classified pixels (940 ha) in the 2007-2011 imagery and in 0.31 % (690 ha) of the 2001-2006 images. A Kappa test of the 2007-2011 classification yielded a value of 0.73 with 88 % overall accuracy of presence or absence of thicket based on 60 samples throughout the Oak Openings. The areal extent of buckthorn thicket increased by 39 % (255 ha) in the study area over the time period from 2001 to 2011.

J	Olea, PP; Mateo-Tomas, P				Olea, Pedro P.; Mateo-Tomas, Patricia			Assessing Species Habitat Using Google Street View: A Case Study of Cliff-Nesting Vultures	PLOS ONE												The assessment of a species' habitat is a crucial issue in ecology and conservation. While the collection of habitat data has been boosted by the availability of remote sensing technologies, certain habitat types have yet to be collected through costly, on-ground surveys, limiting study over large areas. Cliffs are ecosystems that provide habitat for a rich biodiversity, especially raptors. Because of their principally vertical structure, however, cliffs are not easy to study by remote sensing technologies, posing a challenge for many researches and managers working with cliff-related biodiversity. We explore the feasibility of Google Street View, a freely available on-line tool, to remotely identify and assess the nesting habitat of two cliff-nesting vultures (the griffon vulture and the globally endangered Egyptian vulture) in northwestern Spain. Two main usefulness of Google Street View to ecologists and conservation biologists were evaluated: i) remotely identifying a species' potential habitat and ii) extracting fine-scale habitat information. Google Street View imagery covered 49% (1,907 km) of the roads of our study area (7,000 km(2)). The potential visibility covered by on-ground surveys was significantly greater (mean: 97.4%) than that of Google Street View (48.1%). However, incorporating Google Street View to the vulture's habitat survey would save, on average, 36% in time and 49.5% in funds with respect to the on-ground survey only. The ability of Google Street View to identify cliffs (overall accuracy = 100%) outperformed the classification maps derived from digital elevation models (DEMs) (62-95%). Nonetheless, high-performance DEM maps may be useful to compensate Google Street View coverage limitations. Through Google Street View we could examine 66% of the vultures' nesting-cliffs existing in the study area (n = 148): 64% from griffon vultures and 65% from Egyptian vultures. It also allowed us the extraction of fine-scale features of cliffs. This World Wide Web-based methodology may be a useful, complementary tool to remotely map and assess the potential habitat of cliff-dependent biodiversity over large geographic areas, saving survey-related costs.

To help monitor this situation effectively, there have been many researches that utilize remote sensing images to identify the spread of Crofton weed. However, most of these researches found it difficult to identify Crofton weed because it is mixed and entangled with a large number of other vegetation. In our research, data processing includes three steps: 1) Retrieving the spectral feature values of Crofton weed at the different growth stages through long time regional sampling; 2) Comparing the NDVI of Crofton weeds, forests, crops, water bodies, residential areas in the typical sampling regions by using the time series data of remote sensing images; and finally, 3) Classifying the remote sensing images of the research regions according to the distinctive features of NDVI curves based on the time series data. The outcome of following these three data processing steps is a relatively accurate classification result, which produces a high-accuracy distribution map of the Crofton weed.																	2161-024X						2013																		WOS:000339361500094

Distribution of Commiphora wightii (Arnt.) Bhand. in Rajasthan with Special Emphasis on its Conservation Planning in Arid Areas	VEGETOS												Commiphora wightii (Arnott) Bhand., commonly known as 'Guggal', is an important medicinal plant that has been categorized as threatened but International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has put it under data deficient (DD) category. Consequently, placing it in 'Data Deficient' category of IUCN requires detailed information on its spatial distribution and other related aspects. Hence we report here the results of our appraisal of Guggal in Rajasthan, using remote sensing and ground truthing. A base map of Guggal was prepared using Geographical Information System (GIS) open source software Quantum GIS, SAGA. Landsat ETM+ and ASTER GDEM (Advanced Space borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model) Satellite Data were used. By clipping Aster GDEM Data with district boundary it was then provided color range to get elevation information. A digital elevation model of Rajasthan physiography was developed from ASTER and GDEM Data that has 30 m resolution. GIS layers of area of occurrences for Guggal plant and elevation were created. This map along with topographic sheets of 1:50000 were used for field traversing and ground truthing in 35 expeditions from 2009 to 2012. From the ground data, GPS data of longitude, latitude and altitude of each survey points were used in creating GIS layers in a 3D elevation map as also Guggal distribution and density map in 20 districts of Rajasthan. Results revealed that Guggal predominantly occurs in hilly and piedmonts zone. Its density was low in southeast Rajasthan (2-5 plants/ha) compared to western Rajasthan (8-10 plants/ha. In view of better vigour and survival in native sites in western Rajasthan's bioclimatic conditions, its ex-situ and in-situ conservation will be more successful in the districts of Jaisalmer, Barmer, Jalore and Jodhpur than in other areas.																	0970-4078	2092-7843					2013	26				SI		113	120		10.5958/j.2229-4473.26.2s.129                                                   								WOS:000335969200017

Despite their great value, mangroves have one of the highest rates of degradation of any global habitat, which is about 1% of the existing area per year. In fact, the socioeconomic value and ecosystem services of mangroves as a natural product are underestimated. The ecosystem services provided by mangroves are often ignored by the ongoing process of mangrove conversion. This is a major reason why conservation of this ecosystem is not a popular alternative. Thus, the main objective of this study is to evaluate the changes in mangrove forests and valuation of their ecosystem services. SPOT 5 imageries of years 2000 and 2010 have been used for change detection analysis. The vegetation index such as NDVI and AVI and unsupervised classification technique were employed in image processing. In order to obtain the value of socioeconomic impact from the mangrove changes and biodiversity disturbances, the ecosystem service valuation (ESV) model was applied. Results show that the total value of the existing mangrove forest ecosystem service was RM1,901,859.84. The value per unit area is about RM 1,650.92 /ha. The total values of others were RM161, 33.2 (crop land) and RM3,107,500 (water bodies), respectively. It is evident that Sungai Merbok's Mangrove Forest Reserve is very important for coastal ecology, where the orientation of mangrove ecosystem is huge and serves to provide essential services for the community. It also plays a crucial role in providing ecological balance to the coastal environment.																	0302-9743		978-3-642-39643-4				2013	7972						611	622										WOS:000335143000044

From space and from the ground: determining forest dynamics in settlement projects in the Brazilian Amazon	INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW												Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has been partially attributed to the establishment of settlement projects. Acknowledging the difficulties in quantifying the rate and patterns of deforestation, the objective of this paper is to determine forest dynamics (deforestation and reforestation) in areas where settlement projects have been established, at multiple levels and using different methods. Using satellite images from 1985 to 2010, a study was conducted in five settlement projects in Para State, aiming to determine forest dynamics at municipal and settlement levels. At property level, participatory maps were constructed to understand settlers' perception of forest/non-forest areas. The results show that reforestation is the current process in the municipality and in some settlements. Settlers, however, perceive areas with secondary regrowth as potentially fertile cropland and might deforest again in the future. More research is needed to elucidate whether the observed reforestation will lead to a forest transition or is merely a temporary trend.																	1465-5489						2013	15	4					442	455		10.1505/146554813809025658								WOS:000333444800003

Previously known soil cation optima of the pteridophyte species were first used in calibration, i.e. to infer soil cation concentrations for sites on the basis of their pteridophyte species composition. Multiple linear regression based on spectral reflectance values in the Landsat image was then used to derive an equation that allowed the prediction of these calibrated soil values for unvisited sites in the study area. The predictive accuracy turned out to be high: the mean absolute error, as estimated by leave-one-out cross-validation, was just 7% of the total range of calibrated soil values. This method for detailed mapping of natural environmental variability in lowland tropical rainforest has applications for land-use planning, such as wildlife management, forestry, biodiversity conservation, and payments for carbon sequestration.

Breeding Birds Surveys were applied to investigate breeding waterbirds and their breeding activities in 2008 and 2011. GIS, remote sensing techniques and various satellite images were used to determine distributions, surface areas, zonal centroids, and displacements of the habitats in 2000, 2008 and 2011. The total number of bird species with and without breeding evidence in 2008 and 2011 were compared with the Chi-Square test. Habitats in each UTM grid in 2008 and 2011 were compared with McNemar's test. The impact of water level on habitats, number of breeding birds, and their breeding parameters were investigated using Spearman's correlation analyses. The major habitats were open waters, reed beds, scrubs and woodlands, wet grasslands, and mudflats. Significant increases were observed in open waters, reed beds, and wet grasslands, but no significant change was observed for scrubs and woodlands. Out of 70 UTM grids, 69 and 48 grids corresponding to 95 and 75 observation points were surveyed in 2008 and 2011, and 34 different waterbirds were identified. The total number of breeding waterbirds significantly increased in 2011. Open waters were positively correlated with reed beds and negatively correlated with mudflats. Among 34 waterbird species, changes in the breeding parameters of 22 species were significantly correlated with the changes occurring in the major habitats. Our study demonstrates that changes in water level significantly affected the existence of key habitats and theirs distributions, resulting in significant changes in the number of breeding waterbirds and their breeding activities.

Laurel Clark Earth Camp: Building a Framework for Teacher and Student Understanding of Earth Systems	COMMUNICATING SCIENCE: A NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SCIENCE EDUCATION AND PUBLIC OUTREACH	Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series				Conference on Communicating Science - A National Conference on Science Education and Public Outreach	AUG 04-08, 2012	Tucson, AZ	Astronom Soc Pacific				Laurel Clark Earth Camp is designed to inspire teachers and students to study their world through field experiences, remote sensing investigations, and hands on exploration, all of which lend context to scientific inquiry. In three different programs (for middle school students, for high school students, and for teachers) participants are challenged to understand Earth processes from the perspectives of both on-the ground inspection and from examination of satellite images, and use those multiple perspectives to determine best practices on both a societal and individual scale. Earth Camp is a field-based program that takes place both in the "natural" and built environment. Middle School Earth Camp introduces students to a variety of environmental science, engineering, technology, and societal approaches to sustainability. High School Earth Camp explores ecology and water resources from southern Arizona to eastern Utah, including a 5 day rafting trip. In both camps, students compare environmental change observed through repeat photography on the ground to changes observed from space. Students are encouraged to utilize their camp experience in considering their future course of study, career objectives, and lifestyle choices. During Earth Camp for Educators, teachers participate in a series of weekend workshops to explore relevant environmental science practices, including water quality testing, biodiversity surveys, water and light audits, and remote sensing. Teachers engage students, both in school and after school, in scientific investigations with this broad based set of tools. Earth Stories from Space is a website that will assist in developing skills and comfort in analyzing change over time and space using remotely sensed images. Through this three-year NASA funded program, participants will appreciate the importance of scale and perspective in understanding Earth systems and become inspired to make choices that protect the environment.																			978-1-58381-830-5				2013	473						275	+										WOS:000328179100042

It has been agreed on that there is no general solution on deriving information on habitats due to different data availability and spectral as well as textural behaviour of habitat main types (e.g. woodlands, grasslands, etc.). Therefore the monitoring should be rather multi-scale, versatile, user-friendly, and cost-efficient for predefined indicators. In the presented study, five Central European test sites of natural vegetation communities in an Alpine area (1), a temperate forest (2), a Pannonian grassland (3), a shallow lake (4) and a Carpathian grassland (5) have been investigated by multi-temporal remote sensing. For these studies, different time-series of RapidEye images from the years 2009 to 2011 and LandSat data from the year 1984 to 2010 were acquired. The amount of the images was depending on required acquisitions dates as well as weather conditions. The definition of the indicators was relying on the available ground truth data as well as the demands und judgement of the managing authorities in the nature conservation areas. The selected methods for deriving of the indicators depend on the time-series as well as the available calibration and validation data. The techniques vary between unsupervised classification, object-based approaches and supervised classification methods with algorithms such as support vector machines (e.g. SVM) or classification trees (e.g. See5). Often, the named methods are utilized in combined approaches. The resulting indicators for the monitoring are shrub encroachment (for 1), share of naturally occurring tree type (for 2), differentiation of grassland types (for 3 and 5) and the changing extent of a reed belt (for 4). All indicators seem to be valid and useful for the authorities within the conservation areas. In this article a specific example of the share of natural tree types in a temperate forest in Germany will be explained in detail.

In this paper we focus on the development of an automatic tree-crown detection and classification approach, which is in line individual-based investigations in the tropical mountain environment. Airborne laser scanning of discrete type was used with a very high granularity (>10 returns per square meter). The individual tree crown detection reached an accuracy of 51% while supervised classification of palm-trees reached an accuracy of 69%. Accuracy measurements are given in the paper. The detection and characterization of individual tree crowns is the first step in the development of a monitoring approach for the tropical mountain forest.																	0277-786X		978-0-8194-9763-5				2013	8893								UNSP 88930B	10.1117/12.2029912								WOS:000327619300008

Recent advances in radar remote sensing technology raise significant interest to take advantage of the complementary nature of optical and radar data. This paper proposes an approach combining Landsat ETM+ and Advanced Land-Observing Satellite-Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS/PALSAR) data for forest biodiversity and species richness monitoring. Inventory data from one part of the Hyrcanian forest in north of Iran is used as field data. Visible and infrared ETM+ bands, indices and textures information as well as HH, HV backscattering, polarimetric features (alpha angle, entropy and anisotropy) and SAR texture are extracted. We use the multiple linear regression model to find the best components to describe the biodiversity indices in the study area. We show how tree biodiversity is related to information derived from ETM+ and ALOS/PALSAR data at 95% confidence level (R-2=0.63, root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.70). Also, the effects of each component on the variation of biodiversity are shown. ETM+ reflectance, polarimetric features and texture from ALOS/PALSAR can describe approximately 63% of biodiversity. The results of multi source monitoring of tree biodiversity and species richness are promising and worth further investigation.

The biodiversity-rich Anamalai hill ranges in the Western Ghats of southern India hold a viable population for the long-term conservation of the Asian elephant. Through rapid but extensive field surveys we mapped elephant habitat, corridors, vegetation and land-use patterns, estimated the elephant population density and structure, and assessed elephant-human conflict across this landscape. GIS and remote sensing analyses indicate that elephants are distributed among three blocks over a total area of about 4600 km(2). Approximately 92% remains contiguous because of four corridors; however, under 4000 km2 of this area may be effectively used by elephants. Nine landscape elements were identified, including five natural vegetation types, of which tropical moist deciduous forest is dominant. Population density assessed through the dung count method using line transects covering 275 km of walk across the effective elephant habitat of the landscape yielded a mean density of 1.1 (95% Cl = 0.99-1.2) elephant/km(2). Population structure from direct sighting of elephants showed that adult male elephants constitute just 2.9% and adult females 42.3% of the population with the rest being subadults (27.4%), juveniles (16%) and calves (11.4%). Sex ratios show an increasing skew toward females from juvenile (1:1.8) to sub-adult (1:2.4) and adult (1:14.7) indicating higher mortality of sub-adult and adult males that is most likely due to historical poaching for ivory. A rapid questionnaire survey and secondary data on elephant-human conflict from forest department records reveals that villages in and around the forest divisions on the eastern side of landscape experience higher levels of elephant-human conflict than those on the western side; this seems to relate to a greater degree of habitat fragmentation and percentage farmers cultivating annual crops in the east. We provide several recommendations that could help maintain population viability and reduce elephant-human conflict of the Anamalai elephant landscape.

Patterns of past and recent conversion of indigenous grasslands in the South Island, New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												We used recent satellite imagery to quantify the extent, type, and rate of conversion of remaining indigenous grasslands in the inland eastern South Island of New Zealand in recent years. We describe the pattern of conversion in relation to national classifications of land use capability and land environments, and ecological and administrative districts and regions. We show that although large areas of indigenous grasslands remain, grassland loss has been ongoing. Indigenous grassland was reduced in the study area by 3% (70 200 ha) between 1990 and 2008. Almost two-thirds of post-1990 conversion occurred in threatened environments with less than 30% of indigenous cover remaining, primarily in the Waitaki, Mackenzie and Central Otago administrative districts. This conversion occurred primarily on non-arable land. In the Mackenzie and Waitaki districts the rate of conversion in 2001-2008 was approximately twice that in 1990-2001. Opportunities to protect more of the full range of indigenous grasslands lie with the continuing tenure review process in these districts.																	0110-6465	1177-7788					2013	37	1					127	138										WOS:000326145100015

Data collection and mapping of habitats has been boosted by the rapid growth of remote sensing. An island-wide combined survey, focused on Aleppo oak (Q. infectoria) habitats, was undertaken using freely available on-line satellite imagery (Google Earth) and field inspection. The results of the survey, in combination with a weighting methodology, identified areas with high conservation value-Important Oak Areas (IOAs), for potential habitat protection. It is suggested that World Wide Web-based methodologies of habitat identification could be a complementary ecological and conservation tool for remote mapping and assessment of habitats over a broad spatial scale																	0277-786X		978-0-8194-9638-6				2013	8795								UNSP 879522	10.1117/12.2028893								WOS:000325475000074

Protected under the habitat directive, EU member states have to undertake surveillance of habitats and species of community interest and report every six years on habitat range and distribution, conservation status and the future prospects of the habitats within and outside of protected sites. Remote sensing techniques have been applied successfully to monitor habitat changes relevant for Natura 2000 monitoring using multi-temporal satellite image data, but many challenges remain especially outside protected sites to assess the development of habitats over time. A flexible information layer concept was developed within the FP7 project MS.MONINA to address the complex task of monitoring natural habitats. In this paper the new approach to classify grassland land cover classes in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, will be presented. Based on ecological parameters experts defined simple description models, which were used by image analysts to extract corresponding image features for four different grassland types. Information layer operators were defined to extract image features for subsequent classifications.																	1432-8364						2013		5					415	426		10.1127/1432-8364/2013/0188								WOS:000325507600002						
J	Albalawi, EK; Kumar, L				Albalawi, Eman K.; Kumar, Lalit			Using remote sensing technology to detect, model and map desertification: A review	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT												Desertification is a serious global environmental problem that affects many people directly in countries with semi-arid or arid climates. The causes of desertification are diverse and complicated, ranging from international economic activities to unsustainable land use practices of local communities. The consequence of desertification reduces the ability of the land to support life and decreases biodiversity. Natural processes and artificial forces initiate this process. Natural causes of desertification include climatic factors drought, and water or wind erosion. Human induced activities that can cause desertification include over-cultivation, overgrazing, deforestation, and poor water management. The aim of this paper is to analyse how remote sensing and GIS have been used to monitor desertification globally. Remote sensing has proven to be efficient in detecting desertification processes including changes in natural vegetation, land use, and soil. Multi-temporal coverage provided by satellite data facilitates the use of remote sensing imagery to monitor changes in land coverage and usage over time. Remote sensing data and GIS are critical for extracting reliable information important for assessing environmental changes and land quality in any given region. Various techniques in remote sensing combined with analytical methods such as NDVI or classification provide primary data that can be used to assess desertification processes. Several key indicators of the processes of desertification are identified where remote sensing can be used to detect, monitor, and map affected areas. Changing vegetation and land use, drought, soil, erosion, and urbanization are the most common indicators of desertification used by researchers. Results of studies can be used to make important management, environmental, and political decisions. Therefore, care, must be taken to use recent imagery, select the appropriate technique, and to include as much additional data as possible so that reliable and robust results are obtained.																	1459-0255	1459-0263					2013	11	2					791	797										WOS:000322219600001

As a geomorphologically active segment in the middle reach of Yangtze River, China, Jingjiang segment provides important ecologic functions for Yangtze River. Taking upper Jingjiang segment as an example and using Landsat ETM+ imageries respectively acquired in the high-water and low-flow periods of 2002, we aims to understand the usefulness of multi-temporal remote-sensing data for the study of fluvial landscape in middle reach of large alluvial river. Four types of first-level landscape and 10 subtypes of second-level landscape are extracted from imageries. Scale effect of the fluvial landscape of upper Jingjiang segment is addressed. Surface-connected channel forms the matrix of upper Jingjiang segment in all hydrologic periods. Isolated patches of river islands, which are large in size and long in edge length and have high contiguity, may have critical importance for the fluvial landscape of upper Jingjiang segment. Patches of channel bars are relatively small in size but abundant in number and have high connectance. Pool patches, which are small in size, abundant in number and irregular in shape, may be of particular importance for the fluvial landscape in low-flow period. Large changes of the landscape of upper Jingjiang segment within a hydrologic period are also clearly presented and reflect the effect of hydrological disturbance. Patches in low-flow period are smaller in size, more in number, longer in edge length and more irregular in shape than that in high-water period. The contagion, diversity and evenness of patches apparently increase in low-flow period.																	2157-1473		978-0-7695-4932-3				2013							1095	1102		10.1109/ICMTMA.2013.268								WOS:000320989700265

The main causes of degradation include unsustainable logging, agriculture, invasive species, fire, fuelwood gathering, and livestock grazing. Forest degradation is widespread and has become an important consideration in global policy processes that deal with biodiversity, climate change, and forest management. There is, however, no generally recognized way to identify a degraded forest because perceptions of forest degradation vary depending on the cause, the particular goods or services of interest, and the temporal and spatial scales considered. Here, we suggest that there are types of forest degradation that produce a continuum of decline in provision of ecosystem services, from those in primary forests through various forms of managed forests to deforestation. Forest degradation must be measured against a desired baseline condition, and the types of degradation can be represented using five criteria that relate to the drivers of degradation, loss of ecosystem services and sustainable management, including: productivity, biodiversity, unusual disturbances, protective functions, and carbon storage. These criteria are not meant to be equivalent and some might be considered more important than others, depending on the local forest management objectives. We propose a minimum subset of seven indicators for the five criteria that should be assessed to determine forest degradation under a sustainable ecosystem management regime. The indicators can be remotely sensed (although improving calibration requires ground work) and aggregated from stand to management unit or landscape levels and ultimately to sub-national and national scales.

The possibility of using remote sensing technology of lidars for monitoring ecosystem health by detecting habitat condition	XIX INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON HIGH-POWER LASER SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS 2012	Proceedings of SPIE				19th International Symposium on High-Power Laser Systems and Applications (HPLS&A)	SEP 10-14, 2012	Istanbul, TURKEY	TUBITAK Marmara Arastirma Merkezi, European Off Aerosp Res & Dev (EOARD), OSA, Quantel, Global Analitik, Mateck GmbH, Optomek, EZAN, Laser Syst, Edinburgh Photon, Opt m, Sci Res, Star Alliance, SPIE, AF Off Sci Res, USAF Res Lab				Since the emergence of laser and henceforth laser remote sensing in the 1960's, lidar (light detecting and ranging) technology has became a significant tool for the detection of various phenomena like wind direction and intensity, atmospheric temperature, urban and rural topography, forest fires, ocean planktonic development, and detection of various constituants such as tropospheric aerosols, stratospheric ozone, trace chemicals and etc. In 2009, a homemade multiwavelength Raman aerosol lidar (named MRC K09) was designed, developed and installed in the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) Marmara Research Center (MRC), and since 21 February 2011, it has been accepted to EARLINET (European Aerosol Research Lidar Network). Since 2009, aerosol spatio-temporal distribution and microphysical properties have been investigated in the extremely industrialized vicinity [1,2]. MRC K09 lidar uses a Quantel Brilliant B Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm) with the second and third optical harmonics at 532 and 355 nm, and a homemade Newtonian 40 cm aperture 120 cm focal length telescope. It has 7 channel spectrum analyzer detecting: parallel and perpendicular polarizations at 355 nm, elastic signals at 532 and 1064 nm, Raman signal of molecular nitrogen at 387 nm and Raman signal of water vapor at 408 nm (excited with 355 laser line), and Raman signal for molecular nitrogen at 608 nm (excited with 532 nm laser line). In Spring 2010, preliminary applications for the determination of forest tree species and of forest health in the Black Sea Area using an aeroborne lidar in collaboration with Bartin University, Bartin, Turkey have been made. In early 2011, a fluorescence module utilizing a Princeton Instruments PI-MAX3 1024x256 resolution CCD camera with a Princeton Instruments Acton SP 2500 0.500 m Imaging Triple Grating Monochromator/Spectograph was connected to the MRC K09 lidar system, and the first remote measurements of chlorophyll from different types of trees were made. Figure 1 demonstrates the results of these measurements, which must be considered as preliminary and in the future, the measurements can be carried out by the lidar mounted on an aircraft to cover large spatial areas. One of the most important reasons for biodiversity loss, habitat loss and fragmentation can be monitored in large areas by aeroborne lidars and therefore the extent of the situation can be accessed precisely, faster and more efficiently. This paper aims to give a brief overview to show the possibility of detecting the detailed situations of the habitats on terrain surfaces using lidar technology by summarizing the successful examples which have been realized thus far in different types of ecosystems like savannas, forest and grasslands.																	0277-786X		978-0-8194-9455-9				2013	8677								UNSP 86771C	10.1117/12.2014217								WOS:000319867800048

Often, conservation managers are reliant on manually derived fire-history mapping products that delineate fire perimeters. An alternative standard approach concerns the application of remote sensing, typically using band combination indices obtained from relatively fine-scale imagery sensors. For Fraser Island, a World Heritage Area in subtropical, fire-prone eastern Australia, we contrast diagnostic fire-regime characteristics for different vegetation types over a 20-year period (1989-2008) as derived from historical manual, and remotely sensed, fire-mapping approaches. For the remote sensing component we adapt a commonly used approach utilising a differenced normalised burn ratio (dNBR) index derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery. Manual mapping resulted in overestimation of fire-affected area (especially large fires) and fire frequency, whereas the dNBR procedure resulted in underestimation of fire-affected area under low fire-severity conditions, and overestimation of fire patchiness. Of significance for conservation management, (1) age class and related distributions for flammable vegetation types differed markedly between the two mapping approaches, (2) regardless, both methods demonstrated that substantial fuel loads had accumulated in flammable vegetation types by the end of the study period and (3) fuel age was shown to have a more significant effect than did seasonality on the incidence of very large (. 1000 ha) fires. The study serves as an introduction to ongoing research concerning the measurement and application of fire patchiness to conservation management in flammable eastern Australian vegetation types.

J	Munyati, C; Ratshibvumo, T; Ogola, J				Munyati, Christopher; Ratshibvumo, Thihanedzwi; Ogola, Jason			Landsat TM image segmentation for delineating geological zone correlated vegetation stratification in the Kruger National Park, South Africa	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												Image classification approaches are widely used in mapping vegetation on remotely sensed images. Vegetation assemblages are equivalent to habitats. Whereas sub-pixel classification approaches potentially can produce more realistic, homogenous habitat maps, pixel-based hard classifier approaches often result in non-homogenous habitat zones. This salt-and-pepper habitat mapping is particularly a challenge on images of savannas, given the characteristic patchy texture of scattered trees and grass. Image segmentation techniques offer possibilities for homogenous habitat classification. This study aimed at establishing the extent to which established, field surveyed and geology-related vegetation types in South Africa's Kruger National Park (KNP) can be reproduced using image segmentation. Rain season Landsat TM images were used, selected to coincide with the peak in vegetation productivity, which was deemed the time of year when discrimination between key habitats in KNP is most likely to be successful. The multiresolution segmentation mode in eCognition 5.0 was employed, object classification accomplished using the nearest neighbour (NN) classifier, using object texture and training area mean values in the NN feature space. Compared to delineations of the vegetation types of KNP on a digital map of the vegetation zones that was tested, image segmentation successfully mapped the zones (overall accuracy 85.3%, K-boolean AND = 82.7%) despite slight shifts in the location of vegetation zone boundaries. Maximum likelihood classification (MLC) of the same images was only 37% accurate (K-boolean AND = 24.2%). Whereas the vegetation zones resulting from MLC were non-homogenous, with considerable spectral confusion among the vegetation zones, image segmentation produced more homogenous vegetation zones, comparably more useful for conservation management, because realistic and meaningful habitat maps are important in biodiversity conservation as input data upon which to base management decisions. Image segmentation appears to be a useful approach in mapping savanna vegetation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

As such, protection of mangroves is an urgent priority. This work provides some new information on patterns of degradation in the Sundarbans, the largest contiguous mangrove forest in the world, which are home to more than 35 reptile species, 120 commercial fish species, 300 bird species and 32 mammal species. Using radar imagery, we contrast and quantify the recent impacts of cyclone Sidr and anthropogenic degradation on this ecosystem. Our results, inferred from changes in radar backscatter, confirm already reported trends in coastline retreat for this region, with areas losing as much as 200 m of coast per year. They also suggest rapid changes in mangrove dynamics for Bangladesh and India, highlighting an overall decrease in mangrove health in the east side of the Sundarbans, and an overall increase in this parameter for the west side of the Sundarbans. As global environmental change takes its toll in this part of the world, more detailed, regular information on mangroves' distribution and health is required: our study illustrates how different threats experienced by mangroves can be detected and mapped using radar-based information, to guide management action.

J	Bargiel, D				Bargiel, D.			Capabilities of high resolution satellite radar for the detection of semi-natural habitat structures and grasslands in agricultural landscapes	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												The loss of species is an ongoing process threatening the services provided by ecosystems for humanity. In agricultural areas, which globally occupy the largest areas, species diversity is strongly dependent on the farmers' management. If management allows for a landscape structure with many remnants of natural or semi-natural vegetation, the diversity and amount of flora and fauna is higher compared to intensive agricultural landscapes with large, continuous field parcels and a low crop variety. Knowledge of agricultural management is crucial for the development and monitoring of political strategies that aim to enhance or conserve species in agricultural areas. Remote sensing is a cost effective way to acquire this knowledge for large spatial areas with high temporal resolution. Since 2008, modern satellite-based radar sensors deliver images of unprecedented high quality. Since the acquisition of radar images is not restricted by atmospheric conditions, it is very capable of multitemporal classifications. In the presented study, possibilities for supervised multitemporal classification of non crop areas are investigated based on TerraSAR-X images and two different classifiers (Maximum Likelihood and Random Forest). The best results were achieved for the classification of woody structures where producer's accuracies are above 80%. Despite lower values for the other classes (flower strips 75%, grasslands 75.8% and herbaceous 57%), these classes are easily recognized. This is illustrated by different map examples. The presented results can contribute essentially to the monitoring, investigation and increasing of habitat structures in agricultural areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Tree Species Discrimination in Tropical Forests Using Airborne Imaging Spectroscopy	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												We identify canopy species in a Hawaiian tropical forest using supervised classification applied to airborne hyperspectral imagery acquired with the Carnegie Airborne Observatory-Alpha system. Nonparametric methods (linear and radial basis function support vector machine, artificial neural network, and k-nearest neighbor) and parametric methods (linear, quadratic, and regularized discriminant analysis) are compared for a range of species richness values and training sample sizes. We find a clear advantage in using regularized discriminant analysis, linear discriminant analysis, and support vector machines. No unique optimal classifier was found for all conditions tested, but we highlight the possibility of improving support vector machine classification with a better optimization of its free parameters. We also confirm that a combination of spectral and spatial information increases accuracy of species classification: we combine segmentation and species classification from regularized discriminant analysis to produce a map of the 17 discriminated species. Finally, we compare different methods to assess spectral separability and find a better ability of Bhattacharyya distance to assess separability within and among species. The results indicate that species mapping is tractable in tropical forests when using high-fidelity imaging spectroscopy.

Relationship between sagebrush species and structural characteristics and Landsat Thematic Mapper data	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions Do the spectral patterns recorded by Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) for various sagebrush species differ from each other? Could ancillary data derived from topographic variables (elevation, slope and aspect) strengthen the relationship between sagebrush and spectral characteristics? Location Rawlins, Wyoming, USA. Methods Field data on sagebrush species and structural characteristics collected in 2005 were regressed against spectral values and transformed indices derived from Landsat TM data. Step-wise regression methods were used to build (1) a combined model that ignored species and physical differences in sagebrush, and (2) four different models that took those differences in account. Parsimonious models were selected with significant independent variables that accounted for the largest amount of the ground-measured variation in cover. Results In the combined model, a subset of Landsat bands and topographic values accounted for 65% (P < 0.001) of variance in sagebrush canopy cover. However, when separate regression models were fitted based on species type (big and low sagebrush) and height (for big sagebrush only), Landsat data accounted for 7185% (P < 0.001) of the ground measured variance. Conclusions Spectral patterns of sagebrush species and their physical characteristics were distinguishable with Landsat TM data. Transformed indices derived from Landsat data accounted for more variance than the original spectral bands. Future research should focus on testing the relationship between Landsat TM data and sites where sagebrush is present with other vegetation to facilitate landscape and regional mapping of changing sagebrush ecosystems.

The ability to infer ecological processes from landscape changes provides a powerful new tool for large-scale and regional ecological research. Accordingly, we investigated landscape changes in Nikko National Park (Japan) from 1981 to 2006 using an integration of remote sensing images to track ecological processes in the park. We showed that natural succession and anthropogenic disturbance have caused an enormous expansion of coniferous forest (mostly Larix kaempferi and Tsuga diverifolia), which has resulted in an alteration of sika deer (Cervus nippon) habitat structure. The deer population has vastly increased in size, with concomitantly negative effects on the biodiversity of forest-floor vegetation. All changes that we detected have degraded landscape and ecosystem sustainability. Our integrated use of remote sensing images in 2006 accurately identified and classified landscape pattern in the study area. We achieved an overall accuracy of 96.48%, demonstrating that the procedure has an enormous potential for synthetic processing of multitemporal and multiresource remote sensing images.

The spatial distribution of these habitats influence the abundance and interactions of animal species, and the change or destruction of habitat can cause the disturbance of key biological processes. This study uses multi-temporal L-band ALOS/PALSAR, C-band RADARSAT-2, and ENVISAT/ASAR data to map ecosystems and create a lake distribution map of the Lower Nhecolandia subregion in the Brazilian Pantanal. First, backscattering analysis was conducted on individual training objects to gain a better understanding of the backscattering characteristics of each class. Then, a Level 1 object-based image analysis (OBIA) classification based on hierarchical principles first classified the region into "Lakes" and "Not Lakes". This was followed by a Level 2 classification defining six vegetation habitats (Forest Woodland, Open Wood Savanna, Open Grass Savanna, Agriculture, Swampy Grassland and Vazantes) which was achieved at an overall accuracy of 83%. A Level 3 classification defined the "Lakes" class into a) Fresh (baias) and Brackish (salinas) lakes (accuracy results of 98%); and a further classification level dividing the fresh lakes, b) Fresh lakes with floating and emergent vegetation (baias), and Fresh lakes with the presence of Typha (salobras), and including the Brackish lakes (salinas) (overall accuracy results of 81%). The results of this study provide the first fine spatial resolution classification showing the spatial distribution of terrestrial and aquatic habitats for the entire subregion of Lower Nhecolandia using dual season, dual polarization C and L-band SAR imagery.

A meta-analysis of terrestrial aboveground biomass estimation using lidar remote sensing	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Estimating biomass of terrestrial vegetation is not only a rapidly expanding research area, but also a subject of tremendous interest for reducing carbon emissions associated with deforestation and forest degradation (REDD). The accuracy of biomass estimates, and rate of biomass change, is not only important in the context of carbon markets emerging under REDD, but also for characterizing uncertainty in estimates of carbon cycling and the global carbon budget. There is particular interest in mapping biomass so that carbon stocks and stock changes can be monitored consistently across a range of scales - from relatively small projects (tens of hectares) to national or continental scales - but also so that other benefits of forest conservation can be factored into decision making (e.g. biodiversity and habitat corridors). We conducted an analysis of reported biomass accuracy estimates from more than 70 refereed articles using different remote sensing platforms (airborne and spaceborne) and sensor types (optical, radar, and lidar), with a particular focus on lidar since those papers reported the lowest errors when used in a synergistic manner with other coincident multi-sensor measurements. We show systematic differences in accuracy between different types of Iidar systems flown on different platforms but, perhaps more importantly, differences between forest types (biomes) and plot sizes used for field calibration and assessment. We discuss these findings in relation to monitoring, reporting and verification under REDD, and also in the context of more systematic assessment of factors that influence accuracy and error estimation.

The objective of this study was to generate the coastal and marine habitat map for the Straits of Malacca using the SPOT and Landsat data acquired at low tide in 2010 similar to 2012. Images were first processed with atmospheric and geometric correction. The hierarchical unsupervised classification and contextual editing were then used to produce the final habitat map. The WorldView2 and GeoEye data were also used for evaluating purposes in some studied area. Our classification scheme included sandy beach, mangrove forest, mud /sand flat, seagrass /algae, coral reefs, water and others. The produced habitat map provides the most up to date habitat information in the Straits of Malacca and will aid for the regional coastal ecosystems assessment as well as for future comparative study.

Landcover analysis and habitat characterization are now annually performed using very high resolution satellite Pleiades imagery acquired at the end of hamster's hibernation period, highlighting the threats to the rodent in the area and the positive effects of the species conservation actions. Through the spatial analyses of these cartographic results, favorable crop density indicators are derived providing an overview of biotopes connectivity.

The MAREDAT global database of high performance liquid chromatography marine pigment measurements	EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA												A global pigment database consisting of 35 634 pigment suites measured by high performance liquid chromatography was assembled in support of the MARine Ecosytem DATa (MAREDAT) initiative. These data originate from 136 field surveys within the global ocean, were solicited from investigators and databases, compiled, and then quality controlled. Nearly one quarter of the data originates from the Laboratoire d'Oceanographie de Villefranche (LOV), with an additional 17% and 19% stemming from the US JGOFS and LTER programs, respectively. The MAREDAT pigment database provides high quality measurements of the major taxonomic pigments including chlorophylls a and b, 19'-butanoyloxyfucoxanthin, 19'-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin, alloxanthin, divinyl chlorophyll a, fucoxanthin, lutein, peridinin, prasinoxanthin, violaxanthin and zeaxanthin, which may be used in varying combinations to estimate phytoplankton community composition. Quality control measures consisted of flagging samples that had a total chlorophyll a concentration of zero, had fewer than four reported accessory pigments, or exceeded two standard deviations of the log-linear regression of total chlorophyll a with total accessory pigment concentrations. We anticipate the MAREDAT pigment database to be of use in the marine ecology, remote sensing and ecological modeling communities, where it will support model validation and advance our global perspective on marine biodiversity. The original dataset together with quality control flags as well as the gridded MAREDAT pigment data may be downloaded from PANGAEA: http://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.793246.

Thus, the holistic understanding of the complex mechanisms that control LU/LC requires synergetic adoption of measurement approaches, addressing issues, and identifying drivers of change and state of art technologies for mitigation measures. As the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of the LU/LC increases, its impact on biodiversity becomes even more difficult to anticipate. Thus, in order to understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of change in landscape and its relationship to biodiversity, it is necessary to reliably identify and quantify the indicators of change. In addition, it is also important to have better understanding of the technologies and techniques that serve as complimentary tool for land mitigation and conservation planning. Against this background, the chapter aims to synthesize LU/LC studies worldwide and their impacts on biodiversity. This chapter explores identification and analysis of key natural, socio-economic and regulatory drivers for LU/LC. Finally, it attempts to collate some LU/LC studies involving usage of geospatial tools, such as satellite remote sensing, Geographic Information System (GIS), Global Positioning System (GPS), and integrative tools, besides conventional approaches that could assist decision makers, land managers, stakeholders and researchers in better management and formulation of conservation strategies based on scientific grounds.																			978-1-4666-2039-1; 978-1-4666-2038-4				2013							1913	1939		10.4018/978-1-4666-2038-4.ch114	10.4018/978-1-4666-2038-4							WOS:000418007600115

Measuring and reliable reporting of trends and changes in biodiversity requires that data and indicators are collected and analysed in a standard and comparable way. LiDAR is an alternative remote sensing technology that allows to increase the accuracy of biophysical measurements and to extend spatial analysis into the third dimension. The BIO_SOS project shows alternatives to measure habitat diversity as a proxy for biodiversity on the basis of plant life forms. The objective of our study is to assess to what extent LiDAR can be used to map and monitor plant life forms and associated General Habitat Categories (GHCs). The conclusions are that LiDAR provides accurate height measurements on shrubs and trees, even in early spring when no leaves are present. Canopy height models as derived from LiDAR and in combination with very high resolution satellite imagery provides a powerful tool with for the identification of plant life forms and as a direct input for spatial modelling of species distribution. Since LiDAR data are not everywhere available, finding alternatives for height feature extraction from optical imagery for might be worthwhile.																			978-3-87907-532-4				2013							520	523		10.1553/giscience2013s520								WOS:000346201100068

Improved access to integrated biodiversity data for science, practice, and policy - the European Biodiversity Observation Network (EU BON)	NATURE CONSERVATION-BULGARIA												Biodiversity is threatened on a global scale and the losses are ongoing. In order to stop further losses and maintain important ecosystem services, programmes have been put into place to reduce and ideally halt these processes. A whole suite of different approaches is needed to meet these goals. One major scientific contribution is to collate, integrate and analyse the large amounts of fragmented and diverse biodiversity data to determine the current status and trends of biodiversity in order to inform the relevant decision makers. To contribute towards the achievement of these challenging tasks, the project EU BON was developed. The project is focusing mainly on the European continent but contributes at the same time to a much wider global initiative, the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON), which itself is a part of the Group of Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). EU BON will build on existing infrastructures such as GBIF, LifeWatch and national biodiversity data centres in Europe and will integrate relevant biodiversity data from on-ground observations to remote sensing information, covering terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats. A key feature of EU BON will be the delivery of relevant, fully integrated data to multiple and different stakeholders and end users ranging from local to global levels. Through development and application of new standards and protocols, EU BON will enable greater interoperability of different data layers and systems, provide access to improved analytical tools and services, and will provide better harmonised biodiversity recording and monitoring schemes from citizen science efforts to long-term research programs to mainstream future data collecting. Furthermore EU BON will support biodiversity science-policy interfaces, facilitate political decisions for sound environmental management, and help to conserve biodiversity for human well-being at different levels, ranging from communal park management to the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). Additionally, the project will strengthen European capacities and infrastructures for environmental information management and sustainable development. The following paper outlines the framework and the approach that are pursued.

Remotely sensed indicators of forest conservation status: Case study from a Natura 2000 site in southern Portugal	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The successful implementation of habitat conservation measures demands regular and spatially explicit monitoring and reporting on conservation status at a range of scales, based on indicators of both habitat range and condition (structure and functions required for long-term maintenance). Such is the case with the Natura 2000 protected areas in Europe. Focusing on the cork oak (Quercus suber) forests of one such area, the Serra de Monchique in southern Portugal, we test the complementarity and joint effectiveness of airborne multispectral and laser scanning (lidar) in providing robust indicators of conservation status. Principal forest types and other land covers are mapped to an accuracy of up to 70% (11 land cover classes) and 81% (5 classes) by fusing the two remote sensing datasets, results that are superior to using either one alone. Using previously tested relationships between lidar height metrics, forest vegetation structure and species diversity, we develop a map predicting areas of high (22% of area), medium (25%) and low (53%) condition. We recommend the further development and testing of remotely sensed range and condition indicators of conservation status for their application in important forested sites across Europe and beyond.

The aim of this article is (i) to review the state of the use of high-resolution remote sensing for ecological studies in the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) and (ii) to suggest further potential avenues of research in the region using this technology. It has been recognized that the recent improvements in remote sensing have enabled researchers to categorize and spatially map species and communities and to detect vegetation types based on ecological gradients and environmental drivers. Across the globe, the use of current high-resolution imagery in vegetation studies is increasing due to their improved efficiency, as fine-scale vegetation information is needed for both theoretical understanding of the processes involved and conservation towards the maintenance of ecological functions of natural ecosystems. Remote sensing is particularly useful in the IHR, where field-based mapping of forest vegetation and land cover using conventional techniques is a cost-and time-intensive effort. Mapping fine-scale patterns of tree species using high-resolution remote-sensing data has important implications for the understanding and monitoring of ecosystem function and biodiversity patterns in forests.

Monitoring studies or even surveys of species and community diversity in changing landscapes or disturbed areas require an assessment of the land cover changes over time. Here, we present a method combining remote sensing and structural equation models (SEM) to describe and analyse landscape dynamics. We focus on the mount Oku as an example, which is a mountain area located in north-west Cameroon. This site hosts the largest remaining tract of Central African cloud forest, a biodiversity hotspot threatened by contemporary land-use changes. Our aim is to characterize land cover changes over the last three decades and to quantify and elucidate the causes of deforestation and forest fragmentation. For this purpose, we integrate several Landsat satellite images taken between 1978 and 2007 in a Geographic Information System (GIS), and compare changes in land-use types. We assess forest fragmentation over this period by comparing the number, the area and the perimeter of forest fragments, and derive a forest fragmentation index. Finally, we quantify the respective effects of natural (altitude, slope) and human (human density, distance to villages) factors on deforestation using SEM. We evidence two periods in the dynamics of the cloud forest cover: a period of intense deforestation (1978-2001), followed by a period of re-afforestation (2001-2007). The forest cover lost 62.1% of its area (12,060 ha) between 1978 and 2001, corresponding to an averaged deforestation rate of 579 ha.yr(-1). Deforested areas were mainly converted into crop lands (+75.6% between 1978 and 1988), under the pressure of an increasing human density, which was multiplied by 20 between 1921 and 2005 and doubled during the last 18 years. After 2001, the forest cover stabilized with the appearance of numerous small fragments of secondary forest, reflecting the success of the local biodiversity protection programs. Despite this recent progression of the forest cover, the proportion of ancient forest has continuously decreased from 1978 to 2007, indicating that deforestation is still ongoing. In 2007, the forest cover was a mosaic composed of 66% of recent secondary forests (i.e. forests appeared after 1978) and only 34% of ancient forests (i.e. present before 1978). Between 1978 and 2007, the number of forest fragments increased from 2627 to 5183, their average area decreased from 7.4 to 1.8 ha, and perimeter from 912 to 446 m, and the forest fragmentation index increased by 285.7%. Deforestation started from lower altitudes (<2300 m, before 1988) and progressed towards higher altitudes (2100-2900 m) between 1988 and 2001. SEM showed that altitude and slope had a significant negative effect on human density, explaining why the deforestation has been low on steep slopes and/or at higher altitudes. Our study reveals that the last fragments of the primary cloud forest of mount Oku could be definitively lost in the next decades. As tropical primary forests are irreplaceable ecosystems that host numerous endemic species, we recommend (1) to urgently protect the last remnants of ancient forest for their biological value; clear-cuts, grazing in forest interior and fires should be excluded from these areas, and (2) to extend secondary forests around ancient forest fragments so that they can act as a protective buffer and be managed as community forests and used for hunting and logging activities.																	1253-8078					DEC	2012	159	4					451	466		10.1080/12538078.2012.750583								WOS:000316540600007						
J	Dickson, B; Kapos, V				Dickson, Barney; Kapos, Valerie			Biodiversity monitoring for REDD+	CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY												Increasing emphasis on social and environmental safeguards for REDD+ in the UNFCCC and work under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) have prompted growing interest in biodiversity monitoring for REDD+, but most discussions of REDD+ monitoring have so far centred on greenhouse gas emissions and removals at national level. Challenges in monitoring biodiversity for REDD+ include choosing which aspects of biodiversity to monitor, the difficulty of attributing particular changes to REDD+ and the likely scarcity of resources for biodiversity monitoring. Three responses can help address these challenges. First, already-agreed policy targets can help to identify what should be monitored. Second, making links to existing biodiversity monitoring and to monitoring to estimate GHG emissions and removals (both remote sensing and ground based inventories) can provide some solutions. Finally, developing clear theories of change can assist in determining which changes in biodiversity can be attributed to REDD+.

A User-Driven Approach to Determining Critical Earth Observation Priorities for Societal Benefit	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												In order to help data providers make informed decisions regarding the availability and accessibility of Earth observations for societal benefit, a cross-sectoral meta-analysis of observation priorities was conducted from the perspective of users. The analysis was organized around the Group on Earth Observations' (GEOs) societal benefit areas (SBAs): Agriculture, Biodiversity, Climate, Disasters, Ecosystems, Energy, Health, Water, and Weather. Users' needs for Earth observations were prioritized using a two-stage process. In the first stage, critical observations for each individual SBA were determined based on observation needs expressed in publicly available documents, such as scientific journal articles, scientific reports, and workshop summaries. In the second stage, an ensemble of four statistically robust methods was used to prioritize the observations identified in the individual SBA analyses, based on their criticality and commonality to multiple SBAs. The result of the meta-analysis is a ranking of 152 critical Earth observation priorities; the highest priority Earth observations are those that are considered critical for the largest number of SBAs. The 10 highest ranked observations are: (1) Precipitation, (2) Soil Moisture, (3) Surface Air Temperature, (4) Land Cover, (5) Surface Wind Speed (6) Vegetation Cover, (7) Surface Humidity, (8) Urbanization, (9) Vegetation Type, and (10) Surface Wind Direction and Sea Surface Temperature (tie). This study represents one viable method to assess the priority of Earth observations from the perspective of users. The list of critical Earth observation priorities from this study is a foundation for engagement between data providers and users in regard to observation priorities.

Regular monitoring has to be capable of detecting rapid changes in forest extent, i.e. deforestation, and subtle changes to the forest cover caused by logging and/or fire, described as forest degradation. Particularly the early detection of illegal logging activities is important for the conservation of tropical forests. In the present study, a forest disturbance monitoring approach was developed and tested, which makes use of high resolution satellite imagery. A time series consisting of three images, acquired between May 2009 and June 2010, was analyzed covering a remote area of tropical peat swamp forest in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. The forest area was assessed by an object-oriented classification. Logging activities and the impact of fire were detected by a pixel-based spectral mixture analysis. Forest, non-forest and logging trails could be differentiated with an overall classification accuracy of 91.5% (Kappa of 0.87). A high forest disturbance rate of 8.7% was found in the study area. Low impact logging could be detected reliably and the progress was tracked over time. The results show that the timely detection of forest disturbances is necessary because of the fast regrowth of vegetation. The study emphasises the importance of high resolution satellite imagery for tropical forest monitoring and for timely updating forest status assessments, which is important for the implementation of REDD.																	1939-1404					DEC	2012	5	6			SI		1811	1820		10.1109/JSTARS.2012.2202638								WOS:000313009300026

We undertake a geographic information system and remote sensing analysis to identify the rarest and least protected forests in biodiversity hotspots. World Wildlife Fund ecoregions with terrestrial forest were subset from 34 biodiversity hotspots and forest cover calculated from GlobCover data at a 300 m pixel resolution. There were 276 ecoregions in 32 biodiversity hotspots classified as containing terrestrial forests. When the first quartile of forest ecoregions was subset based on smallest extent of forest cover in protected areas, there were 69 rare forests identified within 20 biodiversity hotspots. Most rare forest ecoregions (45) occurred on islands or island archipelagos and 47 rare forest ecoregions contained less than 10 % forest cover in protected areas. San F,lix-San Ambrosio Islands Temperate Forests, Tubuai Tropical Moist Forests, Maldives-Lakshadweep-Chagos Archipelago Tropical Moist Forests, and Yap Tropical Dry Forests were identified as the least protected and possibly most vulnerable forests within biodiversity hotspots. These ecoregions cover less than 500 km(2), forest cover is less than 50 km(2), and there are no protected areas. There is a need to update classifications and boundaries of protected areas, insure that islands are included in global land cover datasets, and identify levels of endemism and endangerment within forest ecoregions. This should improve our ability to compare, prioritize, and monitor forests in biodiversity hotspots.

Regional landscape attributes need to be considered in the integrative research of wetlands to allow habitat-specific management. Here we investigated the distribution and the habitat diversity of the wetlands in the Amazonian Piedmont in the Caqueta Department of Colombia. Based on the landscape approach we combined geomorphic, hydro-chemical and biotic attributes. We used remote sensing based interpretation and ground truth verification. We found 896 wetlands covering up to 11 % of the study area. Our estimate of the wetland area does not reflect the true historic wetland area (occasionally flooded area) because 76.9 % of the flooded active floodplain area has been converted to pastures. Including the pastures the estimated wetland area is 29.3 % of the study region. We identified 7 wetland habitats. The method we applied can be used to map small and middle sized wetlands achieving an acceptable overall accuracy. These wetlands provide important ecosystem services and act as corridors for biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes such as the Caqueta region. Our results provide support for the wise use of tropical wetlands and may help to improve landscape management in the Amazon basin.

Abiotic and biotic controls of cryptobenthic fish assemblages across a Caribbean seascape	CORAL REEFS												The majority of fish studies on coral reefs consider only non-cryptic species and, despite their functional importance, data on cryptic species are scarce. This study investigates inter-habitat variation in Caribbean cryptobenthic fishes by re-analysing a comprehensive data set from 58 rotenone stations around Buck Island, U.S. Virgin Islands. Boosted regression trees were used to associate the density and diversity of non-piscivorous cryptobenthic fishes, both in the entire data set and on reef habitats alone, with 14 abiotic and biotic variables. The study also models the habitat requirements of the three commonest species. Dead coral cover was the first or second most important variable in six of the eight models constructed. For example, within the entire data set, the number of species and total fish density increased approximately linearly with increasing dead coral cover. Dead coral was also important in multivariate analyses that discriminated 10 assemblages within the entire data set. On reef habitats, the number of species and total fish density increased dramatically when dead coral exceeded similar to 55 %. Live coral cover was typically less important for explaining variance in fish assemblages than dead coral, but live corals were important for maintaining high fish diversity. Coral species favoured by cryptobenthic species may be particularly susceptible to mortality, but dead coral may also provide abundant food and shelter for many fishes. Piscivore density was a key variable in the final models, but typically increased with increasing cryptobenthic fish diversity and abundance, suggesting both groups of fishes are responding to the same habitat variables. The density of territorial damselfishes reduced the number of cryptobenthic fish species on reef habitats. Finally, habitats delineated by standard remote sensing techniques supported distinct cryptobenthic fish assemblages, suggesting that such maps can be used as surrogates of general patterns of cryptic fish biodiversity in conservation planning.

The ecosystem functioning dimension in conservation: insights from remote sensing	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												An important goal of conservation biology is the maintenance of ecosystem processes. Incorporating quantitative measurements of ecosystem functions into conservation practice is important given that it provides not only proxies for biodiversity patterns, but also new tools and criteria for management. In the satellite era, the translation of spectral information into ecosystem functional variables expands and complements the more traditional use of satellite imagery in conservation biology. Remote sensing scientists have generated accurate techniques to quantify ecosystem processes and properties of key importance for conservation planning such as primary production, ecosystem carbon gains, surface temperature, albedo, evapotranspiration, and precipitation use efficiency; however, these techniques are still unfamiliar to conservation biologists. In this article, we identify specific fields where a remotely-sensed characterization of ecosystem functioning may aid conservation science and practice. Such fields include the management and monitoring of species and populations of conservation concern; the assessment of ecosystem representativeness and singularity; the use of protected areas as reference sites to assess global change effects; the implementation of monitoring and warning systems to guide adaptive management; the direct evaluation of supporting ecosystem services; and the planning and monitoring of ecological restorations. The approaches presented here illustrate feasible ways to incorporate the ecosystem functioning dimension into conservation through the use of satellite-derived information.

J	Kidane, Y; Stahlmann, R; Beierkuhnlein, C				Kidane, Yohannes; Stahlmann, Reinhold; Beierkuhnlein, Carl			Vegetation dynamics, and land use and land cover change in the Bale Mountains, Ethiopia	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Shifts in biological communities are occurring at rapid rates as human activities induced global climate change increases. Understanding the effects of the change on biodiversity is important to reduce loss of biodiversity and mass extinction, and to insure the long-term persistence of natural resources and natures' services. Especially in remote landscapes of developing countries, precise knowledge about on-going processes is scarce. Here we apply satellite imagery to assess spatio-temporal land use and land cover change (LULCC) in the Bale Mountains for a period of four decades. This study aims to identify the main drivers of change in vegetation patterns and to discuss the implications of LULCC on spatial arrangements and trajectories of floral communities. Remote sensing data acquired from Landsat MSS, Landsat ETM + and SPOT for four time steps (1973, 1987, 2000, and 2008) were analyzed using 11 LULC units defined based on the dominant plant taxa and cover types of the habitat. Change detection matrices revealed that over the last 40 years, the area has changed from a quite natural to a more cultural landscape. Within a representative subset of the study area (7,957.5 km(-2)), agricultural fields have increased from 1.71% to 9.34% of the total study area since 1973. Natural habitats such as upper montane forest, afroalpine grasslands, afromontane dwarf shrubs and herbaceous formations, and water bodies also increased. Conversely, afromontane grasslands have decreased in size by more than half (going from 19.3% to 8.77%). Closed Erica forest also shrank from 15.0% to 12.37%, and isolated Erica shrubs have decreased from 6.86% to 5.55%, and afroalpine dwarf shrubs and herbaceous formations reduced from 5.2% to 1.56%. Despite fluctuations the afromontane rainforest (Harenna forest), located south of the Bale Mountains, has remained relatively stable. In conclusion this study documents a rapid and ecosystem-specific change of this biodiversity hotspot due to intensified human activities (e.g., deforestation, agriculture, infrastructure expansion). Specifically, the ecotone between the afromontane and the afroalpine area represent a "hotspot of biodiversity loss" today. Taking into consideration the projections of regional climate warming and modified precipitation regimes, LULCC can be expected to become even more intensive in the near future. This is likely to impose unprecedented pressures on the largely endemic biota of the area.

J	Pelletier, J; Codjia, C; Potvin, C				Pelletier, Johanne; Codjia, Claude; Potvin, Catherine			Traditional shifting agriculture: tracking forest carbon stock and biodiversity through time in western Panama	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) requires developing countries to quantify greenhouse gas emissions and removals from forests in a manner that is robust, transparent, and as accurate as possible. Although shifting cultivation is a dominant practice in several developing countries, there is still very limited information available on how to monitor this land-use practice for REDD+ as little is known about the areas of shifting cultivation or the net carbon balance. In this study, we propose and test a methodology to monitor the effect of the shifting cultivation on above-ground carbon stocks. We combine multiyear remote sensing information, taken from a 12-year period, with an in-depth community forest carbon stock inventory in Palo Seco Forest Reserve, western Panama. Using remote sensing, we were able to separate four forest classes expressing different forest-use intensity and time-since-intervention, which demonstrate expected trends in above-ground carbon stocks. The addition of different interventions observed over time is shown to be a good predictor, with remote sensing variables explaining 64.2% of the variation in forest carbon stocks in cultivated landscapes. Multitemporal and multispectral medium-resolution satellite imagery is shown to be adequate for tracking land-use dynamics of the agriculture-fallow cycle. The results also indicate that, over time, shifting cultivation has a transitory effect on forest carbon stocks in the study area. This is due to the rapid recovery of forest carbon stocks, which results in limited net emissions. Finally, community participation yielded important additional benefits to measuring carbon stocks, including transparency and the valorization of local knowledge for biodiversity monitoring. Our study provides important inputs regarding shifting cultivation, which should be taken into consideration when national forest monitoring systems are created, given the context of REDD+ safeguards.

Although NEON remote sensing and tower sensor elements are relatively well known, the biological measurements are not. This manuscript describes NEON terrestrial sampling, which targets organisms across a range of generation and turnover times, and a hierarchy of measurable biological states. Measurements encompass species diversity, abundance, phenology, demography, infectious disease, ecohydrology, and biogeochemistry. The continental-scale sampling requires collection of comparable and calibrated data using transparent methods. Data will be publicly available in a variety of formats and suitable for integration with other long-term efforts.

The role of Remote Sensing and GIS for spatial prediction of vector-borne diseases transmission: A systematic review	JOURNAL OF VECTOR BORNE DISEASES												There have been several attemps made to the appreciation of remote sensing and GIS for the study of vectors, biodiversity, vector presence. vector abundance and the vector-borne diseases with respect to space and time. This study was made for reviewing and appraising the potential use of remote sensing and GIS applications for spatial prediction of vector-borne diseases transmission. The nature of the presence and the abundance of vectors and vector-borne diseases, disease infection and the disease transmission are not ubiquitous and are confined with geographical, environmental and climatic factors, and are localized. The presence of vectors and vector-borne diseases is most complex in nature, however, it is confined and fueled by the geographical, climatic and environmental factors including man-made factors. The usefulness of the present day availability of the information derived from the satellite data including vegetation indices of canopy cover and its density, soil types, soil moisture, soil texture, soil depth, etc. is integrating the information in the expert GIS engine for the spatial analysis of other geoclimatic and geoenvironmental variables. The present study gives the detailed information on the classical studies of the past and present. and the future role of remote sensing and GIS for the vector-borne diseases control. The ecological modeling directly gives us the relevant information to understand the spatial variation of the vector biodiversity, vector presence, vector abundance and the vector-borne diseases in association with geoclimatic and the environmental variables. The probability map of the geographical distribution and seasonal variations of horizontal and vertical distribution of vector abundance and its association with vector-borne diseases can be obtained with low cost remote sensing and GIS tool with reliable data and speed.																	0972-9062					DEC	2012	49	4					197	204										WOS:000209023600001	23428518

Mapping Savanna Tree Species at Ecosystem Scales Using Support Vector Machine Classification and BRDF Correction on Airborne Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data	REMOTE SENSING												Mapping the spatial distribution of plant species in savannas provides insight into the roles of competition, fire, herbivory, soils and climate in maintaining the biodiversity of these ecosystems. This study focuses on the challenges facing large-scale species mapping using a fusion of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and hyperspectral imagery. Here we build upon previous work on airborne species detection by using a two-stage support vector machine (SVM) classifier to first predict species from hyperspectral data at the pixel scale. Tree crowns are segmented from the lidar imagery such that crown-level information, such as maximum tree height, can then be combined with the pixel-level species probabilities to predict the species of each tree. An overall prediction accuracy of 76% was achieved for 15 species. We also show that bidirectional reflectance distribution (BRDF) effects caused by anisotropic scattering properties of savanna vegetation can result in flight line artifacts evident in species probability maps, yet these can be largely mitigated by applying a semi-empirical BRDF model to the hyperspectral data. We find that confronting these three challenges-reflectance anisotropy, integration of pixel- and crown-level data, and crown delineation over large areas-enables species mapping at ecosystem scales for monitoring biodiversity and ecosystem function.

EVALUATING HABITAT-ASSOCIATION MODELS FOR THE SALTMARSH SPARROW	CONDOR												Habitat models that associate organisms with features of their environment can help identify areas for planning conservation strategies. These models, however, should be tested with new data before their conclusions are widely accepted. The Saltmarsh Sparrow (Ammodramus caudacutus) is a species of growing conservation concern along the Atlantic coast of North America. In a previous study, we developed models for Saltmarsh Sparrow presence and nesting habitat. Sparrow occupancy was best predicted from raw reflective properties of marshes derived from remote sensing, whereas sparrow nesting was best predicted from a classification of marsh plant communities. To test these models, we surveyed a stratified random sample of sites for which the probability of sparrow presence had been predicted and compared the observations to the predicted probability of presence and nesting generated from the models. The models' performance, assessed by the area under a receiver-operating characteristic curve and the deviance of observations from the models' predictions, was significantly better than expected by chance alone. Because sparrows are predicted to occur in many places where they are unlikely to nest, monitoring sparrow presence alone will not identify areas important for their nesting.																	0010-5422					NOV	2012	114	4					856	864		10.1525/cond.2012.110197								WOS:000311882700020

This information will serve diverse applications, including stimulating new research and providing the basis for assessments.

Predictive models based on optimal scaling of ocean color data and high resolution bathymetry were employed to map the benthic biomass in the vicinity of spill site because no previous sampling had been conducted at that exact location. The predicted biomass declines with water and mixed layer depth and is an increasing function of surface primary production and temporal variation of sea surface temperature. The decline of animal size with depth, however, was a function of a shift of dominant abundance from large to small taxa. At a local scale, high benthic biomass in the N GoM was associated with the enhanced productivity by the nutrient-laden Mississippi River outflows, offshore transport of the river plumes, and upwelling along the northern edge of the Loop Current. The apparent biomass enhancement at the Mississippi and De Soto Canyon and deep sediment fan was presumably related to lateral down-slope advection of organic carbon from the surrounding continental margin. Except for the Campeche Bank, the meager biomass of the Mexican margin may reflect the characteristic low-productivity Caribbean water that enters the GoM through Yucatan Strait. Benthic biomass in the N GoM was not statistically different between comprehensive surveys in the years 1983-1985 and 2000-2002. The stock assessment and biomass predictions from 669 cores at 170 locations throughout the deep GoM provide an important baseline of the sediment-dwelling fauna that may be subjected to immediate or long-term impacts from the oil spill or from climate change.

Using the NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer to characterise temporal and spatial trends in water temperature of large European lakes	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Lakes are major repositories of biodiversity, provide multiple ecosystem services and are widely recognised as key indicators of environmental change. However, studies of lake response to drivers of change at a pan-European scale are exceptionally rare. The need for such studies has been given renewed impetus by concerns over environmental change and because of international policies, such as the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD), which impose legal obligations to monitor the condition of European lakes towards sustainable systems with good ecological status. This has highlighted the need for methods that can be widely applied across large spatial and temporal scales and produce comparable results. Remote sensing promises much in terms of information provision, but the spatial transferability and temporal repeatability of methods and relationships observed at individual or regional case studies remains unproven at the continental scale. This study demonstrates that NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) thermal data are capable of producing highly accurate (R-2>0.9) lake surface temperature (LST) estimates in lakes with variable hydromorphological characteristics and contrasting thermal regimes. Validation of the approach using archived AVHRR thermal data for Lake Geneva produced observations that were consistent with field data for equivalent time periods. This approach provides the basis for generalizing temporal and spatial trends in European lake surface temperature over several decades and confirms the potential of the full 30 year NOAA AVHRR archive to can provide AVHRR-derived LST estimates to help inform European policies on lake water quality.

J	Tattoni, C; Rizzolli, F; Pedrini, P				Tattoni, Clara; Rizzolli, Franco; Pedrini, Paolo			Can LiDAR data improve bird habitat suitability models?	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Habitat suitability models are based on digital maps that very often describe the environment at a human scale and, hence miss ecological structures and features that are important for wildlife. LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) data, laser scanning acquired by remote sensing, can fill this gap by providing useful information not only on the spatial extent of habitat types but also information on the vertical height. The advantage of LiDAR derived variables lays also in the availability at a large scale, instead of just in the survey sites. In this work we evaluated the effect of three LiDAR derived variables (tree height, percentage of trees in open areas and length of ecotone) on the performance of habitat models, developed for four farmland bird species. For each species multiple runs of stepwise Logistic Regression (LR) and Maximum Entropy Models (Maxent) were performed. For each run we included and excluded the LiDAR variables and recorded the improvement in model performance using the AUC, AIC, Sensitivity, Specificity. Model results were applied in a GIS in order to create habitat suitability maps. Results for the RL models showed that for most of the species at least one LiDAR variable was selected and significant (p < 0.05). Additionally the inclusion LIDAR data gave a positive percentage of contribution to the AUC of the Maxent models. The models calculated using LiDAR derived variables identified a smaller area on the map, with a better overlap with open areas, thus showing a more realistic spatial pattern. The interpretation of these variable is also more straightforward, both from the ecological point of view and when defining management guidelines. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Species detection vs. habitat suitability: Are we biasing habitat suitability models with remotely sensed data?	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Remotely sensed datasets are increasingly being used to model habitat suitability for a variety of taxa. We review habitat suitability models (HSMs) developed for both plants and animals that include remote sensing predictor variables to determine how these variables could affect model projections. For models focused on plant species habitat, we find several instances of unintentional bias in HSMs of vegetation due to the inclusion of remote sensing variables. Notably, studies that include continuous remote sensing variables could be inadvertently mapping actual species distribution instead of potential habitat due to unique spectral or temporal characteristics of the target species. Additionally, HSMs including categorical classifications are rarely explicit about assumptions of habitat suitability related to land cover, which could lead to unintended exclusion of potential habitat due to current land use. Although we support the broader application of remote sensing in general, we caution developers of HSMs to be aware of introduced model bias. These biases are more likely to arise when remote sensing variables are added to models simply because they improve accuracy, rather than considering how they affect the model results and interpretation. When including land cover classifications as predictors, we recommend that modellers provide more explicit descriptions of how habitat is defined (e.g., is deforested land considered suitable for trees?). Further, we suggest that continuous remote sensing variables should only be included in habitat models if authors can demonstrate that their inclusion characterizes potential habitat rather than actual species distribution. Use of the term 'habitat suitability model' rather than 'species distribution model' could reduce confusion about modelling goals and improve communication between the remote sensing and ecological modelling communities.

J	Adhikari, S; Southworth, J				Adhikari, Sanchayeeta; Southworth, Jane			Simulating Forest Cover Changes of Bannerghatta National Park Based on a CA-Markov Model: A Remote Sensing Approach	REMOTE SENSING												Establishment of protected areas (PA) has been one of the leading tools in biodiversity conservation. Globally, these kinds of conservation interventions have given rise to an increase in PAs as well as the need to empirically evaluate the impact of these PAs on forest cover. Few of these empirical evaluations have been geared towards comparison of pre and post policy intervention landscapes. This paper provides a method to empirically evaluate such pre and post policy interventions by using a cellular automata-Markov model. This method is tested using remotely sensed data of Bannerghatta National park (BNP) and its surrounding, which have experienced various national level policy interventions (Indian National Forest Policy of 1988) and rapid land cover change between 1973 and 2007. The model constructs a hypothetical land cover scenario of BNP and its surroundings (1999 and 2007) in the absence of any policy intervention, when in reality there has been a significant potential policy intervention effect. The models predicted a decline in native forest cover and an increase in non forest cover post 1992 whereas the actual observed landscape experienced the reverse trend where after an initial decline from 1973 to 1992, the forest cover in BNP is towards recovery post 1992. Furthermore, the models show a higher deforestation and lower reforestation than the observed deforestation and reforestation patterns for BNP post 1992. Our results not only show the implication of national level policy changes on forest cover but also show the usefulness of our method in evaluating such conservation efforts.

This usually results in improved flooding control, but may lead as well to environmental problems, such as river dry up, river morphology change, and reduction in biodiversity. The present study considers water conservancy projects in the Haihe river basin, following the major flood in 1963. It maps the water projects as well as the surface water bodies in 1964, 1980 and 2004, by using an integrated method of remote sensing and field surveys. The impact of the water conservancy projects on the hydro-ecological processes and the ecological environment is analyzed. Construction of the controlled reservoir resulted in a sharp drop of the river discharge and sediment. It also resulted in a reduction of river infiltration, an increase of evaporation and a change in regional water balance characteristics. Furthermore, the projects separated the hydraulic connection between upstream and downstream areas, weakened the river's natural connectivity, and changed the dynamic conditions of the river water. On the basis of the study, we propose changing the operation mode of the existing controllable water conservancy projects and removing the projects with degraded and unreasonable functions as two optional ways to resolve the hydro-ecological problems of the basin.

Comparing the information content of coral reef geomorphological and biological habitat maps, Amirantes Archipelago (Seychelles), Western Indian Ocean	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Increasing the use of geomorphological map products in marine spatial planning has the potential to greatly enhance return on mapping investment as they are commonly two orders of magnitude cheaper to produce than biologically-focussed maps of benthic communities and shallow substrates. The efficacy of geomorphological maps derived from remotely sensed imagery as surrogates for habitat diversity is explored by comparing two map sets of the platform reefs and atolls of the Amirantes Archipelago (Seychelles), Western Indian Ocean. One mapping campaign utilised Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imagery (19 wavebands, 1 m spatial resolution) to classify 11 islands and associated reefs into 25 biological habitat classes while the other campaign used Landsat 7 + ETM imagery (7 bands, 30 m spatial resolution) to generate maps of 14 geomorphic classes. The maps were compared across a range of characteristics, including habitat richness (number of classes mapped), diversity (Shannon-Weiner statistic) and thematic content (Cramer's V statistic). Between maps, a strong relationship was revealed for habitat richness (R-2 = 0.76), a moderate relationship for class diversity and evenness (R-2 = 0.63) and a variable relationship for thematic content, dependent on site complexity (V range 0.43 -0.93). Geomorphic maps emerged as robust predictors of the habitat richness in the Amirantes. Such maps therefore demonstrate high potential value for informing coastal management activities and conservation planning by drawing on information beyond their own thematic content and thus maximizing the return on mapping investment.

Monitoring landscape change in multi-use west-central Alberta, Canada using the disturbance-inventory framework	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Human disturbances are a major driver of biodiversity declines world-wide, and the intensely used Alberta forest landscape is no exception to this trend. Monitoring of such large areas is typically conducted via multi-temporal land-cover maps from remote sensing, but automated and efficient procedures for reliable, operational applications have yet to be fully developed. In an effort to contribute to this need, we developed an innovative approach to landscape monitoring: the disturbance-inventory framework, which is applied for the first time as described here to monitor annual changes in an 8800-km(2) multi-use landscape in west-central Alberta, Canada. Using this framework, we (1) report on the spatio-temporal distribution of industrial disturbances such as harvesting cutblocks, oil and gas wells, coal mines, and road/pipelines; and (2) track the associated annual changes in land-cover composition and configuration between 1998 and 2005. To enable spatially explicit analyses within the study area, we divided it into 178, 49 km(2)-square landscape cells. The overall area-based annual rate of change of 0.62% for this multi-use may be considered moderate compared to other regions, where change was mainly shaped by a single use, i.e., forestry. However, the spatially explicit nature of our analysis revealed that the eastern half of the study area is subject to considerably higher rates of change, mainly due to the concurrent appearance of disturbances from forestry and the oil and gas industry. The western half, by contrast, is more restricted by rugged terrain and fewer roads. The average distance to disturbance features across the entire study area decreased from 1500 m to 1200 m over the seven years. Total forest area, mean and largest patch size, and mean shape index all decreased consistently over the same period. The detected rapid change and associated fragmentation call for ongoing monitoring of this and other multi-use landscapes, which could be undertaken using this framework. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

While flow has frequently been considered as a master variable that controls aquatic biodiversity and species behavior in river floodplains, little is known about thermal heterogeneity and its effect on aquatic biota in complex landscapes. However, quantifying thermal patch dynamics at the river floodplain scale remains a challenging task. In this study, we applied airborne thermal infrared (TIR) imagery to characterize spatial thermal heterogeneity under high (March 2010) and mean (July 2010) flow conditions in a 347.5 ha lowland river floodplain (Oder River, Germany). Concurrently, we electro-fished all major floodplain water bodies (main channel, side channel, and permanently connected ponds) to identify the composition of associated fish assemblages. In addition, we deployed temperature loggers from March to July across the entire range of floodplain water bodies to assess seasonal temperature patterns at 20 min intervals. Under both flow conditions, the TIR imagery revealed a complex mosaic of thermal patches across the floodplain. Cumulative degree-days and average and maximum temperatures were the main variables that thermally differentiated individual water bodies. The water body types delineated based on spatial and seasonal thermal signatures also contained distinct fish assemblages. Distinct temperature gradients at the floodplain scale and both within and across distinct water body types were resolved with airborne thermal data, providing a fully spatial and concurrently available temperature mosaic. A delay in response of fish distribution to a strong thermal gradient recorded in spring, that has never been predicted or observed elsewhere, could be assessed by the use of TIR imagery. This study demonstrates the potential of airborne remotely sensed TIR imagery as a non-invasive method for detecting and quantifying spatial heterogeneity and ecologically relevant temperature gradients in complex landscapes, thereby facilitating the "up-scaling" of ecosystem processes to the landscape scale and expanding current understanding of fish behavior.

Modeling alpha- and beta-diversity in a tropical forest from remotely sensed and spatial data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Comprehensive information on species distribution and species composition patterns of plant communities is required for effective conservation and management of biodiversity. Remote sensing offers an inexpensive means of attaining complete spatial coverage for large areas, at regular time intervals, and can therefore be extremely useful for estimating both species richness and spatial variation of species composition (alpha- and beta-diversity). An essential step to map such attributes is to identify and understand their main drivers. We used remotely sensed data as a surrogate of plant productivity and habitat structure variables for explaining alpha- and beta-diversity, and evaluated the relative roles of productivity-habitat structure and spatial variables in explaining observed patterns of alpha- and beta-diversity by using a Principal Coordinates of Neighbor Matrices analysis. We also examined the relationship between remotely sensed and field data, in order to map alpha- and beta-diversity at the landscape-level in the Yucatan Peninsula, using a regression kriging procedure. These two procedures integrate the relationship of species richness and spatial species turnover both with remotely sensed data and spatial structure. The empirical models so obtained can be used to predict species richness and variation in species composition, and they can be regarded as valuable tools not only for identifying areas with high local species richness (alpha-diversity), but also areas with high species turnover (beta-diversity). Ultimately, information obtained in this way can help maximize the number of species preserved in a landscape. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

Use of an Airborne Lidar System to Model Plant Species Composition and Diversity of Mediterranean Oak Forests	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Airborne lidar is a remote-sensing tool of increasing importance in ecological and conservation research due to its ability to characterize three-dimensional vegetation structure. If different aspects of plant species diversity and composition can be related to vegetation structure, landscape-level assessments of plant communities may be possible. We examined this possibility for Mediterranean oak forests in southern Portugal, which are rich in biological diversity but also threatened. We compared data from a discrete, first-and-last return lidar data set collected for 31 plots of cork oak (Quercus suber) and Algerian oak (Quercus canariensis) forest with field data to test whether lidar can be used to predict the vertical structure of vegetation, diversity of plant species, and community type. Lidar- and field-measured structural data were significantly correlated (up to r= 0.85). Diversity of forest species was significantly associated with lidar-measured vegetation height (R2= 0.50, p < 0.001). Clustering and ordination of the species data pointed to the presence of 2 main forest classes that could be discriminated with an accuracy of 89% on the basis of lidar data. Lidar can be applied widely for mapping of habitat and assessments of habitat condition (e.g., in support of the European Species and Habitats Directive [92/43/EEC]). However, particular attention needs to be paid to issues of survey design: density of lidar points and geospatial accuracy of ground-truthing and its timing relative to acquisition of lidar data.																	0888-8892					OCT	2012	26	5					840	850		10.1111/j.1523-1739.2012.01869.x								WOS:000308484500010	22731687

We investigated whether inter-crown pixel information from VHR imagery could be used for taxonomic identification of trees and characterization of successional stages of tropical Andean mountain forest. Location Santa Lucia cloud forest reserve, NW Ecuadorian Andes. Methods We gathered digital camera imagery (0.05-m spatial resolution), using a remote-controlled helicopter platform, from primary and secondary forest and identified visible crowns to species before extracting digital crown samples (2-m radius). Using an object-based approach, histogram descriptors and diversity metrics of pixel intensity in red, green and blue (RGB) bands were calculated for crowns, and patterns in similarity explored using ordination. Predictive models were developed and validated using four decision tree models (CHIAD, Exhaustive CHIAD, CRT and QUEST). Results Aerial imagery represented 54% of families, 53% of genera and 56% of species sampled from the ground. Ordination (redundancy analysis) confirmed that inherent continuities, based on crown metrics, correlated with traditional species, genus and family groupings (P < 0.05). Data were best described by histogram means in the green band. The best predictive model (CRT) generated a 47% probability of correct species identification for 41 species with similar success at genus and family level. Predictive ability was highly species-specific, ranging from zero for some taxa to 93% for Cecropia gabrielis Cuatrec. Conclusions From the crown metrics tested, we found the mean pixel intensity in the green band was most effective in predicting species and species grouping of tropical mountain trees. This metric integrates species-specific differences in leaf density of crowns and reflectance in the green waveband. High predictive success for indicators of primary (Cornus peruviana J.F. Macbr.) and secondary forest (Cecropia gabrielis Cuatrec.) shows that VHR imagery can be used to identify species from pixel information to provide ecological information on successional status. Further research is needed to develop pattern and textural metrics specifically for hyperspatial digital imagery to identify tree species from crown imagery in diverse tropical forests.

Still, there is a widespread lack of information about the spatial distribution of individual species and biodiversity as a whole. Remote sensing techniques are increasingly used for biodiversity monitoring and especially the combination of LiDAR and hyperspectral data is expected to deliver valuable information. In this study spatial patterns of vascular plant community composition and alpha-diversity of a temperate montane forest in Germany were analysed for different forest strata. The predictive power of LiDAR (LiD) and hyperspectral (MNF) datasets alone and combined (MNF+LiD) was compared using random forest regression in a ten-fold cross-validation scheme that included feature selection and model tuning. The final models were used for spatial predictions. Species richness could be predicted with varying accuracy (R-2 = 0.2 6 to 0.55) depending on the forest layer. In contrast, community composition of the different layers, obtained by multivariate ordination, could in part be modelled with high accuracies for the first ordination axis (R-2 = 0.39 to 0.78), but poor accuracies for the second axis (R-2 <= 0.3). LiDAR variables were the best predictors for total species richness across all forest layers (R-LiD(2) = 0.3, R-MNF(2) = 0.08, R-MNF+LiD(2) = 0.2), while for community composition across all forest layers both hyperspectral and LiDAR predictors achieved similar performances (R-LiD(2) = 0.75, R-MNF(2) = 0.76, R-MNF+LiD(2) = 0.7 8). The improvement in R-2 was small (<= 0.07)-if any-when using both LiDAR and hyperspectral data as compared to using only the best single predictor set. This study shows the high potential of LiDAR and hyperspectral data for plant biodiversity modelling, but also calls for a critical evaluation of the added value of combining both with respect to acquisition costs.

Mapping abandoned agriculture with multi-temporal MODIS satellite data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Agriculture is expanding and intensifying in many areas of the world, but abandoned agriculture is also becoming more widespread. Unfortunately, data and methods to monitor abandoned agriculture accurately over large areas are lacking. Remote sensing methods may be able to fill this gap though, especially with the frequent observations provided by coarser-resolution sensors and new classification techniques. Past efforts to map abandoned agriculture relied mainly on Landsat data, making it hard to map large regions, and precluding the use of phenology information to identify abandoned agriculture. Our objective here was to test methods to map abandoned agriculture at broad scales with coarse-resolution satellite imagery and phenology data. We classified abandoned agriculture for one Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) tile in Eastern Europe (-1,236,000 km(2)) where abandoned agriculture was widespread. Input data included Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and reflectance bands (NASA Global MODIS Terra and Aqua 16-Day Vegetation Indices for the years 2003 through 2008, -250-m resolution), as well as phenology metrics calculated with TIMESAT. The data were classified with Support Vector Machines (SVM). Training data were derived from several Landsat classifications of agricultural abandonment in the study area. A validation was conducted based on independently collected data. Our results showed that it is possible to map abandoned agriculture for large areas from MODIS data with an overall classification accuracy of 65%. Abandoned agriculture was widespread in our study area (15.1% of the total area, compared to 29.6% agriculture). We found strong differences in the MODIS data quality for different years, with data from 2005 resulting in the highest classification accuracy for the abandoned agriculture class (42.8% producer's accuracy). Classifications of MODIS NDVI data were almost as accurate as classifications based on a combination of both red and near-infrared reflectance data. MODIS NDVI data only from the growing-season resulted in similar classification accuracy as data for the full year. Using multiple years of MODIS data did not increase classification accuracy. Six phenology metrics derived with TIMESAT from the NDVI time series (2003-2008) alone were insufficient to detect abandoned agriculture, but phenology metrics improved classification accuracies when used in conjunction with NDVI time series by more than 8% over the use of NDVI data alone. The approach that we identified here is promising and suggests that it is possible to map abandoned agriculture at broad scales, which is relevant to gain a better understanding of this important land use change process.

Modeling spatio-temporal change patterns of forest cover: a case study from the Himalayan foothills (India)	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												The present study used temporal remote sensing data for 1990, 2001 and 2006 to assess spatio-temporal patterns of forest cover changes in Shiwalik range of the Himalaya, Dehradun forest division. Forests are innately associated to human well-being. However, with the increasing anthropogenic activities, deforestation has increased. Quantitative change analysis of the forest cover for the past two decades provides valuable insight into the forest conservation vis-A -vis anthropogenic activities in the region. Spatio-temporal datasets along with biotic and abiotic variables provide opportunities to model the forest cover change further. The present study investigates forest cover change and predicts status of forest cover in the Dehradun forest division. Land Change Modeller (LCM) was used to predict status of forest cover for 2010 and 2015 using current disturbance scenarios. Comparing actual LULC of 2006 with the predicted LULC of 2006 validated change prediction model and agreement was 61.03%. The forested areas are getting degraded due to anthropogenic activities, but deforestation/degradation does not contribute much in expanding urban area. Agricultural areas and fallow lands are the main contributors to increased urban area. The study demonstrates the potential of geospatial tools to understand spatio-temporal forest cover change and generate the future scenarios.																	1436-3798	1436-378X				SEP	2012	12	3					619	632		10.1007/s10113-011-0272-3								WOS:000307534400016

S.; Roy, Arijit; Karnataka, Harish			Contemporary tools for identification, assessment and monitoring biodiversity	TROPICAL ECOLOGY												Biodiversity identification and monitoring have undergone a sea change over the past two hundred years. What started as documentation of natural diversity by naturalists such as Barton and Darwin has evolved into a highly sophisticated and organized exercise with potential uses in studies of global importance like climate change and ecosystem sustainability. Due to the localized and transect based studies, largely dependent on the accessibility of the area, there are gaps in biodiversity explorations. Absence of uniformity in documentation of biodiversity and insufficient tools to disseminate the observations have resulted in the exercise being frequently relegated to the compilation of project reports only. The recent advancement in the fields of Remote Sensing & Geographic Information System, mobile computing, GPS technology, wireless connectivity, and internet has enabled accurate and uniform documentation of biological diversity with revisit capability helping in identification of the hotspots of biodiversity and the gaps in biodiversity exploration. The unlimited connectivity through the World Wide Web has also ensured proper dissemination of biodiversity data and reduced the redundancy in data generation.																	0564-3295					SEP	2012	53	3			SI		261	272										WOS:000306876900003

Natural resource degradation in three sub-watersheds of river Tons, Uttarakhand, India	TROPICAL ECOLOGY												The study was conducted in three sub-watersheds (Har-ki-Dun, Tons and Obra Gad) falling in the headwater region of Tons river and located in Govind Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park (Uttarakhand, India) at an altitude ranging from 2000 to 3600 m asl. The paper analyses linkages between natural resource degradation, biodiversity and loss in ecosystem services using Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System. The analysis on forest fragmentation, biodiversity inventories and socio-economic data revealed that biodiversity decreased across disturbance gradient among all the three sub-watersheds and about 12.11 km(2) area was found to be highly fragmented in the study sites. The ecosystem services have been adversely affected in almost all the degraded sites, however, severe effect was observed in naturally degraded site. It is suggested that the development planning of the area should focus on the issue of local people's dependence, and the resultant biotic pressure on the forests.																	0564-3295					SEP	2012	53	3			SI		333	343										WOS:000306876900009

How can managers map tropical forest tree communities with satellite imagery given these challenges? Here we describe a case study of mapping tropical forests to floristic classes with gap-filled Landsat imagery by judicious combination of field and remote sensing work. For managers, we include background on current and forthcoming solutions to the problems of mapping detailed tropical forest types with Landsat imagery. In the study area, Trinidad and Tobago, class characteristics like deciduousness allowed discrimination of floristic classes. We also discovered that we could identify most of the tree communities in (1) imagery with fine spatial resolution of <= 1 m; (2) multiseason fine resolution imagery (viewable with Google Earth); or (3) Landsat imagery from different dates, particularly imagery from drought years, even if decades old, allowing us to collect the extensive training data needed for mapping tropical forest types with "noisy" gap-filled imagery. Further, we show that gap-filled, synthetic multiseason Landsat imagery significantly improves class-specific accuracy for several seasonal forest associations. The class-specific improvements were better for comparing classification results; for in some cases increases in overall accuracy were small. These detailed mapping efforts can lead to new views of tropical forest landscapes. Here we learned that the xerophytic rain forest of Tobago is closely associated with ultramafic geology, helping to explain its unique physiognomy.

Nichar, Kalpa and Pooh. These landscapes representing different eco-climatic zones were subjected to landscape ecological analysis and various landscape composition, patch and edge characteristic metrics were computed to find the extent of fragmentation in the natural vegetation. The natural vegetation comprised of forests (10.24%), grasslands (31.04%) and scrublands (2.95%) as the landscape elements (LSE). These LSEs were further segregated into different LSE types based on the dominant species of plant communities in the landscapes. These LSE types were surveyed for species diversity in the three landscapes. The total landscape area (TLA) covered by natural vegetation in Nichar, Kalpa and Pooh landscapes was calculated to be 651.42, 529.02 and 1,673.72 km(2) making the total area covered with natural vegetation in the district as 2,854.16 km(2). The Pooh block, lying in the east of the district, though covered the largest area of the landscape, was poor in terms of landscape composition as compared to the Nichar block which was rich in landscape elements as suggested by the diversity measures. The extent of fragmentation was found to be highest in Nichar. The Nichar landscape was observed to be having higher mean values of species diversity than other blocks which is consistent with the trends observed with patches diversity. This was in contrast to the Pooh landscape where the patch diversity as well as the species diversity was the lowest. Thus, an ecological analysis utilizing landscape metrics and biodiversity field sampling of vegetation, was attempted for such heterogenous landscapes in high altitudes of Himalaya, which provided a baseline data for the management and conservation of these virgin mountainous areas.

Tracking the effect of climate change on ecosystem functioning using protected areas: Africa as a case study	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Protected areas represent important core 'units' for in situ conservation. However, the current static system is at risk from the effects of global environmental change. This is especially true in Africa. a biodiversity-rich continent expected to be hit hard by climate change. Focusing on African protected areas that experience limited human impact (International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) categories I and II), we tested three hypotheses regarding the impact of climate change on the dynamics of net primary productivity (NPP). We expected a lower annual NPP and higher seasonality in NPP in Eastern and Southern Africa; changes in NPP dynamics to coincide with changes in precipitation; no correlation between changes in NPP dynamics and human development. To test these expectations, we used the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as an index of NPP. Results show that, between 1982 and 2008, an increased vegetation greenness was observed in 27% of the protected areas monitored (mostly in Western Africa), and an increased seasonality in 9% of them (mostly in Eastern and Southern Africa). Our results lend support to current expectations regarding the impacts of climate change, and demonstrate how protected areas of IUCN categories I and II could be used to track the effect of climate change on ecosystem functioning in Africa, and possibly elsewhere. The study highlights the need for a dynamic approach to conservation, where the relevance and efficiency of management actions need to be regularly evaluated. It also demonstrates that satellite-based approaches offer a cheap, verifiable way to quickly identify protected areas of concern at a global scale, supporting managers in their effort to design and apply adaptive management strategies.

Disentangling how past anthropogenic and natural factors contributed to current biome distribution is thus a crucial issue to understand their complex interactions on wider time scales and to improve predictions and conservation strategies. This is particularly important in biodiversity hotspots, such as Madagascar, dominated by large open habitats whose origins are increasingly debated. Although a dominant narrative argues that Madagascar was originally entirely covered by woodlands, which were destroyed by humans, a number of recent studies have suggested that past climatic fluctuations played a major role in shaping current biome distributions well before humans arrived. Here, we address the question of the origin of open habitats in the Daraina region in northern Madagascar, using a multiproxy approach combining population genetics modeling and remote-sensing analyses. We show that (i) contrary to most regions of Madagascar, the forest cover in Daraina remained remarkably stable over the past 60 y, and (ii) the golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli), a forest-dwelling lemur, underwent a strong population contraction before the arrival of the first humans, hence excluding an anthropogenic cause. Prehuman Holocene droughts may have led to a significant increase of grasslands and a reduction in the species' habitat. This contradicts the prevailing narrative that land cover changes are necessarily anthropogenic in Madagascar but does not preclude the later role played by humans in other regions in which recent lemur bottlenecks have been observed.

J	Verbesselt, J; Zeileis, A; Herold, M				Verbesselt, Jan; Zeileis, Achim; Herold, Martin			Near real-time disturbance detection using satellite image time series	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Near real-time monitoring of ecosystem disturbances is critical for rapidly assessing and addressing impacts on carbon dynamics, biodiversity, and socio-ecological processes. Satellite remote sensing enables cost-effective and accurate monitoring at frequent time steps over large areas. Yet, generic methods to detect disturbances within newly captured satellite images are lacking. We propose a multi-purpose time-series-based disturbance detection approach that identifies and models stable historical variation to enable change detection within newly acquired data. Satellite image time series of vegetation greenness provide a global record of terrestrial vegetation productivity over the past decades. Here, we assess and demonstrate the method by applying it to (1) simulated time series of vegetation greenness data from satellite data, (2) real-world satellite greenness image time series between February 2000 and July 2011 covering Somalia to detect drought-related vegetation disturbances. First, simulation results illustrate that disturbances are successfully detected in near real-time while being robust to seasonality and noise. Second, major drought-related disturbance corresponding with most drought-stressed regions in Somalia are detected from mid-2010 onwards. The method can analyse in-situ or satellite data time series of biophysical indicators from local to global scale since it is fast, does not depend on thresholds and does not require time series gap filling. While the data and methods used are appropriate for proof-of-concept development of global scale disturbance monitoring, specific applications (e.g., drought or deforestation monitoring) mandate integration within an operational monitoring framework (e.g., http://www.fews.net/).

Use of remote sensing to identify areas of groundwater upwelling on active glacial floodplains: Their frequency, extent and significance on a landscape scale	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												On active glacial floodplains, streams sourced from upwelling groundwater are characterised by significantly higher biodiversity than surface-fed streams. However the ecological significance of these habitats at a landscape scale has not yet been determined. A remote-sensing model was developed to identify the frequency and distribution of groundwater upwellings in remote Arctic and alpine areas, using freely available satellite imagery. Field research has established that groundwater upwellings provide stable environments (reduced variability in flow and temperature regimes, and reduced channel slope and bed movement), with high water tables, supporting vegetation growth on otherwise barren glacial floodplains. Upwellings are therefore associated with characteristic isolated patches of dense vegetation. The model uses this characteristic profiling of groundwater upwellings in a four-step process; 1) removing temporal variance from the images; 2) identifying and isolating glacial floodplains from the satellite data, 3) removing snow and ice 4) identifying vegetation density (associated with sites of groundwater upwelling) within the floodplains. The model was calibrated in Denali National Park, and validated in Wrangell St. Elias National Park; the extent of groundwater-fed areas was calculated and compared between sites for the first time. Model accuracy during calibration was 94%, and was marginally lower during validation (88%). The high accuracy of the model supports the wider applicability of site-specific relationships determined thus far. In each region, groundwater upwellings contributed to similar to 40% of the total riverine habitat within glacial floodplains; in combination with their high biodiversity this suggests they are ecologically significant. This model facilitates study site location, and represents a significant development in macroscale studies of groundwater upwellings in glacierised catchments. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Modelling the impact of a La Nina event on a South West Pacific Lagoon	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												In view of increasing environmental awareness and biodiversity conservation, understanding the main forcing mechanism driving biogeochemical cycles in coral reefs and lagoon coastal areas is a priority. La Nina events cause unbalanced situations in the Equatorial Pacific and result in enhanced precipitation in South West Pacific coastal areas. We investigated the impact of heavy rainfalls during the 2008 La Nina event on the New Caledonia lagoon using a 3D coupled on-line hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model. Simulations and data showed that the whole lagoon was impacted by river inputs and stronger hydrodynamics, enhancing chlorophyll-a concentration by a factor between 1.7 and 1.9. The coupled model provided new insights into plume transport, highlighting that eastern plumes can be advected northwards or can reach the South West Lagoon, depending on the balance between regional, tide-induced, and wind-induced surface currents. It also provided a synoptic view of lagoon biogeochemical-hydrodynamic response, when remote sensing data are not available due to cloud coverage. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, multi-source fusion can also deteriorate accuracy when some classes do not benefit from all sources. On the basis of this premise, we introduce a Selective Fusion (SELF) scheme based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) which use a single source for source-specific classes and fuse all sources for classes considered as "in difficulty". Our method yields better overall accuracy and Kappa than the classical systematic approach since it takes advantage of the accuracy achieved by SVM and its ability to weight numerous and heterogeneous sources without the drawback of being sensible to irrelevant data for source-specific classes. This operational method can be used efficiently to enhance accuracy when analyzing the wealth of information available from remote sensing products.				chen, zhu/K-5923-2013													1939-1404					AUG	2012	5	4			SI		1203	1212		10.1109/JSTARS.2012.2183857								WOS:000306922100013

In Borneo most of the forests are classified as permanent forest estates and are selectively logged using conventional logging techniques causing high damage to the forest ecosystems. Incorporation of sustainable forest management into climate change mitigation measures such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) can help to avert further forest degradation by synergizing sustainable timber production with the conservation of biodiversity. In order to evaluate the efficiency of such initiatives, monitoring methods for forest degradation and above-ground biomass in tropical forests are urgently needed. In this study we developed an index using Landsat satellite data to describe the crown cover condition of lowland mixed dipterocarp forests. We showed that this index combined with field data can be used to estimate above-ground biomass using a regression model in two permanent forest estates in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Tangkulap represented a conventionally logged forest estate while Deramakot has been managed in accordance with sustainable forestry principles. The results revealed that conventional logging techniques used in Tangkulap during 1991 and 2000 decreased the above-ground biomass by an annual amount of average -6.0 tC/ha (-5.2 to -7.0 tC/ha, 95% confidential interval) whereas the biomass in Deramakot increased by 6.1 t C/ha per year (5.3-7.2 t C/ha, 95% confidential interval) between 2000 and 2007 while under sustainable forest management. This indicates that sustainable forest management with reduced-impact logging helps to protect above-ground biomass. In absolute terms, a conservative amount of 10.5 t C/ha per year, as documented using the methodology developed in this study, can be attributed to the different management systems, which will be of interest when implementing REDD+ that rewards the enhancement of carbon stocks.

Influence of permafrost distribution on groundwater flow in the context of climate-driven permafrost thaw: Example from Yukon Flats Basin, Alaska, United States	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Understanding the role of permafrost in controlling groundwater flow paths and fluxes is central in studies aimed at assessing potential climate change impacts on vegetation, species habitat, biogeochemical cycling, and biodiversity. Recent field studies in interior Alaska show evidence of hydrologic changes hypothesized to result from permafrost degradation. This study assesses the hydrologic control exerted by permafrost, elucidates modes of regional groundwater flow for various spatial permafrost patterns, and evaluates potential hydrologic consequences of permafrost degradation. The Yukon Flats Basin (YFB), a large (118,340 km(2)) subbasin within the Yukon River Basin, provides the basis for this investigation. Model simulations that represent an assumed permafrost thaw sequence reveal the following trends with decreasing permafrost coverage: (1) increased groundwater discharge to rivers, consistent with historical trends in base flow observations in the Yukon River Basin, (2) potential for increased overall groundwater flux, (3) increased spatial extent of groundwater discharge in lowlands, and (4) decreased proportion of suprapermafrost (shallow) groundwater contribution to total base flow. These trends directly affect the chemical composition and residence time of riverine exports, the state of groundwater-influenced lakes and wetlands, seasonal river-ice thickness, and stream temperatures. Presently, the YFB is coarsely mapped as spanning the continuous-discontinuous permafrost transition that model analysis shows to be a critical threshold; thus, the YFB may be on the verge of major hydrologic change should the current permafrost extent decrease. This possibility underscores the need for improved characterization of permafrost and other hydrogeologic information in the region via geophysical techniques, remote sensing, and ground-based observations.																	0043-1397					JUL 27	2012	48								W07524	10.1029/2011WR011595								WOS:000306905900001

SCA for the years 2000, 2004, 2006 and 2009 was derived from Landsat images using a normalized difference snow index (NDSI). Late summer SCA varied notably between the years (1.5-23.0 km(2)). A major part of the late summer snow was located above 900-1000 m and on northern and eastern slopes. A generalized additive model (GAM) showed that the number of years with snow present in 1 km grid squares was strongly positively related to altitude and terrain ruggedness. Parallel examination of interannual variation of SCA and climatic conditions showed that snow cover declines were linked to relatively low snowfall-to-rainfall ratios. Annual mean air temperatures, particularly spring and early winter temperatures, showed increasing trends during the study period. Projected increases in air temperatures and rainfall suggest earlier and more efficient snow melt in the future. This may threaten the occurrence of species and communities related to snowbeds and decrease the beta-diversity of the landscape, and could also affect ecosystem services of the region.

Mapping and monitoring deforestation and forest degradation in Sumatra (Indonesia) using Landsat time series data sets from 1990 to 2010	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												As reported by FAO (2005 State of the World's Forests (Rome: UNFAO), 2010 Forest Resource Assessment (FRA) 2010/095 (Rome: UNFAO)), Indonesia experiences the second highest rate of deforestation among tropical countries. Hence, timely and accurate forest data are required to combat deforestation and forest degradation in support of climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation policy initiatives. Within Indonesia, Sumatra Island stands out due to the intensive forest clearing that has resulted in the conversion of 70% of the island's forested area through 2010. We present here a hybrid approach for quantifying the extent and change of primary forest in Sumatra in terms of primary intact and primary degraded classes using a per-pixel supervised classification mapping followed by a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based fragmentation analysis. Loss of Sumatra's primary intact and primary degraded forests was estimated to provide suitable information for the objectives of the United Nations Framework on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Reducing Emission from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD and REDD+) program. Results quantified 7.54 Mha of primary forest loss in Sumatra during the last two decades (1990-2010). An additional 2.31 Mha of primary forest was degraded. Of the 7.54 Mha cleared, 7.25 Mha was in a degraded state when cleared, and 0.28 Mha was in a primary state. The rate of primary forest cover change for both forest cover loss and forest degradation slowed over the study period, from 7.34 Mha from 1990 to 2000, to 2.51 Mha from 2000 to 2010. The Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) data set was employed to evaluate results. GLAS-derived tree canopy height indicated a significant structural difference between primary intact and primary degraded forests (mean height 28 m +/- 8.7 m and 19 m +/- 8.2 m, respectively). The results demonstrate a method for quantifying primary forest cover stand-replacement disturbance and degradation that can be replicated across the tropics in support of REDD+ initiatives.

We used the remote-sensing products of Enhanced Vegetation Indexes (EVI) corroborated with information gathered from ground visits to examine the spatial patterns and temporal trajectories of greenness of these nearly 20 million hectares of forests. We found (1) the EVI of about 50% of the impacted forests returned to normal status (i. e., within the 95% confidence interval of the long-term mean) within five months, and about 80% within one year after the storm, (2) the higher the pre-storm EVI (relative to the long-term mean), the slower the rebound of post-storm EVI, and (3) the rebound of greenness was slowest in forests that were moderately impacted by the ice storm only (i. e. before the occurrences of logging), resulting in a nonlinear relationship between greenness rebound time (GRT) and ice storm impact severity (IS). Ground visits suggested a hypothesis that the region-wide rebound in greenness was a consequence of resprouting of physically damaged trees and growth of understory plants including shrub, herbaceous and epiphytic species. These processes were facilitated by the rapid increase in temperature and ample moisture after the ice storm. Gap-phase dynamics could be responsible for the counterintuitive relationship between IS and GRT that was obtained. However, a more parsimonious explanation appears to be biased salvage logging, which may have selectively targeted lightly to moderately impacted forests for economic and accessibility reasons and thus adversely affected the GRT of these forests. Although a purely natural disturbance may result in forest greenness patterns different than those reported here, we suggest that remote-sensing-based dynamic analyses of greenness can play a major role in evaluating disturbance theories and in developing testable hypotheses to guide ground-based studies of the integrated effects of large extreme events and human intervention on forest ecosystems.

THE CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES IN GEDAREF, SUDAN	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Studies in several countries in Africa using remote sensing and conventional aerial photography indicate acute land degradation, which is an issue of global concern as it poses a great threat to stability of world climate, biodiversity and geodiversity. Mechanized scheme farms schemes in Sudan are perceived as a major cause of environmental degradation and land losses. Investigations were thus conducted within forests reserves and natural forests sites in the Gedaref area in eastern Sudan where mechanized farmers and traditional land users inside and outside forests reserves represented the target categories for the study. The target groups were interviewed to evaluate their knowledge, attitudes and perceptions with respect to the causes of environmental degradation of soil, forests, agricultural productivity and animal resources. Interviews were conducted among 162 farmers in addition to group discussion among key informants. The results are presented as descriptive statistics, which indicate that forest conversion to agriculture associated with over-cutting has been the main factor contributing to land degradation in Gedaref State. The results also indicate that there are other causes that include sectoral policies that contradict each other, affecting land ownership. The present study demonstrates the need for integrated policies to facilitate sustainable use and management based on local community's partnership and to encourage communal property rights and local-level institutional regimes that ensure sustainable resource management and protection of biodiversity and geodiversity across Sudan.

Forest changes over a century in Sardinia: implications for conservation in a Mediterranean hotspot	AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS												The Mediterranean basin is one of the most important biodiversity hotspots. However, only 5% of its original vegetation is still in place, and the landscape has been managed and transformed by humans for at least the last two millennia. In the last century the mechanization of agriculture and the over-use of semi-natural habitats have influenced the region even more than before, with huge consequences, especially on islands. Sardinia is the second largest island in the Mediterranean basin, and it has been considered for long as a semi-natural area with an economy based on traditional agroforestry and pastoral practices. Considering four maps covering Sardinia and ranging from 1935 to 2007, we measured the rate of forest changes demonstrating a constant trend towards forest increase, and with a complete recovery of the total forest surface compared to the late 1800s. The traditional agroforestry practices decrease in time due to socio-economic reasons, with deeper consequences for the mosaic of traditional agricultural areas and semi-natural habitats, as well as for the conservation of the unique biodiversity of Sardinia. Species typically linked to Mediterranean forests recovered and are recovering, while species linked to traditional semi-natural landscapes decreased, facing conservation problems. We suggest that the current challenges for biodiversity conservation in the island should be focused together with the agricultural policies towards the preservation and improvement of traditional open areas, even important in the history of the entire Mediterranean hotspot.

Species distribution models that relate occurrence or abundance of a species to environmental predictors can be applied for both purposes. We build a generalized linear model relating the distribution of breeding Tawny Owls (Strix aluco) to remotely sensed environmental data to estimate the current distribution of breeding territories throughout Denmark. Additionally, we apply three different methods to calculate population estimates from the model predictions. The most parsimonious model includes only coverage of deciduous forest and its squared effect as significant predictors. Correspondence between predictions of breeding territories and atlas data on breeding Tawny Owls is high (73%), indicating that our model captures an essential part of this species' habitat requirements. The three population estimates suggests the number of breeding pairs in Denmark to be similar to 4,800, similar to 7,200, or similar to 20,500, respectively. This case adds to the existing body of literature that illustrates that species distribution models can be useful to predict the distribution of species and for estimating population size.

Floodplain ecosystem response to climate variability and land-cover and land-use change in Lower Missouri River basin	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												This contribution aims at characterizing the extreme responses of Lower Missouri River basin ecosystems to land use modification and climate change over a 30-year temporal extent, using long term Landsat data archives spanning from 1975 to 2010. The inter-annual coefficient of variation (CoV) of normalized difference vegetation index was used as a measure of vegetation dynamics to address ecological consequences associated with climate change and the impact of land-cover/land-use change. The slope of a linear regression of inter-annual CoV over the entire time span was used as a sustainability indicator to assess the trend of vegetation dynamics from 1975 to 2010. Deduced vegetation dynamics were then associated with precipitation patterns, land surface temperature, and the impact of levees on alluvial hydrologic partitioning and river channelization reflecting the links between society and natural systems. The results show, a higher inter-annual accumulated vegetation index, and lower inter-annual CoV distributed over the uplands remaining virtually stable over the time frame investigated; relatively low vegetation index with larger CoV was observed over lowlands, indicating that climate change was not the only factor affecting ecosystem alterations in the Missouri River floodplain. We cautiously conclude that river channelization, suburbanization and agricultural activities were the possible potential driving forces behind vegetation cover alteration and habitat fragmentation on the Lower Missouri River floodplain.																	0921-2973	1572-9761				JUL	2012	27	6					843	857		10.1007/s10980-012-9748-x								WOS:000305218000005

Ecosystem functional changes associated with land clearing in NW Argentina	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												We assessed the extension of natural habitat conversion into croplands and grazing lands in subtropical NW Argentina and its impact on two key ecosystem functional attributes. We quantified changes in remotely sensed surrogates of aboveground net primary production (ANPP) and seasonality of carbon gains. Both functional attributes are associated with intermediate ecosystem services sensu Fisher et al. (2009). Deforestation was estimated based on photointerpretation of Landsat imagery. The seasonal dynamics of the MODIS satellite Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) was used to calculate the EVI annual mean as a surrogate of ANPP, and the EVI seasonal coefficient of variation as an indicator of seasonal variability of carbon gains. The 2000-2007 period showed a high rate of land clearing: 5.9% of NW Argentina (1,757,600 ha) was cleared for agriculture and ranching, corresponding to an annual rate of 1.15%. Dry forests experienced the highest rate and humid forests the lowest. Though land clearing for agriculture and ranching had relatively small impacts on total annual ANPP, once deforested, parcels significantly became more seasonal than the natural vegetation replaced. Such increase in seasonality is associated with a reduction of photosynthetic activity during a portion of the year (fallow). Direct consequences of this reduction can be expected on several ecosystem services such as erosion control and water regulation, due to greater exposure of bare soil, and biodiversity, due to the loss or decline in habitat quality and the decrease of green biomass availability for primary consumers during fallow. Land clearing also increased the magnitude of inter-annual differences in C gains, suggesting a greater buffer capacity against climate fluctuations of natural vegetation compared to croplands.

Characterising spatiotemporal environmental and natural variation using a dynamic habitat index throughout the province of Ontario	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Understanding changes in landscape productivity patterns is critical for management of ecosystems, characterising biodiversity, and monitoring climate change. Vegetation productivity, a key functional component of terrestrial ecosystems, can be readily monitored using remote sensing and can also be combined with other spatial information, such as land cover and topography, to provide a more comprehensive understanding, at the landscape scale, of ecosystem dynamics. Ontario is the second largest and most populated province in Canada covering approximately 1 million km(2) with a population of 13 million. Befitting such a large and complex area, Ontario is characterised by high environmental and land cover diversity. In order to assess temporal trends in vegetation productivity across the province we utilised a series of 10-day composites of Medium Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MERIS) fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fPAR) over a 6-year period (2003-2008). Indicators of annual productivity, seasonality and the minimum amount of vegetated cover were all calculated from the WAR time-series to evaluate vegetation condition. To define the level of observed natural variability and areas which fall within, and beyond, the variability thresholds, we utilised the Theil-Sen's non-parametric statistical trend test. Results indicate that over the 6-year period decreasing trends in productivity dominated the Ontario landscape. Using spatial data layers of potential drivers of vegetation variability, we found that different land cover types exhibited significantly different trend amplitudes and proportions with elevation a significant correlate for most of the observed trends. Distance from nearest road or human settlement, indicative of anthropogenic drivers, was not significantly related to the observed trends. Recent and older burn areas were linked to decreasing and increasing trends in satellite derived productivity respectively. Our findings suggest that characterising trends in landscape productivity patterns over large areas is possible using remote sensing technology and the integration of productivity trends with explanatory spatial data sets can provide insights into drivers of productivity dynamics. These insights can aid in provincial and national monitoring activities as well as be used to focus more detailed analysis to regions of specific interest. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Integrating Museum and GIS Data to Identify Changes in Species Distributions Driven by a Disturbance-Induced Invasion	COPEIA												Two topics of great importance to conservation biologists and managers are the impact of habitat degradation on species' distributions and the effects of invasive species on the decline of other species. I evaluate the interaction of these threats by comparing the impact of a native invasive amphibian species on a formerly allotopic amphibian species in disturbed versus undisturbed habitat. Fowler's Toad (Anaxyrus fowleri) historically thrived in a range of habitats Including urban and suburban areas in the mid-twentieth century, but has recently undergone a range contraction concurrent with the spread of the Coastal Plain Toad (Incilius nebulifer) into recently disturbed habitat. Contemporary surveys of historical collection sites obtained from museum records of vouchered specimens were used to document changes in the distribution of both species over the past half-century. Temporal changes in habitat disturbance at collection sites were detected by comparing historical aerial photographs with current remote sensing data. Analysis of species' distribution in different disturbance levels showed that A. fowleri is unaffected by disturbance in areas where I. nebulifer is absent, but at sites where the species are sympatric the distribution of A. fowleri in degraded habitat contracted while the expansion of I. nebulifer increased substantially. This study demonstrates that anthropogenic habitat alteration can facilitate dispersal and colonization by an invasive species, resulting in the significant decline of a native species that is otherwise tolerant of disturbance.																	0045-8511	1938-5110				JUN 27	2012		2					307	320		10.1643/CE-10-159								WOS:000305928700017

SUITABLE BREEDING HABITAT FOR GOLDEN EAGLE (AQUILA CHRYSAETOS) IN A BORDER OF DISTRIBUTION AREA IN NORTHWESTERN SPAIN: ADVANTAGES OF USING REMOTE SENSING INFORMATION VS. LAND USE MAPS	VIE ET MILIEU-LIFE AND ENVIRONMENT												We developed predictive models of suitable breeding habitat potential for Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), in an area of 13500 km(2) in Northwestern Spain. We used 48 locations of well-known nesting territories as response variable and 27 environmental parameters, in the form of raster maps, as predictors. These parameters are mainly related to land use, degree of anthropic disturbance, terrain irregularity and habitat heterogeneity. Automated techniques were developed to estimate the potential distribution of locations suitable for nesting within the study area, using the DOMAIN algorithm and implemented in the statistical environment R. The raster maps, at 250 meter resolution, included topographic variables (i.e. altitude, slope, insolation, etc), remote sensing information (MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index), land use maps, temperature, biodiversity indexes, habitat fragmentation estimates and human influence. The study revealed that suitable areas for nesting are characterized by altitude ranges between 255-1443 m.a.s.I., steep slopes, Mediterranean climatic influence and low human pressure. This study also shows the advantages of using remote sensing information instead of traditional land use maps in this kind of studies. The results are consistent with the ecological requirements of the species and reveal that the locations with highest habitat suitability for nesting in the study area. This analysis constitutes a useful conservation tool for the implementation of management actions for this endangered species in this transitional ecological area in the Northwest of the Iberian Peninsula.																	0240-8759					JUN	2012	62	2					77	85										WOS:000309849100005

Larval habitats and biodiversity of anopheline mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) in a malarious area of southern Iran	JOURNAL OF VECTOR BORNE DISEASES												Background & objectives: Malaria is the most important mosquito-borne disease in Iran. It is endemic in south to southeastern part of the country. Knowledge about bio-ecology of vectors will support authorities for appropriate management of the disease. Bashagard district is one of the main endemic areas for malaria in south of Iran. This study was conducted to determine anopheline fauna, diversity and affinity in the area, characterization of larval habitats, and mapping their potential distribution across the district. Methods.. The potential aquatic habitats for Anopheles larvae were extracted from Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) image and digital elevation model of the area using GIS. Surface water bodies were sampled monthly during 2009-10 for anopheline larvae, while characteristics of their physical environment were recorded and water samples were analyzed. Results: A total of 4511 Anopheles larvae were found during the year with the lowest and highest frequencies in February and April, respectively. Dominant species was Anopheles culicifacies. The Shanon diversity index ranged from 0.570-0.829 at fixed collection sites, while the affinity index was significant among some vector species. Conclusion: Riversides and riverbeds were the main breeding places which provided sandy, rocky, and clay beds for different species. The potential breeding places as well as distribution of collected species were mapped. Knowledge about ecology of malaria vectors provides information to health sector for effective control programs.				ad, m/K-3654-2012	ad, m/0000-0001-5932-9917; Raesei, Ahmad Reza/0000-0003-3690-096X; Haghdoost, AliAkbar/0000-0003-4628-4849												0972-9062					JUN	2012	49	2					91	100										WOS:000308519200007	22898481

Innovative technologies for the sustainable management of water resources: the WARBO (WAter Re-BOrn) project	BOLLETTINO DI GEOFISICA TEORICA ED APPLICATA												The WARBO project will facilitate the regulation of water artificial recharge (AR) and determine how to respond to the need to safeguard, protect and enhance water and land ecosystems. The project will focus on sites with AR problems hosting ecosystems of community interest where urgent measures are needed to fight against water scarcity and to develop protocols able to specify how to manage recharge activities. The protocols concerning direct (hydrogeological, geochemical and isotopic) and indirect (geophysical and remote sensing) surveys will be finalized and applied to two main macro-areas. The first is the Friuli plain (NE Italy), with the aim of identifying the short-and long-term effects of the recharge of highly permeable aquifers in order to mitigate the lowering of piezometric levels and the degradation of the forested areas impacted by a gradual shift of the springs towards lower altitudes and to estimate the water savings that could be achieved through the reclamation and use of grey water in the ZIPR test site (San Vito al Tagliamento, Pordenone). The second is the southern Po Plain in the Copparo area (Ferrara, northern Italy) in order to assess the effectiveness and the issues connected with recharge activities in salinised aquifer inland characterized by medium-low permeability and to estimate the effectiveness of phyto-purification systems and the improvement of biodiversity. The aims of the WARBO project are: the integration and updating of the CAMI-LIFE database to improve existing knowledge and to better evaluate the hydrogeological and geochemical evolution of aquifers; the updating of the conceptual model and identification of test areas; the application of innovative hydrological 3D models implementing state-of-the-art numerical procedures to solve partial differential equations (as finite elements, mixed finite elements, finite volumes).				vaccaro, carmela/C-1324-2013; ABU ZEID, Nasser/R-3532-2016; Paganini, Paolo/L-7431-2015	vaccaro, carmela/0000-0002-4954-8697; ABU ZEID, Nasser/0000-0002-9892-0694; COREN, Franco/0000-0002-7160-1001; Paganini, Paolo/0000-0002-5605-6164; baradello, luca/0000-0002-9796-4521; Accaino, Flavio/0000-0003-3512-2457; Affatato, Alessandro/0000-0003-3921-2986												0006-6729					JUN	2012	53	2					253	260		10.4430/bgta0062								WOS:000305759200005

Using Landsat imagery to map forest change in southwest China in response to the national logging ban and ecotourism development	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Forest cover change is one of the most important land cover change processes globally, and old-growth forests continue to disappear despite many efforts to protect them. At the same time, many countries are on a trajectory of increasing forest cover, and secondary, plantation, and scrub forests are a growing proportion of global forest cover. Remote sensing is a crucial tool for understanding how forests change in response to forest protection strategies and economic development, but most forest monitoring with satellite imagery does not distinguish old-growth forest from other forest types. Our goal was to measure changes in forest types, and especially old-growth forests, in the biodiversity hotspot of northwest Yunnan in southwest China. Northwest Yunnan is one of the poorest regions in China, and since the 1990s, the Chinese government has legislated strong forest protection and fostered the growth of ecotourism-based economic development. We used Landsat TM/ETM+ and MSS images, Support Vector Machines, and a multi-temporal composite classification technique to analyze change in forest types and the loss of old-growth forest in three distinct periods of forestry policy and ecotourism development from 1974 to 2009. Our analysis showed that logging rates decreased substantially from 1974 to 2009, and the proportion of forest cover increased from 62% in 1990 to 64% in 2009. However, clearing of high-diversity old-growth forest accelerated, from approximately 1100 hectares/year before the logging ban (1990 to 1999), to 1550 hectares/year after the logging ban (1999 to 2009). Paradoxically, old-growth forest clearing accelerated most rapidly where ecotourism was most prominent. Despite increasing overall forest cover, the proportion of old-growth forests declined from 26% in 1990, to 20% in 2009. The majority of forests cleared from 1974 to 1990 returned to either a non-forested land cover type (14%) or non-pine scrub forest (66%) in 2009, and our results suggest that most non-pine scrub forest was not on a successional trajectory towards high-diversity forest stands. That means that despite increasing forest cover, biodiversity likely continues to decline, a trend obscured by simple forest versus non-forest accounting. It also means that rapid development may pose inherent risks to biodiversity, since our study area arguably represents a "best-case scenario" for balancing development with maintenance of biodiversity, given strong forest protection policies and an emphasis on ecotourism development.

We discuss the availability of EO products for analysing patterns in macroecology, particularly related to vegetation, on a range of spatial and temporal scales. Location Global. Methods We discuss four groups of EO products: land cover/cover change, vegetation structure and ecosystem productivity, fire detection, and digital elevation models. We address important practical issues arising from their use, such as assumptions underlying product generation, product accuracy and product transferability between spatial scales. We investigate the potential of EO products for analysing terrestrial ecosystems. Results Land cover, productivity and fire products are generated from long-term data using standardized algorithms to improve reliability in detecting change of land surfaces. Their global coverage renders them useful for macroecology. Their spatial resolution (e.g. GLOBCOVER vegetation, 300 m; MODIS vegetation and fire, = 500 m; ASTER digital elevation, 30 m) can be a limiting factor. Canopy structure and productivity products are based on physical approaches and thus are independent of biome-specific calibrations. Active fire locations are provided in near-real time, while burnt area products show actual area burnt by fire. EO products can be assimilated into ecosystem models, and their validation information can be employed to calculate uncertainties during subsequent modelling. Main conclusions Owing to their global coverage and long-term continuity, EO end products can significantly advance the field of macroecology. EO products allow analyses of spatial biodiversity, seasonal dynamics of biomass and productivity, and consequences of disturbances on regional to global scales. Remaining drawbacks include inter-operability between products from different sensors and accuracy issues due to differences between assumptions and models underlying the generation of different EO products. Our review explains the nature of EO products and how they relate to particular ecological variables across scales to encourage their wider use in ecological applications.

Predicting the distribution of Montastraea reefs using wave exposure	CORAL REEFS												In the Caribbean region, forereef habitats dominated by Montastraea spp. have the highest biodiversity and support the largest number of ecosystem processes and services. Here we show that the distribution of this species-rich habitat can be explained by one environmental predictor: wave exposure. The relationship between wave exposure and the occurrence of Montastraea reefs was modelled using logistic regression for reefs throughout the Belize Barrier Reef, one of the largest and most topographically complex systems in the region. The model was able to predict correctly the occurrence of Montastraea reefs with an accuracy of 81%. Consistent with historical qualitative patterns, the distribution of Montastraea reefs is constrained in environments of high exposure. This pattern is likely to be driven by high rates of chronic sediment scour that constrain recruitment. The wide range of wave exposure conditions used to parameterize the model in Belize suggest that it should be transferable throughout much of the Caribbean region, constituting a fast and inexpensive alternative to traditional habitat mapping and complementing global efforts to map reef extent.

HYDROBIOLOGIA												Although Mediterranean temporary pools are of great value for conservation, they are in rapid decline under the impact of various forms of anthropogenic pressure. Their disappearance from the landscape may result in a weakening of the biological connections between pools due to increasing isolation and the impoverishment of their communities. In Western Morocco (province of Benslimane), temporary pools have undergone severe regression over the past decades. The quantification of these losses and the impact on the richness of plant communities remain, however, unstudied. Since this is of vital importance for the conservation of the biodiversity of these habitats, a study has been undertaken associating (1) an assessment of the pool losses (both in density and surface area) between 1955 and 2001 using remote sensing, (2) surveys of vegetation and water depth (in 2006) in 48 pools, and (3) an assessment of the density and surface area of pools occurring within a 3 km radius around each of the sampled pools. The results show a loss of 23% in number and 61% in surface area of pools in the province over a period of 47 years. This decline, promoted by their small size and shallowness, is probably related to socio-economic changes (intensification of agricultural practices and population growth). The richness in characteristic and rare species of the pools was related to both local (water depth) and regional features (land use, pool density and total water surface area in the surrounding landscape). The significant impact of the current density of pools and their total surface area on the conservation value of the studied pools suggests a weakening of the metacommunity dynamics between pools. Given the rapid socio-economic changes in the province and the current rate of pool disappearance (0.5% per year) we predict a continuing reduction in pool density with a high risk of the widespread loss of their unique flora in the long term.																	0018-8158					JUN	2012	689	1					23	36		10.1007/s10750-011-0679-3								WOS:000303591200003						
J	Hjort, J; Luoto, M				Hjort, Jan; Luoto, Miska			Can geodiversity be predicted from space?	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Identification of geodiversity at regional and national scales with traditional surveying techniques remains a logistically difficult and often financially prohibitive task. Earth observation data in combination with statistical modeling may provide a unique approach for mapping and analyzing geodiversity cost-efficiently. In this study, the possibility to map geodiversity using digital elevation models (DEMs) and remote sensing (RS) data was scrutinized in Finland, Northern Europe at a landscape scale. The main methods in the evaluation of spatial prediction ability of geodiversity and the relative contributions of DEM and RS data were generalized additive modeling (GAM) and variation partitioning. Based on the results, geodiversity was mainly determined by polygenetic bedrock topography and fluvial activity, and correlated most strongly with variables describing high potential energy and topographical heterogeneity. The spatial patterns of geodiversity were robustly predicted across the study areas using multivariate GAMs. The higher predictive performance of the DEM- versus RS-based variables was evident across the study areas. In conclusion, we propose that statistically-based spatial prediction offers an opportunity for characterizing geodiversity of a large area in a systematic, repeatable, and spatially exhaustive manner.

J	Franke, J; Keuck, V; Siegert, F				Franke, Jonas; Keuck, Vanessa; Siegert, Florian			Assessment of grassland use intensity by remote sensing to support conservation schemes	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION												Grassland is a land cover in the area of conflict between agriculture and conservation, where intensification of land use is a major threat to grassland biodiversity. Grassland use intensity is a key factor for the conservation value of grassland, and detailed spatial data on grassland use intensity is needed to improve strategies for biodiversity conservation. A new remote sensing-based approach using multi-temporal high resolution RapidEye satellite data was developed in the present study that makes a large-scale assessment of grassland use intensity possible. RapidEye is a constellation of five satellites with 6.5 m spatial resolution, which allows frequent and timely image acquisition targeted at specific growing seasons. Semi-natural grassland, extensively used grassland, intensively used grassland and tilled grassland could be reliably differentiated at the management plot level in a study area in southern Germany. Various combinations of images from different observation dates have been tested as classification input and their overall classification accuracies were validated by field data. Best results were achieved using a combination of five multi-temporal scenes with an overall accuracy of 85.7%. A three-scene combination resulted in an overall accuracy of 82.2%. The analysis showed that seasonal aspects are very important when selecting adequate observation dates. Grassland use intensity was also assessed on peatlands using a peat soil map, since land use intensity significantly affects greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands. The results demonstrate the potential of targeted multi-spectral, high spatial resolution remote sensing for the large-scale monitoring of dynamic habitats, which is of vital importance to support various environmental conservation schemes through improved monitoring and reporting capabilities.

J	Barth, A; Lind, T; Stahl, G				Barth, Andreas; Lind, Torgny; Stahl, Goran			Restricted imputation for improving spatial consistency in landscape level data for forest scenario analysis	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Today, forest scenario analyses often require spatially comprehensive data. This is due to increasing needs to provide broad-scale descriptions of the consequences of different forest management regimes, encompassing issues with a clear spatial dimension such as biodiversity and recreation. Thus, the composition and spatial configuration of the forest landscape have to be accurately assessed. Today, such data are commonly provided by combining field plot data with remote sensing using imputation schemes such as the k Nearest Neighbour (kNN). Often, such algorithms are executed plot by plot, or stand by stand, and there is no final check that overall landscape composition and configuration are correctly captured. As a consequence, the result from scenario analyses may be severely erroneous; for example, kNN data often exhibits a tendency towards mean values, which may result in misleading predicted outputs of goods and services over time. The objective of this paper was to provide a method for improving composition and spatial configuration in landscape level data when applying imputation schemes such as kNN. The methodological framework comprises two steps: (i) composition at landscape level is preserved by a restricted imputation technique; and (ii) composition and spatial configuration within forest stands is improved by rearranging imputed sample-plots between stands. The method was demonstrated in a case study that showed promising results. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Krishna, PH; Reddy, CS				Krishna, P. Hari; Reddy, C. Sudhakar			Assessment of increasing threat of forest fires in Rajasthan, India using multi-temporal remote sensing data (2005-2010)	CURRENT SCIENCE												Rajasthan is the largest state of India experiencing recurrent forest fires. The present study determines forest burnt areas through remote sensing-based time series analysis. IRS P6 AWiFS satellite data covering March, April and May of six years (2005-2010) were used to cover all forest-fire events. The total forest burnt area was assessed as 53,023.5 ha in 2005; 44,681.5 ha in 2006; 57,689 ha in 2007; 89,655.2 ha in 2008; 199,837 ha in 2009 and 144,816 ha in 2010. Forest fires were observed only in the southern Aravallis. Of the total forest cover in southern Aravallis, burnt area proportionately represents 6.8% in 2005, 5.6% in 2006, 7.3% in 2007, 11.1% in 2008, 23.0% in 2009 and 17.6% in 2010. Forest fires were severe during 2009, which was the warmest year since 1901. Small sized (<25 ha) forest burnt area patches contributed to 44% of the total count during 2010. Among the vegetation types, fire prevalence in the dry deciduous forest was higher and it always contributed to >90% of the burnt area. GIS analysis demonstrated highest burnt area in occasional category (70%) followed by frequent fire area (24%). The abundance of fires in edge forests in relation to interior forests clearly indicates significant anthropogenic influence on the forest edges. The fires in Rajasthan are mainly attributed to ethnic culture, collection of non-timber forest produce and grazing pressure. The study provides critical spatial information of increased forest fire threat in Rajasthan. Long-term planning for forest fire management is necessary for effective conservation of biodiversity and bioresources.																	0011-3891					MAY 10	2012	102	9					1288	1297										WOS:000304181400019

Optimizing land cover classification accuracy for change detection, a combined pixel-based and object-based approach in a mountainous area in Mexico	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Inventories of past and present land cover changes form the basis of future conservation and landscape management strategies. Modern classification techniques can be applied to more efficiently extract information from traditional remote-sensing sources. Landsat ETM+ images of a mountainous area in Mexico form the input for a combined object-based and pixel-based land cover classification. The land cover categories with the highest individual classification accuracies determined based on these two methods are extracted and merged into combined land cover classifications. In total, seven common land cover categories were recognized and merged into single combined best-classification layers. A comparison of the overall classification accuracies for 1999 and 2006 of the pixel-based (0.74 and 0.81), object-based (0.77 and 0.71) and combined (0.88 and 0.87) classifications shows that the combination method produces the best results. These combined classifications then form the input for a change detection analysis between the two dates by applying post-classification, object-based change analysis using image differencing. It is concluded that the combined classification method together with the object-based change detection analysis leads to an improved classification accuracy and land cover change detection. This approach has the potential to be applied to land cover change analyses in similar mountainous areas using medium-resolution imagery. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The role of private lands for conservation: Land cover change analysis in the Caldenal savanna ecosystem, Argentina	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Protected areas are critical for conservation of the world's biodiversity; however, parks isolated from their surroundings will not assure the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem integrity. Private lands have the potential to achieve the dual role of conserving natural habitats while providing goods and services societies need. Therefore, understanding which land use practices on private land contribute to the maintenance of native habitats is important. In this study, a land use and land cover change analysis was developed for the Caldenal savanna ecosystem, Argentina, to determine the effect of private game reserves on landscape scale change. Game reserves were found preferentially located in the areas with highest proportion of forest cover. No differences were found in rates of conversion of native habitat to agriculture between game reserves and cattle ranches for 1987-1999 or 1999-2008. Rates of deforestation differed with landholding size between the first and second period. Deforestation stopped in the second period in the game reserves and big cattle ranches, but increased in intensity in small cattle ranches. Intensity of deforestation was more related to agricultural potential of the ranches, which are correlated with landholding size, than to the land use type. Deforestation was higher in areas with more productive soils and higher annual rainfall. These results suggest that, for the period analyzed, incorporation of game reserves as a land use did not significantly alter processes of land cover change, though if conversion to agriculture increases in marginal areas, game reserves potentially could be beneficial for maintenance of a significant portion of the Caldenal.

The PPAs correspond to 42.33% of Lavras county's territory. The conflict between the land use and environmental legislation occurs in 63.48% of PPAs' territory, mainly corresponding to the pasture areas, bare soil and agriculture. The PPAs of tops of hills showed the highest conflicts with the legislation, with 48.48% of the territory occupied by pastures, and 13.62% by agriculture. The PPAs located in the surrounding of water courses and in the slopes with declivity higher than 45 degrees presented 59.99% and 92.03%, respectively of the territory occupied by native vegetation of semi-deciduous forest and natural fields.

In this study, we used support vector machines (SVM) for modeling rare species distribution and we compared it to another emerging machine learning classifier called random forests (RF). The comparison was performed using three native and endemic plants found at low- to mid-elevation in the island of Moorea (French Polynesia, South Pacific) and considered rare because of scarce occurrence records: Lepinia taitensis (28 observed occurrences). Pouteria tahitensis (20 occurrences) and Santalum insulare var. raiateense (81 occurrences). We selected a set of biophysical variables to describe plant habitats in tropical high volcanic islands, including topographic descriptors and an overstory vegetation map. The former were extracted from a digital elevation model (DEM) and the latter is a result of a SVM classification of spectral and textural bands from very high resolution Quickbird satellite imagery. Our results show that SVM slightly but constantly outperforms RF in predicting the distribution of rare species based on the kappa coefficient and the area under the curve (AUC) achieved by both classifiers. The predicted potential habitats of the three rare species are considerably wider than their currently observed distribution ranges. We hypothesize that the causes of this discrepancy are strong anthropogenic disturbances that have impacted low- to mid-elevation forests in the past and present. There is an urgent need to set up conservation strategies for the endangered plants found in these shrinking habitats on the Pacific islands. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Recent Changes in Patch Characteristics and Plant Communities in the Jalca Grasslands of the Peruvian Andes	BIOTROPICA												Habitat loss and fragmentation are considered major threats to biodiversity, especially in tropical mountain ecosystems. Most studies focus on the relationships between biodiversity and patch characteristics such as patch size, connectivity or degree of contrast with the surrounding matrix, but leave the rate of change within these variables little explored. We analyzed the importance of changes in patch characteristics over time on species diversity and species composition in the paramo of northern Peru, a tropical grassland ecosystem, locally known as jalca. We obtained land use/cover maps for 1987 and 2007 spanning an area of 6300 km(2), and quantified land use change, jalca patch characteristics and their proportional changes over 20 yr. In 2009, 371 vascular plant species were recorded in 92 plots, each plot representative of single patches. Between 1987 and 2007, jalca cover decreased from 47 to 35 percent due to encroaching agriculture. This activity showed an upward shift probably favored by climate change. The number of jalca patches increased, mean patch size decreased, and the patches showed a higher contrast with the surrounding matrix. Multiple linear regression failed to show that species diversity relates to changes in patch characteristics. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that species composition relates to the degree of contrast between the patch and its surrounding matrix and its changes through time. We concluded that changes in patch characteristics are important only for species composition. This study highlights the importance of considering matrix management with a long term perspective for conservation efforts.

The effect of land use change and ecotourism on biodiversity: a case study of Manuel Antonio, Costa Rica, from 1985 to 2008	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Development in biodiversity rich areas is of global concern. While development may lead to socioeconomic benefits, this often comes concomitant with biodiversity loss and deforestation. Biodiversity rich areas present the opportunity for both improvements in socioeconomic conditions and conservation; however numerous challenges exist. Costa Rica's Manuel Antonio National Park presents an ideal case study to investigate the balance between alternative forms of development which have contrasting environmental impacts. The Manuel Antonio region is a highly dynamic landscape experiencing deforestation, from agriculture, cattle ranching and oil palm plantations; and also reforestation from abandonment of land holdings and nature oriented tourism. Landscape dynamics are closely intertwined with the livelihoods and perspectives on biodiversity conservation of local communities, determining ecological sustainability. We use an analysis combining multi-temporal remote sensing of land cover dynamics from 1985 to 2008 with questionnaire data from local families on their socioeconomic status, perspectives on conservation, and perceived changes in local wildlife populations. Our results show that, while regeneration occurred and forest fragmentation in the area decreased from 1985 to 2008, Manuel Antonio National Park is rapidly becoming isolated. Decreasing ecological connectivity is related to the rapid expansion of oil palm plantations adjacent to the park and throughout the lowland areas. Perceived decreases in wildlife abundance and compositional change are evident throughout the area, with local communities attributing this primarily to illegal hunting activities. Nature based tourism in the area presents an effective strategy for conservation, including reductions in hunting, through increased valuation of biodiversity and protected areas, and socioeconomic advantages. However, without urgent efforts to limit deforestation and preserve the remaining forested corridor connecting the park to core primary forest, the ability to maintain biodiversity in the park will be reduced.

We are now at the beginning of the international decade for biodiversity and by the time we travel through the decade, there would be sea-changes in the measurement and monitoring approaches, database management options, and inter-linked studies on biodiversity. With the onset of geoinformatics techniques comprising remote sensing, global positioning system (GPS), integrative tools, such as GIS, is realized as a complimentary system to ground-based biodiversity studies. Recently, a nationwide biodiversity study at landscape level using geoinformatics modeling techniques for India has been completed. The study has assessed plant diversity using a three-tier approach, wherein six biodiversity attributes (i.e., spatial, phytosociological, social, physical, economical, and ecological) were linked together based on their relative importance to stratify biological richness of forest vegetation (non-agricultural) of India. It has enumerated 7,964 plant species from 20,000 nested quadrate sampling plots of 0.04 ha each, delineated and mapped 120 vegetation classes; and organized the geo-spatial database on bisindia web portal. Here, we have (i) proposed a method to incorporate the fauna component in-line up with the existing methodology and (ii) utilized the GPS-gathered positional information on the distribution of two species (i.e., Medicago sativa and Poa annua to simulate their distribution for the year 2020 (SRES A1-B scenario, IPCC) using Maxent model. The study conducted in a test site of western Himalayas estimated (i) 24% increase in the overall biologically rich areas on supplement of fauna data and (ii) distribution of both the species would tend to increase in favor of shorter cold season. The study highlights the importance of geoinformatics technique-based biodiversity study for its amenability to incorporate any further change or modification, and utility of the geo-spatial biodiversity database for simulating various species distribution scenarios to understand their ecology in today's fast changing climate for effective conservation prescriptions.				matin, shafique/F-2111-2015	matin, shafique/0000-0002-8533-2148; CHITALE, VISHWAS/0000-0001-8661-8204												0960-3115	1572-9710				MAY	2012	21	5			SI		1229	1250		10.1007/s10531-012-0233-2								WOS:000302570400006

Impact of tsunami on the forest and biodiversity richness in Nicobar Islands (Andaman and Nicobar Islands), India	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Occurrences of extreme events are likely to cause major decline in global biodiversity. In one such event, on December 26, 2004 tsunami caused extensive damage and irreparable losses to the ecology and biodiversity of low-lying areas of the countries located around the Indian Ocean region. Archipelago of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, one of the richest centre of endemism and biodiversity in the Indo-Malayan region, suffered great loss of forests and coastal biodiversity owing to its closeness to the epicenter of tsunami, i.e. just off the coast of Indonesia. There is little insight into the resilience and rate of recovery pattern of tropical coastal habitats consequent to catastrophic impacts of tsunami. It's important to study the impacts of tsunami on the forest and biodiversity in order to suggest mitigation, restoration measures and long-term conservation planning. Here we have assessed the immediate after-effects of December 26, 2004 tsunami on the forests and areas prioritized for biodiversity conservation analyzing pre and post tsunami satellite imageries. The effect of topographic patterns of Island's coastal areas and their distance from the epicenter of tsunami with respect to changes in the forests and different levels of biologically rich areas modeled for prioritization for different groups of Islands in Nicobar has been studied. Great Nicobar accounted for higher proportion of total forest area damaged and submerged in Nicobar, followed by Central Nicobar and Car Nicobar. Mangroves, littoral forest, beach forest and low land swamps and Syzygium swamps were most affected. Study brings out spatially explicit scenario of damaged, submerged and lost forest areas and corresponding area statistics, vital for understanding and mitigating medium and long term effects of tsunami an extreme event.																	0960-3115					MAY	2012	21	5			SI		1267	1287		10.1007/s10531-011-0214-x								WOS:000302570400008

J	Gregr, EJ; Ahrens, AL; Perry, RI				Gregr, Edward J.; Ahrens, Andrea L.; Perry, R. Ian			Reconciling classifications of ecologically and biologically significant areas in the world's oceans	MARINE POLICY												The classification of marine habitats is a critical first step towards the protection of marine biodiversity and the sustainable management of the world's oceans. Recently, the topic has received heightened attention as the 2012 deadline for meeting international commitments under the convention on biological diversity (CBD) approaches. These commitments require the development of a unified approach to identifying high-seas areas in need of protection. To determine the best approach, criteria for identifying sensitive areas proposed by the CBD and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations were compared to the ecologically and biologically significant areas (EBSAs) criteria developed by Fisheries and Oceans Canada. The comparison demonstrates that, with some minor refinements, the EBSA criteria are parsimonious and encompass all other criteria proposed to date. To identify the most suitable approach for defining EBSAs, 16 classifications of the world's oceans, ranging from coastal regions to the high-seas, were reviewed for their suitability to define EBSAs. The classifications differed in substantive ways, including analytical methods (from quantitative analyses to subjective interpretations), data sources (either physical or biological), and the realm to which they were applied (high-seas, coastal, or deep-ocean). No method currently provides an integrated, whole-ecosystem approach to identifying a comprehensive set of important marine areas. To move to a singular, multi-attribute, description of EBSAs requires an explicit, reproducible methodology. Here, the EBSA approach is formalised as an adaptive method that integrates existing classifications in an efficient, holistic, and transparent manner, by explicitly considering important marine features (IMFs) and biologically sensitive areas (BSAs). The proposed approach directly addresses the EBSA criteria, and is applicable across the different realms of the world's oceans. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

There is need of a robust and quality database of the biological diversity at species, community, ecosystem and landscape levels for identification of vulnerable ecosystems and risk species. in order to have a national level database on the spatial distribution of biological diversity, a nationwide project on the biodiversity characterization at landscape level was implemented and studies were carried out between 1998 and 2010 to characterize and map the flowering plants richness in the forested landscapes. The spatial database on vegetation types generated from temporal IRS LISS-III satellite imagery, road/rail network and settlements from topomaps and high-resolution satellite images, and species richness from field sampling were used to generate the spatially explicit species distribution maps and statistics. This study has resulted in the creation of a large baseline spatial database on vegetation types, porosity, patchiness, interspersion, juxtaposition, fragmentation, disturbance regimes, ecosystem uniqueness, terrain complexity and biological richness.																	0011-3891					APR 25	2012	102	8					1136	1142										WOS:000304224300018

Long-term ecological and biodiversity monitoring in the western Himalaya using satellite remote sensing	CURRENT SCIENCE												The IPCC in its Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) described the Himalayan Region as data-deficient in terms of climate monitoring. This is a serious impediment to global research initiatives and thus necessitates long-term ecological monitoring (LTEM) across the Himalaya. Being governed by low temperature conditions, the high-altitude regions in Himalaya are more responsive to changing environmental conditions and hence serve as better indicators. We identified few Protected Areas (PAs) and selected forest core area and ecotones along the temperate, sub-alpine, alpine and cold desert ecosystems in Himachal Pradesh to establish a network of permanent monitoring plots (PMPs). Land and vegetation cover map of three selected PAs has been prepared using Landsat TM satellite data. Among the 10 PMPs, the temperate and tree line forests in the GHNP were found to have the highest tree diversity with Taxus wallichiana showing good stand density and regeneration. The soil pH was found to be higher for cold desert and lower for tree line forests and alpine meadows. Soil total carbon and nitrogen contents ranged from 1.08% to 13.37% and 0.094% to 1.14% respectively. It was observed that the herbs diversity showed a positive trend with increasing soil carbon and nitrogen concentrations. Satellite remote sensing proves to be a useful tool in an LTEM study, including biodiversity assessment and climate change research in complex terrains such as the Himalaya.

J	Dees, M; Straub, C; Koch, B				Dees, Matthias; Straub, Christoph; Koch, Barbara			Can biodiversity study benefit from information on the vertical structure of forests? Utility of LiDAR remote sensing	CURRENT SCIENCE												Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing offers new and improved capabilities for vertical and structural characterization of objects, such as plant height and different growth stages/strata, etc. Climate change will change tree and plant growth conditions and thus will change forest structure and distribution, which can potentially be studied using LiDAR remote sensing. LiDAR data were acquired during leafless season that was subjected to generation of digital terrain model, digital surface model, vegetation height model, forest height map, top height of forest stands, detection of gaps, detection and mapping of tree stands, mapping of density classes of middle layer and understorey detection of coniferous trees. The stand height and structural information derived from the LiDAR imagery would greatly contribute to the characterization of biodiversity through vertical stratification.																	0011-3891					APR 25	2012	102	8					1181	1187										WOS:000304224300023

Our goal was to understand the effects of institutional changes on agricultural land abandonment in different countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union after the collapse of socialism. We studied similar to 273 800 km(2) (eight Landsat footprints) within one agro-ecological zone stretching across Poland, Belarus, Latvia, Lithuania and European Russia. Multi-seasonal Landsat TM/ETM+ satellite images centered on 1990 (the end of socialism) and 2000 (one decade after the end of socialism) were used to classify agricultural land abandonment using support vector machines. The results revealed marked differences in the abandonment rates between countries. The highest rates of land abandonment were observed in Latvia (42% of all agricultural land in 1990 was abandoned by 2000), followed by Russia (31%), Lithuania (28%), Poland (14%) and Belarus (13%). Cross-border comparisons revealed striking differences; for example, in the Belarus-Russia cross-border area there was a great difference between the rates of abandonment of the two countries (10% versus 47% of abandonment). Our results highlight the importance of institutions and policies for land-use trajectories and demonstrate that radically different combinations of institutional change of strong institutions during the transition can reduce the rate of agricultural land abandonment (e.g., in Belarus and in Poland). Inversely, our results demonstrate higher abandonment rates for countries where the institutions that regulate land use changed and where the institutions took more time to establish (e.g., Latvia, Lithuania and Russia). Better knowledge regarding the effects of such broad-scale change is essential for understanding land-use change and for designing effective land-use policies. This information is particularly relevant for Northern Eurasia, where rapid land-use change offers vast opportunities for carbon balance and biodiversity, and for increasing agricultural production on previously cultivated lands.

Examining protected area effectiveness in Sumatra: importance of regulations governing unprotected lands	CONSERVATION LETTERS												Several studies suggest that protected areas conserve forests because deforestation rates are lower inside than outside protected area boundaries. Such benefits may be overestimated when deforestation rates within protected areas are contrasted with rates in lands where forest conversion is sanctioned. Here, we reexamine protected area performance by disentangling the effects of land use regulations surrounding the 110,000 km(2) protected area network in Sumatra, Indonesia. We compared 1990-2000 deforestation rates across: (1) protected areas; (2) unprotected areas sanctioned for conversion; and (3) unprotected production areas where commercial logging is permitted but conversion is not. Deforestation rates were lower in protected areas than in conversion areas (Mean: -19.8%; 95% C.I.: -29.7-10.0%; P < 0.001), but did not differ from production areas (Mean: -3.3%; 95% C.I.: -9.6-2.6%; P = 0.273). The measured protection impact of Sumatran protected areas differs with land use regulations governing unprotected lands used for comparisons. If these regulations are not considered, protected areas will appear increasingly effective as larger unprotected forested areas are sanctioned for conversion and deforested. In the 1990s, production areas were as effective as protected areas at reducing deforestation. We discuss implications of these findings for carbon conservation.																	1755-263X					APR	2012	5	2					142	148		10.1111/j.1755-263X.2011.00220.x								WOS:000303872200008

Julian			Multi-scale marine biodiversity patterns inferred efficiently from habitat image processing	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Cost-effective proxies of biodiversity and species abundance, applicable across a range of spatial scales, are needed for setting conservation priorities and planning action. We outline a rapid, efficient, and low-cost measure of spectral signal from digital habitat images that, being an effective proxy for habitat complexity, correlates with species diversity and requires little image processing or interpretation. We validated this method for coral reefs of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, across a range of spatial scales (1 m to 10 km), using digital photographs of benthic communities at the transect scale and high-resolution Landsat satellite images at the reef scale. We calculated an index of image-derived spatial heterogeneity, the mean information gain (MIG), for each scale and related it to univariate (species richness and total abundance summed across species) and multivariate (species abundance matrix) measures of fish community structure, using two techniques that account for the hierarchical structure of the data: hierarchical (mixed-effect) linear models and distance-based partial redundancy analysis. Over the length and breadth of the GBR, MIG alone explained up to 29% of deviance in fish species richness, 33% in total fish abundance, and 25% in fish community structure at multiple scales, thus demonstrating the possibility of easily and rapidly exploiting spatial information contained in digital images to complement existing methods for inferring diversity and abundance patterns among fish communities. Thus, the spectral signal of unprocessed remotely sensed images provides an efficient and low-cost way to optimize the design of surveys used in conservation planning. In data-sparse situations, this simple approach also offers a viable method for rapid assessment of potential local biodiversity, particularly where there is little local capacity in terms of skills or resources for mounting in-depth biodiversity surveys.

J	Zheng, YM; Zhang, HY; Niu, ZG; Gong, P				Zheng YaoMin; Zhang HaiYing; Niu ZhenGuo; Gong Peng			Protection efficacy of national wetland reserves in China	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN												Wetlands have the most abundant biodiversity, the highest carbon sequestration capacity, and the highest values for ecological services per unit area, of all the world's ecosystems. Practice has shown that establishing reserves is the most effective way of protecting typical ecosystems and their biodiversity, and saving rare or endangered wildlife. The Chinese government's policy is to protect wetland systems by establishing reserves that encompass a massive network of wetlands, including wetland nature reserves, internationally important wetlands, and wetland parks. Many are already established. The effect of protecting wetland nature reserves at the national level has not yet been reported. We used the latest database evaluating the protection value of wetland reserves, and remotely sensed wetland maps (1978-2008), developed by the same mapping specialists and based on the same classification system, and related environmental data, to evaluate the effects of protecting China's national wetland reserves over the last 30 years. We conclude that (i) the total area of wetland in the national wetland reserves has decreased over the last 30 years to 8152.47 km(2), and just 8% of China's net decrease in wetlands; (ii) about 79% of the 91 national wetland reserves are in a poor condition. These are generally located around the Yangtze River, Eastern Coast, the Three Rivers Source, and Southwest China. Protection measures should be undertaken urgently in these areas. Only 15% of national wetland reserves are under sound protection, and these are generally located in the upper reaches of the Songhua River; (iii) although 88% of national wetland reserves are primitive (relatively natural), implying that the site selection has been scientific, a high percentage of national wetland reserves show early warning signs of decline and require urgent attention; (iv) based on our evaluation of protection effects and pressures on ecology, we have made a priority list of national wetland reserves, and propose several protection strategies.

Ferry; Zhang, Cui-Ping; Dai, Zhi-Cong			Rubber and pulp plantations represent a double threat to Hainan's natural tropical forests	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Hainan, the largest tropical island in China, belongs to the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot and harbors large areas of tropical forests, particularly in the uplands. The Changhua watershed is the cradle of Hainan's main river and a center of endemism for plants and birds. The watershed contains great habitat diversity and is an important conservation area. We analyzed the impact of rubber and pulp plantations on the distribution and area of tropical forest in the watershed, using remote sensing analysis of Landsat images from 1988, 1995 and 2005. From 1988 to 1995, natural forest increased in area (979-1040 sq km) but decreased rapidly (763 sq km) over the next decade. Rubber plantations increased steadily through the study period while pulp plantations appeared after 1995 but occupied 152 sq km by 2005. Rubber and pulp plantations displace different types of natural forest and do not replace one another. Because pulp is not as profitable as rubber and existing pulp processing capacity greatly exceeds local supply, considerable pressure exists on remaining upland forests. We recommend for future management that these plantation forests be reclassified as 'industrial', making a clear policy distinction between natural and industrial forestry. Additionally, the local government should work to enforce existing laws preventing forest conversion on marginal and protected areas. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Saravia, LA; Giorgi, A; Momo, F				Saravia, Leonardo Ariel; Giorgi, Adonis; Momo, Fernando			Multifractal Spatial Patterns and Diversity in an Ecological Succession	PLOS ONE												We analyzed the relationship between biodiversity and spatial biomass heterogeneity along an ecological succession developed in the laboratory. Periphyton (attached microalgae) biomass spatial patterns at several successional stages were obtained using digital image analysis and at the same time we estimated the species composition and abundance. We show that the spatial pattern was self-similar and as the community developed in an homogeneous environment the pattern is self-organized. To characterize it we estimated the multifractal spectrum of generalized dimensions D-q. Using D-q we analyze the existence of cycles of heterogeneity during succession and the use of the information dimension D-1 as an index of successional stage. We did not find cycles but the values of D-1 showed an increasing trend as the succession developed and the biomass was higher. D-1 was also negatively correlated with Shannon's diversity. Several studies have found this relationship in different ecosystems but here we prove that the community self-organizes and generates its own spatial heterogeneity influencing diversity. If this is confirmed with more experimental and theoretical evidence D-1 could be used as an index, easily calculated from remote sensing data, to detect high or low diversity areas.

The Imatong Central Forest Reserve (ICFR) in South Sudan together with the nearby Dongotana Hills and the Agoro-Agu Forest Reserve (AFR) in Northern Uganda share a boundary and encompass a biologically diverse montane ecosystem. This study used satellite data combined with general human population trends to examine the impact of armed conflict and its outcome on similar forest ecosystems both during and after hostilities have occurred. A Disturbance Index (DI) was used to investigate the location and extent of forest cover loss and gain in three areas for two key time periods from mid-1980s to 2001 and 2003 to 2010. Results indicate that the rate of forest recovery was significantly higher than the rate of disturbance both during and after wartime in and around the ICFR and the net rate of forest cover change remained largely unchanged for the two time periods. In contrast, the nearby Dongotana Hills experienced relatively high rates of disturbance during both periods; however, post war period losses were largely offset by some gains in forest cover. For the AFR in Uganda, the rate of forest recovery was much higher during the second period, coinciding with the time people began leaving overcrowded camps. The diversity and merging of floristic regions in a very narrow band around the lmatong Mountains makes this area biologically distinct and of outstanding conservation importance; therefore, any future loss in forest cover is important to monitor - particularly in South Sudan where large numbers of people continue to return following the 2005 peace agreement and the 2011 Referendum on Independence.

J	Soininen, J; Luoto, M				Soininen, Janne; Luoto, Miska			Is catchment productivity a useful predictor of taxa richness in lake plankton communities?	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												The influence of catchment variables on lake organisms is understudied. The terrestrial zone in the vicinity of lakes is, however, probably highly important for biota due to the effects on water chemistry and to various processes operating across ecosystem boundaries. We examined the relative importance of lake and catchment variables, as well as large-scale geographical factors, on the taxa richness of phyto- and zooplankton in 100 small lakes in Finland. In variation partitioning, the variability of phytoplankton richness was most strongly related to the effects of lake variables, the joint effects of lake and catchment variables, and the joint effects of all three groups of variables. Zooplankton richness, in turn, was most strongly related to the effects of lake and catchment variables and the joint effect of lake and catchment variables. The exact results of the variation partitioning depended on the catchment sizes considered in the regression models. Among lake variables, planktonic richness was strongly related to variables indicating productivity. Among catchment variables, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), indicating catchment productivity, showed a relatively strong association with planktonic richness. These results provide evidence that catchment variables such as the NDVI may be efficient predictors of planktonic richness in small lakes. It is possible that individual lakes embedded in a highly productive landscape have higher taxa richness than solitary, potentially productive lakes because of the high influx of dispersing propagules from the regional pool. We also suggest that catchment variables may respond to environmental changes at different scales than the lake variables, and explicit consideration of catchment productivity would therefore be useful when planning research and monitoring programs. for freshwater organisms.

Detecting changes in forest floor habitat after canopy disturbance	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												A massive ice storm hit northeastern North America in 1998, dropping more than 100 mm of freezing rain at its epicenter in southern Quebec, Canada. There has been extensive study of which trees and areas received the most damage, but the biodiversity consequences of this damage at landscape scales have not received much attention. We assessed the effectiveness of seven remotely sensed vegetation indices-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index, Difference Vegetation Index, Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index, Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index, Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Visible Atmospheric Resistant Index-for modeling the coarse woody debris (CWD) influx in an old growth forest reserve at the storm's epicenter; NDVI was the best predictor of CWD influx. We categorized the geospatial CWD predictions from the NDVI-derived model to map the spatial distribution of sun-exposed, moist-shaded, dry-shaded and wet CWD microhabitats on the forest floor. Moist-shaded, dry-shaded and wet patches of CWD were large and well connected, but sun-exposed patches were small and sparse. Since these microhabitats affect the distribution and abundance of saproxylic insects, wood-rotting fungi, salamanders, birds, small burrowing mammals and plant species dependent on nurse-logs for establishment, the CWD influx from the 1998 ice storm may have revitalized local populations of these taxa through increased habitat availability as well as increased dispersal within the reserve.

Dynamics of Ecosystem Service Value Caused by Land use Changes in Manas River of Xinjiang, China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												This study aims to quantify the impacts of land use changes on ecosystem service value during large scale land development, and to provide key information for both economic development and policy makers for eco-environmental protection. The study area locates in Manas river watershed which is a typical land development region in northwest China. Landsat MSS/TM/ETM+ images in 1976, 1989, 1999 and 2008 were applied to estimate ecosystem service value based on land use, and subsequently ecosystem service value dynamics were analyzed in response to land use changes. It is found that the built-up area and cultivated land increased significantly from 1976 to 2008. The decreasing ecosystem service value (from 17362.2 million Yuan in 1976 to 16975.0 million Yuan in 2008) is mainly caused by the reduced grassland. The combined ecosystem service value of water body and grassland is over 60% of the total value. Functions of water supply, waste treatment, soil formation and retention and biodiversity protection contributed to over 70% of the total service value. The results suggest that a reasonable land use plan should emphasize protection of water body, woodland and grassland as they have the highest ecosystem service value.																	1735-6865					SPR	2012	6	2					499	508										WOS:000301516600017

Deforestation and CO2 emissions in coastal Tanzania from 1990 to 2007	ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION												Conversion of forest to other land uses is a major contributor to climate change. The coastal forests of Tanzania have increasingly been recognized as being of global biodiversity importance, due to high rates of species endemism. Rates of forest loss are similar to those of other tropical regions, resulting in increasing levels of threat for the biological values within the remaining forest and potentially significant source of CO2 emissions. This study estimated the remaining cover and carbon stock of Tanzania's coastal forests and the CO2 emissions due to forest loss between c. 1990 and c. 2007. Coastal Tanzania contained over 273 700 ha of forest in 2007. Deforestation rates in the area have slowed from 1.0 % yr(-1), or > 3735 ha yr(-1) during the 1990s, to 0.4 % yr(-1), or > 1233 ha yr(-1) during 2000-2007. Despite lower deforestation rates in 2000-2007, the percentage forest lost from within reserved areas has remained steady at 0.2 % yr(-1) for both time periods. CO2 emissions from deforestation slowed from at least 0.63 Mt CO2 yr(-1) in 1990-2000 to at least 0.20 Mt CO2 yr(-1) in 2000-2007. Regional forest clearance in Tanzania is highly dynamic; while rates have slowed since 2000, forest habitat conversion has continued and there is no guarantee that future rates will remain low. A rigorous policy on reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) should be implemented to avoid future increases in deforestation rates.				publicationpage, cmec/B-4405-2017; publist, CMEC/C-3010-2012													0376-8929					MAR	2012	39	1					62	71		10.1017/S037689291100035X								WOS:000299937200007

Our goals were to assess the effectiveness of Romanian protected areas at stemming unsanctioned logging, and to assess post-socialist logging in their surrounding landscapes, during a time of massive socio-economic and institutional change. Our results suggest that forest cover remained fairly stable shortly before and after 1990, but forest disturbance rates increased sharply in two waves after 1995 and 2005. We found substantial disturbances inside protected areas, even within core reserve areas. Moreover, disturbances in the matrix surrounding protected areas were even lower than inside protected area boundaries. We suggest that these rates are largely the result of high logging rates, triggered by rapid ownership and institutional changes. These trends compromise the goals of Romania's protected area network, lead to an increasing loss of forest habitat, and more isolated and more fragmented protected areas. The effectiveness of Romania's protected area network in terms of its ability to safeguard biodiversity is therefore most likely decreasing. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

From an ecological perspective, this is light pollution, which causes changes in reproductive physiology, migration and foraging of many species and ultimately leads to loss of biodiversity. Some seabirds are intimately linked with the light features of their environments because they are nocturnally active. We report light-induced groundings of Cory's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea) during a 2-year study (2008 and 2009) in Sao Miguel Island, in the Azores archipelago, and investigate the spatial correlation of locations of grounded birds with an annual composite of remotely sensed stable lights. Results indicate that 16.7% of fledglings are attracted to lights. The exposure of shearwater colonies in the study area to artificial night lighting is low overall. Four colonies account for 87% of the grounded birds. The distance each bird was found from the closest colony was best explained by the ratio of the satellite-measured light levels at the grounding spot to the light levels at the assigned colony of origin. These results demonstrate that satellite-observed nighttime lights are sufficient to assess risk to marine birds at the scale of oceanic islands and indicate their utility for monitoring the effectiveness of programs to manage lighting to reduce risk for these species and conducting global assessments of species vulnerability. To minimize the impact on Cory's shearwater and other marine birds, we recommend measures such as reduction and control of lighting intensity near colony locations, while continuing and re-enforcing rescue campaigns.

Measuring the Impacts of Community-based Grasslands Management in Mongolia's Gobi	PLOS ONE												We assessed a donor-funded grassland management project designed to create both conservation and livelihood benefits in the rangelands of Mongolia's Gobi desert. The project ran from 1995 to 2006, and we used remote sensing Normalized Differential Vegetation Index data from 1982 to 2009 to compare project grazing sites to matched control sites before and after the project's implementation. We found that the productivity of project grazing sites was on average within 1% of control sites for the 20 years before the project but generated 11% more biomass on average than the control areas from 2000 to 2009. To better understand the benefits of the improved grasslands to local people, we conducted 280 household interviews, 8 focus group discussions, and 31 key informant interviews across 6 districts. We found a 12% greater median annual income as well as a range of other socioeconomic benefits for project households compared to control households in the same areas. Overall, the project generated measurable benefits to both nature and people. The key factors underlying project achievements that may be replicable by other conservation projects include the community-driven approach of the project, knowledge exchanges within and between communities inside and outside the country, a project-supported local community organizer in each district, and strong community leadership.					van Beukering, Pieter/0000-0001-7146-4409												1932-6203					FEB 1	2012	7	2							e30991	10.1371/journal.pone.0030991								WOS:000301977500024	22312436

In view of this, proper image rectification is needed to enable geometrically unbiased application of landscape metrics in order to obtain meaningful results. It is also particularly important to provide researchers with image rectification tools within an open source environment, in order to: (i) guarantee free and robust tools for processing remote sensing data, (ii) facilitate customization, and (iii) provide useful support via forums and email lists. In this paper we provide a complete description of a robust and freely licensed toolchain for orthorectifying images, which is available in the open source software GRASS GIS. We will first sketch the theoretical background behind rectification and then illustrate the workflow of the orthorectification procedure in GRASS GIS. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Flood Pulsing in the Sudd Wetland: Analysis of Seasonal Variations in Inundation and Evaporation in South Sudan	EARTH INTERACTIONS												Located on the Bahr el Jebel in South Sudan, the Sudd is one of the largest floodplain wetlands in the world. Seasonal inundation drives the hydrologic, geomorphological, and ecological processes, and the annual flood pulse is essential to the functioning of the Sudd. Despite the importance of the flood pulse, various hydrological interventions are planned upstream of the Sudd to increase economic benefits and food security. These will not be without consequences, in particular for wetlands where the biological productivity, biodiversity, and human livelihoods are dependent on the flood pulse and both the costs and benefits need to be carefully evaluated. Many African countries still lack regional baseline information on the temporal extent, distribution, and characteristics of wetlands, making it hard to assess the consequences of development interventions. Because of political instability in Sudan and the inaccessible nature of the Sudd, recent measurements of flooding and seasonal dynamics are inadequate. Analyses of multitemporal and multisensor remote sensing datasets are presented in this paper, in order to investigate and characterize flood pulsing within the Sudd wetland over a 12-month period. Wetland area has been mapped along with dominant components of open water and flooded vegetation at five time periods over a single year. The total area of flooding (both rain and river fed) over the 12 months was 41 334 km 2, with 9176 km(2) of this constituting the permanent wetland. Mean annual total evaporation is shown to be higher and with narrower distribution of values from areas of open water (1718 mm) than from flooded vegetation (1641 mm). Although the exact figures require validation against ground-based measurements, the results highlight the relative differences in inundation patterns and evaporation across the Sudd.																	1087-3562					FEB	2012	16								1	10.1175/2011EI382.1								WOS:000300613400001

Using a regression framework, we first test the relative importance of park size and isolation in predicting abundance and species richness of butterfly assemblages across a set of 24 public parks within a large metropolitan area, Marseille (South-East France). Then, we focus on landscape features that affect diversity patterns of the recorded butterfly communities. In this second part, the urban landscape surrounding each park is described (within a 1 x 1 km window) according to two major components: vegetated areas (habitat patches) and impervious or built areas (matrix patches). Specifically, we aim to test whether the incorporation of this built component (matrix) in the landscape analysis provides new insights into the understanding of ecological connectivity in the urban environment. We found a significant effect of both matrix configuration (shape complexity of the built patches) and distance from regional species pool (park isolation) on diversity of butterflies that overrides park size in their contribution to variation in species richness. This result suggests that many previous studies of interactions between biodiversity and urban landscape have overlooked the influence of the built elements.																	0921-2973					FEB	2012	27	2			SI		159	169		10.1007/s10980-011-9651-x								WOS:000300088700002

Spectral heterogeneity of QuickBird satellite data is related to fine-scale plant species spatial turnover in semi-natural grasslands	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: Can satellite data be related to fine-scale species diversity and does the integrated use of field and satellite data provide information that can be used in the estimation of fine-scale species diversity in semi-natural grassland sites? Location: The Baltic Island of Oland (Sweden). Methods: Field work including the on-site description of 62 semi-natural grassland sites (represented by three 0.5 m x 0.5 m plots per site) was performed to record response variables (total species richness, mean species richness and species spatial turnover) and field-measured explanatory variables (field-layer height and distance between plots). Within each site, QuickBird satellite data were extracted from a standardized sample area by associating each field plot with a 3 x 3 pixel window (1 pixel = 2.4 m x 2.4 m). Explanatory variables (the normalized difference vegetation index and spectral heterogeneity) were generated from the satellite data. Correlation tests, univariate regressions, variance partitioning and multivariate linear regressions were used to analyse the associations between response and explanatory variables. Results: There was a significant association between the spectral heterogeneity of the near-infrared band and the field-measured spatial turnover of species. The most parsimonious explanatory model for each response variable included both field-measured and satellite-generated explanatory variables. The models explained 30-35% of the variation in species diversity (total richness 36%, mean richness 31%, species turnover 33%). Conclusions: High spatial resolution satellite data are capable of supplying fine-scale habitat information that is relevant for the monitoring and conservation management of fine-scale plant diversity in semi-natural grasslands.

G.; Skidmore, Andrew			The significance of using satellite imagery data only in Ecological Niche Modelling of Iberian herps	ACTA HERPETOLOGICA												The environmental data used to calculate ecological niche models (ENM) are obtained mainly from ground-based maps (e.g., climatic interpolated surfaces). These data are often not available for less developed areas, or may be at an inappropriate scale, and thus to obtain this information requires fieldwork. An alternative source of eco-geographical data comes from satellite imagery. Three sets of ENM were calculated exclusively with variables obtained (1) from optical and radar images only and (2) from climatic and altitude maps obtained by ground-based methods. These models were compared to evaluate whether satellite imagery can accurately generate ENM. These comparisons must be made in areas with well-known species distribution and with available satellite imagery and ground-based data. Thus, the study area was the south-western part of Salamanca (Spain), using amphibian and reptiles as species models. Models' discrimination capacity was measured with ROC plots. Models' covariation was measured with a Spatial Spearman correlation. Four modelling techniques were used (Bioclim, Mahalanobis distance, GARP and Maxent). The results of this comparison showed that there were no significant differences between models generated using remotely sensed imagery or ground-based data. However, the models built with satellite imagery data exhibited a larger diversity of values, probably related to the higher spatial resolution of the satellite imagery. Satellite imagery can produce accurate ENM, independently of the modelling technique or the dataset used. Therefore, biogeographical analysis of species distribution in remote areas can be accurately developed only with variables from satellite imagery.

Dawn of drone ecology: low-cost autonomous aerial vehicles for conservation	TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE												Tropical deforestation continues to be a major driver of biodiversity loss and greenhouse gas emissions. Remote sensing technology is increasingly used to assess changes in forest cover, species distributions and carbon stocks. However, satellite and airborne sensors can be prohibitively costly and inaccessible for researchers in developing countries. Here, we describe the development and use of an inexpensive (<$2,000) unmanned aerial vehicle for surveying and mapping forests and biodiversity (referred to as 'Conservation Drone' hereafter). Our prototype drone is able to fly pre-programmed missions autonomously for a total flight time of similar to 25 minutes and over a distance of similar to 15 km. Non-technical operators can program each mission by defining waypoints along a flight path using an open-source software. This drone can record videos at up to 1080 pixel resolution (high definition), and acquire aerial photographs of <10 cm pixel resolution. Aerial photographs can be stitched together to produce real-time geo-referenced land use/cover maps of surveyed areas. We evaluate the performance of this prototype Conservation Drone based on a series of test flights in Aras Napal, Sumatra, Indonesia. We discuss the further development of Conservation Drone 2.0, which will have a bigger payload and longer range. Initial tests suggest a flight time of similar to 50 minutes and a range of similar to 25 km. Finally, we highlight the potential of this system for environmental and conservation applications, which include near real-time mapping of local land cover, monitoring of illegal forest activities, and surveying of large animal species.

However, most research, pilot-REDD+ projects and carbon certification agencies have focused on deforestation and there appears to be a gap in knowledge on complex mosaic landscapes containing degraded forests, smallholder agriculture, agroforestry and plantations. In this paper we therefore review current research on how avoided forest degradation may affect emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) and expected co-benefits in terms of biodiversity and livelihoods. There are still high uncertainties in measuring and monitoring emissions of carbon and other GHG from mosaic landscapes with forest degradation since most research has focused on binary analyses of forest vs. deforested land. Studies on the impacts of forest degradation on biodiversity contain mixed results and there is little empirical evidence on the influence of REDD+ on local livelihoods and tenure security, partly due to the lack of actual payment schemes. Governance structures are also more complex in landscapes with degraded forests as there are often multiple owners and types of rights to land and trees. Recent technological advances in remote sensing have improved estimation of carbon stock changes but establishment of historic reference levels is still challenged by the availability of sensor systems and ground measurements during the reference period. The inclusion of forest degradation in REDD+ calls for a range of new research efforts to enhance our knowledge of how to assess the impacts of avoided forest degradation. A first step will be to ensure that complex mosaic landscapes can be recognised under REDD+ on their own merits.

J	Ozdemir, I; Mert, A; Senturk, O				Ozdemir, Ibrahim; Mert, Ahmet; Senturk, Ozdemir			PREDICTING LANDSCAPE STRUCTURAL METRICS USING ASTER SATELLITE DATA	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT												The aim of this study was to predict landscape structural metrics using the features extracted from the ASTER multispectral satellite imagery with 15 m spatial resolution. The landscape structural metrics were calculated on the basis of forest map polygons generated from 1:15000 scaled aerial photos by photo-interpretation technique. The landscape metrics and corresponding image features that are texture parameters and segmentation polygons were determined for four different landscape extents. A stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was carried out to identify the most significant image-derived predictors of landscape metrics for each extent. The regression models established for the landscape metrics including the Number of Patches (NUMP), Edge Density (ED), Shannon's Diversity Index (SDI) and Patch Richness (PR) performed moderately with adjusted R-2 values of 0.50 and 0.53 (P < 0.01), indicating that 50-53% of the total variation in these landscape metrics can be explained by image-derived features. By contrast, the regression analyses showed that there were weak relationships between the image features and Interspersion Juxtaposition Index (IJI), and Shannon's Evenness Index (SEI) (adj. R-2 is varied from 0.12 to 0.30, P < 0.01). According to the results of model evaluation, the Entropy measures based on Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) calculated from the infrared and red bands of ASTER were found as the most correlated parameters with the landscape metrics. Besides, the window size (extent) of 81-144 ha (between 900x900 and 1200x1200 m) might be recommended in estimating the landscape metrics using the ASTER or similar satellite imagery. It can be concluded that the 15 m resolution satellite data used for estimating landscape spatial structure cannot replace aerial photos or very high resolution satellite imagery for local-level inventories. However, it might have potential for predicting landscape heterogeneity for large-scale inventories.																	1648-6897						2012	20	2					168	176		10.3846/16486897.2012.688371								WOS:000305146500010

Assessing and promoting old-growthness of forest stands: Lessons from research in Italy	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												Due to a long-standing history of human impact, it is rare to find in Europe old-growth stands associated to primary forests; the term "old-growthness" is more appropriate to assess old-growth forests in European countries: i.e. the degree to which forest stands, which may or may not have been impacted by humans, express the structural variability commonly found in old-growth forests. The paper focuses on operational methods to assess and promote old-growthness in countries, like Italy, where old-growthness detection is a difficult task because of the scarcity of "relatively old" forest stands. Lessons learnt from research experiences carried out in Italy are reviewed; research findings mostly come from unmanaged tracts of previously managed forest stands that have reached structural and compositional traits typical of the mature stage of forest dynamics. A commentary discussion is provided on the following topics: (i) how to operationally assess old-growthness of forest stands, by coupling remote sensing based approaches and snapshot inventories of structural features; (ii) what forest structural attributes appear to be more strictly related to old-growthness in Mediterranean forests and (iii) how to promote old-growthness in managed forest stands. The paper concludes pointing out open research questions and pragmatic considerations for managing forests for old-growthness.

Changes in landuse and landcover along the Dhansiri River channel, Assam - A remote sensing and GIS approach	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA												Information on landuse/landcover change is a critical input for natural resource management policy decisions. Remote sensing data under GIS domain were utilized to evaluate the changes in land-use/land-cover (LU/LC) spanning a period of thirty three years during 1975 to 2008 along the Dhansiri River channel, Assam, India. Seven different types of LU/LC were categorized and out of them cropland was evident as the most important landuse/landcover practices followed by dense mixed jungle in 1975 and the settlement in 2008. Significant reduction (13.02%) in cropland area to settlement was observed. Moreover, teagarden also occupies 0.77% of the total area from cropland and open mixed jungle. The changes in the areas of swampy land as evident from the present study in turn will impact the environmental quality around it and will help to increase the surface run off leading to enhancement of erosion processes. It is believed that the present study will help to contribute towards sustainable land-use planning and management towards protection of extremely rich biodiversity of the North East India with mighty Brahmaputra River system.																	0016-7622					JAN	2012	79	1					61	68		10.1007/s12594-012-0002-6								WOS:000303065000006

The use and meaning of the 'surrogate' concept in ecology and conservation planning contexts is a typical example. Surrogates are entities such as species, environmental variables or habitats, which are used to represent a target entity such as genes, species, ecosystems or related metrics. 'Pattern-based surrogacy' identifies effective surrogates using statistical congruence, while 'selection-based surrogacy' identifies effective surrogates through a notional conservation plan or prioritization analysis where sites are added to a set of protected areas, often using a complementarity criterion between sites. With this clear framework in mind, an investigation of the coral reef literature revealed that most published studies on surrogates of reef biodiversity refer in fact to pattern-based surrogates. Fundamentally, there is nothing wrong with both approaches. However, efficient pattern-based surrogates are often recommended for conservation planning, implying that they could be efficient selection-based surrogates. In fact, efficient pattern-based surrogates are not necessarily efficient selection-based surrogates and vice versa. The reason is the complementarity rules used by selection algorithms. We call for more clarity from authors on the context in which effective surrogates have to be used, and more caution from managers when surrogates are to be used in conservation plans.

Use of airborne LiDAR to delineate canopy degradation and encroachment along the Guatemala-Belize border	TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE												Tropical rainforest clearing and degradation significantly reduces carbon sequestration and increases the rate of biodiversity loss. There has been a concerted international effort to develop remote sensing techniques to monitor broad-scale patterns of forest canopy disturbance. In addition to loss of natural resources, recent deforestation in Mesoamerica threatens historic cultural resources that for centuries lay hidden below the protective canopy. Here, we compare satellite-derived measures of canopy disturbance that occurred over a three decade period since 1980 to those derived from a 2009 airborne LiDAR campaign over the Caracol Archaeological Reserve in western Belize. Scaling up fine-resolution canopy height measures to the 30 m resolution of Landsat Thematic Mapper, we found LiDAR revealed a >58% increase in the extent of canopy disturbance where there was an overlap of the remotely sensed data sources. For the entire archaeological reserve, with the addition of LiDAR, there was a 2.5% increase of degraded canopy than estimated with Landsat alone, indicating that 11.3% of the reserve has been subjected to illegal selective logging and deforestation. Incursions into the reserve from the Guatemala border, represented by LiDAR-detected canopy disturbance, extended 1 km deeper (to 3.5 km) into Belize than were derived with Landsat. Thus, while LiDAR enables a synoptic, never-seen-before, below-canopy view of the Maya city of Caracol, it also reveals the degree of canopy disturbance and potential looting of areas yet to be documented by archaeologists on the ground.																	1940-0829						2012	5	1					12	24		10.1177/194008291200500103								WOS:000303355700003						
J	Rocchini, D; Neteler, M				Rocchini, Duccio; Neteler, Markus			Spectral rank-abundance for measuring landscape diversity	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Investigation of the diversity of a landscape implies finding appropriate measures coupling information on richness and equitability. Most of the papers dealing with remotely sensed images have relied on the richness of digital numbers (DNs) or on Shannon entropy or Pielou evenness indices for measuring their heterogeneity. Instead, based on ecological theory, we will show that rank-abundance diagrams may be profitably used in remote sensing to take into account both spectral richness and spectral equitability at the same time, by using a unique approach. After a theoretical introduction to the problem, we will empirically test the proposed method by extracting DN abundances derived from a Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image representing contrasting landscapes (test sites), plotting the relative abundance of each DN value versus its rank (rank-abundance diagrams) and interpreting statistically and ecologically the achieved results. We do not propose rank-abundance diagrams as a replacement of existing measures of spectral diversity, but as a parallel method to encompass (at the same time) both richness and evenness of remotely sensed images.

In African woodlands, small-scale farming and the need for fuel are thought to be reducing vegetation carbon stocks, but quantification of these processes is hindered by the limitations of optical remote sensing and a lack of ground data. Here, we present a method for mapping vegetation carbon stocks and their changes over a 3-year period in a > 1000 km2 region in central Mozambique at 0.06 ha resolution. L-band synthetic aperture radar imagery and an inventory of 96 plots are combined using regression and bootstrapping to generate biomass maps with known uncertainties. The resultant maps have sufficient accuracy to be capable of detecting changes in forest carbon stocks of as little as 12 MgC ha-1 over 3 years with 95% confidence. This allows characterization of biomass loss from deforestation and forest degradation at a new level of detail. Total aboveground biomass in the study area was reduced by 6.9 +/- 4.6% over 3 years: from 2.13 +/- 0.12 TgC in 2007 to 1.98 +/- 0.11 TgC in 2010, a loss of 0.15 +/- 0.10 TgC. Degradation probably contributed 67% (96.9 +/- 91.0 GgC) of the net loss of biomass, but is associated with high uncertainty. The detailed mapping of carbon stock changes quantifies the nature of small-scale farming. New clearances were on average small (median 0.2 ha) and were often additions to already cleared land. Deforestation events reduced biomass from 33.5 to 11.9 MgC ha-1 on average. Contrary to expectations, we did not find evidence that clearances were targeted towards areas of high biomass. Our method is scalable and suitable for monitoring land cover change and vegetation carbon stocks in woodland ecosystems, and can support policy approaches towards reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD).

The missing wetlands: using local ecological knowledge to find cryptic ecosystems	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Small, temporally dynamic, biologically diverse isolated wetlands are among the most imperiled ecosystems, yet their conservation is hindered by lack of protective legislation and mapping. As part of an effort to better understand isolated wetland ecology in an area undergoing dramatic land use change, we mapped isolated wetlands in South Carolina's Piedmont and Blue Ridge regions using remote sensing and local ecological knowledge (LEK). Remote detection of isolated wetlands was limited by digital resource resolution, topography, and wetland size. LEK was the most useful tool for locating small isolated wetlands. We sampled 10% of the study area using LEK and discovered 44 wetlands with "isolated" characteristics, none of which had been identified by remote sensing. Only 8 of 44 wetlands found through LEK could be identified using remote sensing after their discovery. LEK fills a gap in cryptic ecosystem detection when adequate remotely sensed data are not available. Though effective, using LEK is neither as rapid nor as repeatable as remote sensing. We suggest a two-pronged approach for finding cryptic ecosystems: remote sensing coupled with LEK where data resolution is inadequate. For remote detection of isolated wetlands, we suggest a minimum resolution of 0.33 m for Color Infrared, leaf-off, high-water photography. Despite great advances in remote sensing, data are not uniformly available worldwide and LEK may serve as an effective tool for locating cryptic resources for biodiversity conservation. Mapping cryptic resources will allow for more accurate resource and biodiversity conservation planning under current and future climate scenarios.

Here we present a spatially explicit prediction for coral reef fish diversity index, as well as habitat classification according to reef fish diversity index values in Chinchorro Bank Biosphere Reserve, one of the most important plain/atoll type reef systems in the Caribbean. We have used extensive ecological data on depth, fish and habitat characteristics to perform such prediction. Fish species assemblages and different biotic variables of benthic organisms were characterized using visual censuses and video-transects, respectively at 119 sampling stations. The information was integrated in a GIS, along with satellite imagery (LANSDAT 7 ETM+) and a digital bathymetric model. From the recorded data and a hierarchical classification procedure, we obtained nine different classes of habitats. We used a generalized regression analysis and spatial prediction methodology to create predictive maps (GIS layers) of the different reef benthic components, and a second modeling run produced predictive maps of coral reef fish diversity index. Predictive accuracy of the diversity index map presented a good correlation coefficient (r = 0.87), with maximum diversity index values en reefscapes composed of aggregation of coral colonies with seagrass beds. The implementation of our application was successful for the prediction of fish diversity hot spots and surrogate habitats.

In a novel approach, we used a long-term time series including historical map data to predict the influence of one century of tropical forest change on keystone species or indicator groups in the Kakamega-Nandi forests, western Kenya. Four time steps of land cover data between 1912/13 and 2003, derived from Landsat satellite imagery, aerial photography and old topographic maps, formed the basis for extrapolating species abundance data on the army ant Dorylus wilverthi, the guild of ant-following birds and three habitat guilds of birds differing in forest dependency. To predict the species' spatio-temporal distribution, we combined spatially explicit geographical information system (GIS)-based modelling with statistical modelling, that is, ordinary least square (OLS) regression models for D. wilverthi and simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models for ant-following birds. We directly related bird habitat guilds to five forest classes as distinguished in the land cover time series. Extrapolation results over time predict dramatic losses in abundance for D. wilverthi (56%), ant-following birds (58%) and forest bird individuals in general (47%) due to a forest loss of 31% and small-scale fragmentation within the past century. Extrapolations based on a scenario of further deforestation revealed the negative consequences of clearing and splitting up continuous forest into isolated patches, whereas a reforestation scenario suggests the positive impact of natural forest regrowth and indigenous-tree planting. This study demonstrates the high potential of integrating remotesensing and field-based faunal data for landscape-scale quantitative assessments over time. In addition, it shows the suitability of extrapolation studies for evaluating measures of forest conservation.

Mapping coffee plantations with Landsat imagery: an example from El Salvador	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Considering the potential of shaded coffee plantations mixed with natural vegetation for promoting biodiversity conservation, this project assessed the utility of multi-date Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite imagery for the characterization of natural vegetation versus coffee plantations in western El Salvador. For assembling a multi-temporal Landsat TM data set, we applied a regression analysis model to remove cloud cover and cloud shadows. Then, through a hybrid classification approach, a nine-class land use/land cover (LULC) map was generated. We identified two types of coffee plantations ('open-canopy' and 'close-canopy') along with natural forest/shrubland, mangrove, water bodies, sandy coastal soils, bare soil, urban areas and agriculture. Notwithstanding the small sample size of the accuracy data, our assessment revealed an overall accuracy of 76.7% (Kappa coefficient = 0.68), considering only the four classes with independent field data. The overall classification accuracy for distinguishing coffee plantations from non-mangrove natural forest was 81.6% and the classification accuracy for distinguishing 'open-canopy' from 'close-canopy' coffee plantations was 85.7%. We are encouraged by the results of this prototype study. They indicate that remote-sensing techniques can be used to distinguish different classes of coffee production systems and to differentiate coffee from natural forest.																	0143-1161						2012	33	1					220	242		10.1080/01431161.2011.591442								WOS:000298946600013

In this paper, we present the results of multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis applied to Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIs) imagery, comparing affects of seasonality and spectral resolution on the discrimination of soil, grass/forb, and sagebrush abundance in Yellowstone National Park. Our results showed that AVIRIS, despite late season phenology, correlated well with herbaceous and sagebrush cover field measurements (R(2) = 0.77 and 0.75, respectively), utilizing high spectral resolution to separate soils from vegetation. However, ASTER-derived values during peak green correlated best with field measurements (0.75 and 0.78). These results demonstrated an effective method to monitor semi-arid regions with readily available imagery and highlight applications for future hyperspectral satellite missions.																	0099-1112					JAN	2012	78	1					23	33		10.14358/PERS.78.1.23								WOS:000298867600001

Estimating life-form cover fractions in California sage scrub communities using multispectral remote sensing	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The California sage scrub (CSS) community type in California's Mediterranean-type ecosystems is known for its high biodiversity and is home to a large number of rare, threatened, and endangered species. Because of extensive urban development in the past fifty years, this ecologically significant community type is highly degraded and fragmented. To conserve endangered CSS communities, monitoring internal conditions of communities is as crucial as monitoring distributions of the community type in the region. Vegetation type mapping and field sampling of individual plants provide ecologically meaningful information about CSS communities such as spatial distribution and species compositions, respectively. However, both approaches only provide spatially comprehensive information but no information about internal conditions or vice versa. Therefore, there is a need for monitoring variables which fill the information gap between vegetation type maps and field-based data. A number of field-based studies indicate that life-form fractional cover is an effective indicator of CSS community health and habitat quality for CSS-obligated species. This study investigates the effectiveness of remote sensing approaches for estimating fractional cover of true shrub, subshrub, herb, and bare ground in CSS communities of southern California. Combinations of four types of multispectral imagery ranging from 0.15 m resolution scanned color infrared aerial photography to 10 m resolution SPOT 5 multispectral imagery and three image processing models - per-pixel, object-based, and spectral mixture models - were tested. An object-based image analysis (OBIA) routine consistently yielded higher accuracy than other image processing methods for estimating all cover types. Life-form cover was reliably predicted, with error magnitudes as low as 2%. Subshrub and herb cover types required finer spatial resolution imagery for more accurate predictions than true shrub and bare ground types. Positioning of sampling grids had a substantial impact on the reliability of accuracy assessment, particularly for cover estimates predicted using multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) applied to SPOT imagery. Of the approaches tested in this study, OBIA using pansharpened QuickBird imagery is one of the most promising approaches because of its high accuracy and processing efficiency and should be tested for more heterogeneous CSS landscapes. MESMA applied to SPOT imagery should also be examined for effectiveness in estimating factional cover over more extensive habitat areas because of its low data cost and potential for conducting retrospective studies of vegetation community conditions.

Snow-covered Landsat time series stacks improve automated disturbance mapping accuracy in forested landscapes	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Accurate landscape-scale maps of forests and associated disturbances are critical to augment studies on biodiversity, ecosystem services, and the carbon cycle, especially in terms of understanding how the spatial and temporal complexities of damage sustained from disturbances influence forest structure and function. Vegetation change tracker (VCT) is a highly automated algorithm that exploits the spectral-temporal properties of summer Landsat time series stacks (LTSSs) to generate spatially explicit maps of forest and recent forest disturbances. VCT performs well in contiguous forest landscapes with closed or nearly closed canopies, but often incorrectly classifies large patches of land as forest or forest disturbance in the complex and spatially heterogeneous environments that typify fragmented forest landscapes. We introduce an improved version of VCT (dubbed VCTw) that incorporates a nonforest mask derived from snow-covered winter Landsat time series stacks (LTSSw) and compare it with VCT across nearly 25 million ha of land in the Lake Superior (Canada, USA) and Lake Michigan (USA) drainage basins. Accuracy assessments relying on 87 primary sampling units (PSUs) and 2640 secondary sampling units (SSUs) indicated that VCT performed with an overall accuracy of 86.3%. For persisting forest, the commission error was 14.7% and the omission error was 4.3%. Commission and omission errors for the two forest disturbance classes fluctuated around 50%. VCTw produced a statistically significant increase in overall accuracy to 91.2% and denoted about 1.115 million ha less forest (-.371 million ha disturbed and -0.744 million ha persisting). For persisting forest, the commission error decreased to 9.3% and the omission error was relatively unchanged at 5.0%. Commission errors decreased considerably to near 22% and omission errors remained near 50% in both forest disturbance classes. Dividing the assessments into three geographic strata demonstrated that the most dramatic improvement occurred across the southern half of the Lake Michigan basin, which contains a highly fragmented agricultural landscape and relatively sparse deciduous forest, although substantial improvements occurred in other geographic strata containing little agricultural land, abundant wetlands, and extensive coniferous forest. Unlike VCT, VCTw also generally corresponded well with field-based estimates of forest cover in each stratum. Snow-covered winter imagery appears to be a valuable resource for improving automated disturbance mapping accuracy. About 34% of the world's forests receive sufficient snowfall to cover the ground and are potentially suitable for VCTw; other season-based techniques may be worth pursuing for the remaining 66%.

M.; Rifai, Sami W.; Higuchi, Niro; Roberts, Dar			Detection of subpixel treefall gaps with Landsat imagery in Central Amazon forests	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Treefall gaps play important roles in both forest dynamics and species diversity, but variability across the full range of gap sizes has not been reported at a regional scale due to the lack of a consistent methodology for their detection. Here we demonstrate the sensitivity of Landsat data for detecting gaps at the subpixel level in the Manaus region, Central Amazon. Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) on treefall gaps was used to map their occurrence across a 3.4 x 10(4) km(2) landscape using the annual change in non-photosynthetic vegetation (Delta NPV) as the change metric. Thirty randomly selected pixels with a spectral signature of a treefall event (i.e. high Delta NPV) were surveyed in the field. The most frequent single-pixel gap size detected using Landsat was similar to 360 m(2), and the severity of the disturbance (Delta NPV) exhibited a significant (r(2) = 0.32, p = 0.001) correlation with the number of dead trees (>10 cm diameter at breast height), enabling quantification of the number of downed trees in each gap. To place the importance of these single-pixel disturbances into a broader context, the cumulative disturbance of these gaps was equivalent to 40% of the calculated deforestation across the Manaus region in 2008. Most detected single-pixel gaps consisted of six to eight downed trees covering an estimated area of 250-900 m(2). These results highlight the quantitative importance of small blowdowns that have been overlooked in previous satellite remote sensing studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Patterns of protection and threats along productivity gradients in Canada	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Productivity is an important driver of broad-scale diversity gradients and community composition. Surprisingly, it is rarely used as a biodiversity proxy in protected area network assessments. In this research, we evaluate if biases exist in the locations of Canada's protected areas with respect to productivity and assess the distribution of anthropogenic threats to protection along productivity and topographic axes. Productivity was expressed as the annual minimum and integrated fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR) and related seasonality (defined as variation in fPAR over a year), as acquired by remote sensing. Results indicate that, overall, protected areas are slightly biased to lower productivities (higher seasonalities), but are relatively unbiased along elevation. Sites at high elevations, high seasonalities, or low productivities are extremely well represented, but they account for a very small proportion of Canada's area overall and under protection. However, the productivity characteristics of protected areas are heterogeneous across reserve characteristics and space; biases are greater and more variable when considering individual International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) categories, protected area size classes, or ecozones. The spatial and environmental correlates of anthropogenic pressures (proximity of roads and settlements in the greater park ecosystem) to protected areas in the forested ecozones were evaluated with partial linear regression models. Threats were strongly spatially structured. Reserve characteristics (productivity, elevation, size, IUCN category) shared about half of this spatial structure, explaining similar to 25% of the variation in threat distributions. Small and productive protected areas tended to occur closer to human populations and roads, respectively, and are thus expected to face greater threats to biodiversity. High-elevation protected areas generally occurred farther from both roads and settlements. Systematic patterns between productivity, reserve size and management goals, and anthropogenic disturbances suggest that the most productive, biodiverse areas may not yet be sufficiently protected. These analyses highlight considerations for the management of existing parks and the expansion of Canada's protected area network. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Remote Sensing-Based Assessment of Fire Danger Conditions Over Boreal Forest	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												Forest fire is an integral part in many forested ecosystems including boreal forests, that influences forest productivity, biodiversity and socio-economy, among others. In this paper, we evaluated the potential of three selected satellite (i.e., MODIS)based variables/indices at 8-day temporal resolution, i.e., surface temperature (T-S), normalized multiband drought index (NMDI) and temperature vegetation wetness index (TVWI) in predicting/forecasting the fire danger conditions over boreal forest regions of Alberta during the period 2006-2008. The method was based on the assumption that the fire danger conditions during i+1 period would be high if the instantaneous values of: (i) T-S values were either higher or equal; or (ii) NMDI or TVWI values were either lower or equal; with compare to their respective study-area-specific average during i period. The analyses were conducted on the basis of either individual variable or combining all of the three together. We found that 60.59% for T-S, 72.41% for NMDI, and 54.19% for TVWI of fires fell under the high fire danger conditions. The combination of all of the three individual variables, it revealed that 91.63% of the fires fell in the categories of "very high" (i.e., all three variables indicated high danger), "high" (i.e., at least two of them indicated high danger), and "moderate" (i.e., at least one of the variables indicated high danger) fire danger classes. These results showed that the applicability of the proposed method in predicting fire danger conditions over the boreal forest regions.

Viability status of biosphere reserves in Sri Lanka	JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF SRI LANKA												Viability refers to the ability of a species to persist for many generations or a community / ecological system to persist over some specified time period. The natural vegetation is the matrix in which the biological diversity at ecosystem, species and genetic levels is developed and sustained, and therefore the viability of the natural vegetation is critical for biodiversity conservation and management. There are 29 sites listed as Biosphere Reserves in Sri Lanka, including four International Biosphere Reserves (IBR), while two more sites are in the process of being proposed as IBRs. During the recently conducted Protected Area Gap Analysis in Sri Lanka exercise, the viability status for all natural vegetation sites was assessed using condition, area and landscape criteria, viz, habitat condition, area, wilderness, shape and isolation. One of the most significant challenges in the application of these criteria is factoring in the large-scale changes brought about to those communities and ecological systems by anthropogenic disturbance that has occurred in the past. Satellite Remote Sensing and GIS (RS/GIS) techniques were used to assess and characterize the site viability. The sites were ranked for viability into four categories, viz. Very Good, Good, Fair and Poor, and colour-coded for easy reference by the conservation authorities and managers. Using RS/GIS technology, the biosphere reserves were separated from other protected areas and overlaid with the viability status map of the Gap Analysis to determine their viability. Thus, a map showing biosphere reserves that also indicates the individual viability status in four-coloured categories was generated. The final product is expected to be useful to the conservation managers for planning, prioritizing and formulating management plans for biosphere reserves in Sri Lanka.																	1391-4588	2362-0161				DEC	2011	39	4					303	319										WOS:000298725200003

L.; Sharma, Narpati			Assessing the Priorities for Sustainable Forest Management in the Sikkim Himalaya, India: A Remote Sensing Based Approach	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Sikkim is a small, mountainous, Indian state (7,096 km(2)) located in the eastern Himalayan region. Though a global biodiversity hotspot, it has been relatively less studied. A detailed forest type, density and change dynamics study was undertaken, using SATELLITE remote sensing data and intensive field verification. The landscape was found to be dominated by alpine and nival ecosystems, with a large portion above the tree line, considerable snow cover, and a sizeable area under forest cover (72%, 5,094 km(2)). A total of 18 landscape components including 14 vegetation classes were delineated, with the major ones being oak forest, alpine meadow, alpine scrub, conifer forest and alder-cardamom agro-forestry. Of the 3,154 km(2) of forests below the tree line, 40% were found to be dense (> 40% tree canopy cover). A sizeable portion of the non dense forests below the tree line was contributed by the degradation of oak forests, which was confirmed by change detection analysis. However on a positive front over the past decade, ban on grazing and felling of trees in forests has been implemented. In order to expand the extent of dense forests, further efforts are needed for the restoration of oak forests such as fire protection, providing alternatives to firewood use, promotion of alder-cardamom agro-forestry in the private lands and protection of the small-sized, fragmented forest patches in the subtropical belt.																	0255-660X					DEC	2011	39	4					555	564		10.1007/s12524-011-0110-6								WOS:000297857300013						
J	Arekhi, S				Arekhi, Saleh			Modeling spatial pattern of deforestation using GIS and logistic regression: A case study of northern Ilam forests, Ilam province, Iran	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY												This study aimed to predict spatial distribution of deforestation and detects factors influencing forest degradation of Northern forests of Ilam province. For this purpose, effects of six factors including distance from road and settlement areas, forest fragmentation index, elevation, slope and distance from the forest edge on the forest deforestation were studied. In order to evaluate the changes in forest, images related to TM1988, ETM(+)2001 and ETM(+)2007 were processed and classified. There are two classes as, forest and non-forest in order to assess deforestation factors. The logistic regression method is used for modeling and estimating the spatial distribution of deforestation. The results show that about 19,294 ha from forest areas are deforested in the 19 years. Modeling results also indicate that more deforestation occurred in the fragmented forest cover and in the areas of proximity to forest/non forest edge. Furthermore, slope and distance from road and settlement areas had negative relationships with deforestation rates. Meanwhile, deforestation rate is decreased with increase in elevation. Finally, a simple spatial model is presented that is able to predict the location of deforestation by using logistic regression. The validation was also tested using ROC approach which was found to be 0.96.																	1684-5315					NOV 16	2011	10	72					16236	16249		10.5897/AJB11.1122								WOS:000298557500017

To understand changes and trends in terrestrial ecosystems and their functioning as carbon sources and sinks, and to characterize the impact of their changes on climate, habitat and biodiversity, new space assets are urgently needed to produce high spatial resolution global maps of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of vegetation, its biomass above ground, the carbon stored within and the implications for atmospheric green house gas concentrations and climate. These needs were articulated in a 2007 National Research Council (NRC) report (NRC, 2007) recommending a new satellite mission, DESDynI, carrying an L-band Polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar (Pol-SAR) and a multi-beam lidar (light RAnging And Detection) operating at 1064 nm. The objectives of this paper are to articulate the importance of these new, multi-year, 3D vegetation structure and biomass measurements, to briefly review the feasibility of radar and lidar remote sensing technology to meet these requirements, to define the data products and measurement requirements, and to consider implications of mission durations. The paper addresses these objectives by synthesizing research results and other input from a broad community of terrestrial ecology, carbon cycle, and remote sensing scientists and working groups. We conclude that: (1) Current global biomass and 3-D vegetation structure information is unsuitable for both science and management and policy. The only existing global datasets of biomass are approximations based on combining land cover type and representative carbon values, instead of measurements of actual biomass. Current measurement attempts based on radar and multispectral data have low explanatory power outside low biomass areas. There is no current capability for repeatable disturbance and regrowth estimates. (2) The science and policy needs for information on vegetation 3D structure can be successfully addressed by a mission capable of producing (i) a first global inventory of forest biomass with a spatial resolution 1 km or finer and unprecedented accuracy (ii) annual global disturbance maps at a spatial resolution of 1 ha with subsequent biomass accumulation rates at resolutions of 1 km or finer, and (iii) transects of vertical and horizontal forest structure with 30 m along-transect measurements globally at 25 m spatial resolution, essential for habitat characterization. We also show from the literature that lidar profile samples together with wall-to-wall L-band quad-pol-SAR imagery and ecosystem dynamics models can work together to satisfy these vegetation 3D structure and biomass measurement requirements. Finally we argue that the technology readiness levels of combined pol-SAR and lidar instruments are adequate for space flight. Remaining to be worked out, are the particulars of a lidar/pol-SAR mission design that is feasible and at a minimum satisfies the information and measurement requirement articulated herein.

J	Amici, V				Amici, Valerio			Dealing with vagueness in complex forest landscapes: A soft classification approach through a niche-based distribution model	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												The increasing interest in biodiversity conservation has led to the development of new approaches to facilitate ecologically based conservation policies and management plans. in this context, the development of effective methods for the classification of forest types constitutes a crucial issue as forests represent the most widespread vegetation structure and play a key role in ecosystem functioning. In this study a maximum entropy approach (Maxent) to forest type classification in a complex Mediterranean area, has been investigated. Maxent, a niche-based model of species/habitat distribution, allowed researchers to estimate the potential distribution of four forest types: Holm oak, Mixed oak, Mixed broadleaved and Riparian forests. The Maxent model's internal tests have proved a powerful tool for estimating the model's accuracy and analyzing the effects of the most important variables in the produced models. Moreover the comparison with a spectral response-based fuzzy classification, showed a higher accuracy in the Maxent outputs, demonstrating how the use of environmental variables, combined with spectral information in the classification of natural or semi-natural land cover classes, improves map accuracies. The modeling approach followed by this study, taking into account the uncertainty proper of the natural ecosystems and the use of environmental variables in land cover classification, can represent a useful approach to making more efficient and effective field inventories and to developing effective conservation policies.

J	Stevens, K; Campbell, L; Urquhart, G; Kramer, D; Qi, JG				Stevens, Kara; Campbell, Lindsay; Urquhart, Gerald; Kramer, Dan; Qi, Jiaguo			Examining complexities of forest cover change during armed conflict on Nicaragua's Atlantic Coast	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												The effects of armed conflict on biodiversity are an emerging concern in conservation due in part to the occurrence of war in biodiversity hotspots, though few studies have addressed it. We investigate this topic by examining changes in forest cover on the Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua from 1978 to 1993, a period covering their civil war. We predict an increase in forest cover between pre- and post-conflict periods as residents abandoned agriculture plots and migrated from conflict areas. We used a remote sensing approach to detect changes in forest cover area and fragmentation at two study sites. Results confirmed that in the first 5-7 years of the conflict, reforestation was greater than deforestation, but in the latter years of the conflict deforested land almost doubled that which was reforested. Although some forest loss was due to Category 4 Hurricane Joan, several conflict-related factors were partially responsible for these results, such as mass human migration and land reform. Understanding how and why forest cover changes during periods of conflict can help conservationists protect resources both during war and in the tumultuous period following the cessation of violence when nascent governments lack the power to effectively govern and community institutions are fractured by war. In areas where the livelihoods of people are directly dependent on local resources, anticipating ecological and social impacts can help improve future conservation efforts.																	0960-3115					NOV	2011	20	12					2597	2613		10.1007/s10531-011-0093-1								WOS:000297200000004

How, and how much, natural cover loss increases species richness	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim The species-area relationship has been applied in the conservation context to predict monotonic species richness declines as natural area is converted to human-dominated land covers. However, some conversion of natural cover could introduce new habitat types and allow new open habitat species to occur. Moreover, decelerating richness-area relationships suggest that, as natural area is converted to human-dominated covers, more species will be added to the rare habitat than are lost from the common one. Area effects and increased habitat diversity could each lead to a peaked relationship between species richness and the relative amount of natural area. The purpose of this study is to quantify the effect on avian species richness of conversion of natural area to human-dominated land cover. Location Ontario, Canada. Methods We evaluated the responses of total avian richness, forest bird richness and open habitat bird richness to remaining natural area within 993 quadrats, each of 100 km(2). We quantified the amount of natural land cover and land-cover heterogeneity using remote sensing data. We used structural equation modelling (SEM) to disentangle the relationships among avian richness, natural area and land-cover heterogeneity. Results Spatial variation in avian richness was a peaked function of remaining natural area, such that losses of up to 44% of the natural area increased avian richness. This partly reflects increased variety of land cover; however, SEM suggests that much of the increase in richness is due to pure area effects. Richness of forest species declined by two species over this range of natural cover loss while open habitat bird richness increased by approximately 20 species. The effect of natural area on species richness is consistent with the sum of species-area curves for natural habitat species and human-dominated habitat species. Main conclusions At least in northern temperate forests, almost half of the natural land cover can be converted to human-dominated forms before avian richness declines. Conversion of < 50% of regional natural area to human-dominated land cover can benefit open-area species richness with relatively few losses of forest obligate species. However, with > 50% natural area conversion, species begin to drop out of regional assemblages.

Estimating aboveground biomass in forest and oil palm plantation in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo using ALOS PALSAR data	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Conversion of tropical forests to oil palm plantations in Malaysia and Indonesia has resulted in large-scale environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity and significant carbon emissions. For both countries to participate in the United Nation's REDD (Reduced Emission from Deforestation and Degradation) mechanism, assessment of forest carbon stocks, including the estimated loss in carbon from conversion to plantation, is needed. In this study, we use a combination of field and remote sensing data to quantify both the magnitude and the geographical distribution of carbon stock in forests and timber plantations, in Sabah, Malaysia, which has been the site of significant expansion of oil palm cultivation over the last two decades. Forest structure data from 129 ha of research and inventory plots were used at different spatial scales to discriminate forest biomass across degradation levels. Field data was integrated with ALOS PALSAR (Advanced Land-Observing Satellite Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) imagery to both discriminate oil palm plantation from forest stands, with an accuracy of 97.0% (kappa = 0.64) and predict AGB using regression analysis of HV-polarized PALSAR data (R-2 = 0.63, p <.001). Direct estimation of AGB from simple regression models was sensitive to both environmental conditions and forest structure. Precipitation effect on the backscatter data changed the HV prediction of AGB significantly (R-2 = 0.21, p <.001), and scattering from large leaves of mature palm trees significantly impeded the use of a single HV-based model for predicting AGB in palm oil plantations. Multi-temporal SAR data and algorithms based on forest types are suggested to improve the ability of a sensor similar to ALOS PALSAR for accurately mapping and monitoring forest biomass, now that the ALOS PALSAR sensor is no longer operational.

However, significant challenges remain when seeking to integrate multiple functions into priority-oriented planning. In this paper, we focus on the city of Wuhan (China) to present an innovative approach for developing multi-functional greenway networks. Based on remote sensing and geographical information systems, this approach applies a least-cost path model, a kernel density analysis and a proxy index to identify and integrate multiple needs into priority greenway networks. Our priorities are bird and small mammal conservation, human recreation and water protection. In the cost settings of the least-cost path model, we include simulated construction costs to realistically identify corridors. This method insures that our results reflect the expenses necessary for the construction of greenways. Our study demonstrates that the kernel density method is an effective tool to illustrate priorities by revealing the potential utilisation intensity of corridors. Based on the proposed method, we identify eight potential greenway networks, each highlighting different sets of priorities. We divide these priority greenway networks into three categories of ecological security: ideal greenways, backbone greenways and the comprehensive greenway network. The latter represents the integration of animal conservation, human recreation and water protection objectives. Because priorities can be added, interchanged or weighted according to local specificities, our study offers a methodological framework applicable to developing and developed cities.

J	Feilhauer, H; Faude, U; Schmidtlein, S				Feilhauer, Hannes; Faude, Ulrike; Schmidtlein, Sebastian			Combining Isomap ordination and imaging spectroscopy to map continuous floristic gradients in a heterogeneous landscape	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Mapping requires a meaningful generalization of information. For vegetation maps, classification is frequently used to generalize the species composition of (semi-)natural plant assemblages. As an alternative to classification, ordination methods aim to extract major floristic gradients describing the prevailing compositional variation in a floristic data set as metric variables. This ability has been used previously to derive gradient maps of homogeneous landscapes that show plant species composition in continuous fields. In the present study, gradient mapping was used in a more heterogeneous landscape with intricate environmental gradients and higher variation in vegetation physiognomy. Since established ordination methods may have difficulties to cope with the highly variable plant species composition, we tested the novel method Isometric Feature Mapping (Isomap) against conventional methods (Detrended Correspondence Analysis and Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling). The resulting floristic gradients were related to hyperspectral imagery (HyMap) using partial least squares regression (PLSR) and subsequently mapped. Prediction uncertainties are provided as additional map. Isomap was able to preserve 74% of the original variation inherent to the floristic data set in a three-dimensional solution. This was considerably more than the established techniques achieved. The PLSR models for the floristic gradients extracted with Isomap showed model fits ranging from R(2) = 0.59 to R(2) = 0.73 in calibration and from R(2) = 0.55 to R(2) = 0.69 in tenfold cross-validation. The resulting gradient map provides detailed information on compositional vegetation patterns. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We examine the application of an unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis to phytoplankton pigment data and spectra of the absorption coefficient and remote-sensing reflectance with the aim of discriminating different phytoplankton assemblages in open ocean environments under non-bloom conditions. This technique is applied to an optical and phytoplankton pigment data set collected at several stations within the eastern Atlantic Ocean, where the surface total chlorophyll-a concentration (TChla) ranged from 0.11 to 0.62 mg m(-3). Stations were selected on the basis of significant differences in the ratios of the two most dominant accessory pigments relative to TChla, as derived from High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis. The performance of cluster analysis applied to absorption and remote-sensing spectra is evaluated by comparisons with the cluster partitioning of the corresponding HPLC pigment data, in which the pigment-based clusters serve as a reference for identifying different phytoplankton assemblages. Two indices, cophenetic and Rand, are utilized in these comparisons to quantify the degree of similarity between pigmentbased and optical-based clusters. The use of spectral derivative analysis for the optical data was also evaluated, and sensitivity tests were conducted to determine the influence of parameters used in these calculations (spectral range, smoothing filter size, and band separation). The results of our analyses indicate that the second derivative calculated from hyperspectral (1 nm resolution) data of the phytoplankton absorption coefficient, a(ph)(lambda), and remote-sensing reflectance, R-rs(lambda), provide better discrimination of phytoplanIcton pigment assemblages than traditional multispectral band-ratios or ordinary (non-differentiated) hyperspectral data of absorption and remote-sensing reflectance. The most useful spectral region for this discrimination extends generally from wavelengths of about 425-435 nm to wavelengths within the 495-540 nm range, although in the case of phytoplankton absorption data a broader spectral region can also provide satisfactory results.

This study uses net primary productivity (NPP) as an important indicator of the reservoir ecosystem's productivity to estimate the impacts of the TGP in the local resettlement region of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA) over the 2000-2010 period. The modeling method is based upon the Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (CASA) terrestrial carbon model and uses Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing data for modeling simulation. The results demonstrate that total NPP in the resettlement region decreased by 8.0% (632.8 Gg) from 2000 to 2010. The impact of the TGP on NPP is mainly mediated by land-use change brought about by the large-scale inundation of land and subsequent massive resettlement of both rural and urban residents. Nearby resettlement, land inundation, and relocation of old urban centers and affiliated urban dwellers are responsible for 54.3%, 28.0%, and 5.8% respectively of total NPP reduction in the resettlement region over the study period. The major national ecological projects implemented in the TGRA since 1998 have played a key role in offsetting the negative impacts of the TGP on NPP in the region. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Using satellite and field data, we assessed the area deforested by industrial-scale high-yield oil palm expansion in the Peruvian Amazon from 2000 to 2010, finding that 72% of new plantations expanded into forested areas. In a focus area in the Ucayali region, we assessed deforestation for high-and smallholder low-yield oil palm plantations. Low-yield plantations accounted for most expansion overall (80%), but only 30% of their expansion involved forest conversion, contrasting with 75% for high-yield expansion. High-yield expansion minimized the total area required to achieve production but counter-intuitively at higher expense to forests than low-yield plantations. The results show that high-yield agriculture is an important but insufficient strategy to reduce pressure on forests. We suggest that high-yield agriculture can be effective in sparing forests only if coupled with incentives for agricultural expansion into already cleared lands.

ORYX												Human-elephant conflict in India, driven by habitat loss and an expanding human population, is a complex challenge for biodiversity conservation. Determining if, how and why this conflict has changed over time will be an important step towards managing landscapes where people and elephants Elephas maxim us coexist. This study combines social surveys and remote sensing data to analyse patterns in human-elephant conflict and land-use change over time. The reported experience of conflict increased dramatically in the early 1980s, with 85% of those surveyed indicating that conflict began after 1980. The expansion of conflict showed a significant southward trend and was associated with forest cover dropping below 30-40%. Based on our results we propose that a critical habitat threshold for human-elephant conflict may exist at 30-40% forest cover. Below this level, conflict expanded across the landscape. The existence of such a deforestation threshold may have important implications for landscape management in elephant range states that seek to avoid or mitigate further conflict. Maintenance of remaining forest areas, reforestation, and the creation of habitat corridors are strategies that could help prevent further expansion of conflict.

In this study, we sought (1) to understand the influence of changes in maps' spatial and spectral resolution of agricultural landscape elements, taking hedgerow networks as a case study, and (2) to explore how predictions of species distribution might be affected by maps' resolutions, taking two carabid species as a case study. To do so, we compared maps from different remote sensors, derived two landscape characterization variables from the maps related to patterns known to drive ecological processes, and analyzed their predictive power on biological data distribution to assess the information content of these maps. The results show that (1) the use of several methods, including landscape metrics, was useful to assess map validity; (2) the spatial resolution of satellite images is not the only important factor; changes in spectral resolution significantly alter maps; (3) the relevant definition of "hedgerow" to construct functional maps is species and process specific; thus the different maps are not either good or bad, but rather provide complementary information; (4) the more a species responds to network structure and over small areas, the less the different maps can be substitutable one to another.

Influence of landscape context on the abundance and diversity of bees in Mediterranean olive groves	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH												The diversity and abundance of wild bees ensures the delivery of pollination services and the maintenance of ecosystem diversity. As previous studies carried out in Central Europe and the US have shown, bee diversity and abundance is influenced by the structure and the composition of the surrounding landscape. Comparable studies have so far not been carried out in the Mediterranean region. The present study examines the influence of Mediterranean landscape context on the diversity and abundance of wild bees. To do this, we sampled bees in 13 sites in olive groves on Lesvos Island, Greece. Bees were assigned to five categories consisting of three body size groups (small, medium and large bees), the single most abundant bee species (Lasioglossum marginatum) and all species combined. The influence of the landscape context on bee abundance and species richness was assessed at five radii (250, 500, 750, 1000 and 1250 m) from the centre of each site. We found that the abundance within bee groups was influenced differently by different landscape parameters and land covers, whereas species richness was unaffected. Generally, smaller bees' abundance was impacted by landscape parameters at smaller scales and larger bees at larger scales. The land cover that influenced bee abundance positively was olive grove, while phrygana, conifer forest, broad-leaved forest, cultivated land, rock, urban areas and sea had mostly negative or no impact. We stress the need for a holistic approach, including all land covers, when assessing the effects of landscape context on bee diversity and abundance in the Mediterranean.

J	Mondal, P; Nagendra, H				Mondal, Pinki; Nagendra, Harini			Trends of Forest Dynamics in Tiger Landscapes Across Asia	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Protected areas (PAs) are cornerstones of biodiversity conservation, but small parks alone cannot support wide-ranging species, such as the tiger. Hence, forest dynamics in the surrounding landscapes of PAs are also important to tiger conservation. Tiger landscapes often support considerable human population in proximity of the PA, sometimes within the core itself, and thus are subject to various land use activities (such as agricultural expansion and road development) driving habitat loss and fragmentation. We synthesize information from 27 journal articles in 24 tiger landscapes to assess forest-cover dynamics in tiger-range countries. Although 29% of the PAs considered in this study have negligible change in overall forest cover, approximately 71% are undergoing deforestation and fragmentation. Approximately 58% of the total case studies have human settlements within the core area. Most changes-including agricultural expansion, plantation, and farming (52%), fuelwood and fodder collection (43%), logging (38%), grazing (38%), and tourism and development (10%)-can be attributed to human impacts largely linked to the nature of the management regime. This study highlights the need for incorporating new perspectives, ideas, and lessons learned locally and across borders into management plans to ensure tiger conservation in landscapes dominated by human activities. Given the increasing isolation of most parks due to agricultural, infrastructural, and commercial developments at the periphery, it is imperative to conduct planning and evaluation at the landscape level, as well as incorporate multiple actors and institutions in planning, instead of focusing solely on conservation within the PAs as is currently the case in most tiger parks.

Decadal trends in net ecosystem production and net ecosystem carbon balance for a regional socioecological system	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Carbon sequestration is increasingly recognized as an ecosystem service, and forest management has a large potential to alter regional carbon fluxes - notably by way of harvest removals and related impacts on net ecosystem production (NEP). In the Pacific Northwest region of the US, the implementation of the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) in 1993 established a regional socioecological system focused on forest management. The NWFP resulted in a large (82%) decrease in the rate of harvest removals on public forest land, thus significantly impacting the regional carbon balance. Here we use a combination of remote sensing and ecosystem modeling to examine the trends in NEP and net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) in this region over the 1985-2007 period, with particular attention to land ownership since management now differs widely between public and private forestland. In the late 1980s, forestland in both ownership classes was subject to high rates of harvesting, and consequently the land was a carbon source (i.e. had a negative NECB). After the policy driven reduction in the harvest level, public forestland became a large carbon sink - driven in part by increasing NEP - whereas private forestland was close to carbon neutral. In the 2003-2007 period, the trend towards carbon accumulation on public lands continued despite a moderate increase in the extent of wildfire. The NWFP was originally implemented in the context of biodiversity conservation, but its consequences in terms of carbon sequestration are also of societal interest. Ultimately, management within the NWFP socioecological system will have to consider trade-offs among these and other ecosystem services. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However there is an increasing recognition that transformation of the native herbaceous ground layer to exotic species is an equally important element of vegetation loss. In grass-dominated vegetation, the ground layer contains most of the plant diversity and hence its condition is critical for maintaining the ecological function of grasslands and woodlands. However, decades of fertiliser use have transformed native pastures to exotic dominance and there is a need for regional-scale ground layer condition assessment. We used time-series Landsat 5 imagery, combined with rainfall and soil moisture data, and coupled with site-based soil phosphorus data to develop assessments of ground layer nutrient status from spectral indices. We found significant relationships between soil available phosphorus and NDVI seasonal change. A constraint in the exploration of this relationship is the need for active plant growth, and therefore sufficient rainfall for a signal to be detected. Similarly performing models were derived from two time periods and while they differed in their direction of response, both were able to predict sites with low P. Differences were due to the functional attributes of the dominant vegetation that were active at the time of image collection. Further refinement of the models should be achievable by designing plot sampling strategies more aligned to synoptic remote sensing needs, and incorporating plant composition data into the analysis.

Predictive model for sustaining biodiversity in tropical countryside	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Growing demand for food, fuel, and fiber is driving the intensification and expansion of agricultural land through a corresponding displacement of native woodland, savanna, and shrubland. In the wake of this displacement, it is clear that farmland can support biodiversity through preservation of important ecosystem elements at a fine scale. However, how much biodiversity can be sustained and with what tradeoffs for production are open questions. Using a well-studied tropical ecosystem in Costa Rica, we develop an empirically based model for quantifying the "wildlife-friendliness" of farmland for native birds. Some 80% of the 166 mist-netted species depend on fine-scale countryside forest elements (<= 60-m-wide clusters of trees, typically of variable length and width) that weave through farmland along hilltops, valleys, rivers, roads, and property borders. Our model predicts with similar to 75% accuracy the bird community composition of any part of the landscape. We find conservation value in small (<= 20 m wide) clusters of trees and somewhat larger (<= 60 m wide) forest remnants to provide substantial support for biodiversity beyond the borders of tropical forest reserves. Within the study area, forest elements on farms nearly double the effective size of the local forest reserve, providing seminatural habitats for bird species typically associated with the forest. Our findings provide a basis for estimating and sustaining biodiversity in farming systems through managing fine-scale ecosystem elements and, more broadly, informing ecosystem service analyses, biodiversity action plans, and regional land use strategies.

J	Bradford, JB				Bradford, John B.			Divergence in Forest-Type Response to Climate and Weather: Evidence for Regional Links Between Forest-Type Evenness and Net Primary Productivity	ECOSYSTEMS												Climate change is altering long-term climatic conditions and increasing the magnitude of weather fluctuations. Assessing the consequences of these changes for terrestrial ecosystems requires understanding how different vegetation types respond to climate and weather. This study examined 20 years of regional-scale remotely sensed net primary productivity (NPP) in forests of the northern Lake States to identify how the relationship between NPP and climate or weather differ among forest types, and if NPP patterns are influenced by landscape-scale evenness of forest-type abundance. These results underscore the positive relationship between temperature and NPP. Importantly, these results indicate significant differences among broadly defined forest types in response to both climate and weather. Essentially all weather variables that were strongly related to annual NPP displayed significant differences among forest types, suggesting complementarity in response to environmental fluctuations. In addition, this study found that forest-type evenness (within 8 x 8 km(2) areas) is positively related to long-term NPP mean and negatively related to NPP variability, suggesting that NPP in pixels with greater forest-type evenness is both higher and more stable through time. This is landscape- to subcontinental-scale evidence of a relationship between primary productivity and one measure of biological diversity. These results imply that anthropogenic or natural processes that influence the proportional abundance of forest types within landscapes may influence long-term productivity patterns.

J	Hernandez-Stefanoni, JL; Gallardo-Cruz, JA; Meave, JA; Dupuy, JM				Luis Hernandez-Stefanoni, J.; Alberto Gallardo-Cruz, J.; Meave, Jorge A.; Manuel Dupuy, Juan			Combining geostatistical models and remotely sensed data to improve tropical tree richness mapping	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Information on the spatial distribution and composition of biological communities is essential in designing effective strategies for biodiversity conservation and management. Reliable maps of species richness across the landscape can be useful tools for these purposes. Acquiring such information through traditional survey techniques is costly and logistically difficult. The kriging interpolation method has been widely used as an alternative to predict spatial distributions of species richness, as long as the data are spatially dependent. However, even when this requirement is met, researchers often have few sampled sites in relation to the area to be mapped. Remote sensing provides an inexpensive means to derive complete spatial coverage for large areas and can be extremely useful for estimating biodiversity. The aim of this study was to combine remotely sensed data with kriging estimates (hybrid procedures) to evaluate the possibility of improving the accuracy of tree species richness maps. We did this through the comparison of the predictive performance of three hybrid geostatistical procedures, based on tree species density recorded in 141 sampling quadrats: co-kriging (COK), kriging with external drift (KED), and regression kriging (RK). Reflectance values of spectral bands, computed NDVI and texture measurements of Landsat 7 TM imagery were used as ancillary variables in all methods. The R(2) values of the models increased from 0.35 for ordinary kriging to 0.41 for COK, and from 0.39 for simple regression estimates to 0.52 and 0.53 when using simple KED and RK, respectively. The R(2) values of the models also increased from 0.60 for multiple regression estimates to 0.62 and 0.66 when using multiple KED and RK, respectively. Overall, our results demonstrate that these procedures are capable of greatly improving estimation accuracy, with multivariate RK being clearly superior, because it produces the most accurate predictions, and because of its flexibility in modeling multivariate relationships between tree richness and remotely sensed data. We conclude that this is a valuable tool for guiding future efforts aimed at conservation and management of highly diverse tropical forests. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The effect of a protected area on the tradeoffs between short-run and long-run benefits from mangrove ecosystems	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Protected areas are used to sustain biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, protected areas can create tradeoffs spatially and temporally among ecosystem services, which can affect the welfare of dependent local communities. This study examines the effect of a protected area on the tradeoff between two extractive ecosystem services from mangrove forests: cutting mangroves (fuelwood) and harvesting the shrimp and fish that thrive if mangroves are not cut. We demonstrate the effect in the context of Saadani National Park (SANAPA) in Tanzania, where enforcement of prohibition of mangrove harvesting was strengthened to preserve biodiversity. Remote sensing data of mangrove cover over time are integrated with georeferenced household survey data in an econometric framework to identify the causal effect of mangrove protection on income components directly linked to mangrove ecosystem services. Our findings suggest that many households experienced an immediate loss in the consumption of mangrove firewood, with the loss most prevalent in richer households. However, all wealth classes appear to benefit from long-term sustainability gains in shrimping and fishing that result from mangrove protection. On average, we find that a 10% increase in the mangrove cover within SANAPA boundaries in a 5-km(2) radius of the subvillage increases shrimping income by approximately twofold. The creation of SANAPA shifted the future trajectory of the area from one in which mangroves were experiencing uncontrolled cutting to one in which mangrove conservation is providing gains in income for the local villages as a result of the preservation of nursery habitat and biodiversity.																	0027-8424					AUG 23	2011	108	34					13945	13950		10.1073/pnas.1101825108								WOS:000294163500023	21873182					
J	Onojeghuo, AO; Blackburn, GA				Onojeghuo, Alex Okiemute; Blackburn, George Alan			Optimising the use of hyperspectral and LiDAR data for mapping reedbed habitats	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Reedbeds are important habitats for supporting biodiversity and delivering a range of ecosystem services, yet reedbeds in the UK are under threat from intensified agriculture, changing land use and pollution. To develop appropriate conservation strategies, information on the distribution of reedbeds is required. Field surveys of these wetland environments are difficult, time consuming and expensive to execute for large areas. Remote sensing has the potential to replace or complement such field surveys, yet the specific application to reedbed habitats has not been fully investigated. In the present study, airborne hyperspectral and LiDAR imagery were acquired for two sites in Cumbria, UK. The research aimed to determine the most effective means of analysing hyperspectral data covering the visible, near infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) regions for mapping reedbeds and to investigate the effects of incorporating image textural information and LiDAR-derived measures of canopy structure on the accuracy of reedbed delineation. Due to the high dimensionality of the hyperspectral data, three image compression algorithms were evaluated: principal component analysis (PCA), spectrally segmented PCA (SSPCA) and minimum noise fraction (MNF). The LiDAR-derived measures tested were the canopy height model (CHM), digital surface model (DSM) and the DSM-derived slope map. The SSPCA-compressed data produced the highest reedbed accuracy and processing efficiency. The optimal SSPCA dataset incorporated 12 PCs comprised of the first 3 PCs derived from each of the spectral segments: visible (392700 nm), NIR (701972 nm), SWIR-1 (9731366 nm) and SWIR-2 (15302240 nm). Incorporating image textural measures produced a significant improvement in the classification accuracy when using MNF-compressed data, but had no impact when using the SSPCA-compressed imagery. A significant improvement (+ 11%) in the accuracy of reedbed delineation was achieved when a mask generated by applying a 3 m threshold to the LiDAR-derived CHM was used to filter the reedbed map derived from the optimal SSPCA dataset. This paper demonstrates the value in combining appropriately compressed hyperspectral imagery with LiDAR data for the effective mapping of reedbed habitats. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

However, in addition to habitat conversion to crop production or urban uses, ecosystem alteration (e.g., from logging, conversion to plantations, biological invasion, or fire suppression) is a large source of conservation risk. We add data quantifying ecosystem alteration on unconverted lands to arrive at a more accurate depiction of conservation risk for the conterminous United States. We quantify ecosystem alteration using a recent national assessment based on remote sensing of current vegetation compared with modeled reference natural vegetation conditions. Highly altered (but not converted) ecosystems comprise 23% of the conterminous United States, such that the number of critically endangered ecoregions in the United States is 156% higher than when calculated using habitat conversion data alone. Increased attention to natural resource management will be essential to address widespread ecosystem alteration and reduce conservation risk.																	1932-6203					AUG 5	2011	6	8							e23002	10.1371/journal.pone.0023002								WOS:000293563300033	21850248					
J	Torontow, V; King, D				Torontow, Valerie; King, Douglas			Forest complexity modelling and mapping with remote sensing and topographic data: a comparison of three methods	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The concept of forest complexity has been recently adopted to represent the multiple horizontal and vertical forest structure and composition attributes that support ecological functions in a single measure or index. The index variables are often selected based on known associations with types of habitat and biodiversity potential. In modelling and mapping of forest complexity using geospatial data, three multivariate methods have been evaluated in previous studies: (i) defining an additive complexity index by manual a priori selection and combination of a set of field variables followed by regression-based modelling of the index against geospatial data; (ii) as the previous method, but where a complexity index is defined a priori using principal components analysis (PCA) of the field data; and (iii) direct modelling of a set of field variables against a set of geospatial variables using techniques such as redundancy analysis (RDA). The objective of this study was to compare these methods through an assessment of model quality and their relative merits and limitations in implementation. In the rural municipality of Chelsea, Quebec, 70 field plots were established, and 24 forest structure and composition variables were measured that had between-variable correlations of less than 0.8. Spectral and spatial Quickbird imagery information and topographic data were used to derive complexity models using the three methods. The manual additive index and the RDA-derived index had similar validation errors relative to their index means (24.3% and 22.3%, respectively). However, the RDA index was based on the full set of 24 field variables, which had a total structure-composition variance greater than the manual additive index comprised of a subset of 10 of those variables. Thus, the RDA index was deemed to more comprehensively represent forest structure and composition than the additive index. RDA also produced outputs that were richer in information content, showing associations between individual variables and plots, as well as forest-environmental gradients. The PCA method was useful for evaluating environmental gradients in the field data, but dimensionality was too high to provide a single useful complexity index for modelling with geospatial data. The additive and RDA index models were used to produce maps of predicted forest complexity to aid in biodiversity survey planning and habitat conservation efforts within the municipality.

The Pan-European Common Bird Monitoring Scheme (PECBM) has been launched by the BirdLife Partnership in Europe, where the European Bird Census Council has been collecting data from 20 independent breeding bird survey programs across Europe over the last 25 years. These data show dramatic declines in European farmland birds. We suggest that seasonal characteristics of vegetation cover derived from high temporal resolution remote sensing images could facilitate the monitoring the suitability of farmland bird habitats, and that these indicators may be a better choice for monitoring than climate data. We used redundancy analysis to link the PECBM data of the estimated number of farmland birds in Europe to a set of phenological and climatic indicators and to the biogeographic regions of Europe. Variance partitioning was used to account for the variation explained by the phenological and climate variables and by the area of the environmental strata individually, to define the pure effect of the variables, and to extract the total explained variance. The analysis revealed high statistical significance (p < 0.001) of the correlations between species and environment. Phenological indices explained 38% of the variance in community composition of the 23 farmland bird species, whereas climate explained 30% of the variance. After partitioning the other variables as covariables, the pure effect of phenology, climate, and environmental strata were 16%, 8%, and 16%, respectively. Based on the probability results, we suggest that phenological indicators derived from remote sensing may supply better indicators for continental scale biodiversity studies than climate only. In addition, these indicators are cost and time effective, are on continuous scale, and are readily repeatable on a large spatial coverage while supplying standardized results.																	1420-2026					AUG	2011	16	4					385	399		10.1007/s10666-011-9251-9								WOS:000293243800006

Patterns of divergence in the olive sunbird Cyanomitra olivacea (Aves: Nectariniidae) across the African rainforest-savanna ecotone	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												In the debate over modes of vertebrate diversification in tropical rainforests, two competing hypotheses of speciation predominate: those that emphasize the role of geographical isolation during glacial periods and those that stress the role of ecology and diversifying selection across ecotones or environmental gradients. To investigate the relative roles of selection versus isolation in refugia, we contrasted genetic and morphologic divergence of the olive sunbird (Cyanomitra olivacea) at 18 sites (approximately 200 individuals) across the forest-savanna ecotone of Central Africa in a region considered to have harboured three hypothesized refugia during glacial periods. Habitats were characterized using bioclimatic and satellite remote-sensing data. We found relatively high levels of gene flow between ecotone and forest populations and between refugia. Consistent with a pattern of divergence-with-gene-flow, we found morphological characters to be significantly divergent across the gradient [forest versus ecotone (mean +/- SD): wing length 60.47 +/- 1.81 mm versus 62.18 +/- 1.35 mm; tarsus length 15.51 +/- 0.82 mm versus 16.00 +/- 0.57 mm; upper mandible length 21.77 +/- 1.09 mm versus 23.19 +/- 0.98 mm, respectively]. Within-habitat comparisons across forest and ecotone sites showed no significant differences in morphology. The results show that divergence in morphological traits is tied to environmental variables across the gradient and is occurring despite gene flow. The pattern of divergence-with-gene-flow found is similar to that described for other rainforest species across the gradient. These results suggest that neither refugia, nor isolation-by-distance have played a major role in divergence in the olive sunbird, although ecological differences along the forest and savanna ecotone may impose significant selection pressures on the phenotype and potentially be important in diversification.

In this paper, the current status of land use/landcover and the vegetation communities of the Solang valley watershed in Himachal Pradesh of Indian western Himalaya has been mapped and presented using remote sensing. This watershed area was dominated by alpine and sub-alpine pastures (30.34%) followed by scree slopes (22.34%) and forests (21.06%). Many tree, shrub, and herb species identified in the study area are among the prioritized species for conservation in the Indian Himalayan Region.

While the combination of remote sensing technology and habitat modelling provides a useful tool for habitat monitoring, the effect of incorporating remotely sensed data on model transferability is unclear. Therefore, our objectives were to assess how different satellite-derived variables affect temporal transferability of habitat models and their usefulness for habitat monitoring. Location Wolong Nature Reserve, Sichuan Province, China. Methods We modelled giant panda habitat with the maximum entropy algorithm using panda presence data collected in two time periods and four different sets of predictor variables representing land surface phenology. Each predictor variable set contained either a time series of smoothed wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI) or 11 phenology metrics, both derived from single-year or multi-year (i.e. 3-year) remotely sensed imagery acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We evaluated the ability of models obtained with these four variable sets to predict giant panda habitat within and across time periods by using threshold-independent and threshold-dependent evaluation methods and five indices of temporal transferability. Results Our results showed that models developed with the four variable sets were all useful for characterizing and monitoring giant panda habitat. However, the models developed using multi-year data exhibited significantly higher temporal transferability than those developed using single-year data. In addition, models developed with phenology metrics, especially when using multi-year data, exhibited significantly higher temporal transferability than those developed with the time series. Main conclusions The integration of land surface phenology, captured by high temporal resolution remotely sensed imagery, with habitat modelling constitutes a suitable tool for characterizing wildlife habitat and monitoring its temporal dynamics. Using multi-year phenology metrics reduces model complexity, multicollinearity among predictor variables and variability caused by inter-annual climatic fluctuations, thereby increasing the temporal transferability of models. This study provides useful guidance for habitat monitoring through the integration of remote sensing technology and habitat modelling, which may be useful for the conservation of the giant panda and many other species.

Nonetheless, sampling species based on standard plant inventories represents an effort-intensive approach. Hence, rarefaction based on remotely sensed information can provide a rapid tool for identifying regions with exceptional richness and turnover. The aim of this paper is to examine (i) if the rates of spectral and species accumulation are positively correlated with one another at different spatial scales, and (ii) if the strength of this correlation differs between regions of varying landscape complexity. Location: Switzerland, Europe. Methods: The plant species data were derived from the Swiss "Biodiversity Monitoring'' programme. Seven Landsat ETM+ images covering the whole study area were acquired. We applied species and spectral rarefaction for five biogeographical areas ranging from flat to mountainous zones. The relative increments (rates) of the species and spectral rarefaction curves were compared using Pearson correlation together with locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS). Results: The biogeographic regions differed from one another in both their spectral and species diversity. The relationship between spectrally- and species-derived rates of accumulation was non-significant in simple landscapes, but we observed a significant positive correlation in complex landscapes over fine-to-intermediate spatial scales. Conclusions: Spectral rarefaction represents a powerful tool for measuring landscape diversity and potentially predicting species diversity at regional to global spatial scales. Based on remotely sensed information, more efficient diversity-based monitoring programmes can be developed.

In this study, the distribution of the White-backed Woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos) in Poland was used to assess the usefulness of a demographic model compared to an area-based model for predicting the occurrence of breeding pairs in local landscapes. The models were applied to the European Forest Map and to CORINE land cover data, two spatial databases derived from remote sensing. We tested the performance of the models by comparing predicted occurrence of the species with actual occurrence in 10 km x 10 km of the Polish Ornithological Atlas Database (POAD). Both models proved useful for identifying areas with high potential for hosting breeding woodpeckers. However, the demographic model performed consistently better at predicting the presence of at least one breeding pair in local landscapes. In north-eastern and south-eastern Poland, expected occurrences coincided with the actual occurrence of the species according to POAD. In north-western Poland, however, occurrence was predicted but not confirmed by the atlas data. The eastern regions are situated at the border to Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and Slovakia. These countries hold large areas of high conservation value forests and large populations of White-backed Woodpecker. This pattern evokes the need for cross-border governance, and planning with an eco-regional perspective that considers both EU and non-EU countries. Moreover, the results stress the need to incorporate population requirements when assessing the distribution of forests with high conservation value. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Dalle, SP; Pulido, MT; de Blois, S				Dalle, Sarah Paule; Pulido, Maria T.; de Blois, Sylvie			Balancing shifting cultivation and forest conservation: lessons from a "sustainable landscape" in southeastern Mexico	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Shifting cultivation is often perceived to be a threat to forests, but it is also central to the culture and livelihoods of millions of people worldwide. Balancing agriculture and forest conservation requires knowledge of how agricultural land uses evolve in landscapes with forest conservation initiatives. Based on a case study from Quintana Roo, Mexico, and remote sensing data, we investigated land use and land cover change (LUCC) in relation to accessibility (from main settlement and road) in search of evidence for agricultural expansion and/or intensification after the initiation of a community forestry program in 1986. Intensification was through a shortening of the fallow period. Defining the sampling space as a function of human needs and accessibility to agricultural resources was critical to ensure a user-centered perspective of the landscape. The composition of the accessible landscape changed substantially between 1976 and 1997. Over the 21-year period studied, the local population saw the accessible landscape transformed from a heterogeneous array of different successional stages including mature forests to a landscape dominated by young fallows. We detected a dynamic characterized by intensification of shifting cultivation in the most accessible areas with milpas being felled more and more from young fallows in spite of a preference for felling secondary forests. We argue that the resulting landscape provides a poorer resource base for sustaining agricultural livelihoods and discuss ways in which agricultural change could be better addressed through participatory land use planning. Balancing agricultural production and forest conservation will become even more important in a context of intense negotiations for carbon credits, an emerging market that is likely to drive future land changes worldwide.

Linking multi-temporal analysis and community consultation to evaluate the response to the impact of Hurricane Stan in coffee areas of Chiapas, Mexico	NATURAL HAZARDS												This paper analyses the responses related to land use of coffee growers in Chiapas, Mexico to the impact of Hurricane Stan (October 2005). A multi-temporal analysis of the effect on land cover was performed through the combination of unsupervised classification of SPOT multispectral images and visual interpretation of panchromatic images (8 months previous to the hurricane, and 2, 14, and 40 months after the hurricane). The information provided by this geographic analysis was interpreted in light of information gathered though household surveys. Although the hurricane wrecked havoc across the region, the main impact in the study area was in the riparian zones where the extent of the loss experienced in terms of coffee harvest and soil was such that, even 14 months after the event, households with land in those areas were struggling to recover. Nevertheless, after 40 months, the zones that had suffered total soil loss began to support soil and vegetation, indicating the possibility of replanting coffee in those areas. Although the hurricane occurred when the coffee sector was particularly fragile as a result of the preceding several years of poor prices, the impact did not trigger extensive land use change. The surveys showed, however, that people are now more informed of the risk of living and farming on the river margins and are now performing soil conservation practices and planting trees to reduce risk.

At the European scale, remote sensing tools for NATURA 2000 habitat monitoring have been requested by the European Commission to fulfill the obligations of the EU Habitats Directive. This paper introduces a method by which swath events in semi-natural grasslands can be detected from multi-temporal TerraSAR-X data. The investigated study sites represent rare and endangered habitats (NATURA 2000 codes 6410, 6510), located in the Doberitzer Heide nature conservation area west of Berlin. We analyzed a time series of 11 stripmap images (HH-polarization) covering the vegetation period affected by swath (June to September 2010) at a constant 11-day acquisition rate. A swath detection rule was established to extract the swath events for the NATURA 2000 habitats as well as for six contrasting pasture sites not affected by swath. All swath events observed in the field were correctly allocated. The results indicate the potential to allocate semi-natural grassland swath events to 11-day-periods using TerraSAR-X time series. Since the conservation of semi-natural grassland habitats requires compliance with specific swath management rules, the detection of swath events may thus provide new parameters for the monitoring of NATURA 2000 grassland habitats.

Cloud cover conditions and stability of the Western Ghats montane wet forests	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Using remote sensing data from multiple satellites and numerical simulations we addressed the hypothesis that the Western Ghats tropical montane wet forests in southwest India are hydrometeorologically stressed and lowland deforestation has decreased cloud cover and precipitation. We generated water cloud and Leaf Area Index climatologies for a 6 year period and answered the following questions: (1) what are the diurnal and seasonal variations of water clouds, (2) what is the relationship between cloud cover and topography, (3) where are potential locations of the tropical montane wet forests, (4) what are the current hydrometeorological conditions over the identified tropical montane wet forests, and (5) what is the sensitivity of cloud cover and precipitation over the montane wet forests to lowland deforestation? The study found that (1) strong correlations between climatological precipitation and cloud frequency were present thereby indicating that higher spatial and temporal resolution cloud frequency is a good indicator of hydrometeorological conditions; (2) cloud frequency was lower in the dry season (10-25%) and higher in the monsoon seasons (40-45%); (3) a morning-afternoon pattern in cloud cover exists during both the dry and wet seasons; (4) morning cloud cover decreased from October to January with afternoon cloud cover similarly decreasing but with higher values than the morning cloud cover; (5) cloud cover generally increased with elevation; (6) 39%, 70%, 47% and 42% of the clouds intersected the mountains during March and May 2007 and February and April 2008, respectively; (7) our maps showing regions with conditions suitable to sustain tropical montane wet forests successfully identified known montane biodiversity hot spots; and (8) simulations showed an increase of afternoon cloud cover and dry season precipitation but reduced cloud immersion over the montane forests with lowland deforestation.

J	Acevedo, MF				Acevedo, Miguel F.			Interdisciplinary progress in food production, food security and environment research	ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION												This review examines contributions of interdisciplinary (ID) research to understanding interactions between environmental quality, food production and food security. Global patterns of food insecurity and crop production are reviewed in relation to climate, land use and economic changes, as well as potential productivity increases compatible with environmental conservation. Interactions between food production and global processes make food insecurity a complex problem that requires ID analysis at local to global scales. Census and satellite data contribute to understanding of global cropland distribution. Analysis of land-use change exemplifies research between natural and social sciences. Quantitative modelling of global climate change impacts indicates relatively greater potential food insecurity in developing countries. International food security is increasingly interconnected through economic globalization and incentives for increased food production are required. Societies may not be able to expand available cropland without significant environmental risks; enhanced land and water productivity are the major opportunities available to increase food production. This requires renewed efforts in ID work to design and implement sound and efficient agricultural management practices. Models need to be informed by data from field experiments, long-term measurements and watershed monitoring by ground and remote sensing methods. Agricultural intensification may spare natural land but lead to increased pollution and water demand; reconciling conservation and productivity is a critical need. ID work provides many opportunities for synergies including conservation agriculture at the local level, efficient use of inputs, smarter land use taking into account spatial patterns and landscape ecology principles, and improved water management at field, system, watershed and basin levels. Goal-directed ID research is crucial, since producers, practitioners and policy makers should be involved. Geospatial, biotechnological and precision agriculture technologies linked with models can help inform strategies to achieve sustainable food production increases that maintain environmental quality. Implementation also requires ID work to overcome impediments due to human factors and facilitate adoption by farmers.																	0376-8929	1469-4387				JUN	2011	38	2			SI		151	171		10.1017/S0376892911000257								WOS:000291114200005

Predicting alpha diversity of African rain forests: models based on climate and satellite-derived data do not perform better than a purely spatial model	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Our aim was to evaluate the extent to which we can predict and map tree alpha diversity across broad spatial scales either by using climate and remote sensing data or by exploiting spatial autocorrelation patterns. Location Tropical rain forest, West Africa and Atlantic Central Africa. Methods Alpha diversity estimates were compiled for trees with diameter at breast height >= 10 cm in 573 inventory plots. Linear regression (ordinary least squares, OLS) and random forest (RF) statistical techniques were used to project alpha diversity estimates at unsampled locations using climate data and remote sensing data [Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Quick Scatterometer (QSCAT), tree cover, elevation]. The prediction reliabilities of OLS and RF models were evaluated using a novel approach and compared to that of a kriging model based on geographic location alone. Results The predictive power of the kriging model was comparable to that of OLS and RF models based on climatic and remote sensing data. The three models provided congruent predictions of alpha diversity in well-sampled areas but not in poorly inventoried locations. The reliability of the predictions of all three models declined markedly with distance from points with inventory data, becoming very low at distances > 50 km. According to inventory data, Atlantic Central African forests display a higher mean alpha diversity than do West African forests. Main conclusions The lower tree alpha diversity in West Africa than in Atlantic Central Africa may reflect a richer regional species pool in the latter. Our results emphasize and illustrate the need to test model predictions in a spatially explicit manner. Good OLS or RF model predictions from inventory data at short distance largely result from the strong spatial autocorrelation displayed by both the alpha diversity and the predictive variables rather than necessarily from causal relationships. Our results suggest that alpha diversity is driven by history rather than by the contemporary environment. Given the low predictive power of models, we call for a major effort to broaden the geographical extent and intensity of forest assessments to expand our knowledge of African rain forest diversity.

However, studies on immediate earthquake impacts are rarely conducted at fine scales due to logistical constraints. We conducted the first post-earthquake field survey in Wolong Nature Reserve, Wenchuan, China, less than 1 year after it was hit by a magnitude 8.0 earthquake in 2008. Since Wolong harbors approximately 10% of the endangered wild giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) population, the impact of the earthquake on the giant panda and its habitat is of particular concern. We established 15 transects in three focus areas within the Reserve where we classified occurrences of earthquake damage according to vegetation and geophysical characteristics. In the 11.2 km(2) area sampled, we recorded 156 occurrences of earthquake damage consisting of landslides and mudflows, which comprised a total area of 0.88 km(2). Of all earthquake damage occurrences sampled, only 36% of occurences (73% of surface area) corresponded to damaged areas previously detected through broad-scale remote sensing. The remaining damaged areas mainly consisted of occurrences too small to be detected without field observation. Although there were significant losses to tree and shrub species diversity and richness in earthquake-damaged areas, remnant vegetation was found in the majority (80%) of damaged areas, suggesting the potential for forest recovery. Most earthquake-damaged areas were too steep to be classified as suitable giant panda habitat (79%). In addition, a sizable number of signs of giant panda (67) and other wildlife (148) were observed near the earthquake-damaged areas, and there appeared to be avoidance of earthquake damage only at short-range distances. This study has implications for understanding the impact of natural disasters on biodiversity and highlights the importance of fine scale on-the-ground assessments of disaster impacts on wildlife and their habitats.

This facilitates better identification of promising crops and cropping systems, logistical and economic studies, and work needed to meet regulatory criteria. A possible approach is built upon three layers of internationally available spatial data: (1) degrading and abandoned areas, (2) potentially suitable land cover classes, (3) exclusion zones such as nature reserves and areas of high biodiversity. For China, areas identified as potentially suitable range from 1.2 to 6.0% of the national territory, depending on different levels of statistical confidence in degrading area status and allowable limits of terrestrial carbon. Verification on the ground showed that about 60% of points tested conformed to the remote suitability assessment in the scenario, which represents the results for the combination of all degrading areas and a terrestrial carbon stock limit of 200 t ha(-1). A top-down approach is useful in framing potentially suitable locations, but a complementary bottom-up analysis is still required to ultimately identify areas for sustainable bio-fuel production.

Using remotely sensed imagery to monitor savanna rangeland deterioration through woody plant proliferation: a case study from communal and biodiversity conservation rangeland sites in Mokopane, South Africa	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Healthy rangelands are of economic and biodiversity conservation importance in the savannas of northern South Africa. The proliferation of woody plant species on the rangelands, known as bush encroachment, constitutes a degradation of rangeland quality, given the non-palatability of the encroaching species. Though the causes are not fully understood, heavy grazing and fire suppression are thought to be primary causes of bush encroachment. This study utilised multitemporal (1994, 2000 and 2008) SPOT images of two rangeland sites in Mokopane, South Africa in monitoring and assessing bush encroachment. The study sites were a fenced biodiversity conservation rangeland with game species in which fire is suppressed and an open access communal rangeland grazed by livestock. Field plot-derived encroachment categories of heavy encroachment, moderate encroachment, low encroachment and non-encroached were used in hybrid classification of the images, following radiometric normalisation and geometric registration. GIS overlay analysis using the non-encroached category enabled the quantification and mapping of change in the preferable open grass rangeland typifying savannas. The biodiversity conservation area was undergoing a trend of reduction in open grass rangeland, whereas the communal rangelands were getting more opened up by livestock trampling. Rangeland management practices of fire utilisation, stocking levels and stock concentration account for the differing trends. Lightly grazed and heavily grazed wild game-utilised rangelands under a fire suppression rangeland management regime had bush encroachment rates of approximately 34% and 56%, respectively, in 6 years. Multitemporal remote sensing proved to be useful for monitoring bush encroachment as indicator of state of savanna rangelands.																	0167-6369					MAY	2011	176	1-4					293	311		10.1007/s10661-010-1583-4								WOS:000289255100022	20628812

Reliable earth observation data are key information for tracking biodiversity change on various scales. Regarding the establishment of standardized environmental observation systems, a key question is: What can be observed on each scale and how can land cover information be transferred? In this study, a land cover map from a dry semi-arid savanna ecosystem in Namibia was obtained based on the UN LCCS, in-situ data, and MODIS and Landsat satellite imagery. In situ botanical relev, samples were used as baseline data for the definition of a standardized LCCS legend. A standard LCCS code for savanna vegetation types is introduced. An object-oriented segmentation of Landsat imagery was used as intermediate stage for downscaling in-situ training data on a coarse MODIS resolution. MODIS time series metrics of the growing season 2004/2005 were used to classify Kalahari vegetation types using a tree-based ensemble classifier (Random Forest). The prevailing Kalahari vegetation types based on LCCS was open broadleaved deciduous shrubland with an herbaceous layer which differs from the class assignments of the global and regional land-cover maps. The separability analysis based on Bhattacharya distance measurements applied on two LCCS levels indicated a relationship of spectral mapping dependencies of annual MODIS time series features due to the thematic detail of the classification scheme. The analysis of LCCS classifiers showed an increased significance of life-form composition and soil conditions to the mapping accuracy. An overall accuracy of 92.48% was achieved. Woody plant associations proved to be most stable due to small omission and commission errors. The case study comprised a first suitability assessment of the LCCS classifier approach for a southern African savanna ecosystem.

We undertook two case studies on the influence of oil and gas activities within neighbouring federal districts in the tundra zone. Employing a strongly interdisciplinary approach, we studied the ecological, spatial and social dimensions of the visible and perceived changes in land use and land cover. Our data are derived from field sampling, remote sensing and intensive participant observation with indigenous Nenets reindeer herders and non-indigenous workers. Important trends include the rapid expansion of infrastructure, a large influx of workers who compete for freshwater fish, and extensive transformation from shrub- to grass- and sedge-dominated tundra. The latter represents an alternative ecosystem state that is likely to persist indefinitely. On terrain disturbed by off-road vehicle traffic, reindeer pastures' vegetation regenerates with fewer species among which grasses and sedges dominate, thus reducing biodiversity. To have maximum forage value such pastures must be accessible and free of trash, petro-chemicals and feral dogs. We found that a wide range of direct and indirect impacts, both ecological and social, accumulate in space and time such that the combined influence is effectively regional rather than local, depending in part on the placement of facilities. While incoming workers commonly commit poaching, they also serve as exchange partners, making barter for goods possible in remote locations. In general, the same positive and negative impacts of the presence of industry were mentioned in each study region. Even using very high-resolution remote sensing data (Quickbird-2) it is not possible to determine fully the amount of degraded territory in modern oil and gas fields. With regard to policy, both biophysical and social impacts could be substantially reduced if information flow between herders and workers were to be optimized. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Location United States. Methods We review the utility of hyperspectral remote sensing for detecting, mapping and predicting the spatial spread of invasive species. We cover a range of topics including the trade-off between spatial and spectral resolutions and classification accuracy, the benefits of using time series to incorporate phenology in mapping species distribution, the potential of biochemical and physiological properties in hyperspectral spectral reflectance for tracking ecosystem changes caused by invasions, and the capacity of hyperspectral data as a valuable input for quantitative models developed for assessing the future spread of invasive species. Results Hyperspectral remote sensing holds great promise for invasion research. Spectral information provided by hyperspectral sensors can detect invaders at the species level across a range of community and ecosystem types. Furthermore, hyperspectral data can be used to assess habitat suitability and model the future spread of invasive species, thus providing timely information for invasion risk analysis. Main conclusions Our review suggests that hyperspectral remote sensing can effectively provide a baseline of invasive species distributions for future monitoring and control efforts. Furthermore, information on the spatial distribution of invasive species can help land managers to make long-term constructive conservation plans for protecting and maintaining natural ecosystems.

Where land use and resource extraction is severely limited, local people turn to resource pools outside parks. Kibale National Park in western Uganda is a remnant of a previously larger, mid-altitude forest region surrounded by dense agricultural settlement. We combine remote sensing techniques and household surveys to examine landscape change and fragmentation and the implications for securing rural livelihoods. Forests and wetlands outside the park provide important resources such as fuelwood, building poles, and water, but they are also problematic for local farmers since crop raids by primates and elephants emanate from these fragments. Our analysis shows that since 1984 forests and wetlands have decreased in size and number and those that remain have become increasingly isolated within the agricultural mosaic. Farmers have adapted to resource shortages and human-wildlife conflict in different ways. Our results suggest that wealth, ethnicity, and distance from the park are important factors in determining responses to these issues. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Integrating remote sensing in Natura 2000 habitat monitoring: Prospects on the way forward	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION												Monitoring and reporting on the state of nature gained increasing importance in the European Union with the implementation of the Habitats Directive and the Natura 2000 network. Reporting habitat conservation status requires detailed knowledge on many aspects of habitats at different spatial levels. Remote sensing is recognised as a powerful tool to acquire synoptic data on habitats, but to date, its use for Natura 2000 monitoring and reporting is still very limited. One reason for this appears to be the knowledge gap between the nature conservation agencies and the remote sensing community. We conducted a review of legal monitoring and reporting requirements on Natura 2000 habitats, looked into the current use of remote sensing in habitat reporting, and consulted monitoring experts in nature conservation administrations to find out about their attitude and expectations towards remote sensing. In this paper, we disclose and summarise the real data needs behind the legal requirements for Natura 2000 habitat monitoring and reporting, analyse opportunities and constraints for remote sensing, and highlight bottlenecks and pathways to resolve them. Monitoring experts are not unwilling to use remote sensing data, but they are unsure of whether remote sensing can suit their needs in a cost-effective way. They look upon remote sensing as a one-way process of data deliverance and fail to see the importance of their active cooperation. Based on our findings, we argue that the integration of remote sensing into Natura 2000 habitat monitoring could benefit from (1) harmonising and standardising approaches, (2) focusing on data at hand to develop readily useful products, (3) a proper validation of both traditional and remote sensing methods, and (4) an enhanced sharing and exchange of ideas and results between the different research communities involved.

J	Baynard, CW				Baynard, Chris W.			The landscape infrastructure footprint of oil development: Venezuela's heavy oil belt	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Oil exploration and production activities (CEPA) and other extractive endeavors can create large-scale and permanent landscape alterations through the establishment of infrastructure features such as roads. well pads, pipelines and production facilities. These structures can lead to or increase landscape fragmentation and degradation, reduce biodiversity, disrupt important ecosystem services and attract informal settlements that further alter the landscape, deplete area resources and lead to social conflict. Aside from regulatory standards, many energy (oil and gas) companies include voluntary environmental performance as part of their sustainability reporting. However, they do not account for these site-specific alterations in a systematic, quantifiable and transparent way. This paper proposes a calculation of a modified Landscape Infrastructure Footprint (LIF) of OEPA based on landscape ecology metrics measured via GIS and remote sensing techniques. Three Venezuelan heavy oil belt (HOB) operations were examined with reference to the years 1990 and 2000. Results indicate that Ameriven displayed the smallest LIF. Newer technologies, best practices, land cover, competing economic interests and type of management may explain observed alterations. LIF methods provide four important benefits. First, they can help to reduce surface disturbances by informing planning practices in current as well as in new projects. Second, they fortify environmental reporting by providing objective measures of environmental performance tied to extractive activities. Third, by including LIF in their sustainability practices, extractive industries can improve their competitive advantage. Finally, the LIF helps create a set of transparent environmental performance standards that industry and regulators can adopt in order to measure and monitor landscape alterations resulting from extractive activities.

J	Pernar, R; Seletkovic, A; Ancic, M; Sucic, J				Pernar, Renata; Seletkovic, Ante; Ancic, Mario; Sucic, Jelena			Features of Spatial Snag Distribution in a Beech-Fir Forest	CROATIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST ENGINEERING												With the participation of about 65% in the total growing stock of conifers, silver fir is the most important and the best represented conifer species in Croatia. The increasing share of sanitary felling in the annual felling plans demands that special attention be paid to the health status of fir forests and the quantity of unplanned felling. This is the reason why dieback of silver fir in beech-fir forests in the Dinaric Alps is an acute and topical management-ecological problem. In the past 10 years, the share of total unplanned felling in the overall annual felling for fir has amounted to 57%. Such a high share of unplanned yield (mainly snags) has had a negative effect on sustainable forest management. Determining the spatial distribution of damaged trees and snags, as well as their monitoring is one of the priorities of sustainable management. Hence, it is of utmost importance to detect less healthy stands and apply timely measures for the purpose of maintaining their vitality and productivity at an optimal level. Due to the seriously disturbed stand stability caused by forced canopy opening, which in turn affects the health condition and natural regeneration of the stand, it is necessary not only to detect snags but also determine the causes of dieback. According to the results of past research, increased tree dieback is associated with the impact of different site and stand characteristics (altitude, exposition, slope, soil, structure, etc.), as well as abiotic and biotic factors (fir needle moth, mistletoe); however, the real causes are yet to be discovered. It is difficult to make efficient snag inventories with standard field methods. For large areas, a remote sensing method (the application of CIR aerial photographs) is much more practical, more cost effective and more reliable. All research activities so far have proved that, in terms of accuracy, this method is equal to field working methods, while in terms of speed and objectivity it is far more efficient. Snag inventories by means of CIR aerial photography interpretation and GIS enable efficient enumeration (detection) and spatial distribution (mapping) of snags. The proposed method is highly important not only for the detection and monitoring of the occurrence, distribution and direction of dieback progress, but also for the detection of possible dieback causes, on the basis of which experts will prescribe adequate measures and treatments. The objective of CIR aerial photography interpretation is to determine the current situation and acquire an objective picture of forest condition (database) in as short a period as possible, while mapping on a color infrared digital orthophoto (DOP) is intended to provide the spatial distribution of snags for the surveyed area. An aerial survey of the Lika area with the CIR film (Forest Administration Gospic) was conducted in strips (Fig. 3). The coordinates of the start and finish points of aerial photogrammetric series in the associated zones of the Gauss-Kruger cartographic projection, as well as planned strip lengths, are given in the following survey (Table 1). A total of 88 aerial photographs were taken at an average scale of 1:6000 and longitudinal overlap of 60%, which allows for the interpretation of individual trees in the stereomodel. As the total length of all the three strips amounted to 40,243 m (40.24 km), an area of 5,548 ha was surveyed. Since aerial photography provided an insight into the condition of the stands in the investigated area, and since the results obtained by photointerpretation of CIR aerial photograph indicated acute fir damage (the average damaged tree is 61.70%), snag inventory (mapping) was undertaken. In the localities of fir forests, dieback was observed in the form of smaller or bigger groups of trees. Hence, areas of 1 ha (sample plots) were delineated on a random sample in the color infrared DOP (1:5000). All visible snags were then mapped in each area (Fig. 1). The central parts of the images were used to construct a DOP. The pixel size of each orthophoto is 0.5 m. According to the spatial snag distribution, the number of snags (density) per strip ranged between 23 and 105 per ha (Fig. 2). Since the values were not similar for all the plots, all the identified snags were mapped in the color infrared DOP. A total of 17,445 snags were mapped in the study area (Fig. 4). GIS was used to produce a cartographic presentation of spatial snag distribution along the survey strips. In order to produce a digital orthophoto, it was necessary to construct a digital relief model. Data for the DRsM were obtained by vectorizing the contour lines from the associated sheets of the Basic Map of Croatia (BMC) of 1:5000 scale and topographic maps (TM25) at a scale of 1:25000. Since individual tree mortality is a stochastic, rare and irregular event (Eid and Tuhus 2001) and since this is a karst terrain, slope variability in the study area is very high; therefore, it is not advisable to take into account the average slope in an area. As the same was also confirmed by the research of Antonic and Legovic (1999), Pernar (1997), and Bozic et al. (2004), the layers were generated from the DRIVE. Raster-GIS modeling provided the layers of slope and exposition. In this way, the values of altitude (Fig. 5), slope (Fig. 6) and exposition (Fig. 7) obtained by means of the DRM were assigned to every snag, in dependence of the location (position in space). An orthophoto and a digital relief model (DRIVE) were also entered into GIS as one of the layers, which enabled rapid spatial analysis and an efficient access to data (Fig. 8). Next, the obtained results were statistically analyzed and the data of spatial snag distribution and geomorphological features were processed. The most important result ensuing from the presented method of rapid snag inventory is the thematic maps, which present spatial snag distribution for the investigated area. Not only is field work very expensive and long-lasting (Boyle et al., 1998), but it is also extremely difficult in barely accessible terrains or on steep slopes. A method based on remote sensing (aerial or satellite images) considerably contributes to the solution of the afore mentioned problems and provides a more practical, less expensive and more reliable manner of enumerating dry trees and stands over large areas. In combination with GIS technology, the production of a map of spatial snag distribution takes 5-10 minutes per hectare of the inventoried area. Such maps provide an insight into the field condition and spatial snag distribution in a very short time. They can also be used as a basis for the calculation of mean snag density and for conducting a variety of analyses intended to predict efficient measures of mitigating dieback effects. Based on the results of statistical analysis, it can be concluded that the spatial distribution of snags is influenced by geomorphological features (terrain orientation, slope and altitude). Variance nalysis (F=278.79; p<0.001) showed that there was a statistically significant difference between the spatial distribution of snags with regard to terrain orientation (exposition) and slope. According to the results, the number of snags increases in accordance with an increase in the slope on the north-eastern and northern exposition (Fig. 9). The Tukey HSD test proved that, in terms of slope, all terrain orientations are clearly differentiated in relation to the occurrence of snags, except the S and SE. This was expected, since the participation of fir in these expositions is lower. As for terrain orientation, there is also a statistically significant difference in terms of altitude (F=102.6; p<0.001). The results show that the number of snags in the E and NE exposition rises with an increase in altitude (Fig. 10). The results of statistical analysis should not be used to make one-sided conclusions based on the correlation between fir snag distribution and mezorelief features. Undoubtedly, however, the spatial distribution (location) of each single snag is conditioned by edaphic and micro-relief site characteristics (soil depth, skeletalness), i.e. total soil capacity for water retention in the rhizosphere zone. Pernar (2001) directly associates the productivity of fir stands with soil depth, while Bigler et al. (2004) use the increment of mature fir trees as a predictor of fir dieback. Research by Certini et al. (2000) also confirms soil depth as a direct and indirect (distribution and virulence of pathogenic fungus Heterobasidion annosum (Fries.) Bref.)) factor of fir tree mortality. Taking into account the obtained results, a rapid and economic snag inventory is a must both for the needs of forest management and protection and for the needs of other scientific disciplines. At the Fourth Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe, held on 2 October 2003, it was proposed that dry trees should be used as a new indicator of biodiversity, or in other words, that snags should have special ecological significance for biodiversity within forest ecosystems. It is, therefore, predicted that snag inventories will be undertaken with increasing frequency. In accordance with this, the proposed method could become an irreplaceable tool and a complement to standard field method. In addition, it has versatile applications, including national, regional or local forests taxation, certification processes, studies of site quality for animal species which depend on dry trees; classification of older stands, etc. The obtained results not only provided the current forest condition (inventory), but also indicated potential (focal points) and purpose of aerial surveys. Aerial photographs provide a survey of the field condition in a short time period, as well as allow for the possibility of planning efficient measures of mitigating dieback effects and evaluating dieback probability and rate. The results of the analyses enable the study of particular environmental features and their effects on forest dieback, as well as indicate the direction of future multidisciplinary research involving complex analyses of all environmental features. The results of the research are applicable primarily in the field of forest management, protection and harvesting, but they can also provide a basis for interpretations of events occurring in other fields.																	1845-5719					APR	2011	32	1					313	327										WOS:000290369000026

CONSERVATION LETTERS												Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD+) is a policy mechanism now agreed under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from developing countries through the sustainable management of forests, while providing co-benefits of biodiversity conservation and livelihood support. Implementation challenges include linking remote sensing and national forest inventories of carbon stocks, to local implementation and measuring carbon loss from forest degradation. Community-based forest monitoring can help overcome some of these challenges. We show that local people can collect forest condition data of comparable quality to trained scientists, at half the cost. We draw on our experience to propose how and where local REDD+ monitoring can be established. Empowering communities to own and monitor carbon stocks could provide a rapid and cost-effective way of absorbing carbon dioxide emissions, while potentially contributing to local livelihoods and forest biodiversity conservation.				publist, CMEC/C-3010-2012; publicationpage, cmec/B-4405-2017; Sorensen, Marten/L-7484-2014; Jensen, Per/J-8182-2012	Sorensen, Marten/0000-0001-6921-5366; Jensen, Per/0000-0001-8792-7711												1755-263X					APR	2011	4	2					158	167		10.1111/j.1755-263X.2010.00159.x								WOS:000289301900009

Since the second half of the twentieth century, the Cantabrian Mountains (NW Spain) have been substantially altered by the loss of traditional management practices and, more recently, by the new environmental schemes developed by the Regional Government. This area is a biodiversity hotspot, representing the south-western-most distribution limit for a large number of species in Europe. Therefore, small changes in landscape patterns can result in biodiversity losses. In this study, we analyzed land cover changes in the Cantabrian Mountains from 1991 to 2004 by means of remote sensing techniques, identifying the main driving forces and classifying the territory according to its risk of land cover change. Forest expansion and loss of shrublands were the two major trajectories of change apparent during this period. When modeling the occurrence of these land cover changes, we found that performance of models was related to the nature of the change. The most accurate models were associated with processes of secondary succession, i.e. forest expansion (78.6%), while the least accurate models related to changes linked with management decisions, i.e. loss of shrubs (61.8%). The main drivers of change were variations in the number of goats (for the forest expansion model) and changes in the number of head of sheep and cattle (for the loss of shrubs model). Topographic conditions (altitude and slope) were relevant in both models. Our approach proposes an explicit decision support tool for landscape managers, allowing better identification of the areas where they should focus their attention. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of the study was to generate spatially and temporally quantified information on land cover dynamics, providing the basis for policy/decision makers and resource managers to facilitate biodiversity conservation, including wild animals. Two satellite images (Landsat TM of 1984 and Landsat ETM+ of 2003) were acquired and supervised classification was used to categorize LC types. Ground Control Points were obtained in field condition for georeferencing and accuracy assessment. The results showed an increase in the areas of pure forest (Erica species dominated) and shrubland but a decrease in the area of agricultural land over the 20 years. The overall accuracy and the Kappa value of classification results were 88 and 85%, respectively. The spatial setting of the LC classes was heterogeneous and resulted from the biophysical nature of SMNP and anthropogenic activities. Further studies are suggested to evaluate the existing LC and LCC in connection with wildlife habitat, conservation and management of SMNP.

Current surrogates for approximating the distribution of biodiversity are habitats mapped within a number of national and international frameworks (e.g., Natura 2000), even though conventional habitat mapping is time consuming and requires well-trained personnel. Here we evaluated the use of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to map forest habitat types to simplify the process. We used available data of habitat types for the Bavarian Forest National Park as a basis to predict habitat types with LiDAR-derived variables. Furthermore, we compared these results with predictions based on extensive ground-based climate, soil and vegetation data. Using linear and flexible discriminant analyses, we found that LiDAR is able to predict forest habitat types with the same overall accuracy as the extensive ground data for climate, soil and vegetation composition. Subtle differences in the vegetation structure between habitat types, particularly in the vertical and horizontal vegetation profiles, were captured by LiDAR. These differences in the physiognomy were in part caused by changes in altitude, which also influence tree species composition. We propose that the most-efficient way to identify forest habitat types according Natura 2000 is to combine remote-sensing LiDAR data with well-directed field surveys.

Modelling semi-natural habitat area on lowland farms in western Ireland	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												A significant policy objective is the need for protection of biodiversity not just within designated Natura 2000 sites, but also in areas that occur outside of these sites. However there is a lack of information on existing semi-natural habitat cover on EU farms, making it difficult to assess whether targets for halting the loss of agricultural biodiversity are being met. To achieve these targets, reliable yet easy-to-use methods are needed for accurately identifying priority areas for conservation actions and monitoring biodiversity on a large spatial scale. Remote sensing, farmland statistics and species data have been used in some EU countries to create maps to estimate the extent of semi-natural habitat cover but these are acknowledged as being too broad scale. In this study, we examined a method of fine-scale prediction of the spatial coverage of semi-natural habitats in lowland farms. A generalized additive model (GAM) was used to investigate the relationships between landscape and farm management variables and the lowland farmland habitat biodiversity on 32 farms outside of conservation designations, in a region of western Ireland. Semi-natural habitat cover on lowland farms could be predicted with a model using stocking density, soil diversity and river and stream length. It is proposed that this model could be used to predict the coverage of semi-natural habitats on farms in other regions of Ireland with similar land-use and landscape.

J	Feilhauer, H; Schmidtlein, S				Feilhauer, Hannes; Schmidtlein, Sebastian			On variable relations between vegetation patterns and canopy reflectance	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Statistical relations between the species composition of plant assemblages and canopy reflectance are frequently employed in remote sensing for mapping vegetation at local scales. Reflectance is influenced by species composition but also affected by dynamics such as seasonal vegetation development or plant stress. Due to this variability in time and space, doubts are frequently raised with respect to the transferability of statistical relations in remote sensing of plant assemblages. Hence, this study addresses the stability of statistical relations between species composition and reflectance despite of spatiotemporally changing vegetation conditions. We established permanent plots at three temperate sites (nutrient-poor grassland, wet heath, and floodplain meadow). We measured canopy reflectance at multiple dates over the vegetation period using a field spectrometer with hyperspectral resolution. Simultaneously, plant species composition and other vegetation and surface parameters that may exert influence on reflectance were recorded. Species composition was statistically related to the corresponding reflectance data using ordination (Isometric Feature Mapping) and cross-validated regression models (Partial Least Squares Regression). Time series of model fits as well as regression coefficients were used to estimate the temporal stability of the models. Model fits were further compared to changes in vegetation conditions. Model residuals were tested for co-variable influences. Finally, we tested the transferability of the statistical relations in time. Results showed that species composition could be modeled with rather high accuracies (R-2 in validation up to 0.78 and for only three measurements lower than 0.5), with the highest fits near the vegetation optimum (i.e., the date with maximum cover of photosynthetically active vegetation). The transferability in time varied with the vegetation type. Uncertainties in the models were strongly related to variable canopy height and to the occurrence of litter. Since such spatial heterogeneities may be a result of non-stationary processes, we conclude that statistical methods taking into account such effects may further improve the accuracy of vegetation mapping.

Spinning a laser web: predicting spider distributions using LiDAR	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												LiDAR remote sensing has been used to examine relationships between vertebrate diversity and environmental characteristics, but its application to invertebrates has been limited. Our objectives were to determine whether LiDAR-derived variables could be used to accurately describe single-species distributions and community characteristics of spiders in remote forested and mountainous terrain. We collected over 5300 spiders across multiple transects in the Bavarian National Park (Germany) using pitfall traps. We examined spider community characteristics (species richness, the Shannon index, the Simpson index, community composition, mean body size, and abundance) and single-species distribution and abundance with LiDAR variables and ground-based measurements. We used the R(2) and partial R(2) provided by variance partitioning to evaluate the predictive power of LiDAR-derived variables compared to ground measurements for each of the community characteristics. The total adjusted R(2) for species richness, the Shannon index, community species composition, and body size had a range of 25-57%. LiDAR variables and ground measurements both contributed >80% to the total predictive power. For species composition, the explained variance was similar to 32%, which was significantly greater than expected by chance. The predictive power of LiDAR-derived variables was comparable or superior to that of the ground-based variables for examinations of single-species distributions, and it explained up to 55% of the variance. The predictability of species distributions was higher for species that had strong associations with shade in open-forest habitats, and this niche position has been well documented across the European continent for spider species. The similar statistical performance between LiDAR and ground-based measures at our field sites indicated that deriving spider community and species distribution information using LiDAR data can provide not only high predictive power at relatively low cost, but may also allow unprecedented mapping of community-and species-level spider information at scales ranging from stands to landscapes. Therefore, LiDAR is a viable tool to assist species-specific conservation as well as broader biodiversity planning efforts not only for a growing list of vertebrates, but for invertebrates as well.

Forest degradation assessment in the upper catchment of the river Tons using remote sensing and GIS	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The present study investigates the status of forest degradation in the upper catchment of the river Tons in the Uttarakhand state of India, including Govind Wildlife Sanctuary and the National Park by the same name using remote sensing and the geographic information system (GIS). The study revealed that more than 50% of the study area is covered with snow and the alpine grasslands while 8.1% area is under agriculture. Degraded forest covers maximum area (53 km(2)), followed by moderately (30.4 km(2)) and severely degraded (26.8 km(2)) forests. The lower and middle slopes showed higher degradation than upper slopes due to multiple uses for agriculture, horticulture, agroforestry and grazing by the local people. Over time, the degradation and deforestation, without adequate protection, have led to severe soil erosion. biodiversity and the habitat depletion for a large number of rare and endemic species including loss of livelihood to the local people.

Comprehensive maps of marine resources, including those important for local fisheries management and biodiversity conservation, provide a crucial foundation of information for the planning process. Using a combination of field and high spatial resolution satellite data, we use an empirical procedure to create a bathymetric map (RMSE 1.76 m) and object-based image analysis to produce accurate maps of geomorphic and benthic coral reef classes (Kappa values of 0.80 and 0.63; 9 and 33 classes, respectively) covering a large (>260 km(2)) traditional fisheries management area in Fiji. From these maps, we derive per-pixel information on habitat richness, structural complexity, coral cover and the distance from land, and use these variables as input in models to predict fish species richness, diversity and biomass. We show that random forest models outperform five other model types, and that all three fish community variables can be satisfactorily predicted from the high spatial resolution satellite data. We also show geomorphic zone to be the most important predictor on average, with secondary contributions from a range of other variables including benthic class, depth, distance from land, and live coral cover mapped at coarse spatial scales, suggesting that data with lower spatial resolution and lower cost may be sufficient for spatial predictions of the three fish community variables.

Reddy			Assessment of spatial and temporal dynamics of tropical forest cover: A case study in Malkangiri district of Orissa, India	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES												Tropical forests have been recognized as having global conservation importance. However, they are being rapidly destroyed in many regions of the world. Regular monitoring of forests is necessary for an adaptive management approach and the successful implementation of ecosystem management. The present study analyses the temporal changes in forest ecosystem structure in tribal dominated Malkangiri district of Orissa, India, during 1973-2004 period based on digitized forest cover maps using geographic information system (GIS) and interpretation of satellite data. Three satellite images Landsat MSS (1973), Landsat TM (1990) and IRS P6 LISS III (2004) were used to determine changes. Six land cover types were delineated which includes dense forest, open forest, scrub land, agriculture, barren land and water body. Different forest types were also demarcated within forest class for better understanding the degradation pattern in each forest types. The results showed that there was a net decrease of 475.7 km(2) forest cover (rate of deforestation = 2.34) from 1973 to 1990 and 402.3 km(2) (rate of deforestation = 2.27) from 1990 to 2004. Forest cover has changed over time depending on a few factors such as large-scale deforestation, shifting cultivation, dam and road construction, unregulated management actions, and social pressure. A significant increase of 1222.8 km(2) agriculture area (1973-2004) clearly indicated the conversion of forest cover to agricultural land. These alterations had resulted in significant environmental consequences, including decline in forest cover, soil erosion, and loss of biodiversity. There is an urgent need for rational management of the remaining forest for it to be able to survive beyond next decades. Particular attention must be paid to tropical forests, which are rapidly being deforested.																	1009-637X					FEB	2011	21	1					176	192		10.1007/s11442-011-0837-6								WOS:000285985800013

Investigating RADARSAT-2 as a tool for monitoring grassland in western Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Native grasslands play an important role in ecosystem function, biodiversity, climate change, and economics, yet quantifiable estimates of the rate and location of native grassland change in western Canada are not readily available. To date, optical remote sensing has been explored for grassland mapping, but cloud cover limits the availability of timely data for the discrimination of improved, as opposed to native, grassland. In this study we investigated the utility of RADARSAT-2 polarimetric imagery to map native grassland, improved grassland, and agricultural crops. Fine quad-polarisation mode RADARSAT-2 data were acquired at two incidence angles over a test site in southern Alberta every 24 days from 1 April to 31 October 2009 and were processed using the Freeman-Durden decomposition. Double-bounce, volumetric, and surface scattering properties suggest that native grasslands can be distinguished from cultivated cropping, especially using a mid-to late-season image. However, discriminating native grasslands from improved grasslands was more difficult. Land cover classification of a single RADARSAT-2 image from July 2009 provided reasonable but slightly less accurate results compared with a single Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper image (Kappa value of 0.65 compared with 0.81).																	1712-7971					FEB	2011	37	1			SI		93	102		10.5589/m11-027								WOS:000305249300010						
J	Dunhill, AM				Dunhill, Alexander M.			Using remote sensing and a geographic information system to quantify rock exposure area in England and Wales: Implications for paleodiversity studies	GEOLOGY												Rock outcrop area and number of sedimentary formations have been widely used as sampling proxies in paleodiversity studies and have often been found to correlate with apparent paleodiversity. However, rock exposure area is a better proxy for the amount of sedimentary rock available for study than the widely used measures of outcrop area (i.e., map area) or number of formations. With the use of remote sensing and a geographic information system (GIS), it is possible to quantify rock exposure area accurately on a regional scale. Rock exposure area does not correlate well with either outcrop area or number of sedimentary formations, and the proportion of rock exposed in different areas can vary considerably with proximity to the coast, bedrock age, lithology, land use, and elevation. Therefore, this suggests that the correlation of paleodiversity and rock volume estimates is best explained by a common-cause hypothesis, rather than a geologic sampling bias hypothesis. GIS methods offer an efficient and accurate method of quantifying regional sedimentary rock exposure and may provide a helpful approach to assessing rock record bias on patterns in the fossil record.																	0091-7613					FEB	2011	39	2					111	114		10.1130/G31503.1								WOS:000286505300004

The physical and biological composition and distribution of benthic habitats within these ecosystems determines their contribution to ecosystem services and biodiversity as well as their connections to neighbouring terrestrial and marine ecosystem processes. The capacity to accurately and consistently map and monitor these benthic habitats is critical to developing and implementing management applications. This paper presents a method for integrating field survey data and high spatial resolution, multi-spectral satellite image data to map bathymetry and seagrass in shallow coastal waters. Using Quickbird 2 satellite images from 2004 and 2007, acoustic field survey data were used to map bathymetry using a linear and ratio algorithm method; benthic survey field data were used to calibrate and validate classifications of seagrass percentage cover and seagrass species composition; and a change detection analysis of seagrass cover was performed. The bathymetry mapping showed that only the linear algorithm could effectively and accurately predict water depth; overall benthic map accuracies ranged from 57-95%; and the change detection produced a reliable change map and showed a net decrease in seagrass cover levels, but the majority of the study area showed no change in seagrass cover level. This study demonstrates that multiple spatial products (bathymetry, seagrass and change maps) can be produced from single satellite images and a concurrent field survey dataset. Moreover, the products were produced at higher spatial resolution and accuracy levels than previous studies in Moreton Bay. The methods are developed from previous work in the study area and are continuing to be implemented, as well as being developed to be repeatable in similar shallow coastal water environments.

Land use and land cover changes over a century (1914-2007) in the Neyyar River Basin, Kerala: a remote sensing and GIS approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH												Land use and land cover change, perhaps the most significant anthropogenic disturbance to the environment, mainly due to rapid urbanization/industrialization and large scale agricultural activities. In this paper, an attempt has been made to appraise land use/land cover changes over a century (1914-2007) in the Neyyar River Basin (L=56 km; Area = 483.4 km2) in southern Kerala - a biodiversity hot spot in Peninsular India. In this study, digital remote sensing data of the Indian Remote Sensing satellite series I-D (LISS III, 2006-2007) on 1:50,000 scale, Survey of India (SOI) toposheet of 1914 (1:63,360) and 1967 (1:50,000) have been utilized to map various land use/land cover changes. Maps of different periods have been registered and resampled to similar geographic coordinates using ERDAS Imagine 9.0. The most notable changes include decreases in areas of paddy cultivation, mixed crops, scrub lands and evergreen forests, and increases in built-up areas, rubber plantations, dense mixed forests, and water bodies. Further, large scale exploitation of flood plain mud and river sand have reached menacing proportions leading to bank caving and cut offs at channel bends. Conservation of land and water resources forms an important aspect of ecosystem management in the basin.

J	Hirt, U; Mewes, M; Meyer, BC				Hirt, Ulrike; Mewes, Melanie; Meyer, Burghard C.			A new approach to comprehensive quantification of linear landscape elements using biotope types on a regional scale	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												The structure of a landscape is highly relevant for research and planning (such as fulfilling the requirements of the Water Framework Directive - WFD - and for implementation of comprehensive catchment planning). There is a high potential for restoration of linear landscape elements in most European landscapes. By implementing the WFD in Germany, the restoration of linear landscape elements could be a valuable measure, for example to reduce nutrient input into rivers. Despite this importance of landscape structures for water and nutrients fluxes, biodiversity and the appearance of a landscape, specific studies of the linear elements are rare for larger catchment areas. Existing studies are limited because they either use remote sensing data, which does not adequately differentiate all types of linear landscape elements, or they focus only on a specific type of linear element. To address these limitations, we developed a framework allowing comprehensive quantification of linear landscape elements for catchment areas, using publicly available biotope type data. We analysed the dependence of landscape structures on natural regions and regional soil characteristics. Three data sets (differing in biotopes, soil parameters and natural regions) were generated for the catchment area of the middle Mulde River (2700 km(2)) in Germany, using overlay processes in geographic information systems (GIS), followed by statistical evaluation. The linear landscape components of the total catchment area are divided into roads (55%), flowing water (21%), tree rows (14%), avenues (5%), and hedges (2%). The occurrence of these landscape components varies regionally among natural units and different soil regions. For example, the mixed deciduous stands (3.5 m/ha) are far more frequent in foothills (6 m/ha) than in hill country (0.9 m/ha). In contrast, fruit trees are more frequent in hill country (5.2 m/ha) than in the cooler foothills (0.5 m/ha). Some 70% of avenues, and 40% of tree rows, are discontinuous; in contrast, only 20% of hedges are discontinuous. Using our innovative framework, comprehensive information about landscape elements can now be obtained for regional applications. This approach can be applied to other regions and is highly relevant for landscape planning, erosion control, protection of waters and preservation of biotopes and species. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Object-oriented classification of multi-resolution images for the extraction of narrow linear forest disturbance	REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												Narrow linear forest disturbances (e. g. seismic cut lines) have been found to have significant effects on wildlife habitat and biodiversity (e. g. species richness and abundance). A great deal of seismic cut lines is created in oil and gas exploration in natural forest areas every year. Accurate mapping of seismic cut lines can therefore contribute to a better understanding of wildlife habitat and biodiversity. However, previous studies have indicated that seismic cut lines were fairly difficult to detect and map even with the available high-spatial resolution imagery (e. g. Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre, SPOT 5). Recent progress in feature segmentation and extraction software, such as Definiens Developer 7.0, has enhanced remote sensing capabilities, with the promise of being able to automate tasks. This study investigated the imagery (high resolution or very high resolution) best suited for extracting seismic cut lines using a set of rules and multi-resolution object-oriented classification methods. The data used include SPOT 5 and QuickBird multispectral images and existing Geographic Information System (GIS) databases within one bear management area (BMA) in the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains in Alberta. Results indicated that among the available algorithms in the Definiens Developer 7.0 package, the Lee sigma algorithm was capable of highlighting cut lines using the near-infrared (NIR) band of the SPOT 5 image and the QuickBird image. The multi-resolution segmentation was able to segment fresh cut lines when giving higher weight to the Lee sigma edge extraction layer, and the nearest-neighbour object-oriented classifier was able to classify linear features, but with noise. Classification accuracy increased following the post-classification refinement processing. The accuracy assessment indicated that, in the case of delineating fresh cut lines, the higher resolution QuickBird image performed better than SPOT 5. However, neither the QuickBird image nor the SPOT 5 image could accurately delineate relatively old cut lines.																	2150-704X						2011	2	2					147	155		10.1080/01431161.2010.504755								WOS:000292873000007

The aim of our research was to analyze and interpret annual trends of forest cover loss for different sub-regions of the study area. We mapped forest cover loss for 2000-2008 using multi-resolution remote sensing data from the Landsat enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+) and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors and analyzed annual trends per island, province, and official land allocation zone. The total forest cover loss for Sumatera and Kalimantan 2000-2008 was 5.39 Mha, which represents 5.3% of the land area and 9.2% of the year 2000 forest cover of these two islands. At least 6.5% of all mapped forest cover loss occurred in land allocation zones prohibiting clearing. An additional 13.6% of forest cover loss occurred where clearing is legally restricted. The overall trend of forest cover loss increased until 2006 and decreased thereafter. The trends for Sumatera and Kalimantan were distinctly different, driven primarily by the trends of Riau and Central Kalimantan provinces, respectively. This analysis shows that annual mapping of forest cover change yields a clearer picture than a one-time overall national estimate. Monitoring forest dynamics is important for national policy makers, especially given the commitment of Indonesia to reducing greenhouse gas emissions as part of the reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries initiative (REDD+). The improved spatio-temporal detail of forest change monitoring products will make it possible to target policies and projects in meeting this commitment. Accurate, annual forest cover loss maps will be integral to many REDD+ objectives, including policy formulation, definition of baselines, detection of displacement, and the evaluation of the permanence of emission reduction.																	1748-9326					JAN-MAR	2011	6	1							014010	10.1088/1748-9326/6/1/014010								WOS:000289263600011						
J	Jenkins, RB; Coops, NC				Jenkins, Ross B.; Coops, Nicholas C.			Landscape Controls on Structural Variation in Eucalypt Vegetation Communities: Woronora Plateau, Australia	AUSTRALIAN GEOGRAPHER												Quantification of landscape-based vegetation structural variation and pattern is a significant goal for a variety of ecological, monitoring and biodiversity studies. Vegetation structural metrics, derived from airborne laser scanning (ALS or aerial light detection and ranging-LiDAR) and QuickBird satellite imagery, were used to establish the degree of plot-based vegetation variation at a hillslope scale. Topographic position is an indicator of energy and water availability, and was quantified using DEM-based insolation and topographic wetness, respectively, stratifying areas into hot-warm-cold and wet-moist-dry topographic classes. A range of vegetation metrics-maximum and modal canopy height, crown cover, foliage cover, NDVI and semivariance-were compared among randomly selected plots from each topographic class. NDVI increases with increasing landscape wetness, whereas ALS-derived foliage cover decreases with increasing insolation. Foliage cover is well correlated with crown cover (R-2 = 0.65), and since foliage cover is readily calculable for whole-of-landscape application, it will provide valuable and complementary information to NDVI. Between-plot heterogeneity increases with increasing wetness and decreasing insolation, indicating that more sampling is required in these locations to capture the full range of landscape-based variability. Pattern analysis in landscape ecology is one of the fundamental requirements of landscape ecology, and the methods described here offer statistically significant, quantifiable and repeatable means to realise that goal at a fine spatial grain.

An integrated approach to a biophysiologically based classification of floating aquatic macrophytes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Globally, invasive species are identified as one of the most serious threats to ecological stability and biodiversity. Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), an aggressive invasive aquatic species, has caused severe economic and ecological impacts in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta in California. In the Delta, water hyacinth co-occurs with native pennywort (Hydrocotyle umbellata L.) and non-native water primrose (Ludwigia spp.). All of the species express a wide range of phenotypic variability, making it difficult to map them with remote sensing techniques because their spectral response is highly variable. We present an integrated approach to mapping these floating species using a sequence of hyperspectral methods, such as spectral angle mapper (SAM), linear spectral unmixing (LSU), continuum removal and several indices in a decision tree format. The ensuing tree, based on biophysiological differences between the species, was robust and consistent across three separate years and over multiple flightlines each year, spread across an area of approximately 2500 km(2). The most important inputs used to create the tree were reflectance in the short-wave infrared (SWIR), Red Edge Index, near-infrared (NIR) reflectance, LSU fractions and SAM rule values. The floating species were mapped with average accuracy of 88% for water hyacinth, 87% for pennywort and 71% for water primrose.

The turtles exhibited short, shallow dives during their migration southward (mean depth: 45 m; mean duration: 23.6 min), followed by deeper, longer dives (mean depth: 56.7 m; mean duration: 26.4 min) in the South Pacific Gyre that probably indicated searching for prey. We integrated the horizontal movements with remotely sensed oceanographic data to determine the turtles' response to the environment, and applied this information to recommendations for conservation in the pelagic environment. A generalized additive mixed model applied to the daily turtle travel rates confirmed that slower travel rates occurred at cooler sea surface temperatures, higher chlorophyll a concentration and stronger vertical Ekman upwelling, all of which are considered favorable foraging conditions. The southern terminus (35 to 37 degrees S) of the leatherback tracks was also in an area of increased mesoscale activity that might act as a physical mechanism to aggregate their prey, gelatinous zooplankton. However, this could also act as a thermal limit to their distribution. This characterization of leatherback habitat use could aid the development of management efforts within the South Pacific Ocean to reduce mortality of leatherback turtles from fisheries interactions.

J	Ozyavuz, M				Ozyavuz, Murat			Determination of Temporal Changes in Lakes Mert and Erikli Using Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The Igneada area of Turkey includes different ecosystems and a wide range of biodiversity, making it one of Turkey's most important areas. Igneada and the surrounding environment have unique characteristics; in other parts of Turkey and Europe, the types of wild forests found in the Igneada area have been damaged by anthropogenic effects. Lakes Mert and Erikli in the Igneada area play an important role in the formation and maintenance of the Longos forest. This study used Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite images from 1987 and 2009 and 1:25,000-scale topographic maps. The satellite images were geometrically corrected and underwent image processing and classification, and the results were subsequently calculated using reclassification and overlay analyses. In addition, a rapid ecological assessment was carried out to detect changes in the field. The surfaces of lakes Mert and Erikli were found to have decreased by 4.03%. The reason for this minor change is that the flow rates of streams feeding these lakes are well protected. The primary cause of the observed changes was found to be the amount of seasonal precipitation and the amount of water taken from the rivers feeding these lakes.																	0749-0208					JAN	2011	27	1					174	181		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-10-00107.1								WOS:000286952900016

Aim To determine the factors which may have led to the increase in Woodlark populations in the Mediterranean region. Methods Woodlark habitat selection was determined using territory mapping in an area that had undergone widespread land abandonment during the past 50 years. Remote sensing data were used to study landscape changes within the study area between 1978 and 2003. Results Most Woodlark territories included a combination of farmland and shrubland patches. These fulfilled the birds' requirements for territorial display and for foraging. Land abandonment has increased the availability of open shrubland, the dominant land-cover type selected by Woodlarks. Conclusions Increased fine-grained landscape heterogeneity following farm abandonment has created opportunities for habitat use by Woodlarks and may be a major factor in the Woodlark population expansion observed between 1978 and 2003.

Development of a forest structural complexity index based on multispectral airborne remote sensing and topographic data	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE												This paper presents development of a multivariate forest structural complexity index based on relationships between field-based structural variables and geospatial data. Remote sensing has been widely used to model individual forest structural attributes at many scales. As opposed to, or in addition to, individual structural parameters such as leaf area index or tree height, overall structural complexity information can enhance forest inventories and provide a variety of information to forest managers, including identifying damage and disturbance as well as indicators of habitat or biodiversity. In this study, a multivariate modelling technique, redundancy analysis, was implemented to derive a model incorporating both horizontal and vertical structural attributes as predicted by an ensemble of high-resolution multispectral airborne imagery and topographic variables. The first redundancy analysis axis of the final model explained 35% of the total variance of the field variables and was used as the complexity index. With a root mean squared error of 19.9%, the model was capable of differentiating four to five relative levels of complexity. This paper presents the forest ecological and modelling aspects of the research. A related paper presents the remote sensing aspects, including application of the model to map predicted structural complexity, map validation, and testing of the method at multiple scales.

Integrating field sampling, geostatistics and remote sensing to map wetland vegetation in the Pantanal, Brazil	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Development of efficient methodologies for mapping wetland vegetation is of key importance to wetland conservation. Here we propose the integration of a number of statistical techniques, in particular cluster analysis, universal kriging and error propagation modelling, to integrate observations from remote sensing and field sampling for mapping vegetation communities and estimating uncertainty. The approach results in seven vegetation communities with a known floral composition that can be mapped over large areas using remotely sensed data. The relationship between remotely sensed data and vegetation patterns, captured in four factorial axes, were described using multiple linear regression models. There were then used in a universal kriging procedure to reduce the mapping uncertainty. Cross-validation procedures and Monte Carlo simulations were used to quantify the uncertainty in the resulting map. Cross-validation showed that accuracy in classification varies according with the community type, as a result of sampling density and configuration. A map of uncertainty derived from Monte Carlo simulations revealed significant spatial variation in classification, but this had little impact on the proportion and arrangement of the communities observed. These results suggested that mapping improvement could be achieved by increasing the number of field observations of those communities with a scattered and small patch size distribution; or by including a larger number of digital images as explanatory variables in the model. Comparison of the resulting plant community map with a flood duration map, revealed that flooding duration is an important driver of vegetation zonation. This mapping approach is able to integrate field point data and high-resolution remote-sensing images, providing a new basis to map wetland vegetation and allow its future application in habitat management, conservation assessment and long-term ecological monitoring in wetland landscapes.

Over the last decade, the NDVI has proven extremely useful in predicting herbivore and non-herbivore distribution, abundance and life history traits in space and time. Due to the continuous nature of NDVI since mid-1981, the relative importance of different temporal and spatial lags on population performance can be assessed, widening our understanding of population dynamics. Previously thought to be most useful in temperate environments, the utility of this satellite-derived index has been demonstrated even in sparsely vegetated areas. Climate models can be used to reconstruct historical patterns in vegetation dynamics in addition to anticipating the effects of future environmental change on biodiversity. NDVI has thus been established as a crucial tool for assessing past and future population and biodiversity consequences of change in climate, vegetation phenology and primary productivity.

J	Ostendorf, B				Ostendorf, Bertram			Overview: Spatial information and indicators for sustainable management of natural resources	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Natural resource management (NRM) is becoming increasingly important at all scales, local, regional. national and global, because of an increasing human population and increasing per capita use of resources and space. Conflicts are intensifying between different interest groups. Production and conservation aspects are particularly debated because conservation often conflicts with economic and social sustainability. There is public demand for objective decision based NRM but limitations are all pervasive due to the spatial and temporal complexity and interdisciplinary nature. This special issue explores the use of spatial data and models to overcome some limitations of NRM decision making. The papers in this issue show modern approaches of natural resources management with a particular focus on spatial data collection, analysis and the development of spatial indicators. This issue presents a balanced mix of review and research papers that give examples of how to find or improve the spatial information base for evidence-based decision making. This overview makes the argument that understanding complex spatial pattern and processes, and the development of spatial indicators, is an essential aspect of evidence-based NRM. If spatial and temporal patterns are complex, ecological evidence from field data or experiments may have limited value for NRM and observational study designs become more appropriate for understanding complex spatial pattern and processes. Data quality should be documented as a combination of accuracy and spatio-temporal representativeness in order to be useful in the NRM decision process. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Lyle, G; Ostendorf, B				Lyle, G.; Ostendorf, B.			A high resolution broad scale spatial indicator of grain growing profitability for natural resource planning	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The balancing of sustainable agricultural production with environmental, social, cultural and community objectives has become an increasing priority worldwide. Political focus has been on the prevention of environmental degradation and improving biodiversity values under the uncertainty of the impacts of climate change on rural livelihoods. In Australia, dry land salinisation is a major cause of environmental degradation in grain growing regions: at a farm scale the adoptions of key environmental strategies, such as revegetation, need to be considered. This study proposes that the identification and quantification of the spatial variability of wheat grain yield within the cropping landscape may help guide this revegetation. We used precision agriculture technology to collect data at the sub-field scale in conjunction with satellite imagery at the regional scale to create a high resolution regional indicator of wheat yield. This indicator is used to identify the economic value of land at sub-field scale which then allows identification of areas of marginal cropping value. This information provides an indication of how much land can be devoted to revegetation and quantifies the economic trade-off needed for this substitution to take place. Results of this study demonstrate that 90% of the income generated within the area of interest was produced by 55-74% of the wheat growing area depending on the choice of cost price scenarios. Between 27% and 44% of the study area made a financial loss or marginal monetary return indicating that trade-offs providing increased environmental benefits may be possible with minimal income loss from a substantial magnitude of cropping area. Although further analysis at larger regions with longer time series is necessary, results presented here show that overall economic returns may be improved by the reassignment of land use in selected cropping areas. The study also suggests that feasibility analyses of land use change at farm and regional scales should be conducted with a spatial resolution that is fine enough to reflect the spatial variability observed from yield mapping. While this information will not be available on every farm, this study shows that it may be possible to predict yield variability from remotely sensed imagery, thus providing a means to circumvent this problem and to produce high resolution indicators at a regional extent.

J	Mehring, M; Stoll-Kleemann, S				Mehring, Marion; Stoll-Kleemann, Susanne			How Effective is the Buffer Zone? Linking Institutional Processes with Satellite Images from a Case Study in the Lore Lindu Forest Biosphere Reserve, Indonesia	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY												Biosphere reserves seek to reconcile nature conservation with local development goals, for example by delineating buffer zones of sustainable resource use around core areas with primary conservation objectives. Here we evaluate buffer zone effectiveness in reducing deforestation within the Lore Lindu Biosphere Reserve in Sulawesi, Indonesia. Socio-economic and remote-sensing data were combined in an integrated approach. We applied a systematic qualitative social research design and carried out in-depth interviews with local, sub-national, and national authorities. Data collected through the interviews were used to interpret satellite images: (1) spatially, that is, forest cover change in the buffer zone versus the core area and, (2) over time, that is, forest cover change as a response to changing management regimes and socio-economic processes in the region. For this purpose a time series of LANDSAT scenes from 1972 to 2007 was used to classify homogeneous areas of forest cover to detect deforestation. According to the satellite image analysis, the buffer zone in Lore Lindu was ineffective at reducing forest cover clearing in the core area between 1972 and 2007. Since management establishment in 1998, the deforestation rate within the core area even increased fourfold. The gathered data suggest that there are three main institutional drivers to account for this ineffectiveness: (1) Low awareness of boundary demarcation among the villagers due to the lack of participation during management and boundary establishment, (2) The fall of the national president Suharto in 1998, which subsequently triggered deforestation activities in the core area, as the park was perceived to be the local branch of the national, suppressive regime, and (3) The lack of implementation of the biosphere reserve concept at the national level, which leads to unclear responsibilities in the buffer zone as the legal backing for any cooperation in the buffer zone is lacking. Although it appears that the forest status in Lore Lindu is still good compared to other regions in Indonesia, attention must be given to the protection of the core area. We thus conclude that the biosphere reserve concept needs to be strengthened in Indonesia. Its implementation at the national level, including adoption of clearly defined regulations, would substantially contribute to reducing negative impacts on biosphere reserve management through, for example, carefully designed awareness raising programs.																	1708-3087						2011	16	4							3	10.5751/ES-04349-160403								WOS:000298841900012

Use of object-oriented classification and fragmentation analysis (1985-2008) to identify important areas for conservation in Cockpit Country, Jamaica	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Forest fragmentation is one of the most important threats to global biodiversity, particularly in tropical developing countries. Identifying priority areas for conservation within these forests is essential to their effective management. However, this requires current, accurate environmental information that is often lacking in developing countries. The Cockpit Country, Jamaica, contains forests of international importance in terms of levels of endemism and overall diversity. These forests are under severe threat from the prospect of bauxite mining and other anthropogenic disturbances. In the absence of adequate, up-to-date ecological information, we used satellite remote sensing data and fragmentation analysis to identify interior forested areas that have experienced little or no change as priority conservation sites. We classified Landsat images from 1985, 1989, 1995, 2002, and 2008, using an object-oriented method, which allowed for the inclusion of roads. We conducted our fragmentation analysis using metrics to quantify changes in forest patch number, area, shape, and aggregation. Deforestation and fragmentation fluctuated within the 23-year period but were mostly confined to the periphery of the forest, close to roads and access trails. An area of core forest that remained intact over the period of study was identified within the largest forest patch, most of which was located within the boundaries of a forest reserve and included the last remaining patches of closed-broadleaf forest. These areas should be given highest priority for conservation, as they constitute important refuges for endemic or threatened biodiversity. Minimizing and controlling access will be important in maintaining this core.																	0167-6369					JAN	2011	172	1-4					391	406		10.1007/s10661-010-1342-6								WOS:000284959400029	20145994

Applying systematic conservation planning principles to palustrine and inland saline wetlands of New Zealand	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P>1. Previous attempts to identify nationally important wetlands for biodiversity in New Zealand were based on expert panel opinions because quantitative approaches were hampered by a lack of data. We apply principles of systematic conservation planning to remote sensing data within a geographical information system (GIS) to identify nationally important palustrine and inland saline wetlands. 2. A catchment-based classification was used to divide New Zealand into 29 biogeographic units. To meet representation goals, all wetland classes need to be protected within each unit. 3. We mapped current and historic wetlands down to a minimum size of 0.5 ha. Over 7000 current wetlands were mapped using standardised satellite imagery and a collection of point or polygon data. Historical extent was estimated from soil information refined using a digital elevation model. The current extent of wetlands is 10% of the historic extent, which is consistent with previous estimates. 4. A classification was produced using fuzzy expert rules within a GIS to identify seven wetland classes: bog, fen, swamp, marsh, pakihi/gumland, seepage and inland saline. Swamps and pakihi/gumland are the most common, but the former has sustained the greatest reduction in area with only 6% of its historical extent remaining. A preliminary field assessment of classification accuracy in the Otago region found only 60% agreement, mainly because of the misclassification of marshes into swamps. 5. Wetland condition was estimated using six measures of human disturbance (natural cover, human-made impervious cover, introduced fish, woody weeds, artificial drainage and nitrate leaching risk) applied at three spatial scales: the wetland's catchment, a 30-m buffer around the wetland and the wetland itself. Measures were transformed and combined into a single condition index. More than 60% of remaining wetlands had condition indices < 0.5, probably indicating moderate to severe degradation and loss of native biodiversity. 6. Sites were ranked within each biogeographic unit using the wetland classification to ensure a representative set of wetland diversity. Rankings were determined by combining condition and complementarity to calculate conservation effectiveness that was then weighted by irreplaceability. Highest ranked sites in each biogeographic unit were usually the largest remaining wetlands that contained multiple wetland classes. This reflects their potential to protect a diverse range of wetland classes and a high proportion of the remaining habitat.

A coupled remote sensing and the Surface Energy Balance with Topography Algorithm (SEBTA) to estimate actual evapotranspiration over heterogeneous terrain	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Evapotranspiration (ET) may be used as an ecological indicator to address the ecosystem complexity. The accurate measurement of ET is of great significance for studying environmental sustainability, global climate changes, and biodiversity. Remote sensing technologies are capable of monitoring both energy and water fluxes on the surface of the Earth. With this advancement, existing models, such as SEBAL, S_SEBI and SEBS, enable us to estimate the regional ET with limited temporal and spatial coverage in the study areas. This paper extends the existing modeling efforts with the inclusion of new components for ET estimation at different temporal and spatial scales under heterogeneous terrain with varying elevations, slopes and aspects. Following a coupled remote sensing and surface energy balance approach, this study emphasizes the structure and function of the Surface Energy Balance with Topography Algorithm (SEBTA). With the aid of the elevation and landscape information, such as slope and aspect parameters derived from the digital elevation model (DEM), and the vegetation cover derived from satellite images, the SEBTA can account for the dynamic impacts of heterogeneous terrain and changing land cover with some varying kinetic parameters (i.e., roughness and zero-plane displacement). Besides, the dry and wet pixels can be recognized automatically and dynamically in image processing thereby making the SEBTA more sensitive to derive the sensible heat flux for ET estimation. To prove the application potential, the SEBTA was carried out to present the robust estimates of 24 h solar radiation over time, which leads to the smooth simulation of the ET over seasons in northern China where the regional climate and vegetation cover in different seasons compound the ET calculations. The SEBTA was validated by the measured data at the ground level. During validation, it shows that the consistency index reached 0.92 and the correlation coefficient was 0.87.

In other words, spatial ecology is where geography and ecology intersect, and high-quality geospatial data and analysis tools are required to address emerging issues in spatial ecology. In this commentary and review for the International Journal of GIS Special Issue on Spatial Ecology, we highlight selected current research priorities in spatial ecology and describe geospatial data and methods for addressing these tasks. Geoinformation research themes are identified in population ecology, community and landscape ecology, and ecosystem ecology, and these themes are further linked to the assessment of ecosystem services. Methods in spatial ecology benefit from explicit consideration of spatial autocorrelation, and applications discussed in this review include species distribution modeling, remote sensing of community and ecosystem properties, and models of climate change. The linkages of the Special Issue papers to these emerging issues are described.				Faculty of ITC, Dep Nat.

Improving the synoptic mapping of coral reef geomorphology using object-based image analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE												Monitoring coral reefs is of great importance for environmental management of these ecosystems. The use of remote sensing and geographical information systems enables rapid and effective mapping of the geomorphology of reefs that can be used as a basis for biodiversity and habitat assessments. However, pixel-based approaches have not been appropriate for detailed mapping of such complex systems. An object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach was used in this study to map intra-reef geomorphology of coral reefs across the Torres Strait region using Landsat ETM+ imagery. By combining image analysis techniques and a non-parametric neural network classifier and incorporating additional spatial information such as context, shape and texture, the accuracy of the segmentation and classification was improved considerably. A large-scale synoptic map of 10 geomorphological classes was produced for Torres Strait with an overall accuracy of 75%. The OBIA approach employed in this research has enabled the geomorphology of reef platforms to be mapped for the first time at such accuracy and descriptive resolution.

Hyperspectral remote sensing for estimating aboveground biomass and for exploring species richness patterns of grassland habitats	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Dry grassland sites are amongst the most species-rich habitats of central Europe and it is necessary to design effective management schemes for monitoring of their biomass production. This study explored the potential of hyperspectral remote sensing for mapping aboveground biomass in grassland habitats along a dry-mesic gradient, independent of a specific type or phenological period. Statistical models were developed between biomass samples and spectral reflectance collected with a field spectroradiometer, and it was further investigated to what degree the calibrated biomass models could be scaled to Hyperion data. Furthermore, biomass prediction was used as a surrogate for productivity for grassland habitats and the relationship between biomass and plant species richness was explored. Grassland samples were collected at four time steps during the growing season to capture normally occurring variation due to canopy growth stage and management factors. The relationships were investigated between biomass and (1) existing broad-and narrowband vegetation indices, (2) narrowband normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) type indices, and (3) multiple linear regression (MLR) with individual spectral bands. Best models were obtained from the MLR and narrowband NDVI-type indices. Spectral regions related to plant water content were identified as the best estimators of biomass. Models calibrated with narrowband NDVI indices were best for up-scaling the field-developed models to the Hyperion scene. Furthermore, promising results were obtained from linking biomass estimations from the Hyperion scene with plant species richness of grassland habitats. Overall, it is concluded that ratio-based NDVI-type indices are less prone to scaling errors and thus offer higher potential for mapping grassland biomass using hyperspectral data from space-borne sensors.

We addressed this by: (1) determining if fire regimes differed between vegetation remnants of differing sizes and uncleared vegetation, using analysis of satellite imagery; (2) determining vegetation structural responses to time since fire in three habitats: mallee-shrub, Acacia shrublands and mallee-heath; and (3) exploring the consequences of these differences, using the fire-sensitive malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata) as a case study. Fire was infrequent in small remnants, more frequent in large remnants, and most frequent in uncleared areas. Key vegetation structural attributes for malleefowl, such as canopy and litter cover, increased beyond 45 years post-fire in mallee-shrub, reached a plateau in mallee-heath after 30-40 years, and declined in Acacia shrublands after 25-40 years. Senescence in long-unburnt vegetation, combined with rare contemporary fires, suggest progressive decline in habitat quality of Acacia shrublands for malleefowl in the wheatbelt. In the adjacent, continuously vegetated landscapes, more frequent (and extensive) fires in structurally developing mallee-shrub communities are of concern for malleefowl conservation.

It is a very useful environmental indicator that can be used to measure the impacts of urbanization on surface runoff, water quality, air quality, biodiversity and microclimate. Therefore, accurate estimation of impervious surfaces is critical for urban environmental monitoring, land management, decision-making and urban planning. Many approaches have been developed to estimate surface imperviousness, using remotely sensed data with various spatial resolutions. However, few studies, have investigated the effects of spatial resolution on estimating surface imperviousness. We compare medium-resolution Landsat data with high-resolution SPOT images to quantify the imperviousness in Beijing, China. The results indicated that the overall 91% accuracy of estimates of imperviousness based on TM data was considerably higher than the 81% accuracy of the SPOT data. The higher resolution SPOT data did not always predict the imperviousness of the land better than the TM data. At the whole city level, the TM data better predicts the percentage cover of impervious surfaces. At the sub-city level, however, the ring belts from the central core to the urban-rural peripheral, the SPOT data may better predict the imperviousness. These results highlighted the need to combine multiple resolution data to quantify the percentage of imperviousness, as higher resolution data do not necessarily lead to more accurate estimates. The methodology and results in this study can be utilized to identify the most suitable remote sensing data to quickly and efficiently extract the pattern of the impervious land, which could provide the base for further study on many related urban environmental problems.

This study focuses on testing the predictions made 10 yr ago concerning the evolution of a mangrove forest in Galle-Unawatuna, Sri Lanka. The very high resolution (VHR) ground inventory revealed that the adult mangrove species composition is dominated by Rhizophora apiculata, Excoecaria agallocha, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza and B. sexangula, with a total density of 216 to 267 stems 0.1 ha(-1) and a basal area of 1.19 to 1.44 m(2) 0.1 ha(-1). However, both young and juvenile vegetation in most sectors were dominated solely by B. gymnorrhiza (128 to 869 stems and 356 to 1482 propagules 0.1 ha(-1)). The recent decadal changes between 1994 and 2004 observed through IKONOS imagery and ground truthing confirmed many of the predictions and showed dynamic shifts in young/adult vegetation of B. gymnorrhiza. Although dominance of R. apiculata and E. agallocha has been seen to alternate over decades (1956 to 2004), the emerging growth of B. gymnorrhiza might cause yet another transition of this mangrove area into a Bruguiera-dominated forest in the near future, resulting in the conclusion that the 'moving mosaic' pattern of mangrove species distribution at Galle-Unawatuna still persists. We maintain that this mangrove forest is probably one of the most dynamic in the world in terms of species turnover. To our knowledge, the present study represents one of the few long-term field-based monitoring research projects on mangroves using VHR remote sensing and VHR fieldwork at decadal intervals, and is probably the only study testing forest development predictions made in the past.

Response of female beetles to LIDAR derived topographic variables in Eastern boreal mixedwood forests (Coleoptera, Carabidae)	ZOOKEYS					Symposium Honoring the Careers of Ross and Joyce Bell and their Contributions to Scientific Work	JUN 12-15, 2010	Burlington, VT					Biodiversity monitoring is increasingly being bolstered with high resolution data derived from remote sensing such as LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). We derived a series of topographical variables, including slope, azimuth, ground curvature and flow accumulation from LIDAR images and compared these to captures of female carabids in pitfall traps in Eastern boreal mixedwood forests. We developed a series of species-specific logistic models predicting the proportion of females for eight dominant species, including Agonum retractum, Calathus ingratus, Platynus decenth, Pterostichus adstrictus, Pterostichus coracinus, Pterostichus pensylvanicus, Sphaeroderus nitidicollis and Synuchus impunctatus. We used these models to test three hypotheses related to how the modest topography in boreal forests could influence the availability of microhabitats and possibly potential sites for oviposition and larval development. In general, topographic features such as north facing slopes and high flow accumulation were important predictors of the proportion of females. Models derived from larger scale topography, such as hillsides or small watersheds on the order of 1/4-1 ha were better predictors of the proportion of females than were models derived from finer scale topography such as hummocks and small depressions. We conclude that topography likely influences the distribution of carabids based on hydrological mechanisms rather than factors related to temperature. We further suggest based on the scale of responses that these hydrological mechanisms may be linked to the attenuation of past disturbances by wildfire and the propensity of unburned forest patches and fire skips.																	1313-2989						2011		147			SI		623	639		10.3897/zookeys.147.2013								WOS:000299592400025	22371678

Assessment of Fragmentation and Disturbance Patterns in Eastern Ghats: A Case Study in RV Nagar Range, Visakhapatnam District, Andhra Pradesh, India	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												At present the biodiversity in Eastern Ghats is threatened by loss of habitats, exploitation and unscientific management of natural resources, forest fire, biological invasion and other anthropogenic pressures. In this context, we have assessed the forest cover changes, fragmentation and disturbance in the R.V. Nagar Range of Eastern Ghats region, Andhra Pradesh using satellite remote sensing and GIS techniques. Satellite data of IRS-1A LISS II of 1988 and IRS-P6 LISS III of 2006 were assessed for forest cover changes in 1 sq.km grid and generated as Sensitivity Index map. Further the road and settlement buffer of 1000 m was generated to represent Threat Index map. From 1988 to 2006, the forest cover had a total cover loss of 35.2 sq.km and increase in scrub cover by 7.2%. Over all change analysis from 1988 to 2006 with reference to forest cover indicates, negative changes (loss of forest area) accounted for 48.1 sq.km area and positive changes (gain of forest) for an area of 12.1 sq.km of area. The results of the change detection using multi-date satellite imagery suggest degradation in forest cover over two decades, which necessitates the conservation measures in this range with high priority.																	0255-660X					DEC	2010	38	4					633	639		10.1007/s12524-011-0077-3								WOS:000288560900007						
J	DeFries, R; Karanth, KK; Pareeth, S				DeFries, Ruth; Karanth, Krithi K.; Pareeth, Sajid			Interactions between protected areas and their surroundings in human-dominated tropical landscapes	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Protected areas (PAs) often depend on landscapes surrounding them to maintain flows of organisms, water, nutrients, and energy. Park managers have little authority over the surrounding landscape although land use change and infrastructure development can have major impacts on the integrity of a PA. The need for scientifically-based regional-scale land use planning around protected areas is acute in human-dominated landscapes to balance conservation goals with livelihood needs for fuelwood, fodder, and other ecosystem services. As a first step, we propose the designation of a "zone of interaction" (ZOI) around PAs that encompasses hydrologic, ecological, and socioeconomic interactions between a PA and the surrounding landscape. We illustrate the concept by delineating the ZOI in three Indian PAs - Kanha, Ranthambore, and Nagarahole - using remote sensing, population census, and field data. The ZOI in Ranthambore is three times the size of the park and is largely defined by the socioeconomic interactions with surrounding villages. Ranthambore is located in headwaters and wildlife corridors are largely severed. In Nagarahole, the ZOI is more than seven times larger than the park and includes upstream watershed and elephant corridors. Kanha's ZOI is approximately four times larger than the park and is mostly defined by contiguous surrounding forest. The three examples highlight the differing extents of ZOIs when applying equivalent criteria, even though all are located in densely-populated landscapes. Quantitative understanding of which activities (e.g. collection of forest products, grazing, road construction, tourism development) and which locations within the ZOI are most crucial to conservation goals will enable improved land use planning around PAs in human-dominated landscapes.

Landscape-level effects on avifauna within tropical agriculture in the Western Ghats: Insights for management and conservation	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												A critical handicap to tropical biodiversity conservation efforts in agroecosystems is the unknowns regarding the influence of landscape-scale factors on the persistence of species. To address these uncertainties, we explored two essential landscape-scale questions, within India's biologically-rich Western Ghats, examining two nearby human-dominated landscapes that dramatically differed in their pattern of land cover. First, how does the proximity of intact forest patches affect bird community composition within agricultural landscapes? Second, can simple remote sensing-derived measures (brightness, wetness, and NDVI) be used to estimate native bird species composition within those landscapes? In both landscapes, as distance to intact forest decreased, the similarity in bird community composition between agricultural areas and intact forest increased. This suggests that the retention of tropical forest bird communities within human-dominated landscapes critically depends on the maintenance of nearby intact forest. In an answer to the second question, the remote sensing measures correlated with forest-affiliated avian species richness in only one of the two landscapes, reflecting an ecological difference between the two in the response of forest bird species to local agricultural conditions. In the landscape where a correlation was found, there was high variation in vegetative structure, which strongly impacted both the remote sensing measures and forest bird species richness. In the other landscape, forest species richness strongly correlated with changes in tree species composition in the agriculture, a factor that could not be detected by the remote sensing metrics. In order to successfully conserve biodiversity in tropical agricultural landscapes, our findings show that it is essential to conserve intact forest within those landscapes and to understand the effect of local agricultural practices on species.

BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												In India, conservation of biodiversity goes hand in hand with human welfare, as millions of people live adjacent or within protected areas and depend upon forests products. The high density and biomass requirements of these households could result in the degradation of forests and loss of biodiversity. We assessed the collection of forest products among households in five sites in the Western and Eastern Ghats of peninsular India: the Kogar region of the Central Western Ghats, the Bandipur and Sigur regions of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, the Kalakad-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve of the southern Western Ghats and Similipal Tiger Reserve of the northern Eastern Ghats, and tested whether extraction pressure on forests was associated with the proportion of agricultural households, wage labour and population density. We also examined whether data on loss of cover as stated by the State of the Forest Reports was supported by field data. The regions differed in land use: Kogar, KMTR and Similipal were primarily agricultural regions, whereas households engaged in wage labour or in running small businesses were predominant in Sigur and Bandipur. Fuel-wood was collected ubiquitously for household use in all sites, used mainly for domestic requirements and secondarily for generating income. Green leaves for making fertilizer and fodder were collected for household use and did not enter the market. Cattle manure for the global organic coffee industry was a major forest product in Bandipur and Sigur. Extraction pressure on forests was positively associated with the availability of wage labour and was negatively with the proportion of agricultural households. Data from official sources seem inadequate to measure forest degradation in protected forests. Accurate estimation of forest condition through field assessments and remote sensing, and understanding the socio-economic variables associated with forest loss and degradation are needed for the sustainable management of Indian protected areas.

Spatially explicit ecosystem service values are important for ecosystem service management. However, it is difficult to quantify ecosystem services. Remote sensing provides images covering Earth surface, which by nature are spatially explicit. Thus, remote sensing can be useful for quantitative assessment of ecosystem services. This paper reviews spatially explicit ecosystem service studies conducted in ecology and remote sensing in order to find out how remote sensing can be used for ecosystem service assessment. Several important areas considered include land cover, biodiversity, and carbon, water and soil related ecosystem services. We found that remote sensing can be used for ecosystem service assessment in three different ways: direct monitoring, indirect monitoring, and combined use with ecosystem models. Some plant and water related ecosystem services can be directly monitored by remote sensing. Most commonly, remote sensing can provide surrogate information on plant and soil characteristics in an ecosystem. For ecosystem process related ecosystem services, remote sensing can help measure spatially explicit parameters. We conclude that acquiring good in-situ measurements and selecting appropriate remote sensor data in terms of resolution are critical for accurate assessment of ecosystem services.

Cryptic destruction of India's native forests	CONSERVATION LETTERS												India sustains some of the world's most imperiled forests. The Forest Survey of India recently announced that forest cover in India had expanded by nearly 5% over the past decade. This result, while technically accurate, is misleading. The Forest Survey estimates forest cover by using automated algorithms to analyze satellite imagery-an approach that fails to distinguish native forests from tree plantations, which are often monocultures of exotic species that have limited value for endangered biodiversity. Since the early 1990s, tree plantations have expanded in India at an estimated rate of roughly 15,400 km2/year. Subtracting plantations from total forest cover shows that native forests in India have declined by 1.5%-2.7% per year. The limited precision of our estimate highlights a paucity of data on native forest cover in India-a problem requiring urgent attention. Forest cutting for fuelwood has been the biggest driver of forest loss and thinning in India. Like India, many nations now rely on satellite imagery to discern changes in vegetation cover, and these frequently lump native, exotic, and degraded forest types. Without sufficiently high-resolution imagery and adequate safeguards, such approaches could paint a misleading picture of the fate of the world's native forests.

Multifractals, with which more detailed information can be obtained from a distribution than mono-fractal does, is especially suited to the description of complex patterns. In our paper, three sites (256 x 256 cells per site, 100 m per cell) from the upper, middle and lower reaches of Yanhe watershed in the Loess Plateau were selected to test the scaling properties of agricultural landscape patterns in 1980, 2000 and 2006 using multifractal Renyi dimensions analysis. We found that: (1) the distributions of cropland, grassland and woodland patterns are multiscaling over nearly four orders of magnitude in scale, whereas water bodies and residential areas are not multifractally distributed, which may result from the resolution of Landsat TM remote sensing images; (2) spatially, the multifractal techniques are capable to uncover subtle differences in land use patterns between different reaches of the watershed that could correspond to their distinct, underlying abiotic and biotic processes; and (3) temporally, the multifractal spectra demonstrate little difference between 1980 and 2000 but a sharp change in 2006, the former depicting the land use patterns in an equilibrium state and the latter the effect of government policies such as large-scale eco-environment conservation programmes starting in the late 20th century. The fact that scaling behaviors exist across a heterogeneous landscape suggests that there may be some simple mechanism that governs agricultural landscape change. Further work on this problem may improve our understanding of the mechanism and enhance our capability to more effectively manage land use. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Large-Area Classification and Mapping of Forest and Land Cover in the Brazilian Amazon: A Comparative Analysis of ALOS/PALSAR and Landsat Data Sources	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												Information on the distribution of tropical forests is critical to decision-making on a host of globally significant issues ranging from climate stabilization and biodiversity conservation to poverty reduction and human health. The majority of tropical nations need high-resolution, satellite-based maps of their forests as the international community now works to craft an incentive-based mechanism to compensate tropical nations for maintaining their forests intact. The effectiveness of such a mechanism will depend in large part on the capacity of current and near-future Earth observation satellites to provide information that meets the requirements of international monitoring protocols now being discussed. Here we assess the ability of a state-of-the-art satellite radar sensor, the ALOS/PALSAR, to support large-area land cover classification as well as high-resolution baseline mapping of tropical forest cover. Through a comprehensive comparative analysis involving twenty separate PALSAR-and Landsat-based classifications, we confirm the potential of PALSAR as an accurate (>90%) source for spatially explicit estimates of forest cover based on data and analyses from a large and diverse region encompassing the Xingu River headwaters in southeastern Amazonia. Pair-wise spatial comparisons among maps derived from PALSAR, Landsat, and PRODES, the Brazilian Amazon deforestation monitoring program, revealed a high degree of spatial similarity. Given that a long-term data record consisting of current and future spaceborne radar sensors is now expected, our results point to the important role that spaceborne imaging radar can play in complementing optical remote sensing to enable the design of robust forest monitoring systems.																	1939-1404					DEC	2010	3	4	2				594	604		10.1109/JSTARS.2010.2076398								WOS:000285357400005						
J	Grainger, A				Grainger, Alan			Uncertainty in the construction of global knowledge of tropical forests	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Knowledge of tropical forest change remains uncertain, affecting our ability to produce accurate estimates of globally aggregated parameters to support clear global statements about 'the tropical forests'. This paper reviews current methods for constructing global knowledge of changes in tropical forest area, carbon density, biodiversity and ecosystem services. It finds a deficiency in formal institutions for global measurement and constructing global knowledge. In their absence, informal institutions have proliferated, increasing the spread of estimates. This is exacerbated by dependence on inaccurate official statistics, which has limited construction of knowledge about forest area change through modelling. Employing the new concept of the Knowledge Exchange Chain shows the interdependence of different disciplines in constructing composite information. Limitations linked to compartmentalization and scale are present, as predicted by the 'post-normal hypothesis'. Disciplinary compartmentalization has impeded construction of information about forest carbon and biodiversity change. There is growth in interdisciplinary research into modelling forest change and estimating carbon emissions using remote sensing data, but not in studying biodiversity. Continuing uncertainty has implications for implementing the Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) scheme. Uncertainty could be reduced by expanding formal scientific institutions, e.g. by establishing an operational scientific global forest monitoring system, and devising formal generic rules for constructing global environmental knowledge.				lyp, maggie/G-1471-2011													0309-1333	1477-0296				DEC	2010	34	6					811	844		10.1177/0309133310387326								WOS:000285245300005

An original non-parametric image interpretation methodology was applied on late summer images. The combined GIS and statistical analysis of 217 coastal sections showed that the helophytic macrophyte belt, dominated by common reed (Phragmites australis), has rapidly widened during the last two decades, with an average expansion rate of 2.2 m per year. Statistical model revealed that the vicinity of large inflows had the strongest positive effect on the expansion of macrophytes, on average 1.6 times. In some sub-regions of the lake shore, we found the suppressing effect of the presence of small inflows on the change of helophytic belt width. This effect, however, was probably interconnected with the presence of human activity at the shoreline, which itself had statistically near-marginal suppressing effect on the widening of the reed belt. We showed that medium resolution satellite images can successfully be used for the retrospective monitoring of macrophyte vegetation in the littoral zone of large water bodies by applying very simple image classification methodology. As the lake coastal areas showed a tendency to become overgrown with reed and other macrophytes even in conditions of generally reduced agricultural intensity in the catchment area, we hypothesize that the clonal expansion of reed is probably triggered by the complex of drivers: large seasonal fluctuations in the water level create specific low water conditions in estuaries in combination with nutrients supply resolved from lake bottom or brought by rivers. Estuary areas are characterised by mineral sediments suitable for anchoring and protection-provision against destructive wave- and ice-action. Probably the most efficient biodiversity conservation policy to revealed macrophytic expansion is the reactivation of disrupted management activities along the coastline. (C) 2010 Elsevier By.

The importance of fine-scale savanna heterogeneity for reptiles and small mammals	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Tropical savannas are an important reservoir of global biodiversity. Australia's extensive savannas, although still largely intact, are experiencing substantial declines in terrestrial biodiversity due to a variety of interrelated effects of altered fire regimes, grazing and increases in invasive species. These disturbance processes are spatially variable, combine to increase landscape to local-scale landscape heterogeneity, but rarely result in well-defined patch boundaries. We quantified the importance of this heterogeneity for native reptile and small mammal species in a tropical savanna landscape of Queensland, Australia. We used high resolution remote sensing imagery (IKONOS) to map habitat pattern at a 4 m spatial resolution and at variable extents. We found that landscapes dominated by grass or bare ground had low reptile and small mammal diversity, while landscapes with a heterogeneous mix of grass, bare ground and trees had high species diversity and relative abundance of most species. Landscape heterogeneity may increase reptile and small mammal species richness by: (i) increasing the variety and abundance of foraging resources such as seeds and invertebrates; (ii) providing cover from predators and high summer temperatures; and (iii) increasing functional connectivity and dispersal success. The importance of these resources and processes varies among individual species and at different spatial scales, reiterating the need to consider habitat requirements of multiple species in landscape management and conservation planning.

Ecosystem Carbon Storage Across the Grassland-Forest Transition in the High Andes of Manu National Park, Peru	ECOSYSTEMS												Improved management of carbon storage by terrestrial biomes has significant value for mitigating climate change. The carbon value of such management has the potential to provide additional income to rural communities and provide biodiversity and climate adaptation co-benefits. Here, we quantify the carbon stores in a 49,300-ha landscape centered on the cloud forest-grassland transition of the high Andes in Manu National Park, Peru. Aboveground carbon densities were measured across the landscape by field sampling of 70 sites above and below the treeline. The forest near the treeline contained 63.4 +/- A 5.2 Mg C ha(-1) aboveground, with an additional 13.9 +/- A 2.8 Mg C ha(-1) estimated to be stored in the coarse roots, using a root to shoot ratio of 0.26. Puna grasslands near the treeline were found to store 7.5 +/- A 0.7 Mg C ha(-1) in aboveground biomass. Comparing our result to soil data gathered by Zimmermann and others (Ecosystems 13:62-74, 2010), we found the ratio of belowground:aboveground carbon decreased from 15.8 on the puna to 8.6 in the transition zone and 2.1 in the forest. No significant relationships were found between carbon densities and slope, altitude or fire disturbance history, though grazing (for puna) was found to reduce aboveground carbon densities significantly. We scaled our study sites to the study region with remote sensing observations from Landsat. The carbon sequestration potential of improved grazing management and assisted upslope treeline migration was also estimated. Afforestation of puna at the treeline could generate revenues of US $1,374 per ha over the project lifetime via commercialization of the carbon credits from gains in aboveground carbon stocks. Uncertainties in the fate of the large soil carbon stocks under an afforestation scenario exist.

J	Huang, N; Wang, ZM; Liu, DW; Niu, Z				Huang, Ni; Wang, Zongming; Liu, Dianwei; Niu, Zheng			Selecting Sites for Converting Farmlands to Wetlands in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China, Based on Remote Sensing and GIS	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Wetlands in the Sanjiang Plain are rich in biodiversity and natural resources in the northeast of China. However, this wetland area has decreased in size and deteriorated in quality owing to expanded agricultural activities since the 1950s. Converting farmlands to wetlands is necessary to improve these conditions. Using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technologies, we derived farmland productivity data and hydrology data for the Sanjiang Plain. The farmland productivity data were derived from land use and net primary productivity (NPP) data of the MODIS products. We obtained three productivity farmland classes (low, medium, and high) through the NPP anomaly percentage method. We were only concerned with the low-productivity farmland. Hydrology data were modeled with a wetness index, which was derived from Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data. Based on these two data layers, we identified and prioritized sites for the conversion of farmlands to wetlands. The areas with low farmland productivity and medium or high wetness values have potential to support the conversion of farmlands to wetlands. Potential sites were prioritized in terms of patch size and proximity to natural wetlands and water bodies. We obtained three priority classes, among which the high-priority class would be used as the areas for the recent conversion of farmlands to wetlands. The area of this class was 75,888 ha and accounted for 1.3% of the total farmland area.																	0364-152X					NOV	2010	46	5					790	800		10.1007/s00267-010-9547-6								WOS:000283360300012	20821010

Ecotourism Impacts in the Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TOURISM RESEARCH												Ecotourism promotes responsible travel to natural areas, environmental conservation and the well-being of local communities. Eco-lodges are an important component of ecotourism ventures but an infrequently researched component of this field. Considering their influence on the natural environment (design and operation) and local communities (employment practices and purchases), the success of ecotourism depends, in part, on the performance of eco-lodges. This project studies the effects of the Punta Islita (PI) eco-lodge on the Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica. An interdisciplinary nested-scale analysis, combining guest and household interviews with multi-temporal remote sensing analysis of forest cover change of the lodge and surrounding areas, is used to evaluate the environmental, economic and social impacts of ecotourism in the region. Our results show significant positive contributions of the PI eco-lodge on forest cover, environmental conservation, and local economic incomes within the surrounding communities. For local livelihoods, the PI eco-lodge was seen as having positive social, cultural and economic impacts for nearly all societal variables for both employees and their neighbours. The PI eco-lodge was also perceived as reducing alcoholism, drug addiction and prostitution, where conventional tourism on the Peninsula was shown to increase these 'societal ills'. Land value and product pricing were the few variables believed to have increased as a result of tourism on the Peninsula. For conservation, the PI eco-lodge property had the highest rates of reforestation within the Nicoya Peninsula and remains the scale most reforested in both forest cover change and total forest cover. In fact, at the landscape scale, we find that the Pacific coast of the Nicoya, where the bulk of ecotourism occurs, has undergone reforestation, whereas forest interiors have been deforested. Historically, reforestation occurred as cattle ranching credit programs were halted by the government and households in the area left to find better job opportunities. The PI eco-lodge, as a source of good employment, resulted in worker migration back to the surrounding area, resulting, in some cases, in increased deforestation. Overall, we feel that the PI eco-lodge serves as an example of successful ecotourism. However, increasing development in the region, in particular by standard hotel operations and large condo developments, seeks to capitalise on the region's natural beauty and may reverse land cover trends if they are not accompanied by adequate forest conservation strategies and stresses the importance of monitoring and assessing the impacts of accommodations tied to nature-based tourism operations.

Several quality review papers have contributed to this field. However, these papers often discuss the issues from the standpoint of an ecologist or a biodiversity specialist. This review focuses on the spaceborne remote sensing of EBC from the perspective of remote sensing specialists, i.e., it is organized in the context of state-of-the-art remote sensing technology, including instruments and techniques. Herein, the instruments to be discussed consist of high spatial resolution, hyperspectral, thermal infrared, small-satellite constellation, and LIDAR sensors; and the techniques refer to image classification, vegetation index (VI), inversion algorithm, data fusion, and the integration of remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS).																	1424-8220					NOV	2010	10	11					9647	9667		10.3390/s101109647								WOS:000284578200008	22163432					
J	Mondal, P; Southworth, J				Mondal, Pinki; Southworth, Jane			Evaluation of conservation interventions using a cellular automata-Markov model	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The field of biodiversity conservation increasingly recognizes the need for empirical evaluations of conservation interventions. While the amount of money invested into conservation and the number of protected areas across the globe have been increasing in the past few decades, few well-designed empirical studies try to show what could have happened in the absence of the conservation efforts. In this paper, we propose an empirical method to evaluate such conservation intervention. We integrate a cellular automata-Markov modeling approach and a counterfactual approach showing what may have happened in the absence of a certain conservation intervention. We test this method in a human-dominated tropical landscape in Central India; however, our method is transferable to any other socio-ecological setting. The study area is located in the tropical forests of Central India and has witnessed several management strategies since its declaration as a protected area in the mid-1970s. However, landscape practitioners have identified the revised forest policy of 1988 to play a vital role in this landscape. We chose this particular forest policy as the conservation intervention in our study and tested our method using this landscape as a template. We used remote sensing and GIS techniques to analyze multi-sensor satellite data from the last 30 years to monitor forest transitions and compare them with the counterfactual scenario. Our findings not only shed light on the importance of national-level policies in governing forest dynamics, but also established our proposed method as an effective tool for empirical evaluation of conservation intervention, particularly in developing countries.

Rural property size drives patterns of upland and riparian forest retention in a tropical deforestation frontier	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS												Deforestation in Brazilian Amazonia accounts for a disproportionate global scale fraction of both carbon emissions from biomass burning and biodiversity erosion through habitat loss. Here we use field- and remote-sensing data to examine the effects of private landholding size on the amount and type of forest cover retained within economically active rural properties in an aging southern Amazonian deforestation frontier. Data on both upland and riparian forest cover from a survey of 300 rural properties indicated that 49.4% (SD = 29.0%) of the total forest cover was maintained as of 2007. and that property size is a key regional-scale determinant of patterns of deforestation and land-use change. Small properties (<= 150 ha) retained a lower proportion of forest (20.7%, SD = 17.6) than did large properties (>150 ha; 55.6%, SD = 27.2). Generalized linear models showed that property size had a positive effect on remaining areas of both upland and total forest cover. Using a Landsat time-series, the age of first clear-cutting that could be mapped within the boundaries of each property had a negative effect on the proportion of upland, riparian, and total forest cover retained. Based on these data, we show contrasts in land-use strategies between smallholders and largeholders, as well as differences in compliance with legal requirements in relation to minimum forest cover set-asides within private landholdings. This suggests that property size structure must be explicitly considered in landscape-scale conservation planning initiatives guiding agro-pastoral frontier expansion into remaining areas of tropical forest.

J	Brisson, J; de Blois, S; Lavoie, C				Brisson, Jacques; de Blois, Sylvie; Lavoie, Claude			Roadside as Invasion Pathway for Common Reed (Phragmites australis)	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												The rapid progression of an invasive genotype of common reed along roads and other linear infrastructures in North America provides one of the most spectacular examples of the role of transportation corridors as invasion pathways. In this paper, we discuss ecological patterns and processes in roadside habitats important for understanding the invasion dynamics of common reed from coastal areas inland. Frequent disturbances in roadsides combined with potentially high levels of nutrients from adjacent land and stress conditions (from deicing salt and other pollutants) mimic the conditions unfortunately found more and more in natural wetlands. The novel contribution of roads is the creation of linear wetlands with an unprecedented level of connectivity. Genetic evidence shows that invasion inland coincides with the intensification of the road network. Time series analysis of remote sensing data reveals impressive rates of invasion of roadsides and other linear infrastructures, suggesting prime conditions for common reed in these novel habitats. Whereas reed dispersal along roads was thought to be largely due to rhizome transport, new evidence suggests a significant contribution of sexual reproduction and seedling establishment, likely enhanced by climate warming at northern latitudes. There is little evidence that other wetland plants can slow down vegetative expansion of common reed in roadside habitats, but plant cover could prevent seedling establishment and shading by shrubs and trees limit lateral clonal expansion. The fact that common reed possibly provides water treatment and other ecosystem services in roadsides must be carefully weighed against the threat to biodiversity in natural systems. All this begs for investigating urgently if, where, and how we should intervene without compromising the great value of wetlands of conservation interest intersected by roads.

Statistical modelling of habitat suitability is an important tool for planning conservation interventions, particularly for areas where species distribution data are expensive or hard to collect. Sometimes however the predictor variables typically used in habitat suitability modelling are themselves difficult to obtain or not meaningful at the geographical extent of the study, as is the case for the Alaotran gentle lemur Hapalemur alaotrensis, a critically endangered lemur confined to the marshes of Lake Alaotra in Madagascar. 2. We developed a habitat suitability model where all predictor variables, including vegetation indices and image texture measures at different scales (as surrogates for habitat structure), were derived from Landsat7 satellite imagery. Using relatively few presence records, the maximum entropy (Maxent) approach and AUC were used to assess the performance of candidate predictor variables, for studying the effect of scale, model selection and mapping suitable habitat. 3. This study demonstrated the utility of satellite imagery as a single source of predictor variables for a Maxent habitat suitability model at the landscape level, within a restricted geographical extent and with a fine grain, in a case where predictor variables typically used at the macro-scale level (e.g. climatic and topographic) were not applicable. 4. In the case of H. alaotrensis, the methodology generated a habitat suitability map to inform conservation management in Lake Alaotra and a replicable protocol to allow rapid updates to habitat suitability maps in the future. The exploration of candidate predictor variables allowed the identification of scales that appear ecologically relevant for the species. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study presents a cost-effective combination of maximum entropy habitat suitability modelling and satellite imagery, where all predictor variables are derived solely from Landsat7 images. With a habitat modelling method like Maxent that shows good performance with few presence samples and Landsat images now freely available, the methodology can play an important role in rapid assessments of the status of species at the landscape level in data-poor regions, when typical macro-scale environmental predictors are of little use or difficult to obtain.

Landsat TM data was used to quantify the changes of the S. glauca community between 1992, 2002, and 2007. The loss of this plant community was mainly associated with reclamation for aquaculture ponds from 1992 to 2002. Using the non-dense, mosaic pixel model from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), we computed the coverage information of the S. glauca community. For each study species, the S. glauca vegetation coverage characteristics were determined from GPS locations of 407 nesting site separately. The mean vegetation coverage of nesting sites of L. saundersi, T. tetanus, and S. hirundo were 35.0 +/- 6.8%, 52.2 +/- 6.9% and 24.8 +/- 3.6%, respectively. Over 15 years, coverage of S. glauca continuously increased due to an expansion of exotic Spartina alterniflora (smooth cord-grass) constraining early sucessional S. glauca. Eventually the S. glauca community may become too dense for nesting by L. saundersi and S. hirundo.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				OCT	2010	30	5					879	888		10.1007/s13157-010-0070-6								WOS:000285109900005

A framework for mapping vegetation over broad spatial extents: A technique to aid land management across jurisdictional boundaries	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Mismatches in boundaries between natural ecosystems and land governance units often complicate an ecosystem approach to management and conservation. For example, information used to guide management, such as vegetation maps, may not be available or consistent across entire ecosystems. This study was undertaken within a single biogeographic region (the Murray Mallee) spanning three Australian states. Existing vegetation maps could not be used as vegetation classifications differed between states. Our aim was to describe and map 'tree mallee' vegetation consistently across a 104 000 km(2) area of this region. Hierarchical cluster analyses, incorporating floristic data from 713 sites, were employed to identify distinct vegetation types. Neural network classification models were used to map these vegetation types across the region, with additional data from 634 validation sites providing a measure of map accuracy. Four distinct vegetation types were recognised: Triodia Mallee, Heathy Mallee, Chenopod Mallee and Shrubby Mallee. Neural network models predicted the occurrence of three of them with 79% accuracy. Validation results identified that map accuracy was 67% (kappa = 0.42) when using independent data. The framework employed provides a simple approach to describing and mapping vegetation consistently across broad spatial extents. Specific outcomes include: (1) a system of vegetation classification suitable for use across this biogeographic region; (2) a consistent vegetation map to inform land-use planning and biodiversity management at local and regional scales; and (3) a quantification of map accuracy using independent data. This approach is applicable to other regions facing similar challenges associated with integrating vegetation data across jurisdictional boundaries. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Estimating vascular plant species richness on Horn Island, Mississippi using small-footprint airborne LIDAR	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Most remote sensing studies of species diversity have been based on the use of passive imagery representing the horizontal dimensions of ecosystems. However, LIDAR (light detection and ranging), provides a means to accurately quantify vertical structure. The goal of this study was to evaluate vascular plant species richness on a coastal barrier island using indicators of community vertical structure derived from airborne, multiple-return LIDAR data. Returns from a 3 m buffer area surrounding each of 90, 15 m vegetation line transects were extracted from LIDAR data of Horn Island, Mississippi, acquired in April, 2004. LIDAR indices did not correlate with richness when data for all habitats were combined. When habitats were considered separately, several LIDAR indices correlated significantly (p <= 0.05) with richness in marsh, meadow and woodland habitats. Best-fit indices indicated the importance of vegetation height and structural complexity in estimating plant species richness.																	1931-3195					SEP 23	2010	4								043545	10.1117/1.3501119								WOS:000286067100001

Major landscape elements (geology, geomorphology, soils, vegetation and land use) were mapped as biogeomorphic land units using remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS). Associations between these variables were analyzed by map fusion and the results were expressed on a land unit map (scale ca. 1:100,000). Volcanic structures are dominant in the study area. Lava flows cover most of the region, mainly as basalt; several pyroclastic cones are widely distributed over the area but are dominant in the southeast region. A hypsometric map derived from a digital elevation model (DEM), and intersected with a land cover/use map showed an altitudinal gradient of vegetation. Rainforest grows at lower altitudes (0 to 700 m) and Virola, Juglans and Chionantus are distributed from 700 to 900 m. These species are located on slopes of basalt and andesites intercalated with tephra, recent isolated stratovolcano structures and an erosive flood plain. At higher altitudes (900 to 1100 m) the forest identified as Chionantus Ulmus Randia is associated with cinder cones. A Quercus Litmus forest (900 to 1400 m) covers the slopes of the highest volcano (San Martin) and surrounding areas, while evergreen (elfin) forest is at the top of this mountain (1660 m).

Application of Landscape Ecology and Remote Sensing for Assessment, Monitoring and Conservation of Biodiversity	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Landscape ecology, inter alia, addresses the question as to how altered landscape patterns affect the distribution, persistence, and abundance of a species. Landscape ecology plays an important role in integrating the different scales of biodiversity from habitat patch to biome level. Satellite remote sensing technology with multi-sensor capabilities offers multi-scale information on landscape composition and configuration. Advances in geospatial analytical tools and spatial statistics have improved the capability to quantify spatial heterogeneity. Globally, landscape level characterization of biodiversity has become an important discipline of science. Considering the vast extent, heterogeneity, and ecological and economic importance of forest landscapes, significant efforts have been made in India during the past decade to strengthen landscape level biodiversity characterization. The generic frame work of studies comprises preparation of national databases providing information on composition and configuration of different landscapes using multi-scale remote sensing techniques, understanding the landscape patterns using geospatial models to elicit disturbance and diversity patterns and application of this information for bioprospecting and conservation purposes. Studies on hierarchical linkage of multi-scale information to study the processes of change, landscape function, dynamics of habitat fragmentation, invasion, development of network of conservation areas based on the understanding of multi-species responses to landscape mosaics, macro-ecological studies to understand environment and species richness, habitat and species transitions and losses, landscape level solutions to adaptation and mitigation strategies to climate change are a few of the future challenges. The paper presents the current experiences and, analyses in conjunction with international scenario and identifies future challenges of Indian landscape level biodiversity studies.																	0255-660X					SEP	2010	38	3					365	385		10.1007/s12524-010-0033-7								WOS:000288426800001

Fragmentation analysis carried out on 20 years time interval in northern-Western Ghats revealed that, losses under moderate and high fragmented forests have decreased from 1985-87 to 2005; however, it is not enough to compensate the loss of intact forests (not fragmented). The area of dense forests in intact forests has decreased from 1985-87 to 2005, this essentially means the loss of quality habitat in the area.

We have validated the biological richness index for three states generated in 'Biodiversity Characterization at Landscape Level' project under the aegis of Department of Biotechnology and Department of Space of the Government of India. Biological Richness (BR) index, described elsewhere as a cumulative property of ecological habitats and surroundings; was analyzed as an integrated 'three-tier modeling approach' of (i) utilization of geospatial tools, (ii) limited field survey and (iii) landscape analysis. For validation, we categorized the field plots into 10-groups corresponding to 10-levels of BR using data splitting technique using their GPS-recorded positional information. In general, the number of tree, shrub and liana species and mean BA demonstrated a decreasing trend with lowering of BR for all three states falling under both the hotspots. However, the number of endemic species increased with decrease in BR levels for Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh; and decreased for the state of Assam. The study validates the BR index derived using geospatial modeling approach, thereby provides confidence in its acceptance for ecological conservation purposes.																	0255-660X					SEP	2010	38	3					415	429		10.1007/s12524-010-0044-4								WOS:000288426800004

Geospatial Analysis of Tamil Nadu Eastern Ghats Forest Types at Landscape level with reference to Fragmentation and Species Diversity	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												The present study has generated spatial databases on the vegetation type with plant biodiversity, forest fragmentation and disturbance regimes in Tamilnadu parts of Eastern Ghats (EG), India. These databases have been analysed geospatially with landscape ecology approach. The study also includes ground inventory of plant species based on Remote Sensing (RS) data stratification. The vegetation type map was generated from the visual interpretation of two season IRS LISS III data. The spatial landscape analysis of the remotely sensed interpreted images was carried out using customized software, SPLAM. This is first such study in Tamilnadu Eastern Ghats that provides a comprehensive spatial database on vegetation types, disturbance regime and plant species diversity. The study has shown that the dry deciduous and thorn forests have shown better resistance to disturbance compared to the most disturbed evergreen and semi-evergreen forests. The study outputs are being utilized by forest department and biodiversity boards for conservation action planning and compliance to Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).																	0255-660X					SEP	2010	38	3					453	463		10.1007/s12524-010-0047-1								WOS:000288426800007						
J	Behera, MD				Behera, M. D.			Influences of Fragmentation on Plant Diversity: An Observation in Eastern Himalayan Tropical Forest	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Tropical forest fragmentation has been a major concern towards biodiversity conservation. Indices to determine the community structure and their relationship with forest fragmentation have been a matter of investigation. Here, I investigated the plant diversity across a fragmentation gradient in a typical human-influenced forested landscape in eastern Himalaya. The stratification for guiding field sampling was done using satellite remote sensing derived forest type map at 1: 50,000 scale. The results of 49 sample plots (nested quadrant of 20x20 m size) following stratified random sampling method were analysed. It was observed that high fragmented forests have fewer plant species, reduced anthropogenic use evidence and newer community types than medium and low fragment forests. In general, species diversity and species dominance were observed to be inversely proportional and directly proportional to forest fragmentation. Basal area followed a decreasing trend along fragmentation gradient. These results revealed that higher level of fragmentation permits low diversity in the eastern Himalayan tropical forests.																	0255-660X					SEP	2010	38	3					465	475		10.1007/s12524-010-0048-0								WOS:000288426800008

Geospatial Multiple Logistic Regression Approach for Habitat Characterization of scarce Plant Population: A case study of Pittosporum eriocarpum Royle (An Endemic Species of Uttarakhand, India)	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Increasing concern for biodiversity conservation at species level resulted in the development of cost effective tools for getting information at larger scale. Modeling distribution of species using remote sensing and geographic information has already proved its potentials to get such information with less effort. Pittosporum eriocarpum Royle is an endemic and threatened tree species of Uttarakhand, yet till now its regional distribution is poorly known. This study using geospatial modelling tools indentified several localities of potential occurrence of this species in the Mussoorie hills and Doon valley, and also provides information on its habitat specificity. The main objective of the study is to predict the suitable habitats for endangered plant species in Himalayan region using logistic regression model where availability of sufficient data on species presence-absence is a major limitation for larger areas.																	0255-660X					SEP	2010	38	3					513	521		10.1007/s12524-010-0036-4								WOS:000288426800012

Indicators for biodiversity and ecosystem services: towards an improved framework for ecosystems assessment	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Ecosystem assessment and monitoring requires the development and application of suitable indicators, i.e. they need to be (i) reliable and capable of simplifying complex relationships, (ii) quantifiable and transparent in order to enable an easy communication, and (iii) fit for the purpose of indication. These requirements are scarcely fulfilled in current ecosystem assessment and monitoring efforts to address the requirements of international biodiversity conventions. Here we present and test a set of seven criteria towards an improved framework for ecosystems indication with particular emphasis on the indication of biodiversity and ecosystem services: purpose of indication, indicator type according to the EEA's Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response scheme, direct/indirect linkages to biodiversity and ecosystem services, spatial scale and scalability across scales, applicability of benchmarks/reference values, availability of data and protocols, and applicability of remote sensing. The criteria are tested using 24 indicators of ecosystem assessment and monitoring at the global, continental and regional scale. Based on the general trends revealed by our evaluation, we present recommendations to streamline and improve ecosystem indication with respect to international biodiversity conventions. The implementation of our recommendations does require concerted international effort, comparable, for instance, to the implementation of the Water Framework Directive in Europe.

At the global scale, there need to be more coordinated efforts to acquire, process, analyze, and make available these observation data across all disciplines, particularly since many applications use the same primary and derived data. Towards that end, the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) is implementing the Global Earth Observing System of Systems. The purpose of this article is to provide information on GEO's goals and activities relevant to biodiversity and ecosystems. The article also describes the data that would best serve as a year 2010 baseline in order to support the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) as well as many other international agreements, programs, and activities. Indeed, an assessment of existing biodiversity observations with a concomitant recognition of the remaining gaps will promote the establishment of an integrated framework for biodiversity observations in support of the CBD's efforts.																	0912-3814					SEP	2010	25	5			SI		937	946		10.1007/s11284-010-0756-5								WOS:000284430800006

Geospatial Modeling of Biological Richness in Kuldiha Wildlife Sanctuary of Orissa, India	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												The paper presents a geospatial modeling approach for the assessment of biological richness in Kuldiha wildlife sanctuary in Orissa located in the northern tip of the Eastern Ghats in India. Indian Remote Sensing satellite data of Resourcesat-1 LISS III and field sampling were used to model biological richness at 1: 50,000 scale. It was found that the sanctuary is dominated by Sal mixed dry deciduous forest. The vegetation map prepared through visual interpretation of satellite imagery was subjected to landscape analysis and assessment of biotic disturbance using SPLAM software. The disturbance index together with species richness, ecosystem uniqueness, terrain complexity and total importance value was modeled to access the biological richness in the sanctuary. A total of 3.9 per cent area was found to posses very high plant richness followed by high (21.2%), medium (42.1%) and low (32.8%) in the sanctuary. The study demonstrated the geospatial technology in conjunction with landscape analysis, ground inventory and geospatial modeling seizes good potential for rapid assessment of biological richness. The fringe areas of the sanctuary having disturbance more because most of the small villages which are relocated from sanctuary, settled in those areas.																	0255-660X					SEP	2010	38	3					477	485		10.1007/s12524-010-0049-z								WOS:000288426800009

Spatial modelling and landscape-level approaches for visualizing intra-specific variation	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Spatial analytical methods have been used by biologists for decades, but with new modelling approaches and data availability their application is accelerating. While early approaches were purely spatial in nature, it is now possible to explore the underlying causes of spatial heterogeneity of biological variation using a wealth of environmental data, especially from satellite remote sensing. Recent methods can not only make inferences regarding spatial relationships and the causes of spatial heterogeneity, but also create predictive maps of patterns of biological variation under changing environmental conditions. Here, we review the methods involved in making continuous spatial predictions from biological variation using spatial and environmental predictor variables, provide examples of their use and critically evaluate the advantages and limitations. In the final section, we discuss some of the key challenges and opportunities for future work.

Multivariate forest structure modelling and mapping using high resolution airborne imagery and topographic information	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Remote sensing has been widely used for modelling and mapping individual forest structural attributes, such as LAI and stem density, however the development and evaluation of methods for simultaneously modelling and mapping multivariate aspects of forest structure are comparatively limited. Multivariate representation of forest structure can be used as a means to infer other environmental attributes such as biodiversity and habitat, which have often been shown to be enhanced in more structurally diverse or complex forests. Image-based modelling of multivariate forest structure is useful in developing an understanding of the associations between different aspects of vertical and horizontal structure and image characteristics. Models can also be applied spatially to all image pixels to produce maps of multivariate forest structure as an alternative to sample-based field assessment. This research used high spatial resolution multispectral airborne imagery to provide spectral, spatial, and object-based information in the development of a model of multivariate forest structure as represented by twenty-four field variables measured in plots within a temperate hardwood forest in southern Quebec, Canada. Redundancy Analysis (RDA) was used to develop a model that explained a statistically significant proportion of the variance of these structural attributes. The resulting model included image variables representing mostly within-crown and within-shadow brightness variance (texture) as well as elevation, taken from a DEM of the study area. It was applied spatially across the entire study area to produce a continuous map of predicted multivariate forest structure. Bootstrapping validation of the model provided an RMSE of 19.9%, while independent field validation of mapped areas of complex and simple structure showed accuracies of 89% and 69%, respectively. Multiscale testing using resampled imagery suggested that the methods could possibly be used with current pan-sharpened, or future sub-metre resolution, multispectral satellite imagery, which would provide much greater spatial coverage and reduced image processing compared to airborne imagery.

J	Ganguly, S; Friedl, MA; Tan, B; Zhang, XY; Verma, M				Ganguly, Sangram; Friedl, Mark A.; Tan, Bin; Zhang, Xiaoyang; Verma, Manish			Land surface phenology from MODIS: Characterization of the Collection 5 global land cover dynamics product	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Information related to land surface phenology is important for a variety of applications. For example, phenology is widely used as a diagnostic of ecosystem response to global change. In addition, phenology influences seasonal scale fluxes of water, energy, and carbon between the land surface and atmosphere. Increasingly, the importance of phenology for studies of habitat and biodiversity is also being recognized. While many data sets related to plant phenology have been collected at specific sites or in networks focused on individual plants or plant species, remote sensing provides the only way to observe and monitor phenology over large scales and at regular intervals. The MODIS Global Land Cover Dynamics Product was developed to support investigations that require regional to global scale information related to spatio-temporal dynamics in land surface phenology. Here we describe the Collection 5 version of this product, which represents a substantial refinement relative to the Collection 4 product. This new version provides information related to land surface phenology at higher spatial resolution than Collection 4 (500-m vs. 1-km), and is based on 8-day instead of 16-day input data. The paper presents a brief overview of the algorithm, followed by an assessment of the product. To this end, we present (1) a comparison of results from Collection 5 versus Collection 4 for selected MODIS tiles that span a range of climate and ecological conditions, (2) a characterization of interannual variation in Collections 4 and 5 data for North America from 2001 to 2006, and (3) a comparison of Collection 5 results against ground observations for two forest sites in the northeastern United States. Results show that the Collection 5 product is qualitatively similar to Collection 4. However, Collection 5 has fewer missing values outside of regions with persistent cloud cover and atmospheric aerosols. Interannual variability in Collection 5 is consistent with expected ranges of variance suggesting that the algorithm is reliable and robust, except in the tropics where some systematic differences are observed. Finally, comparisons with ground data suggest that the algorithm is performing well, but that end of season metrics associated with vegetation senescence and dormancy have higher uncertainties than start of season metrics.

Therefore, understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of understory vegetation is essential for management and conservation. Nevertheless, detailed information on the distribution of understory vegetation across large spatial extents is usually unavailable, due to the interference of overstory canopy on the remote detection of understory vegetation. While many efforts have been made to overcome this challenge, mapping understory vegetation across large spatial extents is still limited due to a lack of generality of the developed methods and limited availability of required remotely sensed data. In this study, we used understory bamboo in Wolong Nature Reserve, China as a case study to develop and test an effective and practical remote sensing approach for mapping understory vegetation. Using phenology metrics generated from a time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data, we characterized the phenological features of forests with understory bamboo. Using maximum entropy modeling together with these phenology metrics, we successfully mapped the spatial distribution of understory bamboo (kappa: 0.59: AUC: 0.85). In addition, by incorporating elevation information we further mapped the distribution of two individual bamboo species, Bashania faberi and Fargesia robusta (kappa: 0.68 and 0.70; AUC: 0.91 and 0.92, respectively). Due to its generality, flexibility and extensibility, this approach constitutes an improvement to the remote detection of understory vegetation, making it suitable for mapping different understory species in different geographic settings. Both biodiversity conservation and wildlife habitat management may benefit from the detailed information on understory vegetation across large areas through the applications of this approach.

J	Parks, KE; Mulligan, M				Parks, K. E.; Mulligan, M.			On the relationship between a resource based measure of geodiversity and broad scale biodiversity patterns	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Geodiversity, (diversity of the geosphere) incorporates many of the environmental patterns and processes that are considered drivers of biodiversity. Components of geodiversity (climate, topography, geology and hydrology) can be considered in terms of their resource giving potential, where resources are taken as energy, water, space and nutrients. The total amount of these resources, along with their spatial and temporal variation, is herein proposed as a compound index of geodiversity that has the potential to model broad scale biodiversity patterns. This paper outlines potential datasets that could be used to represent geodiversity, and then reviews the theoretical links between each element of the proposed compound index of geodiversity (overall resource availability, temporal variation and spatial variation in those resources) and broad-scale patterns of biodiversity. Support for the influence of each of the elements of geodiversity on overall biodiversity patterns was found in the literature, although the majority of relevant research focuses on resource availability, particularly available energy. The links between temporal and spatial variation in resources and biodiversity have been less thoroughly investigated in the literature. For the most part, it was reported that overall resource availability, temporal variation and spatial variation in those resources do not act in isolation in terms of controlling biodiversity. Overall there are sufficient datasets to calculate the proposed compound index of geodiversity, and evidence in the literature for links between the geographical distribution of biodiversity and each of the elements of the compound index defined. Since data for measuring geodiversity is more spatially consistent and widely available (thanks to satellite remote sensing) geodiversity has potential as a conservation planning tool, especially where biological data are not available or sparsely distributed.

Land use patterns and urbanization in the holy city of Varanasi, India: a scenario	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Rapid urbanization and increasing land use changes due to population and economic growth in selected landscapes is being witnessed of late in India and other developing countries. The cities are expanding in all directions resulting in large-scale urban sprawl and changes in urban land use. The spatial pattern of such changes is clearly noticed on the urban fringes or city peripheral rural areas than in the city center. In fact, this is reflected in changing urban land use patterns. There is an urgent need to accurately describe land use changes for planning and sustainable management. In the recent times, remote sensing is gaining importance as vital tool in the analysis and integration of spatial data. This study intends to estimate land use pattern in a planned and unplanned urban setup and also to analyze the impact of change in land use pattern in the Varanasi urban environment. The results indicate that the planned urban setup had a higher tree cover to that of unplanned area in the Varanasi City, although a considerable disparity existed within the planned urban setups. The results emphasize the need to critically review concepts of urban planning and give more consideration to the preservation and management of urban tree cover/greenspace.																	0167-6369					AUG	2010	167	1-4			SI		417	422		10.1007/s10661-009-1060-0								WOS:000279683100034	19562495					
J	Keith, DA; Rodoreda, S; Bedward, M				Keith, David A.; Rodoreda, Suzette; Bedward, Michael			Decadal change in wetland-woodland boundaries during the late 20th century reflects climatic trends	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Wetlands are important and restricted habitats for dependent biota and play vital roles in landscape function, hydrology and carbon sequestration. They are also likely to be one of the most sensitive components of the terrestrial biosphere to global climate change. An understanding of relationships between wetland persistence and climate is imperative for predicting, mitigating and adapting to the impacts of future climate change on wetland extent and function. We investigated whether mire wetlands had contracted, expanded or remained stable during 1960-2000. We chose a study area encompassing a regional climatic gradient in southeastern Australia, specifically to avoid confounding effects of water extraction on wetland hydrology and extent. We first characterized trends in climate by examining data from local weather stations, which showed a slight increase in precipitation and marked decline in pan evaporation over the relevant period. Remote sensing of vegetation boundaries showed a marked lateral expansion of mires during 1961-1998, and a corresponding contraction of woodland. The spatial patterns in vegetation change were consistent with the regional climatic gradient and showed a weaker co-relationship to fire history. Resource exploitation, wildland fires and autogenic mire development failed to explain the observed expansion of mire vegetation in the absence of climate change. We therefore conclude that the extent of mire wetlands is likely to be sensitive to variation in climatic moisture over decadal time scales. Late 20th-century trends in climatic moisture may be related primarily to reduced irradiance and/or reduced wind speeds. In the 21st century, however, net climatic moisture in this region is projected to decline. As mires are apparently sensitive to hydrological change, we anticipate lateral contraction of mire boundaries in coming decades as projected climatic drying eventuates. This raises concerns about the future hydrological functions, carbon storage capacity and unique biodiversity of these important ecosystems.

Assemblages of vegetation are equivalent to habitats. This study examined the use of satellite imagery in vegetation differentiation in South Africa's Kruger National Park (KNP). A vegetation classification scheme based on dominant tree species but also related to the park's geology was tested, the geology generally consisting of high and low fertility lithology. Currently available multispectral satellite imagery is broadly either of high spatial but low temporal resolution or low spatial but high temporal resolution. Landsat TM/ETM+ and MODIS images were used to represent these broad categories. Rain season dates were selected as the period when discrimination between key habitats in KNP is most likely to be successful. Principal Component Analysis enhanced vegetated areas on the Lands at images, while NDVI vegetation enhancement was employed on the MODIS image. The images were classified into six field sampling derived classes depicting a vegetation density and phenology gradient, with high (about 89%) indicative classification accuracy. The results indicate that, using image processing procedures that enhance vegetation density, image classification can be used to map the park's vegetation at the high versus low geological fertility zone level, to accuracies above 80% on high spatial resolution imagery and slightly lower accuracy on lower spatial resolution imagery. Rainfall just prior to the image date influences herbaceous vegetation and, therefore, success at image scene vegetation mapping, while cloud cover limits image availability. Small scale habitat differentiation using multispectral satellite imagery for large protected savanna areas appears feasible, indicating the potential for use of remote sensing in savanna habitat monitoring. However, factors affecting successful habitat mapping need to be considered. Therefore, adoption of remote sensing in vegetation mapping and monitoring for large protected savanna areas merits consideration by conservation agencies. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

Remote sensing imagery has considerable potential to aid in the monitoring and prediction of biodiversity across many spatial and temporal scales. In this paper, we explored the possibility of defining relationships between species diversity indices and Landsat ETM+ reflectance values for Hyrcanian forests in Golestan province of Iran. We used the COST model for atmospheric correction of the imagery. Linear regression models were implemented to predict measures of biodiversity (species richness and reciprocal of Simpson indices) using various combinations of Landsat spectral data. Species richness was modeled using the band set ETM5, ETM7, DV1, wetness and variances of ETM1, ETM2 and ETM5 (adjusted R(2) = 0.59, RMSE = 1.51). Reciprocal of Simpson index was modeled using the band set NDVI, brightness, greenness, variances of ETM2. ETM5 and ETM7 (adjusted R(2)=0.459 RMSE = 1.15). The results demonstrated that spectral reflectance from Landsat can be used to effectively model tree species diversity. Predictive map derived from the presented methodology can help evaluate spatial aspects and monitor tree species diversity of the studied forest. The methodology also facilitates the evaluation of forest management and conservation strategies in northern Iran. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Modeling social and land-use/land-cover change data to assess drivers of smallholder deforestation in Belize	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												This study integrated remote sensing, household survey data, and spatial modeling to assess drivers of deforestation within the Community Baboon Sanctuary (CBS), Belize, an IUCN category IV protected area for the black howler monkey (Alouatta pigra) established in 1985. We contrasted land-cover trends within the CBS, as well as a 120 m river buffer running within and outside the CBS (the focus of conservation). Additionally, we assessed the relative influence of selected household economic activity and demographic data, participation in two conservation initiatives, locational context, and land tenure on the probability of deforestation using binomial logit models. Social survey and land-cover change data was incorporated from 33 smallholder parcels from the years 2000-2004. Deforestation rates within the CBS totaled 30% between 1989 and 2004, following similar trends in Belize. Riparian areas were more likely to be deforested, as were areas closer to roads. Although cattle correlated with the leading driver of deforestation in the model, land tenure was not influential, despite its importance within the literature. Although involvement with conservation initiatives is correlated with decreased deforestation, other drivers are more influential, stressing the influence of other competing factors on forest preservation that must be considered with conservation development.

J	Geri, F; Amici, V; Rocchini, D				Geri, Francesco; Amici, Valerio; Rocchini, Duccio			Human activity impact on the heterogeneity of a Mediterranean landscape	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												The Mediterranean area is one of the most significantly altered hotspots on Earth, since it has been intensively affected by human activity for millennia. As a result, only 4.7% of its primary vegetation remained unaltered and the landscape has been repeatedly transformed. In this paper, we aimed at detecting both the direction and the rate of landscape change focusing on the effects of human activity on the environmental heterogeneity of the Mediterranean landscape under study. In particular, we carried out an analysis of landscape changes occurred in a Mediterranean area from 1954 to 2000, by means of a comparative examination of a historical and a recent land use map. Land use changes have been quantified by landscape metrics coupled with topographical information. Results underline: i) a general homogenisation of the landscape, ii) modification of the arrangements for exploitation of the territory, particularly in the plain areas, iii) a trend of recovery of the territory by the forest to the detriment of semi-natural and agricultural areas in hilly and mountain parts.

In Mediterranean regions, natural landscapes mostly covered by evergreen vegetation have been to a large extent transformed into cultural landscapes since long time ago. We investigated land cover changes in Central Chile using multi-temporal satellite imagery taken in 1975, 1985, 1999 and 2008. The major trends in this highly dynamic landscape were reduction of dryland forest and conversion of shrubland to intensive land uses such as farmland. The average net annual deforestation rate was -1.7%, and shrubland reduction occurred at an annual rate of -0.7%; agriculture, urban areas and timber plantations increased at annual rates of 1.1%, 2.7% and 3.2%, respectively, during the 1975-2008 period. Total forest and shrubland loss rates were partly offset by passive revegetation. However, most of the areas that were passively revegetated remained as shrubland and did not turn into forests due to a low capacity of forest recovery. This resulted in a progressive loss and degradation of dryland forest over the entire region. Overall, the documented land cover changes increase provisioning services such as crops, cattle, and timber that are characteristic of cultural landscapes in the area but may cause an irreversible loss of biodiversity and a depletion of other ecological services provided by forests and shrubland. The implications for conservation of this area and the need for territorial planning and adapted land-use strategies are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wright, CK				Wright, Christopher K.			Spatiotemporal dynamics of prairie wetland networks: power-law scaling and implications for conservation planning	ECOLOGY												Although habitat networks show promise for conservation planning at regional scales, their spatiotemporal dynamics have not been well studied, especially in climate-sensitive landscapes. Here I use satellite remote sensing to compile wetland habitat networks from the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of North America. An ensemble of networks assembled across a hydrologic gradient from deluge to drought and a range of representative dispersal distances exhibits power-law scaling of important topological parameters. Prairie wetland networks are "meso-worlds" with mean topological distance increasing faster with network size than small-world networks, but slower than a regular lattice (or "large world"). This scaling implies rapid dispersal through wetland networks without some of the risks associated with "small worlds" (e. g., extremely rapid propagation of disease or disturbance). Retrospective analysis of wetland networks establishes a climatic envelope for landscape connectivity in the PPR, where I show that a changing climate might severely impact metapopulation viability and restrict long-distance dispersal and range shifts. More generally, this study demonstrates an efficient approach to conservation planning at a level of abstraction addressing key drivers of the global biodiversity crisis: habitat fragmentation and climatic change.																	0012-9658					JUL	2010	91	7					1924	1930		10.1890/09-0865.1								WOS:000279563700007	20715611

Tanzania is one of nine pilot countries for the United Nations REDD Programme, receives significant funding from the Norwegian, Finnish and German governments and is a participant in the World Bank's Forest Carbon Partnership Facility. In combination, these interventions aim to mitigate green-house gas emissions, provide an income to rural communities and conserve biodiversity. The establishment of the UN-REDD Programme in Tanzania illustrates real-world challenges in a developing country. These include currently inadequate baseline forestry data sets (needed to calculate reference emission levels), inadequate government capacity and insufficient experience of implementing REDD+-type measures at operational levels. Additionally, for REDD+ to succeed, current users of forest resources must adopt new practices, including the equitable sharing of benefits that accrue from REDD+ implementation. These challenges are being addressed by combined donor support to implement a national forest inventory, remote sensing of forest cover, enhanced capacity for measuring, reporting and verification, and pilot projects to test REDD+ implementation linked to the existing Participatory Forest Management Programme. Our conclusion is that even in a country with considerable donor support, progressive forest policies, laws and regulations, an extensive network of managed forests and increasingly developed locally-based forest management approaches, implementing REDD+ presents many challenges. These are being met by coordinated, genuine partnerships between government, non-government and community-based agencies.				publicationpage, cmec/B-4405-2017; Miles, Lera/C-7334-2009; Swetnam, Ruth/I-2848-2017; publist, CMEC/C-3010-2012	Miles, Lera/0000-0003-0377-5904; Swetnam, Ruth/0000-0002-5199-9622; Lewis, Simon/0000-0002-8066-6851												0030-6053					JUL	2010	44	3					339	351		10.1017/S0030605310000554								WOS:000281461600015						
J	Knudby, A; LeDrew, E; Brenning, A				Knudby, Anders; LeDrew, Ellsworth; Brenning, Alexander			Predictive mapping of reef fish species richness, diversity and biomass in Zanzibar using IKONOS imagery and machine-learning techniques	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												During the last three decades, the large spatial coverage of remote sensing data has been used in coral reef research to map dominant substrate types, geomorphologic zones, and bathymetry. During the same period, field studies have documented statistical relationships between variables quantifying aspects of the reef habitat and its fish community. Although the results of these studies are ambiguous, some habitat variables have frequently been found to correlate with one or more aspects of the fish community. Several of these habitat variables, including depth, the structural complexity of the substrate, and live coral cover, are possible to estimate with remote sensing data. In this study, we combine a set of statistical and machine-learning models with habitat variables derived from IKONOS data to produce spatially explicit predictions of the species richness, biomass, and diversity of the fish community around two reefs in Zanzibar. In the process, we assess the ability of IKONOS imagery to estimate live coral cover, structural complexity and habitat diversity, and we explore the importance of habitat variables, at a range of spatial scales, in the predictive models using a permutation-based technique. Our findings indicate that structural complexity at a fine spatial scale (similar to 5 to 10 m) is the most important habitat variable in predictive models of fish species richness and diversity, whereas other variables such as depth, habitat diversity, and structural complexity at coarser spatial scales contribute to predictions of biomass. In addition, our results demonstrate that complex model types such as tree-based ensemble techniques provide superior predictive performance compared to the more frequently used linear models, achieving a reduction of the cross-validated root-mean-squared prediction error of 3-11%. Although aerial photographs and airborne lidar instruments have recently been used to produce spatially explicit predictions of reef fish community variables, our study illustrates the possibility of doing so with satellite data. The ability to use satellite data may bring the cost of creating such maps within the reach of both spatial ecology researchers and the wide range of organizations involved in marine spatial planning.

Using hyperspectral remote sensing to detect and quantify southeastern pine senescence effects in red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) habitat	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Conservation of threatened and endangered species requires maintenance of critical habitat. The red-cockaded woodpecker Picoides borealis (RCN) is a threatened bird species, endemic to the mixed conifer forests of the southeastern United States. RCW nests and forages preferentially in mature longleaf pine Pin us palustris, but also uses mature loblolly pine Pinus taeda and shortleaf pine Pinus echinata forests. In the last century, the extent of mature pine forests has been greatly reduced by logging. The RCW, in contrast to other woodpeckers, excavates nest cavities in living trees and senescence symptoms (year round leaf chlorosis and leaf mortality) have been observed in mature pine stands across the southeast. Widespread mortality of the mature pine forests would threaten the long-term survival of the RCW. We used airborne hyperspectral data across a portion of Ft. Benning Military Installation, Georgia, U.S.A., to determine if senescent trees can be identified and mapped and assess the likely persistence of mature pines in the RCW habitat. Univariate analysis of variance showed good separation between asymptomatic, senesced and dead physiological conditions with asymptomatic trees having significantly higher reflectance for all bands in the wavelength range between 0.719 and 1.1676 mu m, senescent trees having significantly lower reflectance for bands in the range between 1.1927 and 1.3122 mu m, and dead trees having significantly higher reflectance for bands in the range between 1.8151 and 1.9471 mu m. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) models achieved correct classification rates and kappa statistics above 70%. CART models selected information from wavelength regions similar to those identified from the ANOVA, which likely explains their performance. Our aggregated CART model of tree senescence estimated that 141.4 ha (3%) of the study area is affected. RCW nests occurred in areas with significantly higher tree cover, and trees within foraging and home ranges did not have significantly more senescence than areas without RCW. These results indicate that although tree senescence is widespread, mortality is yet to significantly affect RCW habitat. Results and analysis of critical habitat similar to those exemplified in this study can extend our knowledge about the stressors of these important and imperiled components of biodiversity.

On the use of abiotic surrogates to describe marine benthic biodiversity	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												A growing need to manage marine biodiversity sustainably at local, regional and global scales cannot be met by applying existing biological data. Abiotic surrogates of biodiversity are thus increasingly valuable in filling the gaps in our knowledge of biodiversity patterns, especially identification of hotspots, habitats needed by endangered or commercially valuable species and systems or processes important to the sustained provision of ecosystem services. This review examines the use of abiotic variables as surrogates for patterns in benthic biodiversity with particular regard to how variables are tied to processes affecting species richness and how easily those variables can be measured at scales relevant to resource management decisions. Direct gradient variables such as salinity, oxygen concentration and temperature can be strong predictive variables for larger systems, although local stability of water quality may prevent usefulness of these factors at fine spatial scales. Biological productivity has complex relationships with benthic biodiversity and although the development of local and regional models cannot accurately predict outside the range of their biological sampling, remote sensing may provide useful information. Indeed, interpolated values are available for much of the world's seas, and these are continually being refined by the collection of remote sensing and field data. Sediment variables often exhibit complex relationships with benthic biodiversity. The strength of the relationship between any one sediment variable and biodiversity may depend on the state of another sediment variable in that system. Percentage mud, percentage gravel, rugosity and compaction hold the strongest independent predictive power. Rugosity and the difference between gravel and finer sediments can be established using acoustic methods, but to quantify grain size and measure compaction, a sample is necessary. Pure spatial variables such as latitude, longitude and depth are not direct drivers of biodiversity patterns but often correspond with driving gradients and can be of some use in prediction. In such cases it would be better to identify what the spatial variable is acting as a proxy for so boundaries for that variable are not overlooked. The utility of these potential surrogates vary across spatial scales, quality of data, and management needs. A continued focus on surrogate research will address the need of marine scientists and resource managers worldwide for accurate and robust predictions, extending from simple measures of diversity to species distributions and patterns of assemblage.

The ecological status of grasslands on lowland farmlands in western Ireland and implications for grassland classification and nature value assessment	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												The identification and protection of High Nature Value (HNV) farmland is an objective of the European Rural Development policy which has yet to be met by Member States. Remote sensing and models based on farm statistics are commonly used to identify HNV farmland. Use of datasets such as Corine Landcover Classes is widespread but it has been acknowledged that such datasets can significantly overlook fine-scale biodiversity features. In countries where farmland is predominantly grass-based, there is an added difficulty in distinguishing between grassland types without undertaking field-scale survey work. This study was conducted to improve our knowledge of grassland biodiversity on lowland farms with a view to helping assess their potential conservation value in a High Nature Value farmland context. We analysed the grassland species composition of 603 fields on 32 lowland farms and investigated their relationship to management, ecological and spatial descriptors. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMS) and Multi-Response Permutation Procedure (MRPP) analyses of the grasslands and their ecology on these farms revealed a continuum between semi-natural and improved agricultural grasslands, including an intermediate Semi-Improved Grassland type. This gradation from improved to semi-natural grassland highlights the biodiversity variation that occurs on farms that are frequently considered to be of low nature value. Statistical analyses showed that management practices, and especially soil fertility, were most strongly associated with grassland type. The detailed description of the grasslands that occur on these lowland farms has the potential to provide a better assessment of the overall nature value of a farm, potentially aiding the identification of Type 2 High Nature Value farmland. Before this can be achieved, however, there is a need to amend the grassland classification system used in Ireland in order that intermediate semi-natural grassland assemblages can be identified at the field level. Field surveys are necessary for this level of detail. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here we test the applicability of remote sensing, particularly novel use of waveform lidar measurements, for quantifying the habitat heterogeneity of a contiguous northern hardwoods forest in the northeastern United States. We apply these results to predict the breeding habitat quality, an indicator of reproductive output of a well-studied Neotropical migrant songbird, the Black-throated Blue Warbler (Dendroica caerulescens). We found that using canopy vertical structure metrics provided unique information for models of habitat quality and spatial patterns of prevalence. An ensemble decision tree modeling approach (random forests) consistently identified lidar metrics describing the vertical distribution and complexity of canopy elements as important predictors of habitat use over multiple years. Although other aspects of habitat were important, including the seasonality of vegetation cover, the canopy structure variables provided unique and complementary information that systematically improved model predictions. We conclude that canopy structure metrics derived from waveform lidar, which will be available on future satellite missions, can advance multiple aspects of biodiversity research, and additional studies should be extended to other organisms and regions.

For a study area of 88 484 km2, 70% of which lie inside the Western Ghats Biodiversity Hotspot (WGBH), land-cover maps for two dates (1977, 1999) were built from various data sources including remote sensing images and ecological forest maps. SOC stocks were calculated from climatic parameters, altitude, physiography, rock type, soil type and land-cover, with a modelling approach used in predictive learning and based on Multiple Additive Regression Tree. The model was trained on 361 soil profiles data, and applied to estimate SOC stocks from predictor variables using a Geographical Information System (GIS). Comparison of 1977 and 1999 land-cover maps showed 628 km2 of dense forests habitat loss (6%), corresponding to an annual deforestation rate of 0.44%. This was found consistent with other studies carried out in other parts of the WGBH, but not with FAO figures showing an increase in forest area. This could be explained by the different forest definitions used, based on ecological classification in the former, and on percentage tree cover in the latter. Unexpectedly, our results showed that despite ongoing deforestation, overall SOC stock was maintained (similar to 0.43 Pg). But a closer examination of spatial differences showed that soil carbon losses in deforested areas were compensated by sequestration elsewhere, mainly in recent plantations and newly irrigated croplands. This suggests that more carbon sequestration in soils could be achieved in the future through appropriate wasteland management. It is also expected that increasing concerns about biodiversity loss will favour more conservation and reinforce the already prevailing protective measures, thus further maintaining C stocks.

Since the seventies, part of the main infrastructure for country's oil extraction is located in this area. Its high biodiversity has motivated different type of studies including deforestation processes and land use planning. In this work we used satellite image analysis to determine land cover changes in the area from 1974 to 2001. Our results indicate that tropical forest and mangroves presented the most extensive losses in its coverage. In contrast, urban areas and induced grassland increased considerably. In 2001 more than half of the ecosystem area showed changes from its original land cover, and a third part of it was deteriorated. The main causes of deforestation were both the increase in grassland and the growth of urban areas. However, deforestation was attenuated by natural reforestation and plant canopy recovery. We conclude that the introduction of cattle and urban development were the main causes for the land cover changes; however, the oil industry activity located in the ecosystem, has promoted indirectly to urban growth and rancher boom.

The analysis was done using temporal IRS-1D LISS-III data in conjunction with the ground information. Patterns of fragmentation in plant communities were identified using a programme written in Geographic Information System (GIS) domain using Arc macro language (AML) and C(++). Forest fragmentation patterns were categorized for different communities in terms of interior, perforation, transition, edge and patch, based on the contiguity of the forest. It was observed that all communities exist in 'patchy' state. Biodiversity levels in different fragment categories were also computed. In general, the forest of Vindhyan hills showed a high degree of patchiness. However, the disturbance resilient plant communities had larger forest area under interior or perforation category. The Acacia catechu community exhibits high levels of diversity in transition category. Similarly, Lagerstroemia-Lannea-Anogeissus community showed higher diversity levels in interior category.																	0564-3295					SUM	2010	51	1					55	65										WOS:000273290100007

High-Resolution Remote Sensing of Upland Swamp Boundaries and Vegetation for Baseline Mapping and Monitoring	WETLANDS												Current high-resolution remote sensing provides the means to accurately map upland swamp boundaries and vegetation communities in eastern Australian coastal woodlands. The aim of this study was to develop baseline methods for upland swamp definition and change detection that can be routinely applied in an operational setting. Airborne laser scanning was used to define swamp boundaries, image classification was used to describe vegetation communities, and post-classification comparison used to assess temporal variation in community composition over the period 2006-2007. We found that swamp boundaries could be accurately located along the sharp swamp-fringing tree ecotone (accuracy 98%), which provided a definitive feature to support both short- and long-term monitoring. Wet Heath and Dry Heath areas were well defined by image classification, and generally approximate the field-defined perennial vegetation communities of the Tea Tree Thicket and Sedgeland Heath Complexes. Temporal changes to Wet-Dry Heath extent appear to reflect growth phenology, rather than community composition. The proportion of non-vegetated area was less variable, hence an increase in bare ground is likely to be a robust indicator for impact assessment monitoring.																	0277-5212					JUN	2010	30	3					531	540		10.1007/s13157-010-0059-1								WOS:000278626200014						
J	Miura, N; Jones, SD				Miura, Naoko; Jones, Simon D.			Characterizing forest ecological structure using pulse types and heights of airborne laser scanning	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Characterizing forest structure is an important part of any comprehensive biodiversity assessment. However, current methods for measuring structural complexity require a laborious process that involves many logistically expensive point based measurements. An automated or semi-automated method would be ideal. In this study, the utility of airborne laser scanning (LiDAR; Light Detection and Ranging) for characterizing the ecological structure of a forest landscape is examined. The innovation of this paper is to use different laser pulse return properties from a full waveform LiDAR to characterize forest ecological structure. First the LiDAR dataset is stratified into four vertical layers: ground, low vegetation (0-1 m from the ground), medium vegetation (1-5 m from the ground) and high vegetation (>5 m). Subsequently the "Type" of LiDAR return is analysed: Type I (singular returns); Type 2 (first of many returns); Type 3 (intermediate returns); and Type 4 (last of many returns). A forest characterization scheme derived from LiDAR point clouds is proposed. A validation of the scheme is then presented using a network of field sites that recorded commonly used metrics of biodiversity. The proposed forest characterization categories allow for quantification of gaps (above bare ground, low vegetation and medium vegetation), canopy cover and its vertical density as well as the presence of various canopy strata (low, medium and high). Regression analysis showed that LiDAR derived variables were good predictors of field recorded variables (R(2) = 0.82, P < 0.05 between LiDAR derived presence of low vegetation and field derived LAI for low vegetation). The proposed scheme clearly shows the potential of full waveform LiDAR to provide information on the complexity of habitat structure. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We studied a mid-altitude steppe-like area of Southern France, the Causse de Sauveterre, that has been grazed for many centuries. The decrease of human population during the 20th century, particularly since the end of 2nd World War, and the ongoing changes in agricultural practices may have dramatic effects on many biodiversity components of these landscapes.

We paid particular attention to the possible consequences of recent changes in agricultural policy on these communities. Landscape changes were studied through remote sensing, and bird community and vegetation changes by field sampling on 183 sites. Correspondence Analysis showed an overall trend towards landscape closure. This results in a decrease of open-habitat species that are fairly rare in Europe (e.g. Tawny Pipit Anthus campestris, Linnet Carduelis cannabina. Ortolan Bunting Emberiza hortulana), and in an increase of common forest species (e.g. the Common Chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita and Winter Wren Troglodytes troglodytes). Although most of the avifauna changes seem to be explained by local landscape changes, the decrease of certain bird species as Bullfinch Pyrrhula pyrrhula and Citril Finch Serinus citrinella may result from population changes at larger scales. The current closure of the landscape represents a threat for several steppe species whose conservation status is unfavourable in Europe. This closure does not result from a decrease in human population and/or in flock number, as observed in many Mediterranean hinterlands. It rather results from a shift from a former extensive pastoralism, where sheep grazed steppe-like grasslands (rangeland grazing), towards a more intensive herding that use hay and cereal foodstocks cultivated on the more productive areas of the farms. To alleviate the observed trends, subsidies should be oriented towards the compensation of a possible loss of income resulting from the maintenance of the traditional extensive pastoralism.

Increased human pressures and socioeconomic development make forest protection more challenging, particularly for forest ecosystems that lie across national borders because of the differences in national socioeconomic policies and conditions within them. Here with Landsat data, Google Earth images, and field observations, we show that, in two adjacent biosphere reserves across the border of China and North Korea, over one half of primary forest landscapes have been deteriorated by exploitive uses, including seed harvesting and systematic logging. The combined effects of detectable and hidden degradation processes have further damaged forest ecosystems in the core areas in the two biosphere reserves, threatening sustainable biodiversity conservation in the region. It is urgent to develop cross-border collaborative conservation strategies that can help combat both detectable and hidden degradation processes at a regional scale. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Liu, JY; Deng, XZ				Liu JiYuan; Deng XiangZheng			Progress of the research methodologies on the temporal and spatial process of LUCC	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN												After one decade of development, the methods to explore the temporal and spatial process of LUCC (Land Use and Land Cover Change) have been vastly improved; and in some sense a methodology framework used to study the temporal and spatial process is being rapidly developed. The methodology framework is based on the integration of the classical theories of Geography and the recent developed technologies of remote sensing and GIS, which is a new research field to meet the need for scientific information to promote the studies on global change adaptation and sustainable development. It addressed the following: the detection and description of the temporal and spatial process of LUCC, analysis of driving mechanism of LUCC, simulation of LUCC process and evaluation of ecological effect due to LUCC. The formation of methodology framework to study the temporal and spatial process of LUCC, to some extent, has been promoted to tackle the hard-nut topics in science through interdisciplinary efforts among geography, GIS and macro-ecology. The domestic and overseas research trends indicate that the development of detection and analytical technologies of remote sensing information and the methodological innovation of simulating the temporal and spatial process of LUCC, play an important role in promoting the development of methodology framework of the temporal and spatial process of LUCC. The synthetic application of the detection and analytical technologies of LUCC remote sensing information, the construction of multi-source and temporal-spatial data platform and the realization of massive data availability and integration are all kernel components of the methodology framework of the temporal and spatial process of LUCC. We can expect that the research methods system of the temporal and spatial process of LUCC will play a more important role in guiding the research activities of LUCC processes at regional and global levels.																	1001-6538					MAY	2010	55	14					1354	1362		10.1007/s11434-009-0733-y								WOS:000277335300002

However, variations in the use of legends and classification systems sometimes pose challenges. The landscape of Sagarmatha National Park and Buffer Zone (SNPBZ) has seen many changes in the past few decades. Mapping of land cover in SNPBZ was carried out to fill gaps in basic databases for the area. A review of past land cover initiatives and existing data revealed differences in methodologies and definitions that made them incompatible for cross-region applications. For the present study, a legend was developed using the standard Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) methodology developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme, a comprehensive and standardized a priori classification system designed for mapping exercises independent of scales or means. The changes in land cover were analyzed using Landsat Thematic Mapper, Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer images from 1992 to 2006. Land cover maps were generated using object-based image analysis supplemented by ancillary information. Extensive fieldwork was carried out for ground truthing and validation. The use of LCCS was instrumental in bringing general understanding of the classification systems and helping to gain greater clarity and accuracy in the results. About 70% of the SNPBZ area is covered by snow and ice, glaciers, bare rocks, and bare soil. Altitude and its influence on climatic conditions have dominated the distribution pattern of vegetation in SNPBZ. The analysis showed that forest is being converted into shrub at elevations between 3000 and 4000 m, while shrub is decreasing between 4000 and 5000 m. A major decrease in snow cover is seen above 5000 m. Harmonization of the classification system helped to gain more reliable information on changes, as comparisons were made between the classes with consistent definitions.

Forest conversion due to illegal logging and agricultural expansion is a major problem that is hampering biodiversity conservation efforts in the TDNP region. Yet, areas vulnerable to forest conversion are unknown. In this paper, we predicted areas vulnerable to forest changes in the TDNP region using multi-temporal remote sensing data and a multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) with a Markov chain model (MLPNN-M). The MLPNN-M model predicted increasing pressure in the remaining primary forest within the park as well as on the secondary forest in the surrounding areas. The primary forest is predicted to decrease from 18.03% in 2007 to 15.10% in 2014 and 12.66% in 2021. Our results can be used to prioritize locations for future biodiversity conservation and forest management efforts. The combined use of remote sensing and spatial modeling techniques provides an effective tool for monitoring the remaining forests in the TDNP region.

Fine-scale assessment of hay meadow productivity and plant diversity in the European Alps using field spectrometric data	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												The potential of field hyperspectral remote sensing data for non-destructive assessment of hay meadow biomass and vascular plant diversity has been investigated. Spectrometric and agronomic data were acquired at peak biomass over 34 sites distributed at diverse elevation and slopes over an area of 220 km(2) in the Central Alps (Valtellina, Northern Italy). Different modelling approaches were tested to evaluate the predictive performance of spectral measurements: (i) the use of two band ratios of reflectance as input in ordinary least square regression models and (ii) the use of all reflectance bands as input in multivariate partial least square regression models. Each model was subjected to leave-one-out cross-validation and evaluated using the cross-validated coefficient of determination and the root mean square error. Fresh biomass and fuel moisture content were predicted with an average error of <20%, while Shannon Diversity Index and plant species richness were predicted with an average error of <15%, with no relevant differences between the two modelling approaches. Best models for plant diversity indicator prediction were based on chlorophyll/nitrogen sensible bands in the blue and red spectral regions. This observation together with the apparent negative correlation between hay meadow plant diversity and canopy chlorophyll/nitrogen content in the study area suggests a potential connection between reflectance and plant diversity indicators based on meadow biochemical properties.

When droughts occur, serious social conflicts become apparent in relation to water management practices, i.e. whether to use water for irrigation of croplands or for wetland conservation. Mediterranean wetlands in south-eastern Spain are extremely valuable due to the biodiversity and their role as water reservoirs. In this study, land-cover changes in an artificial wetland are analysed for a drought-affected hydrologic year (2004-2005) in comparison to an average hydrologic year (2000-2001) by means of remote sensing techniques. Land-cover components (vegetation, soil and water) obtained from linear spectral unmixing (LSU) were used to detect temporal changes within and outside the "El Hondo" Natural Park wetland. During the drought period significant differences in vegetation, soil and water components were observed within the protected area with respect to outside. This suggests different water management practices within and outside the Park during the drought. The land-cover maps of 2001 and 2005 that were derived from the LSU components highlight these significant land-cover changes, especially within the protected area. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

New strategies are required to more effectively select MPA locations and increase the pace of their implementation. Many criteria exist to design MPA networks, but generally, it is recommended that networks conserve a diversity of species selected for, among other attributes, their representativeness, rarity, or endemicity. Because knowledge of species' spatial distribution remains scarce, efficient surrogates are urgently needed. We used five different levels of habitat maps and six spatial scales of analysis to identify under which circumstances habitat data used to design MPA networks for Wallis Island provided better representation of species than random choice alone. Protected-area site selections were derived from a rarity-complementarity algorithm. Habitat surrogacy was tested for commercial fish species, all fish species, commercially harvested invertebrates, corals, and algae species. Efficiency of habitat surrogacy varied by species group, type of habitat map, and spatial scale of analysis. Maps with the highest habitat thematic complexity provided better surrogates than simpler maps and were more robust to changes in spatial scales. Surrogates were most efficient for commercial fishes, corals, and algae but not for commercial invertebrates. Conversely, other measurements of species-habitat associations, such as richness congruence and composition similarities provided weak results. We provide, in part, a habitat-mapping methodology for designation of MPAs for Pacific Ocean islands that are characterized by habitat zonations similar to Wallis. Given the increasing availability and affordability of space-borne imagery to map habitats, our approach could appreciably facilitate and improve current approaches to coral reef conservation and enhance MPA implementation.

How widespread is woody plant encroachment in temperate Australia? Changes in woody vegetation cover in lowland woodland and coastal ecosystems in Victoria from 1989 to 2005	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Encroachment or densification by woody plants affects natural ecosystems around the world. Many studies have reported encroachment in temperate Australia, particularly in coastal ecosystems and grassy woodlands. However, the degree to which published studies reflect broad-scale changes is unknown because most studies intentionally sampled areas with conspicuous densification. We aimed to estimate changes in woody vegetation cover within lowland grassy woodland and coastal ecosystems in Victoria from 1989 to 2005 to determine whether published reports of recent encroachment are representative of broad-scale ecosystem changes. Location All lowland grassy woodland and coastal ecosystems (c. 6.11 x 105 ha) in Victoria, Australia. Four major ecosystems were analysed: Plains woodlands, Herb-rich woodlands, Riverine woodlands and Coastal vegetation. Methods Changes in woody vegetation cover from 1989 to 2005 were assessed based on state-wide vegetation maps and Landsat analyses of woody vegetation cover conducted by the Australian Greenhouse Office's National Carbon Accounting System. The results show changes in woody cover within mapped patches of native vegetation, rather than changes in the extent of woody vegetation resulting from clearing and revegetation. Results When pooled across all ecosystems, woody vegetation increased by 18,730 ha from 1989 to 2005. Woody cover within Riverine woodlands and within Plains woodlands each increased by > 7000 ha. At the patch scale, the mean percentage cover of woody vegetation in each polygon increased by > 5% in all four ecosystems: Riverine woodlands (+9.2% on average), Herb-rich woodlands (+7.6%), Plains woodlands (+6.7%) and Coastal vegetation (+5.9%). Regression models relating degree of encroachment to geographic and climatic variables were extremely weak (r2 < 0.026), indicating that most variation occurred at local scales rather than across broad geographic gradients. Main conclusions At the scale of observation, woody vegetation cover increased in all lowland woodland and coastal ecosystems over the 16-year period. Thus, published examples of encroachment in selected coastal and woodland patches do appear to reflect widespread increases in woody vegetation cover in these ecosystems. This densification appears to be associated with changes in land management rather than with post-fire vegetation recovery and is likely to be ongoing and long-lasting, with substantial implications for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services.

Increasing population along with the demand for more food, fodder and fuelwood has given rise to a chain of interrelated economic, social and environmental issues associated with the land degradation. Desertification is essentially a result of soil degradation. A variety of natural and human factors are contributing to desertification, including drought, overgrazing, over exploitation of land and water resources, over cultivation of marginal lands, deforestation, soil erosion, water logging and salinity and the use of inappropriate agricultural technologies. The consequences of this are: abandoned croplands, affected by waterlogging and salinity; abandoned villages, traditional irrigation systems and croplands desertified by deteriorated groundwater aquifers or lowering of the water table; siltation of rivers, irrigation systems and reservoirs; landslides in hilly areas. The desertification leads to agricultural productivity losses and enhance poverty. It also causes significant reductions in carbon storage in soils, contributing to global warming, and loss of biodiversity. Various approaches are being applied to combat the menace of desertification. Introduction of rapid growing exotic species of trees and grasses for stabilization of shifting sand dunes; creation of microclimates through shelterbelt plantation have proved highly successful towards the control of desertification. Sustainable land management (SLM), soil and water conservation, afforestation and rehabilitation of degraded land, repetitive high resolution satellite images, delineation and mapping of affected areas, remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) arc likely to be suitable strategies for combating desertification in Pakistan. The efforts already underway to combat desertification need to be strengthened and integrated through a nationally supported, coordinated and monitored system.																	1459-0255					APR	2010	8	2	2				1203	1208										WOS:000279103700109						
J	DeFries, R; Pandey, D				DeFries, R.; Pandey, D.			Urbanization, the energy ladder and forest transitions in India's emerging economy	LAND USE POLICY												Urbanization is currently a major force in tropical land use transitions as economic activities aggregate in urban centers, particularly in Asia. This paper examines relationships among urbanization, household energy source, and forest cover at the state level in India using available census, survey, and remote sensing analysis from the 1990s and 2000s. Central questions include (1) how rapidly are urban and rural households switching from traditional to modern fuel sources; and (2) what are the consequences of changing household energy sources for fuelwood demand and forest cover. Country-wide. 30 and 78% of urban and rural households respectively used fuelwood for cooking in 1993. In urban households, the percentage decreased to 22% by 2005 with a shift towards liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The shift occurred across almost all income classes. In rural areas. the use of LPG increased fourfold but 75% of households still rely on fuelwood. Despite the decline in percentage households using traditional fuels, fuelwood demand continued to increase from 1993 to 2005 at a national scale due to an increasing total number of households. However, 25% of states and union territories experienced declines in rural fuelwood demand and over 70% declines in urban fuelwood demand. Forest cover has remained steady or increased slightly over the time period, reaffirming the conclusion that fuelwood demand may lead to local degradation but not large-scale deforestation. At the state level, increases in percent forest cover between 2000 and 2004 are positively associated with percent of total households that are urban (corresponding to fewer percentage households using wood) but not related to changes in fuelwood demand. Plantations are a primary cause of increases in forest area, where benefits to ecosystem services such as biodiversity and hydrologic function are controversial. Results suggest that households will continue to climb the energy ladder with future urbanization, resulting in substantial development benefits and reduced exposure to indoor air pollution. Implications of reduced fuelwood demand for forest cover are less certain but the limited data suggest that urbanization will promote a transition to increasing forest cover in the Indian context.

Managing these environments effectively requires a comprehensive inventory of the resource and cost-effective tools for regular monitoring. The complex and extensive margins of natural water bodies make them difficult to sample comprehensively. Problems thus occur with extrapolating point-specific sampling to accurately represent the diversity of vegetation in large freshwater bodies. Mapping freshwater vegetation using satellite remote sensing can overcome problems associated with access, scale and distribution, but it requires high-resolution images that have appropriate spectral characteristics. This paper provides an overview of the optical satellite data characteristics required for mapping riparian, submerged and emergent vegetation associated with freshwater environments in New Zealand.

J	Muller, J; Stadler, J; Brandl, R				Mueller, Joerg; Stadler, Jutta; Brandl, Roland			Composition versus physiognomy of vegetation as predictors of bird assemblages: The role of lidar	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Whether diversity and composition of avian communities is determined primarily by responses of species to the floristic composition or to the structural characteristics of habitats has been an ongoing debate, at least since the publication of MacArthur and MacArthur (1961). This debate, however, has been hampered by two problems: 1) it is notoriously time consuming to measure the physiognomy of habitat, particularly in forests, and 2) rigorous statistical methods to predict the composition of bird assemblages from assemblages of plants have not been available. Here we use airborne laser scanning (lidar) to measure the habitat (vegetation) structure of a montane forest across large spatial extents with a very fine grain. Furthermore, we use predictive co-correspondence and canonical correspondence analyses to predict the composition of bird communities from the composition and structure of another community (i.e. plants). By using these new techniques, we show that the physiognomy of the vegetation is a significantly more powerful predictor of the composition of bird assemblages than plant species composition in the field and as well in the shrub/tree layer, both on a level of p<0.001. Our results demonstrate that ecologists should consider remote sensing as a tool to improve the understanding of the variation of bird assemblages in space and time. Particularly in complex habitats, such as forests, lidar is a valuable and comparatively inexpensive tool to characterize the structure of the canopy even across large and rough terrain.

The prominence of and biases in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning research	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												The sub-discipline of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) has emerged as a central topic in contemporary ecological research. However, to date no study has evaluated the prominence and publication biases in BEF research. Herein we report the results of a careful quantitative assessment of BEF research published in five core general ecology journals from 1990 to 2007 to determine the position of BEF research within ecology, identify patterns of research effort within BEF research, and discuss their probable proximal and historical causes. The relative importance of BEF publications increased exponentially during the period analyzed and was significantly greater than the average growth of ecological literature, affirming the prominence of BEF as a current paradigm in ecology. However, BEF research exhibited a strong bias toward experimental studies on terrestrial plant communities, with significantly lower effort devoted to the functional aspects of biodiversity in aquatic systems, multiple trophic level systems, and animal or microbial communities. Such trends may be explained by a combination of methodological adequacy and historic epistemological differences in ecological thinking. We suggest that BEF researchers should direct more effort toward the study of aquatic systems and animal communities, emphasize long-term and trophically complex experiments, such as those with multi-trophic microbial communities, employ larger-scale field observational studies and increase the use of integrative and theoretical studies. Many technical and analytical methodologies that are already employed in ecological research, such as stable isotopes, paleobiology, remote sensing, and model selection criteria, can facilitate these aims. Overcoming the above-mentioned shortcomings of current BEF research will greatly improve our ability to predict how biodiversity loss will affect ecosystem processes and services in natural ecosystems.

ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Different approaches for the assessment of biodiversity by means of remote sensing were developed over the last decades. A new approach, based on the spectral variation hypothesis, proposes that the spectral heterogeneity of a remotely sensed image is correlated with landscape structure and complexity which also reflects habitat heterogeneity which itself is known to enhance species diversity. In this context, previous studies only applied species richness as a measure of diversity. The aim of this paper was to analyze the relationship of richness and abundance-based diversity measures with spectral variability and compare the results at two scales. At three different test sites in Central Namibia, measures of vascular plant diversity was sampled at two scales - 100 m(2) and 1000 m(2). Hyperspectral remote sensing data were collected for the study sites and spectral variability, was calculated at plot level. Ordinary least square regression was used to test the relationship between species richness and the abundance-based Shannon Index and spectral variability. We found that Shannon Index permanently achieved better results at all test sites especially at 1000 m(2), Even when all sites where pooled together, Shannon index was still significantly related with spectral variability at 1000 m(2). We suggest incorporating abundance-based diversity measures in studies of relationships between ecological and spectral variability. The contribution made by the high spectral and spatial resolution of the hyperspectral sensor is discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Spatial analysis on impacts of mining activities leading to flood disaster in the Erai watershed, India	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT												Decisions related to mine management, especially pertaining to dumped material, might lead to several environmental hazards including flood risks in mining areas. Excavation and mine dumps are dominant factors of land use/land cover change in the Erai River watershed of Chandrapur district in Maharashtra, India. Identification and quantification of the extent of mining activities is important for assessing how this change in land use/land cover affects ecosystem components such as aesthetics, biodiversity and mitigation of floods in the Erai watershed. The present study utilizes satellite data of Landsat TM (1989), IRS LISS-3 (1999, 2007) and CARTOSAT (2007) to study the extent of surface mines and management of mine over burden (OB) dumps of Hindustan Lalpeth coal mines, Chandrapur, India. Image processing techniques in conjunction with GIS have been used to visualize the flood scenario, the reasons for floods and area under impact. The study indicates that the development of the mine OB dump within the river channel on both the sides has been responsible for the 2006 flood within the region. Further increase in OB dump heights may result in the risk of floods of greater potential during heavy rainfall in the future. The study presents a spatial analysis to assess the impacts of OB dumps in the recent flood in the area. The study also spatially represents the area under impact leading to a disastrous situation due to floods. The study also suggests the probable measures that must be adopted to avoid such situations in future in the mining areas.

Spatial analysis of anthropogenic disturbances in mangrove forests of Bhitarkanika Conservation Area, India	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												The dependence of coastal communities on mangrove forests for direct consumptive use due to the scarcity of alternate resources makes them one of the highly disturbed landscapes. This paper examines the spatial characteristics and extent of anthropogenic disturbances affecting the mangrove forests of Bhitarkanika Conservation Area situated along the east coast of India by using remotely sensed data and GIS, supplemented with socioeconomic surveys. The study reveals that resource extractions from these forests were considerable despite the protected status. Around 14% of the total fuel wood consumed annually in each of the household came from the mangrove forests of the Park. The patterns of consumption were spatially heterogeneous, controlled by the availability of alternatives, ease of accessibility, presence of markets, human density, and forest composition. The disturbance surface showed 30% of the major forest classes to be under high to very high levels of disturbance especially at easy access points. Besides, the distribution of economically useful species also determined the degree of disturbance. Resource use surfaces clearly identified the biotic pressure zones with respect to specific mangrove use and could be combined with the disturbance regime map to prioritize areas for mangrove restoration.																	0255-660X					MAR	2010	38	1					67	83		10.1007/s12524-010-0013-y								WOS:000281393500007

Major ecosystem functions, such as biodiversity, productivity, and soil and water retention, are being lost or weakened in Japan's forests, especially in Japanese cypress (Hinoki; Chamaecyparis Obtusa Sieb.) plantations. Detecting forest degradation is critical to the restoration of the ecosystem in the Kochi area, but ground-based detection methods are labour intensive and difficult to implement in mountainous areas. In this study we examined the ecological characteristics (e. g. soil water content (SWC) and leaf water content) of degraded and healthy forests, based on in situ measurements and controlled experiments, and present a new method for mapping forest degradation based on remote sensing techniques. A field survey was carried out to record the locations and conditions of the degraded Japanese cypress plantations. Empirical relationships among the degraded plantation, SWC, fuel moisture content (FMC), and vegetation indices (VIs) were investigated by field survey and control experiments. We found that the SWC of the degraded Japanese cypress plantations was lower than that of the well-managed Japanese cypress plantations. We also found that the SWC, FMC, and VI are highly correlated (R > 0.80). In addition to the ground investigation, we used the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER) data and compared a number of VIs to determine their relationships to the biophysical/biochemical attributes of vegetation canopies. Our results showed that the ASTER thermal band was the most effective method used to detect degraded Japanese cypress plantations in the study area. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Martinez, S; Ramil, P; Chuvieco, E				Martinez, Susana; Ramil, Pablo; Chuvieco, Emilio			Monitoring loss of biodiversity in cultural landscapes. New methodology based on satellite data	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												One of the most urgent priorities in the conservation and management of biodiversity in Europe is the assessment of landscape conservation conditions, as well as the analysis of landscape changes. Europe is characterised by the heterogeneous nature of its cultural landscapes. We approached the monitoring and management of habitats and landscapes in the European Atlantic Biogeographical Region at landscape level, using a new methodology which integrates geographical information systems (GIS), remote sensing, environmental variables and landscape ecology. The analysis focuses on the biosphere reserve known as Terras do Mino (NW Iberian Peninsula) using two main criteria: a classification scheme based on the pan-European system EUNIS (European Nature Information System) and ecologically meaningful units of analysis, and the assessment of landscape change based on landscape indicators and conservation criteria. Spatial indices, contagion, fractal dimension and dominance, reveal a fragmentation process, occurring at sub-regional level. This process has mainly affected forests and scrublands in the area under study. Our results show the traditional landscape is declining and there is a drop in the habitats of greatest environmental interest. The methodological approach proposed in this paper will facilitate comparative analyses with those changes that may occur in other natural regions within Europe. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	Mondal, P; Southworth, J				Mondal, Pinki; Southworth, Jane			Protection vs. commercial management: Spatial and temporal analysis of land cover changes in the tropical forests of Central India	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Tropical forests worldwide are undergoing rapid changes due to increasing human populations and varied land use practices. In an effort to protect these forests and their species, the number of protected areas has increased exponentially in recent decades. Clearly protected areas play a crucial role in conservation efforts and this strategy has been found to be successful in several studies. However, protected areas are often embedded within a matrix of other land cover types, including non-protected forests, agricultural fields, or urban areas. It is therefore critical for park management to think beyond the borders of their protected areas and work to maintain ecological integrity of the surrounding matrix and the connectivity between protected areas. This study integrates remote sensing, GIS and field observations to examine the effects of different management strategies on land cover changes. As a case study we examine a tiger reserve in Central India which is surrounded by commercially managed forests, representative of many protected areas throughout India. Findings of this study show that while protected areas play an important role in conservation, alternative approaches including favorable management policies could also be effective to extend conservation over larger areas.

J	Pocock, MJO; Evans, DM; Memmott, J				Pocock, Michael J. O.; Evans, Darren M.; Memmott, Jane			The impact of farm management on species-specific leaf area index (LAI): Farm-scale data and predictive models	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Leafarea index (LAI; the single-sided leaf area per unit area of ground) is a measure of plant standing crop in terrestrial ecosystems and is a key parameter in meteorological, climate and hydrological models. While the LAI of individual species can be measured by destructive harvesting and LAI of whole landscapes can be estimated by remote sensing, estimates of species-specific LAI at the landscape-scale are lacking. Working on a 125 ha farm in Somerset, UK during the summers of 2007 and 2008, we developed a method to identify sources of variation in total leaf area over time, between habitats and between species. We measured LAI for all vegetation types on the farm, namely: crops, unmanaged non-woody vegetation, hedgerows and trees. We used established methods to estimate LAI, mostly by gap fraction analysis with a LI-COR LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer and we divided LAI into its constituent species based on the data from field surveys. We found that the total LAI of the farm was 4.1, although this varied substantially between habitats from 3.3 for cereal fields to 8.0 for woods. Each month we measured LAI and found that, depending on the month, 61-81% of the leaf area was comprised of crop species (including grass and clover in pastures and short-term leys), 7-10% was woody vegetation and the remainder was non-woody semi-natural vegetation. We developed predictive models of LAI, based on our measurements of LAI in each habitat, and found that, for non-woody vegetation, variation in LAI was a function of vegetation type and vegetation height, while for hedgerows LAI was a function of hedge height and width. From our data and our predictive models we predicted changes in LAI due to five likely farm management scenarios. Changes that would have a huge impact on the visual landscape (loss of woods, reduction in hedge size) were predicted to have a smaller effect on farm-scale LAI than changes that would be visually more subtle (changes in vegetation length of grass fields). This type of modelling could be combined with regional land use data to predict the effect of regional agricultural changes (changes in land use or the intensity of land management) on LAI, and hence on ecosystems, biogeochemical cycling, carbon sequestration and hydrology.

Forest restoration is likely to be more successful when it proceeds with an understanding of how native and exotic vertebrates utilize forest patches of different size. We used a system of forest fragments isolated by volcanic activity 153 years ago in Hawaii to examine how long-term fragmentation, as well as fragment size and structural features affect the richness of native and exotic bird species. The total number of bird species increased rapidly with forest fragment size, with most of the native species pool found in patches <3 ha. Smaller fragments were dominated by native bird species with several exotic bird species found only in the largest fragments, suggesting that exotic bird species in this landscape show greater area-sensitivity than native species. We used airborne scanning light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to assess whether fragment area was correlated with estimates of fragment vegetation volume as well as measures of tree height. Fragment area was highly correlated with vegetation volume, maximum tree height, and canopy height heterogeneity, and these variables were strong predictors of bird richness, demonstrating that remote sensing can provide key insights into the relationship between fragment structural attributes and biodiversity indicators. Overall, this work demonstrates the value of conserving small remnant mid-elevation forest patches for native birds in Hawaii. This work also provides insight into how newly created forest patches might be used by native and exotic bird species in Hawaii. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Regulated private" lands were dominated by lands in Maine covered by a Land Use Regulatory Commission. The AGB means between all pairs of the identified ownership categories were significantly different (P < 0.05). Mean AGB observed in public lands (156 Mg/ha) was 43% higher than that in regulated private lands (109 Mg/ha), or 30% higher than that of private lands as a whole. Seventy-seven percent of the regional forests (or about 9,300 km(2)) with AGB > 200 Mg/ha were located outside the area designated in the PAD and concentrated in western MA, southern VT, southwestern NH, and northwestern CT. While relatively unfragmented and high-AGB forests (> 200 Mg/ha) accounted for about 8% of total forested land, they were unevenly proportioned among the three major ownership groups across the region: 19.6% of the public land, 0.8% of the regulated private land, and 11.0% of the other private land. Mean disturbance rates (in absolute value) between 1992 and 2001 were 16, 66, and 19 percent, respectively, on public, regulated private, and other private land. This indicates that management practices from different ownerships have a strong impact on dynamic changes of landscape structures and AGB distributions. Our results may provide insight information for policy makers on issues regarding forest carbon management, conservation biology, and biodiversity studies at regional level.

Remotely-Sensed Active Fire Data for Protected Area Management: Eight-Year Patterns in the Manas National Park, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands, which once extended along most of the Himalayan foothills, now only remain in a number of protected areas. Within these localities, grassland burning is a major issue, but data on frequency and distribution of fires are limited. Here, we analysed the incidence of active fires, which only occur during the dry season (Nov.-Mar.), within a significant area of Terai grasslands: the Manas National Park (MNP), India. We obtained locations of 781 fires during the 2000-2008 dry seasons, from the Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) that delivers global MODIS hotspot/fire locations using remote sensing and GIS technologies. Annual number of fires rose significantly from around 20 at the start of the study period to over 90 after 2002, with most (85%) detected between December and January. Over half of the fires occurred in tall grasslands, but fire density was highest in wetland and riverine vegetation, dry at the time. Most burning took place near rivers, roads and the park boundary, suggesting anthropogenic origins. A kernel density map of all recorded fires indicated three heavily burnt areas in the MNP, all within the tall grasslands. Our study demonstrates, despite some technical caveats linked to fire detection technology, which is improving, that remote fire data can be a practical tool in understanding fire concentration and burning temporal patterns in highly vulnerable habitats, useful in guiding management.																	0364-152X					FEB	2010	45	2					414	423		10.1007/s00267-009-9411-8								WOS:000274399400018	20016983

An early forecast for the montane belt of Majella, Italy	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Alternative hypotheses on post-fire successions of monospecific European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and black pine (Pinus nigra Arnold) forests are investigated. The research area is located in the centre of the Apennine montane belt, Italy and covers portions of the Roccamorice and Lettomanoppello municipalities within the Majella, National Park. Temporal moderate-resolution (MODIS) and spatial mid-resolution (ASTER) imagery are combined for the assessment of the 2007-fire features. Tree seedlings were surveyed on the ground in post-fire forests and their unburnt equivalents during September 2008. The satellite imagery analysis provides records on spread, intensity, location and extent of the forest fires. The evidence suggests an abandoned farmland fire spreading secondarily uphill into the forests. The early post-fire beech forest manifests primarily beech seedlings and beech sprouts, rarely interspersed with seedlings of maples (Acer spp.) and manna-ash (Fraxinus ornus L.), indicating a low probability of succession to mixed forest. The post-fire pine plantation appears to convert to a mannaash bush-woodland, whereas the unburnt pine manifests succession to a mixed forest with beech and maples. Based on our findings, specific fire control and silvicultural interventions are recommended. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.				Faculty of ITC, Dep Nat.

Harnessing wireless sensor technologies to advance forest ecology and agricultural research	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Over the past few decades, wireless technologies have revolutionized personal communications by improving flexibility and solving myriad logistical constraints. Recently, wireless sensor technologies have begun offering similar enhancements to communications between the scientist and the environment. This includes monitoring of civil structures and natural ecosystems. Although forest biology has benefited from novel technologies such as remote sensing and GIS, many 'on the ground' sensing technologies have not changed in many decades. What can wireless sensor networks offer the forest and agricultural scientist? We suggest at least three benefits: improved experimental design via flexible equipment deployment, improved monitoring access in logistically challenging environments (i.e. tall tree canopies) and increased density of observations for better validation of models and hypotheses. Here we briefly describe the current state of wireless environmental monitoring from an end-user point of view and report our initial attempts to adapt this cutting-edge technology to the realm of forest research.

J	Fernandez, N; Paruelo, JM; Delibes, M				Fernandez, Nestor; Paruelo, Jose M.; Delibes, Miguel			Ecosystem functioning of protected and altered Mediterranean environments: A remote sensing classification in Donana, Spain	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Spatial heterogeneity in ecosystem functioning is a key component of ecological variability requiring special attention in the context of global change. A large history of human use has produced high physiognomic heterogeneity in Mediterranean ecosystems. However, the consequences for ecosystem functioning remain insufficiently understood. We analyzed spectral indicators of matter and energy fluxes in the land surface to classify the functional ecosystem heterogeneity in a Mediterranean region covering different management histories and protection types. We specifically analyzed the spatial variability in seasonal and annual patterns in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), surface temperature (T(s)) and albedo from five Landsat ETM images. Then we classified numerically this variability into ecosystem functional types (EFTs) and explored their seasonal dynamics in terms of photosynthetic radiation absorption and evapotranspiration. We identified eight main EFTs with ecologically relevant differences including contrasting dynamics in MAR seasonality, great variation in incoming radiation reflection and differing evapotranspiration rates, particularly during the water-limitation period. Functional variability in natural vegetation mostly consisted in dissimilar annual rates of NDVI and albedo, whereas differences in seasonality were more evident in transformed areas. Similarly, the spatial distribution of EFTs was partly associated to protection, with two EFTs exclusive of protected areas and comparatively higher functional diversity in humanized areas. Landform effects on water availability in protected areas and human activities under different ecological settings were seemingly responsible for the large functional diversity of the region. We advocate for the explicit incorporation of multifunctional ecosystem heterogeneity in ecosystem management and monitoring designs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

FUZZY AND BOOLEAN FOREST MEMBERSHIP: ON THE ACTUAL SEPARABILITY OF LAND COVER CLASSES	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Forests are among the most important habitats of the Earth for several ecological reasons and their management is a prior task when dealing with landscape conservation. Thematic maps and remote sensing data are powerful tools to be used in landscape planning and forest management; nevertheless, most of the European and Mediterranean forest monitoring and conservation programs do not take into account the continuity of the variation of habitats within the landscape but they only rely on boolean classification methods. The utilisation of a classification method that applies a continuity criterion is fundamental because it is expected to better represent the ecological gradients within a landscape. The aim of this paper is to assess the amount of classification uncertainty related to crisp (boolean) classes, particularly focusing on forest identification uncertainty. Forest fuzzy membership of the Tuscany region (Italy) derived from a Landsat ETM+ image scene was compared with the widely used crisp datasets in European forests management and conservation practices, i.e. the European JRC Forest/Non-Forest map, the CORINE Land Cover 2000 (levels 1 and 2), as well as the Global Land Cover 2000, in order to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the separability of crisp classes with respect to forest fuzzy membership. A statistically significant (p < 0.001) forest fuzzy membership separability among the considered crisp classes was found. Despite the crisp dataset and hierarchical level taken into account, both forest and non-forest crisp classes showed a high degree of forest fuzzy membership variability. Therefore, given the intrinsic mixture of crisp land cover classes, ecological studies on forestal ecosystems should rigorously take into account the classification uncertainty related to a crisp view of ecological entities which are being mapped.

J	Diepart, JC				Diepart, Jean-Christophe			Cambodian peasant's contribution to rural development: a perspective from Kampong Thom Province	BIOTECHNOLOGIE AGRONOMIE SOCIETE ET ENVIRONNEMENT												The paper aims to identify the rationality of peasant communities and their contribution to rural development in Kampong Thom province. To do so, an interdisciplinary analytical framework addresses the dynamics of land use and land tenure, the strategies of labor force allocation as well as the determinants of land and labor agricultural productivities amongst peasant communities. It rests on details field surveys in two communes located in very distinct agro-ecological settings of Kampong Thom province. A land use change analysis based on time-series aerial photos is conducted with participatory inventories of natural resources. It shows that endogenous management of forest and fisheries resources generate significant incomes and, at the same time, contribute to maintaining biodiversity. The paper analyses how this contribution is challenged by the non-peasant actors involved in massive State land privatization. Aiming to full employment, peasant households enjoy a great flexibility in the way they allocate labor force, especially in line with the age of active labor and the fluctuation of labor opportunity costs. Principally due to an unequal land holding distribution, agricultural income is unfairly distributed but this inequality is actually balanced by the access to common-pool resources of crucial importance for the poorest and by the recourse to non farming activities, which is an important factor of socio-economic differentiation amongst households. The main economic indicators of rice production confirm that peasant households always try to maximize their income in step with the production factor they have in relatively less amount. A land market simulation stresses that, contrarily to theoretical assumptions, land access through sale ( and purchase) does not result in a fairer land distribution. Nevertheless, land leases amongst peasant households seem more promising to ensure equitable access to land as they are embedded in collective security mechanisms activated by peasantry. The paper argues that peasant communities in the studied area constitute a solid basis for rural development as they offer a very good articulation between economic efficiency, social justice and environmental sustainability. Finally, recommendations are formulated to properly address peasant contribution to rural development in the new national agrarian policies.																	1370-6233						2010	14	2					321	340										WOS:000282403300005

The Importance of Defining 'Forest': Tropical Forest Degradation, Deforestation, Long-term Phase Shifts, and Further Transitions	BIOTROPICA												While research continues on the causes, consequences, and rates of deforestation and forest degradation in the tropics, there is little agreement about what exactly is being lost, what we want back, and to whom the 'we' refers. Particularly unsettling is that many analyses and well-intended actions are implemented in fogs of ambiguity surrounding definitions of the term 'forest'-a problem that is not solely semantic; with development of markets for biomass carbon, vegetation classification exercises take on new relevance. For example, according to the basic implementation guidelines of the Kyoto Protocol, closed canopy natural forest could be replaced by monoclonal plantations of genetically engineered exotic tree species and no deforestation would have occurred. Following these same guidelines, carbon credits for afforestation could be available for planting trees in species-rich savannas; these new plantations would count towards a country moving towards the 'forest transition,' the point at which there is no net 'forest' loss. Such obvious conflicts between biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration might be avoided if 'forest' was clearly defined and if other vegetation types and other ecosystem values were explicitly recognized. While acknowledging that no one approach to vegetation classification is likely to satisfy all users at all scales, we present an approach that recognizes the importance of species composition, reflects the utility of land-cover characteristics that are identifiable via remote sensing, and acknowledges that many sorts of forest degradation do not reduce carbon stocks (e. g., defaunation) or canopy cover (e. g., over-harvesting of understory nontimber forest products).																	0006-3606					JAN	2010	42	1					10	20		10.1111/j.1744-7429.2009.00567.x								WOS:000273301100003						
J	Altamirano, A; Lara, A				Altamirano, Adison; Lara, Antonio			Deforestation in temperate ecosystems of pre-Andean range of south-central Chile	BOSQUE												A multitemporal analysis to determine the land cover change was conduced in the pre-Andean range of Maule region of Chile. We used satellite imagery from the year 1989 and 2003 to analyze the likely causes of native forest change. In this period, there was a reduction in native forest area of 44% in the study area, which is equivalent to an annual forest loss rate of 4.1%. The native forest area is replaced by shrublands (29%) and exotic forest plantations (27%). A great proportion of current exotic forest plantations are established on lands that were native forest in 1989 (63%). Most forest loss was associated with intermediate elevation and less distance to road network, where native forest area dominated. Native forest replacing by shrublands was associated to selective forest logging and firewood, which leads to degradation of these forests. Native forest replacing by exotic forest plantations was the result of the forestation incentive and an increase in the demand for forest products such as wood and pulp. Because of multiple impacts of the forest loss, we propose to focus the government incentives. Priority areas for incentives must be characterized by high forest loss rate and poverty, presence of threatened species and low availability of water from catchments. Moreover, we propose to prioritize the connectivity of the current network protected areas and to develop an effective forest management monitoring system using advanced technologies.																	0717-9200						2010	31	1					53	64		10.4067/S0717-92002010000100007								WOS:000277434400007

Estimating the age of cerrado regeneration using Landsat TM data	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING					30th Canadian Symposium on Remote Sensing	JUN 22-25, 2009	Lethbridge, CANADA	Canadian Remote Sensing Soc				Cerrado is a woody savanna formation covering about one fifth of Brazil with a very complex structure and rich biodiversity. Its rate of conversion surpasses that of all other biomes in Brazil. Remote sensing is the only practical means to monitor the evolution of its conversion and regeneration. The objective of this article is to study the process of regeneration of cerrado vegetation after being a eucalyptus plantation for two decades and to estimate its age using multitemporal Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data. The study area is a state park in Minas Gerais that was a eucalyptus plantation until 1994 with a broad range of regeneration ages between 13 and 34 years. A total of 47 plots were surveyed for which the exact ages of regeneration are known. Eighteen Landsat TM images were digitally processed to model the reflectance trajectory of the regenerating cerrado and determine its age. Results show that spectral data can be used for estimating the age regeneration up to 30 years with an average accuracy of 3-4 years. In particular, the spectral trajectory of band 5 of TM data shows an almost linear trend that directly relates to the time elapsed after the clearcut.

Warming Seas in the Coral Triangle: Coral Reef Vulnerability and Management Implications	COASTAL MANAGEMENT												The highest diversity coral reefs in the world, located in the Coral Triangle, are threatened by a variety of local stresses including pollution, overfishing, and destructive fishing in addition to climate change impacts, such as increasing sea surface temperatures (SSTs), and ocean acidification. As climate change impacts increase, coral reef vulnerability at the ecoregional scale will have an increasingly important influence on conservation management decisions. This project provides the first detailed assessment of past and future climatic stress, thermal variability, and anthropogenic impacts in the Coral Triangle at the ecoregional level, thus incorporating both local (e.g., pollution, development, and overfishing) and global threats (increasing SSTs). The development of marine protected area (MPA) networks across the Coral Triangle is critical for the region to address these threats. Specific management recommendations are defined for MPA networks based on the levels of vulnerability to thermal and local stress. For example, coral reef regions with potentially low vulnerability to thermal stress may be priorities for establishment of MPA networks, whereas high vulnerability regions may require selection and design principles aimed at building resilience to climate change. The identification of climate and other human threats to coral reef systems and ecoregions can help conservation practitioners prioritize management responses to address these threats and identify gaps in MPA networks or other management mechanisms (e. g., integrated coastal management).

J	Boyd, W				Boyd, William			Ways of Seeing in Environmental Law: How Deforestation Became an Object of Climate Governance	ECOLOGY LAW QUARTERLY												Few areas of law are as deeply implicated with science and technology as environmental law, yet we have only a cursory understanding of how science and technology shape the field. Environmental law, it seems, has lost sight of the constitutive role that science and technology play in fashioning the problems that it targets for regulation. Too often, the study and practice of environmental law and governance take the object of governance be it climate change, water pollution, biodiversity, or deforestation as self-evident, natural, and fully-formed without recognizing the significant scientific and technological investments that go into making such objects and the manner in which such investments shape the possibilities for response. This Article seeks to broaden environmental law's field of vision, replacing the tendency to naturalize environmental problems with an exploration of how particular scientific and technological knowledge practices make environmental problems into coherent objects of governance. Such knowledge practices, or ways of seeing, are instrumental in shaping regulatory possibilities and must be interrogated directly as key constituents of particular forms of governance. The argument is developed through a case study of how tropical deforestation, which accounts for some 15 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions but which was expressly excluded from the Kyoto Protocol, has recently become a viable object of climate governance, demonstrating the fundamental importance of conceptual advances in carbon cycle research, the synoptic view of global land cover change made possible by remote sensing, and new carbon accounting techniques in rendering the problem comprehensible for climate policy. Building on the case study, this Article identifies and elaborates on three general ways of seeing kind-making, calculability, and equivalence that operate through particular scientific and technical practices to shape and inform the substance of environmental law, with specific attention to the implications of the overall approach for a comprehensive theory of the field.																	0046-1121						2010	37	3					843	916										WOS:000283454300002

A review on hyperspectral remote sensing for homogeneous and heterogeneous forest biodiversity assessment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												This review paper evaluates the potential of hyperspectral remote sensing for assessing species diversity in homogeneous (non-tropical) and heterogeneous (tropical) forest, an increasingly urgent task. Existing studies of species distribution patterns using hyperspectral remote sensing have used different techniques to discriminate different species, in which the wavelet transforms, derivative analysis and red edge positions are the most important of them. The wavelet transform is used based on its effectiveness and determined as the most powerful technique to identify species. Furthermore, estimations of relationships between spectral values and species distributions using chemical composition of foliage, tree phenology, selection of signature training sites based on field measured canopy composition, selection of the best wavelet coefficient and waveband regions may be useful to identify different plant species. This paper presents a summary on the feasibility, operational applications and possible strategies of hyperspectral remote sensing in forestry, especially in assessing its biodiversity. The paper also reviews the processing and analysis of techniques for hyperspectral data in discriminating different forest tree species.

J	Rocchini, D; Vannini, A				Rocchini, Duccio; Vannini, Arianna			What is up? Testing spectral heterogeneity versus NDVI relationship using quantile regression	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Environmental diversity and net primary productivity (NPP) are powerful indicators of local plant species richness (alpha-diversity). Remote sensing proxies of environmental diversity, such as spectral heterogeneity and NPP, are often used in modelling species richness variability, usually through regression analysis. As multicollinearity may affect analysis of species diversity, the interdependence of such proxies should be a major concern in their use. However, few attempts have been made to examine the interdependence between spectral heterogeneity and NPP proxies such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), in most cases using Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression or Pearson correlations. We test the possible dependence of Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) local spectral heterogeneity versus NDVI using quantile regression and rejecting the main assumption of OLS regression, i.e. the symmetry of model residuals. A second-order polynomial function was fitted to the data and both OLS and quantile regression led to a humped-back relationship between spectral heterogeneity and biomass. Nonetheless while for most of the quantiles the humped-back curve was significant (with a negative and significant quadratic slope), for quantiles higher than 0.90, the parabola opened up until it reached an almost linear shape, showing that, at very low values of biomass, pixels may show high levels of local heterogeneity. Hence, patterns of spectral heterogeneity versus NDVI are possible when considering maximum potential spectral variability. We show that the investigation of all possible subsets within a scatter plot may lead to identification of patterns that remain hidden in OLS regression.

The multispectral separability of Costa Rican rainforest types with support vector machines and Random Forest decision trees	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Estimating the extent of tropical rainforest types is needed for biodiversity assessment and carbon accounting. In this study, we used statistical comparisons to determine the ability of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) bands and spectral vegetation indices to discriminate composition and structural types. A total of 144 old-growth forest plots established in northern Costa Rica were categorized via cluster analysis and ordination. Locations for palm swamps, forest regrowth and tree plantations were also acquired, making 11 forest types for separability analysis. Forest types classified using support vector machines (SVM), a theoretically superior method for solving complex classification problems, were compared with the random forest decision tree classifier (RF). Separability comparisons demonstrate that spectral data are sensitive to differences among forest types when tree species and structural similarity is low. SVM class accuracy was 66.6% for all forest types, minimally higher than the RF classifier (65.3%). TM bands and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) combined with digital elevation data notably increased accuracies for SVM (84.3%) and RF (86.7%) classifiers. Rainforest types discriminated here are typically limited to one or two categories for remote sensing classifications. Our results indicate that TM bands and ancillary data combined via machine learning algorithms can yield accurate and ecologically meaningful rainforest classifications important to national and international forest monitoring protocols.

The remote sensing data revealed that in the submergence zone only mixed deciduous forest that occupies 807.5ha area and has a wood biomass volume of 4,027,503m3 is likely to be lost due to impoundment. A total of 165 plant species found in the submergence zone also occur in the influence and free draining catchment area of the project. In the influence zone of the project area only one tree species (Acer oblongum) is found under conservation threat category, which is also present in the free draining catchment of the project. The project affected population (6716 people) residing in the submergence and influence zone depend upon the surrounding forests for fuel wood, fodder, wild edibles etc., and most likely they will settle in the nearby areas, thus mounting more pressure on residual forests of the influence zone for various forest products. Further, from the vegetation analysis it is evident that several tree species (e.g. Lannea coromandelica, Terminalia alata, T. bellerica etc.), may face more pressure from exploitation as they provide a number of useful products and are represented in lower numbers in the forests of the project area. To compensate for the loss of various goods and services provided by the forests falling in the submergence zone and to offset the increased pressure of the project affected families on the forests of influence zone, a biodiversity management plan is suggested incorporating socio-economic considerations.																	0964-0568						2010	53	7					907	923	PII 925289436	10.1080/09640568.2010.490060								WOS:000281729300006

Combining LiDAR and IKONOS Data for Eco-Hydrological Classification of an Ombrotrophic Peatland	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Remote sensing techniques have potential for peatland monitoring, but most previous work has focused on spectral approaches that often result in poor discrimination of cover types and neglect structural information. Peatlands contain structural "microtopes" (e.g., hummocks and hollows) which are linked to hydrology, biodiversity and carbon sequestration, and information on Surface structure is thus a useful proxy for peatland condition. The objective of this work was to develop and rest a new eco-hydrological mapping technique for ombrotrophic (rain-fed) peatlands using a combined spectral-structural remote sensing approach. The study site was Wedholme Flow, Cumbria, UK. Airborne light dectection and ranging (LiDAR) data were used with IKONOS data in a combined multispectral-structural approach for mapping peatland condition classes. LiDAR data were preprocessed so that spatial estimates of minimum and maximum land Surface height, variance and semi-variance (from semi-variogram analysis) were extracted. These were assimilated alongside IKONOS data into a maximum likelihood classification procedure, and thematic outputs were compared. Ecological survey data were used to validate the results. Considerable improvements in thematic separation of peatland classes were achieved when spatially-distributed measurements of LiDAR variance or semi-variance were included. Specifically, the classification accuracy improved From 71.8% (IKONOS data only) to 88.0% when a LiDAR semi-variance product was used. Of note was the improved delineation of management classes (including Eriophorum bog, active raised bog and degraded raised bog). The application of a combined textural-optical approach can improve land cover mapping in areas where reliance on purely spectral discrimination approaches would other-wise result in considerable thematic uncertainty				Bennie, Jonathan/A-6526-2010	Bennie, Jonathan/0000-0003-4394-2041; Lindsay, Richard/0000-0001-5365-0531; Anderson, Karen/0000-0002-3289-2598												0047-2425					JAN-FEB	2010	39	1					260	273		10.2134/jeq2009.0093								WOS:000273579300027	20048314

Observational methods used in marine spatial monitoring of fishes and associated habitats: a review	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Management areas are used in marine spatial planning to conserve biodiversity of marine ecosystems and to protect fish from fishing pressure. To evaluate the effectiveness of these protected areas, observational techniques are used to determine densities, sizes, biomass, habitat types and distribution of fish species in and around management areas. Two types of observational techniques are used in spatial monitoring: (1) fishery-independent techniques, which include underwater visual census (UVC), underwater video, remote sensing, acoustics, and experimental catch and effort data; and (2) fishery-dependent techniques, which include catch, effort and catch per unit effort data from commercial and recreational fisheries. This review summarises the applications, advantages, disadvantages and biases of each of these observational categories and highlights emerging technologies. The main finding from this review was that a combination of observational techniques, rather than a single method, was the most effective approach to marine spatial monitoring. For example, a combination of hydroacoustics for habitat mapping and UVC or video for fish surveys was one of the most cost-effective and efficient means of obtaining fish-habitat linkages and fish assemblage data. There are also emerging technologies that could increase the precision and efficiency of monitoring surveys. There is a need for continued development of non-intrusive technology for marine monitoring studies.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2010	61	2					236	252		10.1071/MF09068								WOS:000274913200012

Scaling giant kelp field measurements to regional scales using satellite observations	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Little is known about the local to regional scale variability in biomass and productivity of many subtidal ecosystems, as appropriate field surveys are both time and labor intensive. Here, we combined high-resolution satellite imagery with aerial photos and diver sampling to assess changes in giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera canopy cover and biomass along a similar to 60 km stretch of coastline in the Santa Barbara Channel, California, USA. Our objectives were to (1) develop new methods for estimating giant kelp canopy cover and biomass using satellite imagery, and (2) assess temporal changes in kelp forest biomass across multiple spatial scales. Results of the satellite kelp cover classification compared very favorably with near-coincident high-resolution aerial camera surveys (r(2) = 0.90). Monthly diver observations of biomass for fixed plots at 3 kelp forest sites were strongly correlated with satellite determinations of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) signals (r(2) = 0.77). This allowed us to examine variation in giant kelp biomass across multiple spatial scales (pixel, plot, site, and region). The relationship between plot scale (40 m) changes in biomass and remote assessments of site scale (similar to 1 km) changes varied among sites and depended on the relative location of the plot and the size of the kelp forest at each site. Changes in biomass among sites were well correlated with each other and with the aggregated regional (similar to 60 km) total. Linking field measurements of giant kelp biomass made on a plot scale with regional estimates made by satellite facilitates an understanding of the regional patterns and drivers of biomass and primary production of giant kelp forest ecosystems.

When a diagnosis is made over all Brazil, the reality is quite different from what is demanded by law. Therefore, this work, as a general objective, proposes ways of establishing Legal Reserves based on the analysis of the environmental deterioration in a river basin. For this purpose, the environmental deterioration was detected based on three diagnoses: physical-conservational, socioeconomical, and environmental quality. In this way, from a quantitative and qualitative diagnosis, it was possible to identify the main aggressive factors in the studied river basin and to indicate the main vulnerabilities that the area is subjected. According to such diagnosis, some proposals for the establishment of Legal Reserves are discussed here based on scientific arguments aimed at the conservation of water resources, soil and biodiversity. It is hoped, that from this study, the environment receives a new tool for diagnosis, pollution control, recovery and conservation of natural resources.

Recent issues such as concern over the effects of acid deposition, biodiversity, forest sustainability, increased demand for forest data, international reporting requirements and climate change have led to the expansion of NFIs to include more variables, greater diversity in sampling protocols and a generally more holistic approach. This review focuses on six selected topics: (1) a brief historical review; (2) a summary of common structural features of NFIs; (3) a brief review of international reporting requirements using NFI data with an emphasis on approaches to harmonized estimation; (4) an overview of inventory estimation methods that can be enhanced with remotely sensed data; (5) an overview of nearest neighbors prediction and estimation techniques; and (6) a brief overview of several emerging issues including carbon inventories in developing countries and use of lidar data. Although general inventory principles will remain unchanged, sampling designs, plot configurations and measurement protocols will require modification before they can be applied in countries with tropical forests.

Using field studies and multi-temporal Landsat imagery, we examine a forest park, Kibale National Park in western Uganda, its changes over time, and related land cover change in the surrounding landscape. We find Kibale has successfully defended its borders and prevents within-park deforestation and other land incursions, and has maintained tree cover throughout the time period of the study. Outside the park there was a significant increase in tea plantations and continued forest fragmentation and wetland loss. The question of whether the park is a conservation success because of the network of forest fragments and wetlands or in spite of them remains unanswered.

Remote sensing of vegetation 3-D structure for biodiversity and habitat: Review and implications for lidar and radar spaceborne missions	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Biodiversity and habitat face increasing pressures due to human and natural influences that alter vegetation structure. Because of the inherent difficulty of measuring forested vegetation three-dimensional (3-D) structure on the ground, this important component of biodiversity and habitat has been, until recently, largely restricted to local measurements, or at larger scales to generalizations. New lidar and radar remote sensing instruments such as those proposed for spaceborne missions will provide the capability to fill this gap. This paper reviews the state of the art for incorporatinginformation on vegetation 3-D structure into biodiversity and habitat science and management approaches, with emphasis on use of lidar and radar data. First we review relationships between vegetation 3-D structure, biodiversity and habitat, and metrics commonly used to describe those relationships. Next, we review the technical capabilities of new lidar and radar sensors and their application to biodiversity and habitat studies to date. We then define variables that have been identified as both useful and feasible to retrieve from spaceborne lidar and radar observations and provide their accuracy and precision requirements. We conclude with a brief discussion of implications for spaceborne missions and research programs. The possibility to derive vegetation 3-D measurements from spaceborne active sensors and to integrate them into science and management comes at a critical juncture for global biodiversity conservation and opens new possibilities for advanced scientific analysis of habitat and biodiversity.

Incorporating remotely sensed tree canopy cover data into broad scale assessments of wildlife habitat distribution and conservation	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Remote sensing provides critical information for broad scale assessments of wildlife habitat distribution and conservation. However, such efforts have been typically unable to incorporate information about vegetation structure, a variable important for explaining the distribution of many wildlife species. We evaluated the consequences of incorporating remotely sensed information about horizontal vegetation structure into current assessments of wildlife habitat distribution and conservation. For this, we integrated the new NLCD tree canopy cover product into the US GAP Analysis database, using avian species and the finished Idaho GAP Analysis as a case study. We found: (1) a 15-68% decrease in the extent of the predicted habitat for avian species associated with specific tree canopy conditions, (2) a marked decrease in the species richness values predicted at the Landsat pixel scale, but not at coarser scales, (3) a modified distribution of biodiversity hotspots, and (4) surprising results in conservation assessment: despite the strong changes in the species predicted habitats, their distribution in relation to the reserves network remained the same. This study highlights the value of area wide vegetation structure data for refined biodiversity and conservation analyses. We discuss further opportunities and limitations for the use of the NLCD data in wildlife habitat studies.

This paper presents an integrated concept for vegetation type mapping in a dry savanna ecosystem based on local scale in-situ botanical survey data with high resolution (Landsat) and coarse resolution (MODIS) satellite time series. In this context, a semi-automated training database generation procedure using object-oriented image segmentation techniques is introduced. A tree-based Random Forest classifier was used for mapping vegetation type associations in the Kalahari of NE Namibia based on inter-annual intensity-and phenology-related time series metrics. The utilization of long-term inter-annual temporal metrics delivered the best classification accuracies (Kappa = 0.93) compared with classifications based on seasonal feature sets. The relationship between annual classification accuracies and bi-annual precipitation sums was conducted using data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Increased error rates occurred in years with high rainfall rates compared to dry rainy seasons. The variable importance was analyzed and showed high-rank positions for features of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the blue and middle infrared bands, indicating that soil reflectance was crucial information for an accurate spectral discrimination of Kalahari vegetation types. Time series features related to reflectance intensity obtained increased rank-positions compared to phenology-related metrics.

J	Sancar, C; Turan, SO; Kadiogullari, AL				Sancar, Cenap; Turan, Sanem Oezen; Kadiogullari, Ali Lhsan			Land use-cover change processes in Urban fringe areas: Trabzon case study, Turkey	SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND ESSAYS												Urban settlements account for only two percent of the Earth's land surface, however, over half of the world's population resides in cities (United Nations, 2001). High population density in urban areas has resulted in a large-scale modification of the environment in urban fringe. Urbanization is a complex process of converting urban fringe and rural land to urban land uses and has caused various impacts on ecosystem structure, function and dynamics (Luck and Wu, 2002). On one hand, the high rate of urbanization causes high density in settlement limited areas of cities, on the other hand, it costs increases to society due to the resulting unplanned and uncontrolled urbanization and land use with the skirts, especially in urban fringe of natural habitat/landscape pieces and the corrupted use of urban areas without taking into account natural law or the ecological balance (Aydemir et al., 1993). Suburban, urban fringe and rural development are a leading cause of biodiversity loss and natural resource degradation in Trabzon province. The detection and analysis of land use changes in the urban environment is an important issue in planning. Remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) are considered as appropriate and efficient techniques for this type of studies. These techniques were used to investigate the effects of urbanization on ecosystem structure (landscape) and to quantify urban growth of Trabzon urban area. Changes of landscape pattern from 1987 to 2008 were analyzed by FRAGSTATS with four metrics, indicating that the diversity and landscape fragmentation are positively related to the degree of urbanization. The study showed that the percentage of urbanization in Trabzon Centrum increased from 4.72 in 1987 to 6.27 in 2008 based on supervised classification of images. Cumulative urbanization accounted for 1.55% of the whole area of Trabzon (254 ha) and 32.8% of the settlement area of the Trabzon from 1987 to 2008. This translates to an annual rate of urbanization of 1.35% between 1987 and 2008. This study demonstrated additional insights into landscape change by integrating the spatial and the temporal perspectives and targeting the forms of residential developments towards urban fringe.

Distinguishing between live and dead standing tree biomass on the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park, USA using small-footprint lidar data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Accurate estimation of live and dead biomass in forested ecosystems is important for studies of carbon dynamics, biodiversity, wildfire behavior, and for forest management. Lidar remote sensing has been used successfully to estimate live biomass, but studies focusing on dead biomass are rare. We used lidar data, in conjunction with field measurements from 58 plots to distinguish between and map standing live and dead tree biomass in the mixed coniferous forest of the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park, USA. Lidar intensity and canopy volume were key variables for estimating live biomass, whereas for dead biomass, lidar intensity alone was critical for accurate estimation. Regression estimates of both live and dead biomass ranged between 0 and 600 Mg ha(-1), with means of 195.08 Mg ha(-1) and 65.73 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Cross validation with field data resulted in correlation coefficients for predicted vs. observed of 0.85 for live biomass (RMSE = 50 Mg ha(-1) and %RMSE (RMSE as a percent of the mean) = 26). For dead biomass, correlation was 0.79, RMSE was 42 Mg ha(-1), and %RMSE was 63. Biomass maps revealed interesting patterns of live and dead standing tree biomass. Live biomass was highest in the ponderosa pine zone, and decreased from south to north through the mixed conifer and spruce-fir forest zones. Dead biomass exhibited a background range of values in these mature forests from zero to 100 Mg ha(-1), with lower values in locations having higher live biomass. In areas with high dead biomass values, live biomass was near zero. These areas were associated with recent wildfires, as indicated by fire maps derived from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity Project (MTBS). Combining our dead biomass maps with the MTBS maps, we demonstrated the complementary power of these two datasets, revealing that MTBS burn intensity class can be described quantitatively in terms of dead biomass. Assuming a background range of dead biomass up to 100 Mg ha(-1), it is possible to estimate and map the contribution to the standing dead tree biomass pool associated with recent wildfire.

J	Chai, SL; Tanner, E; McLaren, K				Chai, Shauna-Lee; Tanner, Edmund; McLaren, Kurt			High rates of forest clearance and fragmentation pre- and post-National Park establishment: The case of a Jamaican montane rainforest	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												The principal defense of tropical forests has been to designate them as protected areas, but few of these protected areas have been studied to determine their effectiveness at preventing forest clearance within their boundaries. We used remote sensing techniques to quantify three fundamental forest cover change processes: forest clearance, re-growth and fragmentation over a 19-year time period, in a National Park of Jamaica. Results show that forest clearance occurred at similar high levels prior and subsequent to the establishment of the area as a National Park in 1993: 1.50% yr(-1) (1983-1992) and 1.42% yr(-1) (19922002), respectively. Fragmentation continued post-establishment, and manifested itself in an increasing number of smaller more vulnerable fragments; the number of fragments increased by 60%, and the mean fragment size decreased by 40%. Core areas decreased with ensuing increases in edge lengths, and fragments became more isolated from one another. After designation as a National Park however, increased forest re-growth occurred, resulting in a 63% decline in the net deforestation rate from 0.80% yr(-1) (19831992) to 0.26% yr(-1) (1992-2002). Image classifications gave accuracies of 90-97% (Kappa 0.80-0.93). Although the decrease in net deforestation may indicate some level of success of this National Park, forest clearance and fragmentation, leading to species shifts and biodiversity loss were still present at pre-National Park levels. We then examined the preponderance of successful protected areas, and found that success may be an artifact of the most widely used method of assessment, which compares deforestation rates inside versus outside protected areas.

J	Nagendra, H; Paul, S; Pareeth, S; Dutt, S				Nagendra, Harini; Paul, Somajita; Pareeth, Sajid; Dutt, Sugato			Landscapes of Protection: Forest Change and Fragmentation in Northern West Bengal, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												In the tropics and sub-tropics, where high levels of biodiversity co-exist with some of the greatest levels of population density, achieving complete exclusion in protected area contexts has proved close to impossible. There is a clear need to recognize that parks are significantly impacted by human-environment interactions in the larger landscape within which they are embedded, and to move the frontier of research beyond the boundaries of protected areas in order to examine larger landscapes where multiple forms of ownership and access are embedded. This research evaluates forest change and fragmentation between 1990 and 2000, in a landscape surrounding the Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary in the Indian state of West Bengal. This protected forest is bounded to the south by a less intensively protected area, the Baikunthapur Reserve Forest, and surrounded by a mosaic of unprotected, largely private land holdings. Results indicate differences in the extent and spatial pattern of forest cover change in these three zones, corresponding to different levels of government protection, access and monitoring. The two protected areas experience a trend toward forest regrowth, relating to the cessation of commercial logging by park management during this period. Yet, there is still substantial clearing toward peripheral areas that are well connected to illegal timber markets by transportation networks. The surrounding landscape, although experiencing some forest regrowth within less intensively cultivated tea plantations, is also becoming increasingly fragmented, with potentially critical impacts on the maintenance of effective wildlife corridors in this ecologically critical region.

Monitoring conservation effectiveness in a global biodiversity hotspot: the contribution of land cover change assessment	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Tropical forests, which play critical roles in global biogeochemical cycles, radiation budgets and biodiversity, have undergone rapid changes in land cover in the last few decades. This study examines the complex process of land cover change in the biodiversity hotspot of Western Ghats, India, specifically investigating the effects of conservation measures within the Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary. Current vegetation patterns were mapped using an IRS P6 LISS III image and this was used together with Landsat MSS data from 1973 to map land cover transitions. Two major and divergent trends were observed. A dominant degradational trend can be attributed to agricultural expansion and infrastructure development while a successional trend, resulting from protection of the area, showed the resilience of the system after prolonged disturbances. The sanctuary appears susceptible to continuing disturbances under the current management regime but at lower rates than in surrounding unprotected areas. The study demonstrates that remotely sensed land cover assessments can have important contributions to monitoring land management strategies, understanding processes underpinning land use changes and helping to inform future conservation strategies.

The role of local and landscape level measures of greenness in modelling boreal plant species richness	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Measurements of primary productivity and its heterogeneity based on satellite images can provide useful estimates of species richness and distribution patterns. However, species richness at a given site may depend not only on local habitat quality and productivity but also on the characteristics of the surrounding landscape. In this study we investigated whether the predictions of species richness of plant families in northern boreal landscape in Finland can be improved by incorporating greenness information from the surrounding landscape, as derived from remotely sensed data (mean, maximum, standard deviation and range values of NDVI derived from Landsat ETM), into local greenness models. Using plant species richness data of 28 plant families from 440 grid cells of 25 ha in size, generalized additive models (GAMs) were fitted into three different sets of explanatory variables: (1) local greenness only, (2) landscape greenness only, and (3) combined local and landscape greenness. The derived richness-greenness relationships were mainly unimodal or positively increasing but varied between different plant families, and depended also on whether greenness was measured as mean or maximum greenness. Incorporation of landscape level greenness variables improved significantly both the explanatory power and cross-validation statistics of the models including only local greenness variables. Landscape greenness information derived from remote sensing data integrated with local information has thus the potentiality to improve predictive assessments of species richness over extensive and inaccessible areas, especially in high-latitude landscapes. Overall, the significant relationship between plants and surrounding landscape quality detected here suggests that landscape factors should be considered in preserving species richness of boreal environments, as well as in conservation planning for biodiversity in other environments.

Spatial and temporal changes of Hyrcanian forest in Iran	IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY												Original old-growth northern forests of Iran are essential sources of genetic variation, biodiversity, commercial woody products, and various environmental services (e.g., ground water reservation, auxiliary forest products provision, wildlife habitation, and erosion control). Today, the forests are depleting rapidly due to population growth, and associated socio-economic problems, industrial development, urbanism, and more recently intensive/irregular tourism. Satellite image processing and other geo-spatial tools have been used in Iran from the early 80's to map the vegetative attributes of forests for environmental resource monitoring. This paper aims to build up a basic assumption of when and how the spectral, spatial and temporal features of satellite-borne remote sensing have been applied for the sustainable resource monitoring of the Caspian forests of Iran. To this end, available literature will be reviewed, specific features of the studies discussed in brief, and the future prospects for remote sensing-aided delineation of structural and functional characteristics of the forests will be outlined.

Location Kyrgyzstan/Central Asia. Methods The study relied on a combination of predictive mapping and remote sensing. Punctual measurements of alpha diversity were linked to topography and reflectance using regression models. For beta diversity, ordination techniques were employed to extract major vegetation gradients. Scores on the ordination axes were regressed against topography as well as reflectance and subsequently mapped. Beta diversity was mapped as spatial turnover rate along these axes. Results The diversity maps quantified species counts and turnover in a spatially contiguous manner while taking into account fuzzy transitions. The variance explained by regression models ranged from 51% to 61% in cross-validation. Many of the observed differences were caused by differences in species shares. The occurrence of walnut, in particular, showed a negative relation to woody species numbers. Conclusion Mapping biodiversity in remote areas can be based on easily accessible spatial data in combination with a set of calibration field samples. With regard to human influence on walnut dominance, a total removal of human land use would be counterproductive in terms of diversity conservation. The results of this study highlight the need for comprehensive analyses of diversity patterns that include spatially contiguous quantifications of species numbers, shares and turnover rates.

J	Butler, DW				Butler, Don William			Planning iterative investment for landscape restoration: Choice of biodiversity indicator makes a difference	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Natural regrowth vegetation offers a cost-effective means of restoring some degraded landscapes. Worldwide, policy responses to climate change are increasing the attractiveness of investment in regrowth protection or facilitation which with strategic planning could also deliver substantial dividends for biodiversity conservation. This study compares the performance of two commonly used indicators of biodiversity conservation priority, irreplaceability and complementarity, as tools to support planning for iterative investment to protect natural regrowth of Brigalow, an endangered ecological community in subtropical eastern Australia. Brigalow covered more than seven million hectares prior to clearing, it now persists 'intact' on less than a tenth of that area but there are significant areas of regrowth. Data on Brigalow regrowth derived from mapping and remote sensing identify 10,555 patches covering 280,000 hectares in total. Two different classifications are used to represent Brigalow biodiversity: a land-type classification of 16 'regional ecosystems' mapped at 1:100,000 scale, and a landscape-scale classification of 40 biogeographic subregions that discriminate relatively uniform landscapes at about 1:500,000 scale. Conservation targets are expressed as the extent of regrowth needed to increase the extent of intact or 'remnant' areas of each biodiversity feature to either 5% or 10% of its former extent. In each case, irreplaceability and complementarity are positively correlated, and either metric type could be used to identify relatively large sets of high-priority patches. However, regional-scale restoration is likely to involve iterative investment and therefore to require discrimination of relatively small sets of patches of the highest priority for biodiversity conservation. Irreplaceability is not an ideal measure of biodiversity value when planning such iterative processes, simply because irreplaceability is uninformative for ranking 'high-value' patches; they all have the highest possible score. This study demonstrates the importance of considering quite fundamental points when choosing metrics for conservation planning, such as the frequency distribution of values they produce. Where planning aims to identify quite small sets of very high value features metrics that are most variable among the highest value patches, like the one used for complementarity, in this study, will be more useful than metrics that are strongly bounded at higher values.

Critical need for new definitions of "forest" and "forest degradation" in global climate change agreements	CONSERVATION LETTERS												If global policies intended to promote forest conservation continue to use the definition of "forest" adopted in 2001 by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (an area of >0.05-1 ha with >10-30% cover of plants >2-5 m tall at maturity), great quantities of carbon and other environmental values will be lost when natural forests are severely degraded or replaced by plantations but technically remain "forests." While a definition of "forest" that is globally acceptable and appropriate for monitoring using standard remote sensing options will necessarily be based on a small set of easily measured parameters, there are dangers when simple definitions are applied locally. At the very least, we recommend that natural forest be differentiated from plantations and that for defining "forest" the lower height limit defining "trees" be set at more than 5 m tall with the minimum cover of trees be set at more than 40%. These changes will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from what is now termed forest "degradation" without increasing monitoring costs. Furthermore, these minor changes in the definition of "forest" will promote the switch from degradation to responsible forest management, which will help mitigate global warming while protecting biodiversity and contributing to sustainable development.

Studied extensively in pastoral areas, piospheres have rarely been investigated in areas hosting rich herbivore diversity. We studied piospheres in woody cover assessed through remote-sensing in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, which has one of the world's largest elephant populations. As no preferred statistical model for piosphere studies has emerged, we first contrasted results from ordinary least-square (OLS) regressions on raw data with those from other statistical models (OLS on aggregated data and simultaneous autoregressive models on raw data), and selected the most parsimonious, unbiased, model to study the influence of artificial and natural waterholes, and the abundance of elephants, others browsers, and grazers on piospheres. OLS models provided unbiased parameter estimates, despite the strong spatial autocorrelation present in woody cover data, whereas other statistical models had important drawbacks. Using an OLS framework we showed that despite an important negative non-linear mean effect, distance-to-water was a poor predictor of woody cover at any location. Woody cover was on average more reduced in the vicinity of water at artificial waterholes than at natural waterholes. Elephant abundance was not consistently associated with lower woody cover, and poorly explained woody cover heterogeneity, as did all other herbivore-related variables. Our study indicates that piospheres may develop differently in pastoral and protected areas, suggesting the importance of herbivore diversity in ecosystem functioning. Our results also show that heterogeneity in woody cover persists within piospheres, calling for further investigation on the origin and role of this heterogeneity in the maintenance of ecological processes and biodiversity within these key-areas of the landscape.

Mapping dead wood distribution in a temperate hardwood forest using high resolution airborne imagery	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Dead wood, in the form of coarse woody debris and standing dead wood, or snags, is an essential structural component of forest ecosystems. It plays a key role in nutrient cycling, ecosystem functions and provision of habitat for a wide variety of species. In order to manage dead wood in a temperate hardwood forest, an understanding of its availability and spatial distribution is important. This research evaluates airborne digital camera remote sensing for mapping temperate forest dead wood across an area within Gatineau Park, Canada. Two approaches were evaluated: (1) direct detection and mapping of canopy dead wood (dead branches and tall snags) through the combination of three techniques in a hybrid classification: ISODATA clustering, object-based classification, and spectral unmixing, and (2) indirect modelling of coarse woody debris and snags using spectral and spatial predictor variables extracted from the imagery. Indirect modelling did not provide useful results while direct detection was successful with field validation showing 94% accuracy for detected canopy level dead wood objects (i.e. 94% of validation sites with canopy dead wood were detected correctly) and 90% accuracy for control sites (i.e. 90% of validation sites with no canopy level dead wood were identified correctly). The procedures presented in this paper are repeatable and could be used to monitor dead wood over time, potentially contributing to applications in forest carbon budget estimation, biodiversity management, and forest inventory.

Impacts of conservation easements for threat abatement and fire management in a rural oak woodland landscape	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Rural residential development can impact habitat and complicate fire management. Conservation easements are created to prevent development but are rarely assessed for their influence on development patterns. In the Lassen Foothills, California, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) holds over 37,000ha of mostly public-funded conservation easements on ranchland dominated by blue oak (Quercus douglasii) woodland. For this region we modeled land use through 2050 under two scenarios, with and without conservation easements, using a rule-based growth model. We mapped development footprints on 760 rural residential parcels through automated remote sensing. From calculated footprint sizes we projected site-level habitat loss for each scenario. We also projected the influence of development patterns on fire management. With easements present the Lassen Foothills would gain about 184 new homes, compared with 223 homes if easements were absent. With an average residential footprint size of 0.34 +/- 0.25 ha (mean +/- SD), we found that easements slightly reduce vegetation conversion, protecting an additional 16.8 ha than were protected by the general plan alone. Without easements, scattered development may alter fire management on 12,370 ha (17.5% of undeveloped wildfire containment areas) by requiring more fire suppression and reducing options for prescribed burning. Low development pressure and county land use policies maintain very low residential densities in the Lassen Foothills. The easement program may increase options for fire management by preserving large landscapes. This case illustrates the limited effectiveness of land acquisition in preventing development in a low-threat landscape, and demonstrates the utility of growth models for prioritizing conservation investments.

Modelling the spatial distribution of Natura 2000 habitats across Europe	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												The development of a Pan-European Ecological Network is now widely recognised as an important policy initiative in support of protected Natura 2000 sites. The site selection is based on habitats as defined in the Annex I of the Habitats Directive. Whilst there is information about the presence of these habitats in Natura 2000 sites, there is no detail of their distribution elsewhere in Europe. The present paper describes a methodology that identifies the spatial distribution of habitats across Europe so that their actual extent can be determined. Five methodological steps are involved starting with selection of appropriate spatial data sets, defining knowledge rules from the descriptions of Annex I habitats, continuing with additional ecological expert knowledge when needed, implementation of the models, and finally the validation. Spatial distribution models were derived for 27 habitats representing the most significant ecosystems. This spatial modelling approach is illustrated with one detailed example. Validation showed that mapping accuracy depends on the habitat description available but also upon its spatial character. Thus widespread habitats such as forests were accurately assessed whereas dispersed classes such as freshwater systems were more difficult to assess. Possible methodological improvements are suggested, such as inclusion of vegetation releves to improve the knowledge rules. Extension of the methodology to other habitats would require a moderate effort since data collection and processing has now been completed and it is this which is the most time consuming part of the process. We conclude that our method maps widespread European habitats with unprecedented accuracy. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this habitat mapping study, multibeam echosounder (MBES) data are integrated with precisely geo-referenced video ground-truth data to quantify benthic biotic communities at Cape Nelson, Victoria, Australia. Using an automated decision tree classification approach, 5 representative biotic groups defined from video analysis were related to hydro-acoustically derived variables in the Cape Nelson survey area. Using a combination of multibeam bathymetry, backscatter and derivative products produced highest overall accuracy (87%) and kappa statistic (0.83). This study demonstrates that decision tree classifiers are capable of integrating variable data types for mapping distributions of benthic biological assemblages, which are important in maintaining biodiversity and other system services in the marine environment.

In this paper, we evaluate land cover change processes around one of the most important tropical dry forest reserves in the Americas: the Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve, Mexico. The analysis is conducted at three scales: regional scale (coast of the State of Jalisco), proximity to the reserve (via a 30-km buffer zone analysis), and inside the Biosphere Reserve. The proximity analysis is complemented by a unique data set that represents the extent and boundaries of Ejidos (local land management units) in the region. Results indicate that areas surrounding the reserve have low deforestation, with Ejidos and buffer areas having more forest cover as they get closer to the reserve. The nature of this important phenomenon is discussed in the context of the socio-economic conditions of the local communities. Our work suggests that the creation of a network of "Ejidos' Conservation Areas", in the context of an approach that will recognize payments for environmental services provided to local communities, could contribute to the conservation and maintenance of the rich biodiversity in a region that has one of the highest levels of endemism in the world.

Tropical rainforest birds live in an extremely diverse acoustic community consisting of other birds, mammals, frogs, and many insects. Insects are notable for often producing continuous bands of sound energy at constant frequencies, which vary between species and across habitats. We examined how green hylia (Hylia prasina) song frequencies correlate to insect-generated spectral profiles of ambient noise. We also examined how the environment influenced song frequency by using remote sensing to quantify environmental variables. Using path analysis, we assessed the relative effects of elevation, tree cover, precipitation, and insect sounds on green hylia song frequency. Environmental variables were found to directly influence green hylia song frequencies. Specifically, green hylia sang at lower frequencies at higher elevations and under reduced canopy cover. The environment also influenced green hylia song indirectly through its effect on insect sounds. Green hylia sang at lower frequencies presumably to avoid masking by lower frequency insect sounds. Habitat-dependent divergence in songs within species potentially plays an important role in ecological speciation through its impact on species recognition and mate choice. Our data show that factors related to climate, vegetation, and vocal community can promote such habitat-dependent song variation.

J	Rocchini, D; He, KS; Zhang, JT				Rocchini, Duccio; He, Kate S.; Zhang, Jianting			Is spectral distance a proxy of beta diversity at different taxonomic ranks? A test using quantile regression	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Beta diversity represents a powerful indicator of ecological conditions because of its intrinsic relation with environmental gradients. In this view, remote sensing may be profitably used to derive models characterizing or estimating species turnover over an area. While several examples exist using spectral variability to estimate species diversity at several spatial scales, most of these have relied on standard correlation or regression approaches like the common Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression which are problematic with noisy data. Moreover, very few attempts were made to derive beta diversity characterization models at different taxonomic ranks. In this paper, we performed quantile regression to test if spectral distance represents a good proxy of beta diversity considering different data thresholds and taxonomic ranks. We used plant distribution data from the North and South Carolina including 146 counties and covering a variety of vegetation formations. The dissimilarity in species composition at different taxonomic ranks (using Sorensen distance) among pairs of counties was compared with their distance in NDVI values derived from 23 yearly MODIS images. Our results indicate that (i) spectral variability represents a good proxy of beta diversity when appropriate statistics are applied and (ii) a lower taxonomic rank is important when changes in species composition are examined spatially using remotely sensed data.

Such evaluations ignore forest degradation or the decline in quality of the ecological values of the forest. Landsat image processing and geographical information systems were used to study forest cover changes in and around Popa Mountain Park (central Myanmar). Deforestation inside the Park was lower than outside the Park, but forest degradation, namely the net area that changed from dense forest to open forest, within the Park had grown at rates exceeding those outside the Park. The effectiveness of the PA was overestimated by adopting deforestation as the only indicator of conservation effectiveness. Forest degradation studies can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of PAs.																	0376-8929					SEP	2009	36	3					218	224		10.1017/S0376892909990415								WOS:000275897300006

This is particularly true in the Solon-ion Islands, where coastal rainforest cover still remains, but where climate change and a growing human Population is putting increasing pressure on ecosystems. This study assessed recent primary productivity changes in the Kahua region (Makira, Solomon Islands) using remote sensing data (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI). In this area, there has been no commercial logging and there is no existing information about the state of the forests. Results indicate that primary productivity has been decreasing in recent years, and that the recent changes arc more marked near vi I]ages. Multiple factors may explain the reported pattern in primary productivity. The study highlights the need to (1) assess how accurately remote sensing data-based results match field data on the ground; (2) identify, the relative contribution of the climatic, socioeconomic and political drivers of such changes; and (3) evaluate how primary productivity changes affect biodiversity level, ecosystem functioning and human livelihoods.

They not only provide the traditional livelihood of the local communities but are also the basis of a tourism industry that generates substantial revenue for the whole of Botswana. For the global community, the wetlands retain a tremendous pool of biodiversity. As the upstream states Angola and Namibia are developing, however, changes in the use of the water of the Okavango River and in the ecological status of the wetlands are to be expected. To predict these impacts, the hydrology of the Delta has to be understood. This article reviews scientific work done for that purpose, focussing on the hydrological modelling of surface water and groundwater. Research providing input data to hydrological models is also presented. It relies heavily on all types of remote sensing. The history of hydrologic models of the Delta is retraced from the early box models to state-of-the-art distributed hydrological models. The knowledge gained from hydrological models and its relevance for the management of the Delta are discussed.

Potential Species Distribution of Balsam Fir Based on the Integration of Biophysical Variables Derived with Remote Sensing and Process-Based Methods	REMOTE SENSING												In this paper we present a framework for modelling potential species distribution (PSD) of balsam fir [bF; Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.] as a function of landscape-level descriptions of: (i) growing degree days (GDD: a temperature related index), (ii) land-surface wetness, (iii) incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and (iv) tree habitat suitability. GDD and land-surface wetness are derived primarily from remote sensing data acquired with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on the Terra satellite. PAR is calculated with an existing spatial model of solar radiation. Raster-based calculations of habitat suitability and PSD are obtained by multiplying normalized values of species environmental-response functions (one for each environmental variable) parameterized for balsam fir. As a demonstration of the procedure, we apply the calculations to a high bF-content area in northwest New Brunswick, Canada, at 250-m resolution. Location of medium-to-high habitat suitability values (i.e., >0.50) and actual forests, with >50% bF, matched on average 92% of the time.

Satellite remote sensing is the most accurate and cost-effective way to monitor changes in forest cover and degradation over large geographic areas, but the tools and methods have been highly manual and time consuming, often requiring expert knowledge. We present a new user-friendly, fully automated system called CLASlite, which provides desktop mapping of forest cover, deforestation and forest disturbance using advanced atmospheric correction and spectral signal processing approaches with Landsat, SPOT, and many other satellite sensors. CLASlite runs on a standard Windows-based computer, and can map more than 10,000 km(2), at 30 m spatial resolution, of forest area per hour of processing time. Outputs from CLASlite include maps of the percentage of live and dead vegetation cover, bare soils and other substrates, along with quantitative measures of uncertainty in each image pixel. These maps are then interpreted in terms of forest cover, deforestation and forest disturbance using automated decision trees. CLASlite output images can be directly input to other remote sensing programs, geographic information systems (GIS), Google Earth (TM), or other visualization systems. Here we provide a detailed description of the CLASlite approach with example results for deforestation and forest degradation scenarios in Brazil, Peru, and other tropical forest sites worldwide.

J	Muller, J; Brandl, R				Mueller, Joerg; Brandl, Roland			Assessing biodiversity by remote sensing in mountainous terrain: the potential of LiDAR to predict forest beetle assemblages	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												P>1. Effective biodiversity management can only be implemented if data are available on assemblage-environment relationships. The level of detail needs to be relevant to the scale of planning and decision making. A number of remote-sensing methods are available, but there are few studies that link information collected at both landscape and local scales. This is particularly true for arthropods even though these organisms are ecologically very important. 2. We assessed the predictive power of habitat variables measured by airborne laser scanning (light detection and ranging; LiDAR) to model the activity, richness and composition of assemblages of forest-dwelling beetles. We compared the results with data acquired using conventional field methods. We sampled beetles with pitfall traps and flight-interception traps at 171 sampling stations along an elevation gradient in a montane forest. 3. We found a high predictive power of LiDAR-derived variables, which captured most of the predictive power of variables measured in ground surveys. In particular, mean body size and species composition of assemblages showed considerable predictability using LiDAR-derived variables. The differences in the predictability of species richness and diversity of assemblages between trap types can be explained by sample size. We expect predictabilities with R-2 of up to 0 center dot 6 for samples with 250 individuals on average. 4. The statistical response of beetle data and the ecological interpretability of results showed that airborne laser scanning can be used for cost-effective mapping (LiDAR : field survey : beetles 15 : 100 : 260 euro ha(-1)) of biodiversity even in remote mountain areas and in structurally complex habitats, such as forests. 5. Synthesis and applications. The strong relationship between characteristics of beetle assemblages to variables derived by laser scanning provides an opportunity to link data from local ground surveys of hyperdiverse taxa to data collected remotely at the landscape scale. This will enable conservation managers to evaluate habitats, define hotspots or map activity, richness and composition of assemblages at scales relevant for planning and management. In addition to the large area that can be sampled remotely, the grain of the data allows a single tree to be identified, which opens up the possibility of planning management actions at local scales.																	0021-8901	1365-2664				AUG	2009	46	4					897	905		10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01677.x								WOS:000267706000019

Remote sensing and the future of landscape ecology	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Landscape ecology focuses on the analysis of spatial pattern and its relationship to ecological processes. As a scientific discipline, landscape ecology has grown rapidly in recent years, supported by developments in GIS and spatial analysis techniques. Although remote sensing data are widely employed in landscape ecology research, their current and potential roles have not been evaluated critically. To provide an overview of current practice, 438 research papers published in the journal Landscape Ecology for the years 2004-2008 were examined for information about use of remote sensing. Results indicated that only 36% of studies explicitly mentioned remote sensing. Of those that did so, aerial photographs and Landsat satellite sensor images were most commonly used, accounting for 46% and 42% of studies, respectively. The predominant application of remote sensing data across these studies was for thematic mapping purposes. This suggests that landscape ecologists have been relatively slow to recognize the potential value of recent developments in remote sensing technologies and methods. The review also provided evidence of a frequent lack of key detail in studies recently published in Landscape Ecology , with 75% failing to provide any assessment of uncertainty or error relating to image classification and mapping. It is suggested that the role of remote sensing in landscape ecology might be strengthened by closer collaboration between researchers in the two disciplines, by greater integration of diverse remote sensing data with ecological data, and by increased recognition of the value of remote sensing beyond land-cover mapping and pattern description. This is illustrated by case studies drawn from Latin America (focusing on forest loss and fragmentation) and the UK (focusing on habitat quality for woodland birds). Such approaches might improve the analytical and theoretical rigour of landscape ecology, and be applied usefully to issues of outstanding societal interest, such as the impacts of environmental change on biodiversity and ecosystem services.

Monitoring land use and cover around parks: A conceptual approach	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Many of the habitats and resources which influence ecological functioning within National Parks, and protected areas in general, are located outside of their borders in unprotected areas. Hence, land use and land cover changes in surrounding areas may substantially influence the natural resources within parks. The US National Park Service has recognized these threats and incorporated land use and land cover monitoring into its Inventory and Monitoring Program. The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework based on a conceptual approach for planning and implementing monitoring within this Program. We present a conceptual model, based on ecological theory, which illustrates how land use and land cover change impact park resources, and helps to identify monitoring indicators that will measure relevant attributes of land use and land cover change. We also discuss potential sources of data for quantifying indicators of land use and land cover change over time, including remote sensing data and ancillary spatial datasets. Finally, we describe steps for analyzing monitoring data so that the intensity and direction of changes in land use and land cover over time are quantified, as well as trends in the status of important park resources impacted by these changes. Integration of land use and land cover monitoring data and park resource data will allow for analysis of change from past to present, and can be used to project trends into the future to provide knowledge about potential land use and land cover change scenarios and ecological impacts. We illustrate our monitoring approach with an example from the Inventory and Monitoring Program's Greater Yellowstone Network. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Because such areas may be large, not easily accessible, subject to change, and sensitive to the surrounding landscape, remote sensing can be a valuable tool in establishing and managing protected areas. We describe three case studies to illustrate how remote sensing can contribute to setting priorities for conservation actions, monitoring the status of conservation targets, and evaluating the effectiveness of conservation strategies. In the Connecticut River watershed, remote sensing has been used to assess flood regimes and identify key areas of floodplain forests and their context for conservation planning. At Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, remote sensing has provided information to assess the effectiveness of management strategies to restore fire to the longleaf pine sandhills ecosystem, control invasive species, and prioritize annual prescribed burns. In eastern US forests, remote sensing is being used to evaluate the ecological condition and changes at properties where direct access would be difficult. As the resolution and capacities of remote-sensing technology continue to develop, however, several issues are becoming increasingly important. It is essential that the spatial and temporal resolution of remotesensing data be matched to the relevant scales of biodiversity, major threats, and management actions. Data layers must be compatible, both in scale and in measurement properties, and key patterns must be distinguished from irrelevant detail, especially at the finer scales of application in local management. Combining remote sensing with ground surveys can expand the array of information used in management and contribute to the ecological interpretation of remote-sensing data. Because conservation funds are always limited, remote sensing also must be cost effective. This requires balancing the wealth of detail afforded by ever-finer resolution of remote-sensing data with what is actually needed to implement sound conservation and management. Remote sensing is a valuable tool, but it is not a panacea for all of the challenges of conservation monitoring and management.

Emerging protocols for assessing the conservation status of communities include as central criteria the current extent, historical reduction and contemporary rate of decline in geographic distribution. Estimation of these parameters is confronted by methodological challenges, data limitations and uncertainties that may vary from case to case. We describe an approach to these issues comprising five steps: (1) classification of the community using an analysis of data from systematic ground surveys; (2) mapping to produce a contemporary baseline distribution (1980s); (3) interpolation to produce a historical distribution (pre-European settlement); (4) interpretation of satellite imagery to update the distribution (various dates up to 2004) and (5) assessment of change in extent over historical and contemporary time scales incorporating plausible bounds of uncertainty around best estimates. The bounds can be based on areas for which image interpretation produces uncertain diagnosis of clearing and differences between credible alternative base maps of the same area. We demonstrated the approach using a case study of Coolibah-Black Box Woodland, a declining semi-arid woodland community in Australia and found that 61% (plausible range 50-67%) of the woodland community had been cleared since European settlement and that during 1998-2004 the community continued to decline on average by 135.3(+/- 21.7) km(2) each year, or 1.7(+/- 0.3)% of each previous year's distribution, apparently accelerating in recent years. Strengths of the approach include the use of biological data (cf. remote sensing) to distinguish the target assemblage from others, the use of historical and contemporary base lines to examine change over different time scales, and the use of bounded estimates to incorporate uncertainty into the assessment.

A method for assessing evergreen habitats using phytodiversity and geospatial techniques in tropical rain forests of Southern Western Ghats (India)	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												We have used data generated using remote sensing and geographical information systems to categorize habitats, and then determined the relationship between the habitat categorizations and species-distribution patterns. A biologically rich hotspot-Kalakad-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve, located at Southern Western Ghats, India, was chosen for this study. In order to spatially delineate areas of high species richness/diversity and endemic habitat zones, we have identified evergreen habitats in conjunction with landscape metrics, species assemblage, micro-habitats like slope, topography, species endemism, and proportion of core and edge species. A total of 236 species and 2,920 individuals were recorded using systematic stratified plots of 0.1 ha covering 47 plots. Hierarchical cluster analysis was done using Ward's method. Plot information was used to identify clusters based on species density. The analysis showed five species assemblages that are quite distinct from each other in terms of dominant species. The distribution of endemic and edge species, land cover heterogeneity, and continuity of patches in these clusters were evaluated to understand the degree of disturbance and intactness at landscape scale. Integration of species assemblages and topography brought out four major elevation-slope complexes. Information on species composition (robust field survey) with spectral (hybrid classification) properties has shown 72% overall accuracy and distinguished four evergreen sub-groups and other land cover classes. The developed approach assumes great importance in the assessment of biodiversity and prioritizing the areas of conservation.																	0912-3814					JUL	2009	24	4					749	760		10.1007/s11284-008-0547-4								WOS:000267680600005						
J	McKinney, RA; Charpentier, MA; Wigand, C				McKinney, Richard A.; Charpentier, Michael A.; Wigand, Cathleen			Assessing the wildlife habitat value of New England salt marshes: I. Model and application	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												We developed an assessment model to quantify the wildlife habitat value of New England salt marshes based on marsh characteristics and the presence of habitat types that influence habitat use by terrestrial wildlife. Applying the model to 12 salt marshes located in Narragansett Bay, RI resulted in assessment scores that ranged over a factor of 1.5 from lowest to highest. Pre-classifying the results based on marsh size and morphology helped to compare assessment scores between marshes, and demonstrated that even the lower ranking marshes had substantial habitat value. Stepwise multiple regression analysis of assessment scores and model components demonstrated that salt marsh morphology, the degree of anthropogenic modification, and salt marsh vegetative heterogeneity were significant variables and accounted for 91.3% of the variability in component scores. Our results suggest that targeting these components for restoration may lead to improved assessment scores for our study marshes. We also examined the use of lower resolution remote sensing data in the assessment in order to minimize the time and effort required to complete the model. Scores obtained using smaller-scale, lower resolution data were significantly lower than those obtained using larger-scale, higher resolution data (df = 11; t = 2.2; p < 0.001). The difference was significantly positively correlated with the portion of the assessment score that could be attributed to trees, pools, and pannes and marsh size (r (2) =0.50, F = 4.6, p = 0.04), and could indicate a bias against smaller, more heterogeneous marshes. We conclude that potential differences need to be weighed against the time benefit of using this type of data, bearing in mind the marsh size and the goals of the assessment. Overall, our assessment can provide information to aid in prioritizing marshes for protection and restoration, identify marshes that may harbor significant biodiversity, or help monitor changes in habitat value over time.																	0167-6369					JUL	2009	154	1-4					29	40		10.1007/s10661-008-0375-6								WOS:000267824400004	18592388

Use of Hyperspectral Remote Sensing to Evaluate Efficacy of Aquatic Plant Management	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Invasive aquatic weeds negatively affect biodiversity, fluvial dynamics, water quality, and water storage and conveyance for a variety of human resource demands. In California's Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, one submersed species Brazilian egeria-and one floating species-waterhyacinth-are actively managed to maintain navigable waterways. We monitored the spatial and temporal dynamics of these species and their communities in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta using airborne hyperspectral data and assessed the effect of herbicide treatments used to manage these species from 2003 to 2007. Each year, submersed aquatic plant species occupied about 12% of the surface area of the Delta in early summer and floating invasive plant species occupied 2 to 3%. Since 2003, the coverage of submersed aquatic plants expanded about 500 ha, whereas the coverage of waterhyacinth was reduced. Although local treatments have reduced the coverage of submersed aquatic plants, Delta-wide cover has not been significantly reduced. Locally, multiyear treatments could decrease submersed aquatic plants spread, given that no residual plants outside the treated area were present. In contrast, the spread of waterhyacinth either has been constant or has decreased over time. These results show that (1) the objectives of the Egeria densa Control Program (EDCP) have been hindered until 2007 by restrictions imposed on the timing of herbicide applications; (2) submersed aquatic plants appeared to function as ecosystem engineers by enabling spread to adjacent areas typically subject to scouring action; (3) repeated herbicide treatment of waterhyacinth has resulted in control of the spread of this species, which also appears to have facilitated the spread of waterprimrose and floating pennywort. These results suggest that management of the Delta aquatic macrophytes may benefit by an ecosystem-level implementation of an Integrated Delta Vegetation Management and Monitoring Program, rather than targeting only two problematic species.

However, quantification of restoration effects is often hindered by logistical issues, which include (1) the difficulty of systematically monitoring responses over large areas and (2) lack or loss of comparison sites necessary for assessing treatment effect. We explored the use of remote sensing to quantify the effects of native grass seeding and prescribed burns on ecosystem forage provisioning services within a California (U.S.A.) rangeland landscape. We used Landsat time series to monitor forage (green biomass) dynamics within 296 ha of treatment areas-distributed throughout a 36-km(2) watershed-for 6 years and to identify post hoc comparison areas when a priori comparisons were lacking. Remote sensing analysis documented gains and losses in forage provisioning services due to restoration efforts and provided critical information for adaptive management. Our results demonstrate the degree to which invaded grasslands can be resistant to change and suggest that increasing the functional complexity of restoration mixes might help increase forage availability and reduce opportunities for weed reinvasion.

Operational active fire mapping and burnt area identification applicable to Mexican Nature Protection Areas using MODIS and NOAA-AVHRR direct readout data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Since 1999, the National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of the Biodiversity (CONABIO) in Mexico has been developing and managing the "Operational program for the detection of hot-spots using remote sensing techniques". This program uses images from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites and from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA-AVHRR), which are operationally received through the Direct Readout station (DR) at CONABIO. This allows the near-real time monitoring of fire events in Mexico and Central America. In addition to the detection of active fires, the location of hot spots are classified with respect to vegetation types, accessibility, and risk to Nature Protection Areas (NPA). Besides further analysis is necessary due to the considerable effects of forest fires on the fast detection of fires, biodiversity and human life. This fire impact assessment is crucial to support the needs of resource managers and policy makers for adequate fire recovery and restoration actions. CONABIO attempts to meet these requirements, providing post-fire assessment products as part of the management system in particular for satellite-based burnt area mapping. This paper provides an overview of the main components of the operational system and will present an outlook to future activities and system improvements, especially the development of a burnt area product. A special focus will also be placed on the fire occurrence within NPAs of Mexico. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Remm, K; Remm, L				Remm, Kalle; Remm, Liina			Similarity-based large-scale distribution mapping of orchids	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												The expected presence/absence of a target species outside the area of actual observations is commonly estimated using statistical models or decision criteria. This investigation demonstrates a similarity-based solution for predictive mapping as an alternative to generalizing models. The maps of the expected distribution of 12 orchids were created using find sites from field observations and absence sites generated onto the observation track. The expected presence/absence of a species in a location was calculated according to the similarity between the location and selected examples of presence and absence sites. A machine learning system selected the best predictive sets for each species out of 161 cartographic and remote sensing features. The usefulness of the predictive distribution maps was expressed as the ratio of the density of find sites per track in the predicted presence area relative to the density per track in the predicted absence area. The predictive mapping was more efficient for Dactylorhiza incarnata, D. russowii, Gymnadenia conopsea, and Goodyera repens. Soil properties and the proportion of find sites for the other species in the vicinity were the most indicative site characteristics. The rarer species were found to be better indicators of the occurrence of the other species than were the more common orchids. The proposed approach-to direct subsequent field observations to sites where the occurrence of the target species was predicted but has not yet been recorded-helped discover new populations of orchids and enhance the representativeness of absence sites.																	0960-3115					JUN	2009	18	6					1629	1647		10.1007/s10531-008-9547-5								WOS:000266137900012

In this study, we investigate whether light detection and ranging (lidar) can be used to estimate the distribution of standing dead tree classes within forests. Twenty-two field plots were established in which each stem (DBH >10 cm) was assigned to a wildlife tree (WT) class. For each plot, a suite of lidar-derived predictor variables were extracted. Ordinal regression using a negative log-log link function was then employed to predict the cumulative proportions of stems within the WT classes. Results indicated that the coefficient of variation of the lidar height data was the best predictor variable (chi(2) = 106.11, p < 0.00; Wald = 4.83, p = 0.028). The derived relationships allowed for the prediction of the cumulative proportion of stems within WT classes (r = 0.90, RMSE = 6.0%) and the proportion of dead stems within forest plots (r = 0.61, RMSE = 16.8%). Our research demonstrates the capacity of lidar remote sensing to estimate the relative abundances of standing living and dead trees in forest stands and its ability to characterize vegetation structure across large spatial extents.

Conservation Threats Due to Human-Caused Increases in Fire Frequency in Mediterranean-Climate Ecosystems	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Periodic wildfire is an important natural process in Mediterranean-climate ecosystems, but increasing fire recurrence threatens the fragile ecology of these regions. Because most fires are human-caused, we investigated how human population patterns affect fire frequency. Prior research in California suggests the relationship between population density and fire frequency is not linear. There are few human ignitions in areas with low population density, so fire frequency is low. As population density increases, human ignitions and fire frequency also increase, but beyond a density threshold, the relationship becomes negative as fuels become sparser and fire suppression resources are concentrated. We tested whether this hypothesis also applies to the other Mediterranean-climate ecosystems of the world. We used global satellite databases of population, fire activity, and land cover to evaluate the spatial relationship between humans and fire in the world's five Mediterranean-climate ecosystems. Both the mean and median population densities were consistently and substantially higher in areas with than without fire, but fire again peaked at intermediate population densities, which suggests that the spatial relationship is complex and nonlinear. Some land-cover types burned more frequently than expected, but no systematic differences were observed across the five regions. The consistent association between higher population densities and fire suggests that regardless of differences between land-cover types, natural fire regimes, or overall population, the presence of people in Mediterranean-climate regions strongly affects the frequency of fires; thus, population growth in areas now sparsely settled presents a conservation concern. Considering the sensitivity of plant species to repeated burning and the global conservation significance of Mediterranean-climate ecosystems, conservation planning needs to consider the human influence on fire frequency. Fine-scale spatial analysis of relationships between people and fire may help identify areas where increases in fire frequency will threaten ecologically valuable areas.

Airborne spectranomics: mapping canopy chemical and taxonomic diversity in tropical forests	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT												Tree canopies play an enormous role in the maintenance of tropical forest diversity and ecosystem function, and are therefore central to conservation, management, and resource policy development in tropical regions. However, high-resolution mapping of tropical forest canopies is very difficult, because traditional field, airborne, and satellite measurements cannot resolve the number of canopy species, or particular species of interest, over the large regional scales commensurate with conservation goals and strategies. Newer technologies, such as imaging spectroscopy and light detection and ranging (lidar), are just now reaching performance levels that will allow monitoring of tropical forest diversity from the air, but the methods for applying these technologies are not yet ready. Here, we present concepts that combine chemical and spectral remote sensing perspectives to facilitate canopy diversity mapping. Using examples from our ongoing work in the Hawaiian Islands, we demonstrate how a new "airborne spectranomics" approach could revolutionize tropical forest monitoring in the future.

Limnological variability and pelagic fish abundance (Stolothrissa tanganicae and Lates stappersii) in Lake Tanganyika	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The abundance of two main pelagic fish species in Lake Tanganyika (Stolothrissa tanganicae and Lates stappersii) has always been observed to fluctuate considerably at different time scales. The inverse correlation between the abundance of these species has often been interpreted as the consequence of predator-prey relations (avoidance behaviour by the prey). However, currently the two species often appear spatially segregated in the lake, S. tanganicae dominating in the north while L. stappersii is generally abundant in the south where it feeds mostly on shrimps. A fluctuating abundance of the species is nevertheless observed. As these fish species have a major importance for the fisheries, we investigated the limnological variability in relation to the short-term variability of fish catches. The abundance of S. tanganicae was positively correlated to plankton biomass (r = 0.65), while water transparency (r = 0.56), depth of mixed layer (r = -0.70) and oxygenated water appeared important drivers for the abundance of L. stappersii. Alternating "mixing" and "stable" states of the epilimnion related to seasonal and internal waves variability are probably determinant for the short-term variability in abundance of S. tanganicae and L. stappersii. In the framework of this study, remote sensing has shown a potentially interesting application for fisheries research at Lake Tanganyika. We observed a close correspondence between phytoplankton blooms at the time of trade winds changes and increased catches of S. tanganicae in the south. The anti-correlated abundance of S. tanganicae and L. stappersii probably mainly reflects the underlying fluctuating limnological environment. Fisheries studies need to integrate limnological and planktonic monitoring to better understand large and complex ecosystems such as Lake Tanganyika.

Differences in environmental properties of different habitats should lead to differences of spectral responses, which can be detected by satellite imagery. Hence, spectral distance may be related to species diversity. Based on previous studies, Krishnaswamy et al. [Krishnaswamy, J., Bawa, K, S., Ganeshaiah, K. N.. & Kiran, M. C. (2009). Quantifying and mapping biodiversity and ecosystem services: Utility of a multi-season NDVI based Mahalanobis distance Surrogate. Remote Sensing of Environment.] used spectral distance to estimate species diversity. Since a noisy scatterplot of species versus spectral diversity is expected, the commonly used Ordinary Least Square regression may fail to detect trends which occur across other quantiles than the mean.

Quantification of shelterbelt characteristics using high-resolution imagery	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												The Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Prairie Shelterbelt Program has distributed shelterbelt trees across the Prairie Provinces since 1903 to reduce wind erosion and other environmental benefits such as sequestering carbon and providing habitat for biodiversity. To assess the existence and conditions of shelterbelts on the landscape, visiting individual shelterbelts across each province is costly and time-consuming. High-resolution imagery offers a potentially quick and inexpensive method of identifying shelterbelts and deriving information about them. As resolution of imagery increases, more information can be extracted as ground features are becoming increasingly recognizable. Although shelterbelts could be analyzed across large sections of land, finer resolution comes at a greater price in required time and computing power. Shelterbelts were examined using spectral reflectance from multi-spectral bands and using shape, texture and other relational properties as determined with object-oriented image analysis. Principal components analysis and multiple discriminate analysis were used to identify shelterbelt characters by species. In a selected region, 93 of 97 field shelterbelts (95.8%) were correctly identified from 1:40,000 orthophotos. Spectral reflectance, variance and shape parameters were combined to differentiate among six shelterbelt species compositions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Khan, S; Hafeez, M; Abbas, A; Ahmad, A				Khan, Shahbaz; Hafeez, Mohsin; Abbas, Akhtar; Ahmad, Aftab			Spatial Assessment of Water Use in an Environmentally Sensitive Wetland	AMBIO												Wetlands are among the most valuable ecosystems in the world and are crucial in supporting biodiversity. They also provide space for storing surface waters, where intense biological processing occurs that helps improve water quality. Human activities, particularly irrigated agriculture and urban developments instigating water diversions from rivers, have altered the hydrology of most wetlands. The Lower Murrumbidgee wetland, located in the Murrumbidgee River Catchment, is an example and is one of the significant wetlands across the Murray Darling Basin of Australia. Historic estimates show the volumes of water ranged from none in dry years to about 300 to 400 GIL (1 GL = 10(9) L) in an average and wet year, respectively. The flows reaching the Lower Murrumbidgee wetland have been drastically reduced by at least 60% because of the upstream diversions introduced during the last century. These reductions have adversely affected the health of natural vegetation and agricultural crops in the Lower Murrumbidgee floodplain. This article presents the results of the quantification of total water consumption of various land uses in the Lower Murrumbidgee floodplain using the remote sensing-based Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) modeling approach. The spatial analysis of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) shows that ETa rates are the highest (13-26%) for the red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) forests both in summer and winter days. However, in terms of total ETa volume, lignum (Muehlenbeckia florulenta) constitutes the most significant part, which is around 14-30% of the total ET, volume for the area. Actual evapotranspiration from winter cereal cropping areas following the summer ponding is the third highest consumer of water after the river red gum and lignum. Actual evapotranspiration from the fallow land is also significant, representing 5-28% of total ETa from the region. In view of the extent of the unaccounted flows in the overall water balance of the system, there is a need to upgrade measuring and reporting infrastructure by strengthening the institutional and management arrangements to better gauge the efficiency of environmental and consumptive water use. The state-of-the-art technology of remote sensing-based SEBAL modeling proved to have potential for measuring actual water use with reliable accuracy and can be used for assessing the environmental and productive use of water from wetlands in other regions of Australia.																	0044-7447	1654-7209				MAY	2009	38	3					157	165		10.1579/0044-7447-38.3.157								WOS:000266276300006	19580033

Here we show that change in its extent and condition has occurred to a greater extent than previously recorded. We assessed deforestation and forest degradation in Papua New Guinea by comparing a land-cover map from 1972 with a land-cover map created from nationwide high-resolution satellite imagery recorded since 2002. In 2002 there were 28,251,967 ha of tropical rain forest. Between 1972 and 2002, a net 15 percent of Papua New Guinea's tropical forests were cleared and 8.8 percent were degraded through logging. The drivers of forest change have been concentrated within the accessible forest estate where a net 36 percent were degraded or deforested through both forestry and nonforestry processes. Since 1972, 13 percent of upper montane forests have also been lost. We estimate that over the period 1990-2002, overall rates of change generally increased and varied between 0.8 and 1.8 percent/yr, while rates in commercially accessible forest have been far higher-having varied between 1.1 and 3.4 percent/yr. These rates are far higher than those reported by the FAO over the same period. We conclude that rapid and substantial forest change has occurred in Papua New Guinea, with the major drivers being logging in the lowland forests and subsistence agriculture throughout the country with comparatively minor contributions from forest fires, plantation establishment, and mining.																	0006-3606					MAY	2009	41	3					379	390		10.1111/j.1744-7429.2009.00495.x								WOS:000265407000015						
J	Ivits, E; Cherlet, M; Mehl, W; Sommer, S				Ivits, Eva; Cherlet, Michael; Mehl, Wolfgang; Sommer, Stefan			Estimating the ecological status and change of riparian zones in Andalusia assessed by multi-temporal AVHHR datasets	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Following the European Commission's Water Framework Directive all surface waters in EU's Member States must reach a good status by 2015. The evaluation of this status will be partly based on ecological criteria, such as the hydro-morphological quality criteria which also evaluate the structure and condition of the riparian zone. Riparian zones with undisturbed or nearly undisturbed condition are given high-ecological status. The agri-environmental measures in the EU promote an extensive use of land to protect the farmed environment and its biodiversity. Recent studies in Andalusia and elsewhere suggest that extensification leads to riparian zones with higher ecological status compared to intensively used areas. We suggest that extensification and thus better ecological status of the riparian zone can be partly approximated by the amount of vegetation permanently present on the area. For this the so-called permanent vegetation fraction was derived from a multi-temporal advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) dataset and was used (1) to classify the ecological status of the riparian zone into two classes, favourable and unfavourable, and (2) to assess the effect of agricultural practices on these areas. The classification was validated by field observations in the Guadalquivir river basin while detailed information on farming practices helped to assess the effect of agriculture on the riparian zone. The assessment was carried out in olive land cover because erosion control in olive cultivations is the most widely implemented measure in Andalusia. Results suggest that the remotely sensed permanent vegetation fraction is a good indicator of the favourable and unfavourable ecological status of the riparian zone. Furthermore, extensification of agricultural practices expressed in terms of increasing permanent vegetation cover was shown to have positive effect on the riparian zone as opposed to areas where no measures were implemented.

The successional stages were mapped using the combination of Geographic Information System (GIS), Global Positioning System (GPS), aerial photos and high resolution satellite images (IKONOS). Forest structure and its relationship with structural plant diversity along with its changes over time were characterized using FRAGSTATS. In terms of spatial configuration of seral stages, the total number of fragments increased from 572 to 735, and mean size of patch (MPS) decreased from 154.97 ha to 120.60 ha over 33 years. The situation resulted in forestation serving appropriate conditions for plant diversity in the area. As an overall change in study area, there was a net increase of 1823.3 ha forest during the period with an average annual forestation rate of 55.25 ha year(-1)(0.4% per year). In conclusion, the study revealed that stand type maps of forest management plans in Turkey provide a great chance to monitor the changes in structural plant diversity over time. The study further contributes to the development of a framework for effective integration of biodiversity conservation into Multiple Use Forest Management (MUFM) plans using the successional stages as a critical mechanism.

Being a suitable medium for the nourishment, reproduction, and accommodation of many species of living creatures, wetlands are museums of natural riches, not only of the country where they are located but also of the whole world. Kavak Delta, one of the most important wetlands of Turkey, with coastal dunes and halophilic vegetation as well as being on the north-south bird migration route, provides not only opportunities for coastal tourism but also offers substantial potential for ecotourism. During observations, bird species, especially of the orders Anseriformes, Falconiformes, and Charadriiformes, were identified. Some 14 orders, 39 families, and 124 bird species were spotted in the delta. Also, dune and halophilic plants constitute a rich flora in the delta. In this study, the potential for ecotourism and opportunities for coastal tourism in the area are outlined. Within this context, besides ecotourism activities, such as bird observation, botanic tourism, and angling, the use of beaches for coastal tourism is determined. Various recommendations are made for the optimal use of all tourism opportunities detected in the delta and for enabling sustainable coastal use and management.																	0749-0208					MAY	2009	25	3					781	787		10.2112/08-1068.1								WOS:000266182300021

Remotely sensed satellite images and ancillary ground true data were used to produce land cover maps, trough classification techniques, and water compounds maps, applying radiative transfer models. The study proposed within the framework of the cooperation between Italian Foreign Affair Ministry (through the University of Rome) and Kenyan Authorities has been carried out on the Kenyan part of the Lake Victoria. This lake is one of the largest freshwater bodies of the world where, over the last few years environmental challenges and human impact have perturbed the ecological balance affecting the biodiversity. The objective of this research study is to define the thematic products, retrievable from satellite images, like weed abundance maps and water compound concentrations. These products, if provided with an appropriate time frequency, are useful to identify the preconditions for the occurrence of hazard events like abnormal macrophyte proliferation and to develop an up-to-date decision support system devoted to an apprised territory, environment and resource management.

Using Earth Observation to update a Natura 2000 habitat map for a wetland in Greece	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The European Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC has defined the need for the conservation of habitats and species with the adoption of appropriate measures. Within the Natura 2000 ecological network of special areas of conservation, natural habitats will be monitored to ensure the maintenance or restoration of their composition, structure and extent. The European Space Agency's GlobWetland project has provided remotely sensed products for several Ramsar wetlands worldwide, Such as detailed land cover-land use, water cycle and inundated vegetation maps. This paper presents the development and testing of an operational methodology for updating a wetland's habitat snap using the GlobWetland products. and the evaluation of the extent to which GlobWetland products have contributed to the habitat snap updating. The developed methodology incorporated both automated and analyst-supervised techniques to photo-interpret, delineate, refine, and evaluate the updated habitat polygons. The developed methodology was proven Successful in its application to the wetland complex of the Axios-Loudias-Aliakmon delta (Greece). The resulting habitat trap met the European and Greek national requirements. Results revealed that GlobWetland products were a valuable contribution, but source data (enhanced satellite images) were necessary to discriminate spectrally similar habitats. Finally, the developed methodology can be modified for original habitat mapping. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hartter, J; Southworth, J				Hartter, Joel; Southworth, Jane			Dwindling resources and fragmentation of landscapes around parks: wetlands and forest patches around Kibale National Park, Uganda	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Landscapes surrounding parks in most of the developing world, while still containing considerable biodiversity, also have rapidly growing human populations and associated agricultural development. Since the establishment of Kibale National Park first as a Crown Forest Reserve in 1932 and later as a park in 1993 in western Uganda, most access and resource extraction has been prohibited. The park has become nearly a complete island of forested land cover surrounded by intensive small-scale agriculture and some large-scale tea plantations, along with a network of wetland and forest patches. As the population grows outside the park and land becomes more scarce, remaining forests and wetlands are being used more intensively for material resources (e.g., fuelwood, building poles) and converted to other land uses (e.g., pasture, agriculture). This study uses both discrete and continuous data analyses of satellite imagery to examine these diminishing resource bases at the landscape level placing the results within the social context of conservation and parks. Findings reveal that the park boundaries have remained fairly intact whereas, the landscape surrounding the park has become increasingly fragmented. From a landscape perspective, while the park has indeed maintained its forest cover, it has become increasingly islandized with wetland and forest patches in the surrounding landscape becoming smaller in number and size. Those that have survived are now more isolated and even lower productivity than in 1984, which may be a precursor to their eventual loss in this landscape.

Quantifying and mapping biodiversity and ecosystem services: Utility of a multi-season NDVI based Mahalanobis distance surrogate	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												There is an urgent need for techniques to rapidly and periodically measure biodiversity and ecosystem services over large landscapes. Conventional vegetation classification and mapping approaches are based on discrete arbitrary classes which do not capture gradual changes in forest type (and corresponding biodiversity and ecosystem services values) from site to site. We developed a simple multi-date NDVI based Mahalanobis distance measure (called eco-climatic distance) that quantifies forest type variability across a moisture gradient for complex tropical forested landscapes on a single ecologically interpretable, continuous scale. This Mahalanobis distance, unlike other distance measures takes into account the variability in the reference class and shared information amongst bands as it is based on the covariance matrix, and therefore is most useful to summarize ecological distance of a pixel to a reference class in multi-band remotely sensed space In this study we successfully apply this measure as a surrogate for tree biodiversity and ecosystem services at two nested scales for the Western Chats Bio-diversity hotspot. Data from over 500 tree-plots and forest type maps was used to test the ability of this remotely sensed distance to be a surrogate for abundance based tree-species compositional turn-over and as a continuous measure of forest type and ecosystem services. Our results suggest a strong but scale dependant relationship between the remotely-sensed distance measure and floristic distance between plots. The multi-date NDVI distance measure emerges as very good quantitative surrogate for forest type and is a useful complement to existing forest classification systems. This surrogate quantifies forest type variability on a single, continuous quantitative scale and has important applications in conservation planning and mapping and monitoring of hydrologic and carbon storage and sequestration services.

Multi-scale sampling and statistical linear estimators to assess land use status and change	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: Multi-temporal analysis of remotely sensed imagery has proven to be a powerful tool for assessment and monitoring of landscape diversity. Here the feasibility of assessing land-use diversity and land-use change was tested at multiple scales and over time by means of statistical linear estimators based on a probabilistic sampling design. Location: The study area ( the district of Asciano, Tuscany, Italy) is characterized by erosional forms typical of Pliocene claystone (i.e. calanchi and biancane) that have been subject to the phenomenon of biancane reworking over the past 50 years, mainly owing to the expansion of intensive agriculture. Methods: Cells at two different scales (50 m x 50 m and 10 m x 10 m) were classified by two operators according to a multilevel legend, using 1954 and 2000 aerial photographs. Inter-operator agreement and accuracy were tested by Cohen's K coefficient. Total land cover estimation for each class was carried out using a multistage estimator, while the variance was estimated by means of the Wolter estimator. Field-based information on plant species composition was recorded in order to test for a relationship between land use and plant community composition by ANOVA and indicator species analysis. Results: Agreement between photointerpreters and accuracy were significantly higher than those expected by chance, proving that the approach proposed is reproducible, as long as proper quality assurance methods are used. Our data show that, at the two scales considered (50 m x 50 m and 10 m x 10 m), crops have increased against woodlands and semi-natural areas, the latter showing the highest and significantly different mean species richness. Meanwhile, an increase in the coverage of trees and shrubs was found within the semi-natural areas, probably as a result of secondary succession occurring on typical landscape elements such as biancane. Conclusions: Inferential statistics made it possible to acquire quantitative information on the abundance of land cover classes, allowing formal multi-temporal and multi-scale analysis. Sampling design-based statistical linear estimators were found to be a powerful tool for assessing landscape trends considering both time expenditure and other costs. They make it possible to maintain the same scale of analysis over time series data and to detect both coarse- and fine-grained changes in spatial patterns.

However, most deforestation research focuses on tropical rain forests. We analyzed spatial and temporal changes in land cover from 1972 through 2005 at Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary (CWS), a tropical dry forest in Myanmar (Burma). CWS is one of the largest protected patches of tropical dry forest in Southeast Asia and supports over half the remaining wild population of the endangered Eld's deer. Between 1973 and 2005, 62% of forest was lost at an annual rate of 1.86% in the area, while forest loss inside CWS was only 16% (0.45% annually). Based on trends found during our study period, dry forests outside CWS would not persist beyond 2019, while forests inside CWS would persist for at least another 100 years. Analysis of temporal deforestation patterns indicates the highest rate of loss occurred between 1992 and 2001. Conversion to agriculture, shifting agriculture, and flooding from a hydro-electric development were the main deforestation drivers. Fragmentation was also severe, halving the area of suitable Eld's deer habitat between 1973 and 2001, and increasing its isolation. CWS protection efforts were effective in reducing deforestation rates, although deforestation effects extended up to 2 km into the sanctuary. Establishing new protected areas for dry forests and finding ways to mitigate human impacts on existing forests are both needed to protect remaining dry forests and the species they support.

Mapping Grazing-Induced Degradation in a Semi-Arid Environment: A Rapid and Cost Effective Approach for Assessment and Monitoring	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Improved techniques for measuring and monitoring the state of biodiversity are required for reporting on national obligations to international and regional conservation institutions. Measuring the extent of grazing-related degradation in semi-arid ecosystems has proved difficult. Here we present an accurate and cost-effective method for doing this, and apply it in a South African semi-arid region that forms part of a globally significant biodiversity hotspot. We grouped structurally and functionally similar vegetation units, which were expert-mapped at the 1:50,000 scale, into four habitat types, and developed habitat-specific degradation models. We quantified degradation into three categories, using differences between dry and wet season values of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the three succulent karoo habitats, and the difference between maximum and mean NDVI values for the subtropical thicket habitat. Field evaluation revealed an accuracy of 86%. Overall, degradation was high: 24% of the study area was modeled as severely degraded, and only 9% as intact. Levels of degradation were highest for bottomland habitats that were most exposed to grazing impacts. In sharp contrast to our methods, a widely used, broad-scale and snapshot assessment of land cover in South Africa was only 33% accurate, and it considerably underestimated the extent of severely degraded habitat in the study area. While our approach requires a multidisciplinary team, and in particular expert knowledge on the characteristics and spatial delimitation of vegetation types, it is repeatable, rapid, and relatively inexpensive. Consequently, it holds great promise for monitoring and evaluation programs in semi-arid ecosystems, in Africa, and beyond.

J	Fischer, DT; Still, CJ; Williams, AP				Fischer, Douglas T.; Still, Christopher J.; Williams, A. Park			Significance of summer fog and overcast for drought stress and ecological functioning of coastal California endemic plant species	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Fog drip is a crucial water source for plants in many ecosystems, including a number of global biodiversity hotspots. In California, dozens of rare, drought-sensitive plant species are endemic to coastal areas where the dominant summer moisture source is fog. Low clouds that provide water to these semi-arid ecosystems through fog drip can also sharply reduce evaporative water losses by providing shade. We quantified the relative hydrological importance of cloud shading vs. fog drip. We then examined how both factors influence the range dynamics of an apparently fog-dependent plant species spanning a small-scale cloud gradient. The study area is on Santa Cruz Island off the coast of southern California. It is near the southern range limit of bishop pine (Pinus muricata D. Don), a tree endemic to the coasts of California and Baja, Mexico. We measured climate across a pine stand along a 7 km, coastal-inland elevation transect. Short-term (1-5 years) monitoring and remote sensing data revealed strong climatic gradients driven primarily by cloud cover. Long-term (102 years) effects of these gradients were estimated using a water balance model. We found that shade from persistent low clouds near the coast reduced annual drought stress by 22-40% compared with clearer conditions further inland. Fog drip at higher elevations provided sufficient extra water to reduce annual drought stress by 20-36%. Sites located at both high elevation and nearer the coast were subject to both effects. Together, these effects reduced average annual drought stress by 56% and dramatically reduced the frequency of severe drought over the last century. At lower elevation (without appreciable fog drip) and also near the inland edge of the stand (with less cloud shading) severe droughts episodically kill most pine recruits, thereby limiting the local range of this species. Persistent cloud shading can influence hydrology as much as fog drip in cloud-affected ecosystems. Understanding the patterns of both cloud shading and fog drip and their respective impacts on ecosystem water budgets is necessary to fully understand past species range shifts and to anticipate future climate change-induced range shifts in fog-dependent ecosystems.

J	Zald, HSJ				Zald, Harold S. J.			Extent and spatial patterns of grass bald land cover change (1948-2000), Oregon Coast Range, USA	PLANT ECOLOGY												Globally, temperate grasslands and meadows have sharply declined in spatial extent. Loss and fragmentation of grasslands and meadows may impact biodiversity, carbon storage, energy balance, and climate change. In the Pacific Northwest region of North America, grasslands and meadows have declined in extent over the past century. Largely undocumented in this regional decline are the grass balds of the Oregon Coast Range, isolated grasslands in a landscape dominated by coniferous forests. This study was conducted to quantify the spatial extent and patterns of grass bald change. Five balds in the Oregon Coast Range were evaluated using historical aerial photographs and recent digital orthophoto quadrangles (DOQ). Over the time period of study (1948/1953 to 1994/2000), bald area declined by 66%, primarily from forest encroachment. The number and average size of bald vegetation patches declined, while edge density increased. Tree encroachment into balds was inversely related to distance from nearest potential parent trees. Spatial patterns of bald loss may result from a forest to bald gradient of unfavorable environmental conditions for tree establishment and/or seed dispersal limitation. Species dependent on balds may be at risk from loss of bald area and increased fragmentation, although metrics of habitat fragmentation may not reflect species-specific habitat requirements. Tree encroachment patterns and increased bald edge densities suggest increasing rates of bald loss in the future. The remote sensing nature of this study cannot determine the fundamental causes of bald decline, although prior research suggests climate change, cessation of native burning, successional changes in response to prior wildfires, and cessation of livestock grazing all may have potential influence.																	1385-0237					APR	2009	201	2					517	529		10.1007/s11258-008-9511-1								WOS:000263888200013

Large-scale impacts of herbivores on the structural diversity of African savannas	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												African savannas are undergoing management intensification, and decision makers are increasingly challenged to balance the needs of large herbivore populations with the maintenance of vegetation and ecosystem diversity. Ensuring the sustainability of Africa's natural protected areas requires information on the efficacy of management decisions at large spatial scales, but often neither experimental treatments nor large-scale responses are available for analysis. Using a new airborne remote sensing system, we mapped the three-dimensional (3-D) structure of vegetation at a spatial resolution of 56 cm throughout 1640 ha of savanna after 6-, 22-, 35-, and 41-year exclusions of herbivores, as well as in unprotected areas, across Kruger National Park in South Africa. Areas in which herbivores were excluded over the short term (6 years) contained 38%-80% less bare ground compared with those that were exposed to mammalian herbivory. In the longer-term (> 22 years), the 3-D structure of woody vegetation differed significantly between protected and accessible landscapes, with up to 11-fold greater woody canopy cover in the areas without herbivores. Our maps revealed 2 scales of ecosystem response to herbivore consumption, one broadly mediated by geologic substrate and the other mediated by hillslope-scale variation in soil nutrient availability and moisture conditions. Our results are the first to quantitatively illustrate the extent to which herbivores can affect the 3D structural diversity of vegetation across large savanna landscapes.

Specifically, we first developed a suite of environmental descriptors (productivity, land cover, and elevation). These descriptors were based on readily available data, including the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites and terrain data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). We then assessed the capacity of the environmental descriptors, using a decision tree approach, to estimate species richness of all breeding birds, and of groups of bird species based on habitat and nesting groupings, using data summarized from the Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas. Results indicated that the variance in the distributions of total bird species richness, as well as richness of habitat and nesting groups, were well predicted by the environmental descriptors (with variance explained ranging between 47 and 75%) with the predictions clearly related to both habitat (as modeled by land cover and land cover diversity) and vegetation productivity. Modeling demonstrates that initial partitioning is most often based on land cover class, indicating that it may be the driving variable of bird species richness; however, information on vegetation productivity and energy were then critical in defining how many species occur in each habitat type. The results indicate that remotely sensed environmental descriptors can provide an effective tool for predicting breeding bird species richness at regional scales. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Most of these fires are anthropogenic. The fires in this environment are thought to impact the environment negatively and therefore practices that are associated with extensive use of fire have been strongly criticized. Despite this, there has been little work done to understand how these fires impact the wetlands environment and its dynamics, especially the vegetation resources that are used by the local communities in the wetlands. The objective of the study was to identify fire spatial and temporal trends in relation to settlement distribution, through the use of remote sensing, socio-economic and phytosociological surveys. The fire history results show that geographically there has not been any significant change in vegetation structure and that in fact fires may have promoted biodiversity. The results of analysis show an overall variance on vegetation structure of 23% whereas the rest are unaccounted for. There is a strong association between settlements, ethnicities, literacy and fire occurrences. The most fire-prone areas are inhabited by communities that have used fire in the past for various resource use practices.																	0141-6707					MAR	2009	47						71	77		10.1111/j.1365-2028.2008.01052.x								WOS:000263035500011

Ecology, Economics, and Equity of the Pastoral Systems in the Khangchendzonga National Park, Sikkim Himalaya, India	AMBIO												The Khangchendzonga National Park is a part of the eastern Himalaya global biodiversity hotspot and is located in the Sikkim state of India. Increasing livestock populations coupled with the government policy to ban grazing and its selective implementation resulted in conflict. Hence we undertook this multidisciplinary study involving consultations with traditional resource users, field surveys, and remote sensing. We found that in the greater Himalayan part, over the past 6 decades sheep have been increasingly replaced by yaks (and their crossbreeds), who descend only up to the multilayered temperate and subalpine forests during winter. These forests have been extensively manipulated by the yak herders to increase the fodder availability. In terms of economics and equity in benefit sharing, we found that a few yak herders earn high incomes by maintaining large herds while the sheep and pack animal herders earn subsistence level incomes from small herds. We propose a reduction in yak (and their female crossbreed) numbers with adequate alternative livelihood support for the herders.																	0044-7447					MAR	2009	38	2					95	100		10.1579/0044-7447-38.2.95								WOS:000264443200006	19431939

Despite their biodiversity value, many IBAs are threatened by habitat degradation and a high proportion lack legal protection. We integrate an inventory of these IBAs with remote sensing data to identify patterns that could be used to assess priorities for monitoring and conservation. Land cover composition in IBAs differed significantly from that in buffer zones of the same area immediately Surrounding them and was significantly more homogeneous. Agriculture and deforestation were the most prevalent threats to IBAs, particularly in IBAs containing a high proportion of dense forest or shrub. Human population density within IBAs was no lower than that immediately outside IBAs, and was around three times higher than the average for sub-Saharan Africa. However, projected human population growth was lower than the average for sub-Saharan Africa, with the projected increase greatest in IBAs with a high proportional cover of dense forest and mosaic woodland and lowest in IBAs with a higher grassland component. Fifty seven percent of IBAs fell within or overlapped Protected Areas, though this percentage differed between different categories of IBA. IBAs that were included within Protected Areas supported a greater number of globally threatened bird species and contained proportionally more dense forest, woodland and shrub than IBAs falling outside Protected Areas. IBAs outside Protected Areas contained a high proportion of mosaic woodland and open water, suggesting that Such habitats are under-protected in Africa. We suggest that because the most prevalent threats to IBAs involve changes in land cover that could be detected from satellites, remote sensing could play an important role in the monitoring of African IBAs. This would permit monitoring of a wider range of sites than is possible solely by conventional, ground-based approaches.																	0959-2709	1474-0001				MAR	2009	19	1					49	61		10.1017/S0959270908007697								WOS:000264692000005

However, this wetland area has decreased in size during the past several decades. Water quality and biodiversity has declined due to expanded agricultural activities since 1960s. Using remote sensing (RS), geographic information system (GIS) and global positioning system (GPS) techniques, we investigated the dynamics, spatial patterns and fragmentation of the wetlands in the middle and lower reaches of the Tarim River from 1980 to 2000. We found that the total area of the wetlands was reduced by 45.8% and the density of the patches increased four times from 1980 to 1990. From 1990 to 2000, though the total area of the wetlands slightly increased the number of the patches increased three times and the density of the patches doubled. Based on the analyses of transition matrixes, diversity and fragmentation indexes, and spatial distribution alternation of the wetlands, we found the landscape diversity and fragmentation indices increased while wetland dominance index decreased dramatically. Among the wetland types, the areas of the river-channel, reservoir and pond wetlands increased while the areas of the lake and marsh wetlands decreased continuously.				chen, yaning/D-4047-2013													0943-0105					MAR	2009	57	2					455	464		10.1007/s00254-008-1316-y								WOS:000263361600022

Burnt Area Mapping of Bandipur National Park, India using IRS 1C/1D LISS III Data	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												The Bandipur National Park situated in the Western Ghats of Karnataka State, is one of the biodiversity hotspots of the world. During recent years, this park has witnessed repeated fires, affecting considerable areas under vegetation. The temporal satellite data from 1997 to 2006 have been analyzed to map the burnt areas using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. The vegetation cover is moist deciduous, dry deciduous, scrub forests and teak plantation. Information on extent of the burnt areas and the type of vegetation affected were derived forest range-wise. The fire prone regions have been identified by integrating vegetation type/density, road and settlement network and past history of forest fire occurrence, by assigning subjective weightage according to their fire-inducing capability or their sensitivity to fire. Comparison between each temporal dataset in terms of the extent of burnt area was also carried out to interpret fire incidence pattern. Three categories of fire risk regions such as Low, Moderate and High fire intensity zones were identified and it was found that almost 40% of the study area falls under low risk zone. An evaluation of the existing fire management systems and the implication of fire prevention programmes has been discussed, besides an assessment of causal factors for fire incidence in the park.

Landscape parameters like fragmentation, porosity, patchiness and jaxtaposition have been analysed for disturbance gradient characterization. Disturbance on biodiversity due to human activities has been studied both qualitatively and quantitatively. The species richness is highest in northern mixed dry deciduous forest followed by dry deciduous open scrub and southern tropical dry deciduous teak forest. Species richness of the open thorny dry deciduous forest with grasses is found to be the lowest. Disturbance analysis indicates that 22.02% of the southern slightly moist teak forests are highly disturbed whereas Anogeissus forest and Riverine forest have 17.04% and 12.41% of the area under high disturbance, respectively. A total of 88 field sample plots were laid to enumerate trees, shrubs, herbs, climbers, etc. Biological richness parameters such as Shannon-Wiener biodiversity index, biodiversity value, ecosystem uniqueness were derived from field data. High biological richness is found in northern mixed dry deciduous forest and mixed dry deciduous forest with bamboo. More than 99% of such areas are falling under medium to high biological richness. Nearly 55% of the gentle and flat to gentle, slope categories were found to have low biological richness. Phytosociological analysis of sampled field data indicated that the number of trees per unit area is the lowest in the Savannah. In inaccessible areas, the species richness and number of trees per unit area is very high. Main forces causing disturbance are search for diamonds, dams on river Ken, settlements in and around the park, grazing and resource utilization by villagers for fodder, animal grazing, fuel-wood, timber, etc.																	0255-660X					MAR	2009	37	1					51	67		10.1007/s12524-009-0011-0								WOS:000275958500005

Yet the rates and spatial patterns of post-socialist land use change remain largely unclear. We used Landsat TM/ETM+ images to classify land cover maps and assess landscape pattern changes from 1990 to 2005 in Arge angstrom County, Southern Romania. Cropland abandonment was the most widespread change (21.1% abandonment rate), likely due to declining returns from farming, tenure insecurity, and demographic developments during transition. Forest cover and forest fragmentation remained remarkably stable during transition, despite widespread ownership transfers. Cropland abandonment provides opportunities for increased carbon sequestration, but threatens cultural landscapes and biodiversity. Continued monitoring is important for assessing whether abandoned croplands will eventually reforest or be put back into production and to better understand the consequences of post-socialist land use change for ecosystems and biodiversity.

Assessment of ecosystem services and the factors that threaten them is an important first step to support watershed management. This, however, requires detailed information that is often missing in mountainous regions. To overcome this, in this paper, we adopt a decision tree approach to assess protection, biodiversity, and production services in two mountainous watersheds (Fengqing and Xiaojie) of the Lancang River Basin. Decision tree rules were built on the basis of field surveys, available references, ecosystem maps derived from remote sensing, expert knowledge, basic topographic information, and community interviews. Decision tree results showed that forest cover and agro-forestry practices contribute greatly to improved ecosystem functioning in the Fengqing Catchment compared to the Xiaojie Catchment. The results were consistent with field observations. The decision tree method proved to be a suitable and flexible tool for the rapid assessment of watershed ecosystem services, for highlighting those areas that need more in-depth research, and for guiding watershed and ecosystem management.

Changes in the extent of surface mining and reclamation in the Central Appalachians detected using a 1976-2006 Landsat time series	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Surface mining and reclamation is the dominant driver of land cover land use change (LCLUC) in the Central Appalachian Mountain region of the Eastern U.S. Accurate quantification of the extent of mining activities is important for assessing how this LCLUC affects ecosystem services such as aesthetics, biodiversity, and mitigation of flooding. We used Landsat imagery from 1976, 1987, 1999 and 2006 to map the extent of surface mines and mine reclamation for eight large watersheds in the Central Appalachian region of West Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania. We employed standard image processing techniques in conjunction with a temporal decision tree and GIS maps of mine permits and wetlands to map active and reclaimed mines and track changes through time. For the entire study area, active surface mine extent was highest in 1976, prior to implementation of the Surface Mine Control and Reclamation Act in 1977, with 1.76% of the study area in active mines, declining to 0.44% in 2006. The most extensively mined watershed, Georges Creek in Maryland, was 5.45% active mines in 1976, declining to 1.83% in 2006. For the entire study area, the area of reclaimed mines increased from 1.35% to 4.99% from 1976 to 2006, and from 4.71% to 15.42% in Georges Creek. Land cover conversion to mines and then reclaimed mines after 1976 was almost exclusively from forest. Accuracy levels for mined and reclaimed cover was above 85% for all time periods, and was generally above 80% for mapping active and reclaimed mines separately, especially for the later time periods in which good accuracy assessment data were available. Among other implications, the mapped patterns of LCLUC are likely to significantly affect watershed hydrology, as mined and reclaimed areas have lower infiltration capacity and thus more rapid runoff than unmined forest watersheds, leading to greater potential for extreme flooding during heavy rainfall events.

However, the trends of the two methods differ in direction and quantity. For this study, a historical and a recent remote sensing-derived map were homogenized to reduce misleading changes and to assess spatial aggregation errors. This was carried out by means of a data integration procedure based on landscape metrics, allowing cartographic and census trends to be compared. Discrepancies between data were thus highlighted, both in absolute surface value and in evolution. The methodology presented, and the results obtained, Could be employed to evaluate and improve LUCC analyses aimed at assessing landscape identity, both in the case of analyses based only on LU census data, or of those based only on LC cartographic data.

Landscape effects of transgenic cotton on non-target ants and beetles	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												Transgenic crops producing toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) can be planted in the same field for many years, and many insects exploiting such crops must disperse to other habitats to persist. Accordingly, effects of transgenic crop farming could accumulate through time and affect insect populations across agricultural landscapes. We monitored the population density of seven ant genera and beetle families and of rare ants and beetles in 84 non-cultivated sites abutting agricultural fields in Central Arizona. We assessed the short-term (during planting year) and long-term (over 5-6 years) landscape effect of farming Cry1Ac cotton oil ant and beetle density in non-cultivated sites, in addition to several local and regional variables. Landscape variables (e.g., sequence of crops planted in neighbouring fields, crop diversity, and abundance) were more frequently associated with insect density than local variables (e.g., plant productivity and diversity in non-cultivated sites). In the short-term, use of Bt relative to non-Bt cotton in neighbouring fields was positively associated with density of one ant and two beetle groups in non-cultivated sites. However, acreage of Bt cotton located within I kill from non-cultivated sites had more negative effects than acreage of non-Bt cotton on density of one ant and one beetle group. In the long-term, the proportion of years that Bt cotton was planted in neighbouring fields was positively associated with ant density but not beetle density. Results Suggest that the farming of Bt cotton in neighbouring fields frequently resulted in positive short- and long-term landscape effects oil ants and beetles in non-cultivated sites, while Bt cotton planted farther away had less frequent negative short-term impacts.

Because larval dispersion takes place on different spatial scales, global operational satellite data can be successfully used to investigate the connectivity of marine populations on different spatial and temporal scales. In fact, satellite data have long been used for the study of the large and mesoscale biological processes associated with ocean dynamics. This paper presents simulations of spiny lobster larvae transport in the Tropical Atlantic using the geostrophic currents, generated by altimetry that feeds an advection/diffusion model. Simulations were conducted over the Tropical Atlantic ( 20 degrees N to 15 degrees S), considering four larvae release areas: the Cape Verde Archipelago, the Ivory Coast, Ascension Island and Fernando de Noronha Archipelago. We used mean geostrophic current ( MGC) calculated from 2001 to 2005 to represent the mean circulation of the Tropical Atlantic. We also ran the model for the El Nino geostrophic current regime (ENGC) using part of the MGC data, representing the El Nino 2002/2003 event. Results suggest that the intensification of the mesoscale ocean processes associated with El Nino events promotes the connectivity between populations, increasing the chances of a genetic flux among different stocks. We concluded that the altimetry geostrophic current data together with a relatively simple advection/diffusion model can provide useful information about the physical dynamics necessary to conduct studies on larval dispersion.

J	Coops, NC; Wulder, MA; Iwanicka, D				Coops, Nicholas C.; Wulder, Michael A.; Iwanicka, Donald			An environmental domain classification of Canada using earth observation data for biodiversity assessment	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Broad ecosystem based classifications are increasingly applied as a context to consider, understand, and manage biodiversity. The need for more spatially explicit, repeatable, transferable, transparent, and defensible environmental regionalization has become apparent. increased computing power, sophisticated analysis software, and the availability of spatially explicit descriptions of the environment, principally derived from Earth observation data, have facilitated the development of statistical ecosystem regionalizations. These regionalizations are desired to produce environmentally unique ecoregions to provide the basis for stratification for ongoing biodiversity monitoring efforts. Using a suite of indicators of the physical environment, available energy such as vegetation production, and habitat suitability all derived from remote sensing technology at 1 km spatial resolution, we undertook an environmental regionalization using a two-stage multivariate classification of terrestrial Canada. A relatively large number of classes were initially derived (100) and a hierarchical clustering approach was then applied to derive a 40 level classification. These clusters where then used to assess which clusters were the most dissimilar to the majority thus providing indication of the most unique environmental domains across Canada. Secondly, a 14 class stratification was then produced to emulate the current ecozone stratification commonly used in Canada. Results indicated that a number of unique clusters exits across Canada, specifically the forest/urban-industrial/cropland mosaic in the southern portion of Ontario, the mixed wood forests in south-central Ontario and western Quebec, the foothills of south western Alberta, regions of the southern Arctic and the northern Boreal shield (particularly the areas south of Hudson Bay and Labrador). A resemblance between the 14 class stratification and the ecozone classification for Canada is evident; locations of within and between ecozone heterogeneity are also indicated. A critical key benefit of utilising ecoregions quantitatively using key indicators, such as those derived from remote sensing observations, is the capacity to establish, and quantify, how well particular networks of sites, or plot locations, represent the overall environment. As such, the incorporation of these types of methods, and remotely derived indicators, into biodiversity assessment is an important area of ongoing research. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J	Vadjunec, JM; Rocheleau, D				Vadjunec, Jacqueline M.; Rocheleau, Dianne			Beyond Forest Cover: Land Use and Biodiversity in Rubber Trail Forests of the Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY												Among the strategies to promote sustainable tropical forest development around the world, the Federal Extractive Reserve System of Brazil is widely cited as an exemplary model. It is designed to protect rubber tapper communities, their forests, and their livelihoods while preventing deforestation and conserving biodiversity. In response to changing markets and policies, rubber tappers in the Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve have recently diversified production to include market agriculture and cattle production, precipitating deforestation in the reserve, with the implication of increased ecological degradation compared to the extraction of nontimber forest products (NTFPs). Our remote sensing and forest inventory analyses yield different insights about the environmental consequences of distinct land-use mixes in two extractive communities, one of which emphasizes cattle and the other, NTFPs. Remote sensing results show a predictably greater impact on forest cover in the cattle-oriented community. This preliminary study is based on nested household-and community-level forest inventory and biodiversity analyses in two communities. Surprisingly, we found higher tree biodiversity in the rubber trail forests of the cattle-oriented community, and significantly lower tree species richness, tree density, total basal area, and number of trees of commercial size in the same land-use unit in the NTFP-focused community. Land-use surveys indicate lower levels of game consumption and hunting in the cattle-oriented community, and strong support for the development of sustainable timber extraction in both communities. The distinct type and degree of forest impact in the two communities exposes the problem of single-impact assessment as the sole means of performance and categorical land-use prohibitions as an effective mode of regulation in conservation areas.																	1708-3087						2009	14	2							29									WOS:000278707200007

For these purposes, the analysis of functional attributes of ecosystems (i.e., different aspects of the exchange of matter and energy) has advantages over the traditional use of structural attributes, like a quicker response to disturbances and the fact that they are easily monitored through remote sensing. In this study, we described the spatiotemporal patterns of different aspects of the ecosystem functioning of the Spanish national parks and their response to environmental changes between 1982 and 2006. To do so, we used the NOAA/AVHRR-GIMMS dataset of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a linear estimator of the fraction of photosynthetic active radiation intercepted by vegetation, which is the main control of carbon gains. Nearly all parks have significantly changed during the last 25 years: The radiation interception has increased, the contrast between the growing and nongrowing seasons has diminished, and the dates of maximum and minimum interception have advanced. Some parks concentrated more changes than others and the degree of change varied depending on their different environmental conditions, management, and conservation histories. Our approach identified reference conditions and temporal changes for different aspects of ecosystem functioning, which can be used for management purposes of protected areas in response to global changes.

J	Dengiz, O; Baskan, O				Dengiz, Orhan; Baskan, Oguz			Land quality assessment and sustainable land use in Salt Lake (Tuz Golu) specially protected area	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Land quality assessment is of great important for decisions on sustainable land uses and the conservation of ecosystems of high biodiversity value. The main objective of this study was to determine properties of land quality of specially protected area of the Salt Lake using CORINE land quality assessment methodology and to propose a revision for this model. In addition to field study and laboratory analysis, digital soil map, digital elevation model, satellite image and climatic data were used and analyzed with remote sensing and geographic information systems techniques to generate actual land quality map and to form database for study area. Results show that 42.1% of the study area has high quality, 28.7% was classified as moderate quality and 4.0% was determined as low quality. On the other hand, some places classified as moderate quality, were not accurately classified. These places should be low land quality due to content of high salt concentration. Therefore, to resolve this insufficient situation, some soil parameters such as chemical properties should be collaborated with this model. In this case, moderate land quality level of the study area decreased from 28.7 to 12.3%, whereas 4.0% of low quality land of the study area increased to 20.8%. In addition, this research was also carried out to provide guidance for planner or decision makers about specially protected area of the Salt Lake.																	0167-6369					JAN	2009	148	1-4					233	243		10.1007/s10661-008-0154-4								WOS:000261581800021	18214696					
J	Gibbes, C; Southworth, J; Keys, E				Gibbes, Cerian; Southworth, Jane; Keys, Eric			Wetland conservation: Change and fragmentation in Trinidad's protected areas	GEOFORUM												Conservation efforts often neglect the importance of monitoring of protected areas, which is key to adaptively managing dynamic landscapes. In many developing countries, like Trinidad, protected areas are set aside as a result of an agreement with an international conservation organization, often resulting in inadequate planning and monitoring of the protected area. Monitoring of protected areas allows for an examination of the conservation scheme implemented and enables improved conservation decisions to be made. The research presented provides an example of the use of technology in monitoring conservation strategies in two protected wetlands, Caroni and Nariva, in Trinidad. Remote sensing and fragmentation analyses are used to quantify land cover change within these two protected wetlands. Results show that the classification of Caroni immediately identifies a shift towards anthropogenic land cover types, suggesting an increase in human activity within the park, This finding is further supported by the continuous measures used, such as decreases in mean NDVI and greenness values suggesting a decrease in the amount or health of the vegetation. While the classification of Nariva suggests a return to natural land covers, the continuous measures of land cover change indicate the opposite. Land cover change analyses are limited in Trinidad and in the Caribbean in general, partly due to satellite data availability, thus this research presents remote sensing and landscape fragmentation analyses as new tools for monitoring land cover change and conservation effectiveness in Trinidad.

J	Stromquist, L; Backeus, I				Stromquist, Lennart; Backeus, Ingvar			INTEGRATED LANDSCAPE ANALYSES OF CHANGE OF MIOMBO WOODLAND IN TANZANIA AND ITS IMPLICATION FOR ENVIRONMENT AND HUMAN LIVELIHOOD	GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Landscapes bear witness to past and present natural and societal processes influencing the environment and human livelihoods. By analysing landscape change at different spatial scales over time the effects on the environment and human livelihoods of various external and internal driving forces of change can be studied. This paper presents such an analysis of miombo woodland surrounding the Mkata plains in central Tanzania. The rich natural landscape diversity of the study area in combination with its historical and political development makes it an ideal observation ground for this kind of study. The paper focuses on long-term physical and biological changes, mainly based on satellite information but also on field studies and a review of documents and literature. The miombo woodlands are highly dynamic semi-arid ecosystems found on a number of nutrient-poor soil groups. Most of the woodlands are related to an old, low-relief geomorphology of erosion surfaces with relatively deep and leached soils, or to a lesser extent also on escarpments and steep Inselberg slopes with poor soils. Each period in the past has cast its footprints on the landscape development and its potential for a sustainable future use. On a regional level there has been a continual decrease in forest area overtime. Expansion of agriculture around planned villages, implemented during the 1970s, in some cases equals the loss of forest area (Mikumi-Ulaya), whilst in other areas (Kitulangalo), the pre-independence loss of woodland was small; the agricultural area was almost the same during the period 1975-1999, despite the fact that forests have been lost at an almost constant rate over the same period. Illegal logging and charcoal production are likely causes because of the proximity to the main highway running through the area. Contrasting to the general regional pattern are the conditions in a traditional village (Ihombwe), with low immigration of people and a maintained knowledge of the resource potential of the forest with regards to edible plants and animals. In this area the local community has control of the forest resources in a Forest Reserve, within which the woody vegetation has increased in spite of an expansion of agriculture on other types of village land. The mapping procedure has shown that factors such as access to transport and lack of local control have caused greater deforestation of certain areas than during the colonial period. Planned villages have furthermore continued to expand over forest areas well after their implementation, rapidly increasing the landscape fragmentation. One possible way to maintain landscape and biodiversity values is by the sustainable use of traditional resources, based on local knowledge of their management as illustrated by the little change observed in the traditionally used area.																	0435-3676						2009	91A	1					31	45		10.1111/j.1468-0459.2009.00351.x								WOS:000266549100003

GIS- and RS-based spatial decision support: structure of a spatial environmental information system (SEIS)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH												The development of spatial decision support for environmental resource management, e. g. forest and agroecosystem management, biodiversity conservation, or hydrological planning, started in the 1980s and was the focus of many research groups in the 1990s. The combined availability of spatial data and communication, computing, positioning, geographic information system (GIS)- and remote sensing (RS)-technologies has been responsible for the implementation of complex SDSS since the late 1990s. The regional GIS-based modelling of environmental resources, and therefore ecosystems in general, requires setting-up an extensive geo and model database. Spatial data on topography, soil, climate, land use, hydrology, flora, fauna and anthropogenic activities have to be available. Therefore, GIS- and RS-technologies are of central importance for spatial data handling and analysis. In this context, the structure of spatial environmental information systems (SEIS) is introduced. In SEIS, the input data for environmental resource management are organised in at least seven sub-information systems: base geodata information system (BGDIS), climate information system (CIS), soil information system (SIS), land use information system (LUIS), hydrological information system (HIS), spatial/temporal biodiversity information system (STBIS), forest/agricultural management information system (FAMIS). The major tasks of a SEIS are to (i) provide environmental resource information on a regional level, (ii) analyse the impact of anthropogenic activities and (iii) simulate scenarios of different impacts.

Discrimination of dominant forest types for Matschie's tree kangaroo conservation in Papua New Guinea using high-resolution remote sensing data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Matschie's tree kangaroos (Dendrolagus matschiei) are arboreal marsupials endemic to the Huon Peninsula in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Primarily because of an increase in hunting pressure and loss of habitat from agricultural expansion, D. matschiei is currently listed as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. This paper reports the results of our study to compare the capabilities of Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT)-4 multispectral image data at discriminating dominant forest types at a remote research location in PNG. Nearest-neighbour vegetation plots were established from July to August 2004 to obtain detailed information about the vegetative communities and guide class assignments. Forests were separated into four distinct habitat types with Dacrydium nidulum dominant forests being the most widespread and the most accurately classified. The comparative results indicated that Landsat-7 and Spot-4 had similar classification accuracies but the results were low because of the complex structure and heterogeneity of the forest communities and the limited spatial/spectral resolutions of the satellite data sources. This research provides an improved result compared to past research and provides detailed information towards the future conservation of Matschie's tree kangaroo habitat in PNG.																	0143-1161						2009	30	2					405	422	PII 906000055	10.1080/01431160802311125								WOS:000261189500009

In this study, our analysis maps and characterizes the wall-to-wall forest change patterns in Mississippi over the time period 1987-2005, by interpreting 132 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) or Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) scenes using a vegetation change tracker (VCT) model. Our analysis revealed that a gradual decelerating forest fragmentation during the time period 1987-1993 gave way to an accelerating fragmentation during the period 1994-2005. This unique trend in forest fragmentation was a consequence of forest logging, regeneration practices and natural disturbance regimes. In addition, for the most part of the 1990s and between 2000 and 2005, Mississippi lost about 2% of its forest on an annual basis, but many of the losses were offset by forest regeneration from previous disturbances. Forest spatial change information derived from this analysis has provided valuable insights regarding regional forest management practices and socioeconomic impacts, which will be beneficial for land managers to develop ecologically sustainable forest management strategies and biodiversity conservation practices.

Rugosity-based regional modeling of hard-bottom habitat	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Systematic conservation planning is most often directed at the representation and protection of marine biodiversity. However, direct observation and sampling of marine biodiversity is extremely time consuming and expensive. Due to these constraints, marine conservation planners have sought proxies for marine biodiversity to use in their models, Hard-bottom habitats support high levels of biodiversity and are frequently used as a surrogate for it in marine spatial planning. Rugosity (i.e. the roughness of the seafloor) is an indicator of hard-bottom habitat. In the present study, we expand on previous analyses of the relationship between rugosity and hard-bottom and create the first data-driven regional rugosity model to predict hard-bottom habitat. We used logistic regression to create an empirical model and compare it to other pre-formulated definitions of rugosity with receiver operator characteristic curves. Our model performed better than all other models and was able to correctly predict the presence or absence of hard-bottom habitat with similar to 70 % accuracy. This model offers a fast and inexpensive alternative to more traditional survey methods, and should be of value to regional conservation planners and fisheries managers as an initial predictor of hard-bottom habitat. By testing this model with low-resolution (90 m) bathymetry data, we demonstrate that this type of information may be used in marine conservation plans in regions such as developing countries, where high-resolution data is not currently available. Further, our model offers a proxy for marine habitat diversity in non-coastal areas, an under-represented sector in marine conservation planning.

This quest implies that fish-habitat relationships are characterized across different spatial scales. Remote sensing allows now for a routine description of habitats from global-regional to detailed reef scales, thus theoretically offering access to hierarchical spatial analysis at multiple scales. To judge the progress in using remotely sensed habitat variables for reef fish study, existing peer-reviewed papers on the subject are reviewed. We tabulated the significant fish-habitat relationships given the different study sites, fish and habitat variables, statistical analysis, sampling efforts and scales. Studies generally do not corroborate each other. Instead, the exercise provides a diversity of thematic results from which lessons remain equivocal. It is thus justified to recommend more systematic and hierarchical remote-sensing based research in the future. We advocate the use of remote-sensing early in the design of the fish study, as part of a coherent conceptual scheme spanning all spatial scales. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

RANGELAND JOURNAL					15th Conference of the Australian-Rangeland-Society	SEP 28-OCT 02, 2008	Queensland, AUSTRALIA	Australian Rangeland Soc				A bare ground index derived by remote sensing would provide a rapid methodology for assessing the biodiversity condition of an ecosystem, providing that ground cover is a satisfactory correlate with key biodiversity attributes. The relationship between plant species richness and the abundance of individual species was examined in relation to ground cover within silver-leaved ironbark (Eucalyptus melanophloia F. Muell.) woodlands in the Desert Uplands bioregion of north-eastern Australia. There was significant correlation between the bare ground index and ground cover and biomass measurements. Twenty-four species, including the perennial grasses Sehima nervosum (Rottler) Stapf, Themeda triandra Forssk. and Bothriocloa ewartiana (Domin) C. E. Hubb., were significantly and negatively correlated with bare ground. Scleroleana birchii (F. Muell.) Domin and Sida fibulifera Lindl. displayed significant positive relationships with increasing bare ground, and where abundant indicate heavy grazing in this land type. The study suggests that satellite-derived data does provide a meaningful methodology for assessing vegetation condition although it is strongly associated with seasonal conditions, but is only useful in relation to the regional average for a land type. The findings suggest that plant diversity is maintained at a relatively high level throughout most of these woodlands in the Desert Uplands.																	1036-9872						2009	31	1					103	109		10.1071/RJ08041								WOS:000264639900008

Populations are controlled to reduce damage to agriculture and the environment, and are also a recreational hunting resource. Knowledge of the area over which feral pigs may expand in the future could be used regionally to assist biosecurity planning, control efforts and the protection of biodiversity assets. The present study sought to estimate the future distribution of a recently introduced, expanding feral pig population in the remote Kimberley region of north-western Australia. An existing survey of feral pig distributions was enhanced and remote-sensing and weather data, reflecting or correlated with factors that may affect feral pig distributions, were collated and analysed. Relationships between feral pig distributions and these data were identified by using a generalised additive modelling approach. By the use of the model, the distribution of favourable habitat was estimated across the study region (89 125 km(2)). The potential future distribution of feral pigs in the Kimberley was then estimated, assuming only natural dispersal of feral pigs from areas of known feral pig status (cf. hunter-assisted movements or escape of domestic pigs). The modelling suggests that feral pigs could expand their distribution by realistic natural dispersal in the future (to 61 950 km(2)). This expansion possibility contains several strategically important areas (such as sea ports and biologically significant wetlands). This approach has the potential to improve biosecurity planning for the containment of the feral pig in the Kimberley and may have utility for other recently introduced invasive species in other regions. These results may also be used to improve pest-management programmes and contingency planning for exotic-disease incursions.

Here we describe current practices in habitat monitoring based on 150 schemes in Europe. Most schemes were initiated after 1990 in response to EU nature directives or habitat management/restoration actions, with funding mostly from European or national sources. Schemes usually monitor both the spatial distribution and the quality of the habitats, and they frequently collect data on environmental parameters and potential causes of changes. Many schemes are local or regional rather than national or international in scope, and sampling effort varies greatly across spatial and temporal scales. Experimental design is used in half of the schemes, however, data are rarely analysed by advanced statistics. Most schemes require two months or less per year in manpower and are typically run by professionals rather than by volunteers. Estimated salaries plus equipment costs average 650,000 Euro per year per scheme, and add up to 80 million Euros annually. Costs are particularly high for schemes based on European or international law and for schemes funded by European or national sources. Costs are also high in schemes in which sampling sites are selected subjectively rather than based on sampling theory, and in schemes that do not use field mapping or remote sensing to document spatial variation in habitats. Our survey demonstrates promising developments in European habitat monitoring but also underlines the need for better spatial coverage, documentation of spatial variaton, improved sampling design and advanced data analysis. Such improvements are essential if we are to judge progress towards the 2010 biodiversity targets.

Parallel to this growth, it is increasingly important to address biodiversity changes on large spatial (e.g. continental) and temporal (e.g. decade-long) scales, which requires the integration of currently ongoing monitoring efforts. Here we review habitat monitoring and develop a framework for integrating data or activities across habitat monitoring schemes. We first identify three basic properties of monitoring activities: spatial aspect (explicitly spatial vs. non-spatial), documentation of spatial variation (field mapping vs. remote sensing) and coverage of habitats (all habitats or specific habitats in an area), and six classes of monitoring schemes based on these properties. Then we explore tasks essential for integrating schemes both within and across the major classes. Finally, we evaluate the need and potential for integration of currently existing schemes by drawing on data collected on European habitat monitoring in the EuMon project. Our results suggest a dire need for integration if we are to measure biodiversity changes across large spatial and temporal scales regarding the 2010 target and beyond. We also make recommendations for an integrated pan-European habitat monitoring scheme. Such a scheme should be based on remote sensing to record changes in land cover and habitat types over large scales, with complementary field mapping using unified methodology to provide ground truthing and to monitor small-scale changes, at least in habitat types of conservation importance.

J	Nagendra, H; Rocchini, D				Nagendra, Harini; Rocchini, Duccio			High resolution satellite imagery for tropical biodiversity studies: the devil is in the detail	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												While high resolution satellite remote sensing has been hailed as a very useful source of data for biodiversity assessment and monitoring, applications have been more developed in temperate areas. The biodiverse tropics offer a challenge of an altogether different magnitude for hyperspatial and hyperspectral remote sensing. This paper examines issues related to hyperspatial and hyperspectral remotely sensed imagery, which constitutes one of the most potentially powerful yet underutilized sources of for tropical research on biodiversity. Hyperspatial data with their increased pixel resolution are possibly best suited at facilitating the accurate location of features such as tree canopies, but less suited to the identification of aspects such as species identity, particularly when spatial resolution becomes too fine and pixels are smaller than the size of the object (e.g., tree canopy) being identified. Hyperspectral data on the other hand, with their high spectral resolution, can be used to record information pertaining to a range of critical plant properties related to species identity, and can be very effective used for discriminating tree species in tropical forests, despite the greater complexity of such environments. There remains a glaring gap in the easy availability of hyperspectral and hyperspatial satellite data in the tropics due to reasons of cost, data coverage, and security restrictions. Stimulating discussion on the applications of this powerful, but underutilized tool by ecologists, is the first step in promoting a more extensive use of such data for ecological studies in tropical biodiversity rich areas.

Impact of sudden oak death on tree mortality in the Big Sur ecoregion of California	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												The Big Sur ecoregion in coastal California is a botanically and ecologically diverse area that has recently experienced substantial mortality of oak (Quercus spp.) and tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus) trees due to the emerging forest disease sudden oak death, caused by the invasive pathogen Phytophthora ramorum. In response to the urgent need to examine environmental impacts and create management response strategies, we quantified the impact of P. ramorum invasion on tree mortality across the Big Sur ecoregion using high-resolution aircraft imagery and field data. Using the imagery, we mapped all detectable oak and tanoak trees possibly killed by P. ramorum infection within redwood-tanoak forests and mixed oak woodlands. To validate and improve our remote assessment, we quantified the number, size, and infection status of host trees in 77 field plots (0.25 ha). The field data showed that our remote assessment underestimated mortality due to the occurrence of dead trees in the forest understory. For each forest type, we developed regression models that adjusted our remote assessments of tree mortality in relation to field observations of mortality and local habitat variables. The models significantly improved remote assessment of oak mortality, but relationships were stronger for mixed oak woodlands (r(2) = 0.77) than redwood-tanoak forests (r(2) = 0.66). Using the field data, we also modeled the amount of dead tree basal area (m(2)) in relation to the density of mapped dead trees in mixed oak woodlands (r2 = 0.73) and redwood-tanoak forests (r(2) = 0.54). Application of the regression models in a GIS estimated 235,678 standing dead trees in 2005 and 12,650 m(2) of tree basal area removed from the ecoregion, with 63% of mortality occurring in redwood-tanoak forests and 37% in mixed oak woodlands. Integration of the remote assessment with population estimates of host abundance, obtained from an independent network of 175 field plots (0.05 ha each), indicated similar prevalence of mortality in redwood-tanoak forests (20.0%) and mixed oak woodlands (20.5%) at this time. This is the first study to quantify a realistic number of dead trees impacted by P. ramorum over a defined ecological region. Ecosystem impacts of such widespread mortality will likely be significant.																	1387-3547					DEC	2008	10	8					1243	1255		10.1007/s10530-007-9199-5								WOS:000260306700005

Approaches to utilising QuickBird data for the monitoring of NATURA 2000 habitats	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY					International Conference on Monitoring the Effectiveness of Nature Conservation	SEP 03-06, 2007	Birmensdorf, SWITZERLAND	Swiss Fed Inst Forest, Snow & Landscape Res				The implementation of standardised methods for the monitoring of NATURA 2000 sites in Europe is still a key topic in environmental research. Effective, economically priced and, as far as possible, automated applications are required. Rapidly developing sensor technology together with advanced image processing methods offer new possibilities for application of remote sensing data to NATURA 2000 monitoring. The studies presented here combine commonly available GIS data, such as Biotope Type Maps or Forestry Site Maps with remote sensing classifications of the very high spatial resolution (VHSR) QuickBird sensor. Two knowledge-based approaches under inclusion of a priori object-based information are utilised to detect the extent of habitats as well as their quality according to the German NATURA 2000 mapping guidelines. While one method used a segmentation of forested sites in Bavaria (southern Germany), the second technique applied available objects to classify heathland habitats in the Brandenburg Region (northern Germany). The results were subsequently compared, in close cooperation with local environmental authorities, with habitats mapped terrestrially for NATURA 2000 management plans. These results indicate that different remote sensing methods can be a valuable support for terrestrial mapping. Woodland habitats can be detected and specific NATURA 2000 quality parameters (e. g., percentage of natural forest types) are recognisable. In the case of heath-dominated sites, terrestrial mapping can even be replaced by remote sensing of certain habitat types for which it is also possible to obtain adequate measures of quality. Having evaluated the quality of forest and heathland NATURA 2000 habitats, two general challenges when implementing the guideline regionally could be indicated. Firstly, the very general scope of the Habitats Directive contradicts to specific local protection purposes. Secondly, the protection aims given for NATURA 2000 areas are very static. The Directive could be improved by adapting existing management and conservation strategies to pro-actively respond on likely anthropogenic influences.

This paper introduces a new approach for mapping large intact forest landscapes (IFL), defined as an unbroken expanse of natural ecosystems within areas of current forest extent, without signs of significant human activity, and having an area of at least 500 km(2). We have created a global IFL map using existing fine-scale maps and a global coverage of high spatial resolution satellite imagery. We estimate the global area of IFL within the current extent of forest ecosystems ( forest zone) to be 13.1 million km(2) or 23.5% of the forest zone. The vast majority of IFL are found in two biomes: Dense Tropical and Subtropical Forests (45.3%) and Boreal Forests (43.8%). The lowest proportion of IFL is found in Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests. The IFL exist in 66 of the 149 countries that together make up the forest zone. Three of them-Canada, Russia, and Brazil-contain 63.8% of the total IFL area. Of the world's IFL area, 18.9% has some form of protection, but only 9.7% is strictly protected, i.e., belongs to IUCN protected areas categories I-III. The world IFL map presented here is intended to underpin the development of a general strategy for nature conservation at the global and regional scales. It also defines a baseline for monitoring deforestation and forest degradation that is well suited for use with operational and cost-effective satellite data. All project results and IFL maps are available on a dedicated web site (http://www.intactforests.org).																	1708-3087					DEC	2008	13	2							51									WOS:000262291600035

Baniwa indigenous communities in Rio Icana, upper Rio Negro, Brazil. Six campinarana vegetation types, recognized and named by a consensus of Baniwa indigenous informants according to salient indicator species, were studied in 15 widely distributed plots. Floristic composition (using Baniwa plant nomenclature only, after frustrated attempts to obtain botanical collection permits), quantitative measures of forest structure and GPS waypoints of the 4-ha composite plot contours were registered, permitting their location on Landsat satellite images. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination was carried out using pc-ord software. The NMDS ordinations of the plot data revealed a clear gradient of floristic composition that was highly correlated with three quantitative measures of forest structure: basal area, canopy height and satellite reflectance. Baniwa-defined forest types are excellent predictors of habitat diversity along the structural gradient comprising distinctive white-sand campinarana vegetation types. Indigenous ecological knowledge, as revealed by satellite imagery and floristic analyses, proves to be a powerful and efficient shortcut to assessing habitat diversity, promoting dialogue between scientific and indigenous worldviews, and promoting joint study and conservation of biodiversity.

J	Hu, HB; Liu, WJ; Cao, M				Hu, Huabin; Liu, Wenjun; Cao, Min			Impact of land use and land cover changes on ecosystem services in Menglun, Xishuangbanna, Southwest China	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Changing the landscape has serious environmental impacts affecting the ecosystem services, particularly in the tropics. In this paper, we report changes in ecosystem services in relation to land use and land cover over an 18-year period (1988-2006) in the Menglun Township, Xishuangbanna, Southwest China. We used Landsat TM/ETM and Quickbird data sets to estimate changes in ten land use and land cover categories, and generalized value coefficients to estimate changes in the ecosystem services provided by each land category. The results showed that over the 18-year period, the land use and land cover in the study area experienced significant changes. Rubber plantations increased from 12.10% of total land cover to 45.63%, while forested area and swidden field decreased from 48.73 and 13.14 to 27.57 and 0.46%, respectively. During this period, the estimated value of ecosystem services dropped by US $11.427 million (similar to 27.73%). Further analysis showed that there were significant changes in ecological functions such as nutrient cycling, erosion control, climate regulation and water treatment as well as recreation; the obvious increase in the ecological function is provision of raw material (natural rubber). Our findings conclude that an abrupt shift in land use from ecologically important tropical forests and traditionally managed swidden fields to large-scale rubber plantations result in a great loss of ecosystem services in this area. Further, the study suggests that provision of alternative economic opportunities would help in maintaining ecosystem services and for an appropriate compensation mechanisms need to be established based on rigorous valuation.

Using Finnish National Forest Inventory information and remote sensing data, we determined a habitat quality index and economic value for each site in Satakunta region in Finland. Moreover, we defined several sets of potential conservation targets using alternative criteria for the habitat quality index developed for the Finnish case study. These figures were used in the site selection model in order to maximize the sum of habitat index of selected areas under a given budget constraint. We found that the production possibility frontier for the outputs of timber and biodiversity is only slightly concave when using the given threshold values. Thus, the optimal combination of the outputs is sensitive to the relative values of these goods. Our results suggest that an integrated approach in forest conservation could provide to environmental managers considerable cost savings compared with current management practices. Environmental managers could also reduce conservation costs by loosening the criteria for potential conservation targets. This would not lower considerably the quality of conserved forests.

J	Panta, M; Kim, K; Joshi, C				Panta, Menaka; Kim, Kyehyun; Joshi, Chudamani			Temporal mapping of deforestation and forest degradation in Nepal: Applications to forest conservation	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Deforestation and forest degradation are associated and progressive processes resulting in the conversion of forest area into a mosaic of mature forest fragments, pasture, and degraded habitat. Monitoring of forest landscape spatial structures has been recommended to detect degenerative trends in forest conditions. GIS and remote sensing play an important role in the generation of such data to identify degraded and deforested areas as well as potential areas for conservation. In this study we analyzed forest degradation and deforestation trends in Chitwan district in Nepal, which contains key habitat elements for wildlife in the region. An artificial neural network was used to predict forest canopy density in five classes using Landsat images of the year 2001. Forest canopy density was predicted with 82% overall accuracy. Except riverine forest, forest area of all other forest types was reduced. Terai Shorea robusta forest, which has high commercial value, showed a loss of 23% between 1976 and 1989 and an overall loss of 15% forest covers between the year 1976 and 2001. Deforestation and forest degradation disproportionately reduced the sizes of the different forest types, a finding that has important management implications. The maps presented in this article could be useful to prioritize limited resources for conservation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J	Lucas, KL; Carter, GA				Lucas, Kelly L.; Carter, Gregory A.			The use of hyperspectral remote sensing to assess vascular plant species richness on Horn Island, Mississippi	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Relationships of plant species richness with spectral indices derived from airborne hyperspectral image data were evaluated for several habitat-types on Horn Island, Mississippi, northern Gulf of Mexico. A 126-band hyperspectral data cube of Horn Island acquired by the HyMap imaging system covered the 450-2500 nm spectrum at a 3 m Ground Sample Distance (GSD). Reflectance spectra were extracted from 5-11 HyMap pixels representing each of 95,15-m vegetation line transects that were established randomly on the island. In simple regressions, no index related to richness when data from all habitat-types were combined. a number of reflectance and spectral derivative indices related significantly (p <= 0.05) with richness However, when habitat-types were considered separately. Only those indices which passed a fidelity test based on the consistency of index response to changes in plant and environmental moisture were selected as potentially reliable indicators of richness. Transect coefficient of variation (CV) for R-1056/R-966 and R-920/R-834 related negatively with richness in meadows and transition zones, respectively. The CV of R-951/R-1100 and R-904 related negatively with woodland richness. Negative regression slopes, field observations and spectral mixtures indicated that richness in these habitats declined with increased bare soil exposure. In marsh habitat, positive relationships of richness with mean R-618/R-2475 or the CV of R-514/R-2459 were explained by the increasing presence and patchy distribution of broadleaved vegetation in the progression from wetter, low-richness sites to slightly-elevated, higher-richness sites. Present results combined with those of a previous grassland study suggested that remotely-sensed indicators of soil exposure may be generally useful in the assessment of plant species richness in mesic habitats.

The design of regional networks of marine reserves is concerned with the problem of where to place the marine protected areas and how to spatially configure them. Quantitative methods for doing this provide important decision support tools for marine managers, The central problem is to balance the costs and benefits of the reserve network, whilst satisfying conservation objectives (hence solving a constrained optimization problem). Current optimization algorithms for reserve design are widely used, but none allow for the systematic incorporation of data uncertainty and its effect on the reserve design solutions. The central purpose of this study is to provide a framework for incorporating uncertain ecological input data into algorithms for designing networks of marine reserves. In order to do this, a simplified version of the marine reserve design optimization problem is considered. A Metropolis-Hastings random search procedure is introduced to systematically sample the model solution space and converge on an optimal reserve design. Incorporation of the uncertain input data builds on this process and relies on a parametric bootstrapping procedure. This allows for the solution (i.e, the marine reserve design) to be expressed as the probability of any planning unit being included in the marine reserve network. Spatial plots of this acceptance probability are easily interpretable for decision making under uncertainty. The bootstrapping methodology is also readily adapted to existing comprehensive reserve design algorithms. Here, a preliminary application of the algorithm is made to the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (in the Caribbean Sea) based on satellite-derived and mapped conservation features (from Landsat).

Estimating area of forest change by random sampling of change strata mapped using satellite imagery	FOREST SCIENCE												There is worldwide interest in monitoring changes in forest area for carbon budgeting and assessing biodiversity changes. For cost-effective monitoring over large areas, automated mapping is necessary. However, the accuracy of automated mapping is rarely high enough to permit accurate estimation of changes in forest area when there is small change. In this article, we show how accurate area statistics of small change can be achieved by combining automated change mapping with stratified random sampling. The stratified random sampling can be made efficient by exhaustive sampling of a stratum with contiguous areas of apparent change greater than or equal to some lower limit (5 ha in the case presented here) and splitting the forest-to-forest stratum into large and small spectral change. Efficiency of the method is high when the exhaustively sampled stratum contains a high proportion of all real change. A regional example from New Zealand of mapping change in forest area is given. Acceptable accuracy (afforestation is estimated to +/- 7% of reported afforestation) from acceptable effort (10,702 sample points) is obtained, representing an efficiency gain of 78% (in terms of sample size) over simple random sampling. The method can be applied to national estimation of forest change to the same accuracy with an efficiency gain of approximately 70%. It provides a more rapid alternative to multipurpose forest inventories, which depend on intensive and expensive field data, and has significant implications for carbon accounting at regional and national scales, where rapid production of usable estimates are required for carbon exchange markets.																	0015-749X					OCT	2008	54	5					475	480										WOS:000259757800001

Previous studies of Cerrado land-use and land-cover (LULC) change imply spatial homogeneity, report widely varying rates of land conversion, use ambiguous LULC categories, and generally do not attempt to validate results. This study addresses this gap in the literature by analyzing moderate-resolution, multi-spectral satellite remote sensing data from 1986 to 2002 in two regions with identical underlying drivers. Unsupervised classification by the ISODATA algorithm indicates that Cerrado was converted to agro-pastoral land covers in 31% (3646km(2)) of the study region in western Bahia and 24% (3011 km(2)) of the eastern Mato Grosso study region, while nearly 40% (4688 km(2) and 5217 km(2), respectively) of each study region remained unchanged. Although aggregate land change is similar, large and contiguous fragments persist in western Bahia, while smaller fragments remain in eastern Mato Grosso. These findings are considered in the current context of Cerrado land-use policy, which is dominated by the conservation set-aside and command-control policy models. The spatial characteristics of Cerrado remnants create considerable obstacles to implement the models; an alternative approach, informed by countryside biogeography, may encourage collaboration between state officials and farmer-landowners toward conservation land-use policies.

Mapping and exploring the distribution of the Vulnerable grey-winged cotinga Tijuca condita	ORYX												The grey-winged cotinga Tijuca condita was first described in 1980 from an old specimen, misidentified as a congener. Field observations came later, from two remote, high-elevation forests in the Mountains of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Both involved only a few pairs of birds at best, making this species one of the least known in the world. Accurately defining the locations this species inhabits is an obvious prerequisite for designing conservation strategies to protect it. Using remotely sensed data on elevation and forest cover we mapped this species' habitat and predicted six more sites where it may occur. Field Surveys confirmed two of them, doubling the known range of the species. The two easternmost predicted sites did not contain the species but these areas have less annual rainfall than other sites, which may explain the absences. This research serves as an important guide to conservation actions, for it uncovered biological, important areas for this species that had been previously overlooked. It has also measured the remaining habitat of the species so that any future losses can be detected.

Analysis of forest cover changes and its causes are the most challenging areas of landscape ecology, especially due to the absence of temporal ground data and comparable space platform based data. Comparing remotely sensed data from three different sources with sensors having different spatial and spectral resolution presented a technical challenge. Quantitative change analysis over a long period provided a valuable insight into forest cover dynamics in this area. Time-series maps were combined within a geographical information system (GIS) with biotic and abiotic factors for modelling its future change. The land-cover change has been modelled using GEOMOD and predicted for year 2020 using the current disturbance scenario. Comparison of the forest change maps over the 31-year period shows that evergreen forest being degraded (16%) primarily in the form of selective logging and clear felling to raise plantations of coffee, tea and cardamom. The natural disturbances such as forest fire, wildlife grazing, invasions after clearance and soil erosion induced by anthropogenic pressure over the decades are the reasons of forest cover change in KMTR. The study demonstrates the role of remote sensing and GIS in monitoring of large-coverage of forest area continuously for a given region over time more precisely and in cost-effective manner which will be ideal for conservation planning and prioritization.

Estimating foliar nitrogen concentration of heather (Calluna vulgaris) from field and laboratory spectra	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Regional botanical surveys supported by field experiments suggest that atmospheric nitrogen deposition threatens the balance between species and causes loss of biodiversity within plant communities. Methods are required to monitor the nitrogen status of vegetation at a landscape scale and therefore the potential for ecological change. Remote sensing has the potential to monitor a number of plant biophysical and chemical variables, but its application to monitor the nitrogen status of native vegetation remains limited and untested. Using field spectroscopy, canopy reflectance measurements were taken from two heathland field sites and heather (Calluna vulgaris) plants grown in a greenhouse. The nitrogen concentration was determined through destructive sampling and chemical analysis. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to identify the wavebands most associated with nitrogen concentration and despite high variation in the selected wavebands between the three datasets, most of these wavebands were associated with nitrogen and protein absorption features within the spectral region 1,990-2,170 nm. Results highlight the potential of remote sensing as a bio-monitoring technique to estimate foliar nitrogen status in native plants.

An appraisal of landuse and landcover mapping in Nigeria	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												Land use and landcover change have emerged as a global phenomenon and perhaps the most significant regional anthropogenic disturbance to the environment, especially in the 20(th) century. Rapid urbanization/industrialization and large scale agriculture and major changes in human activities have been identified as the major causes of the dramatic changes in land cover and land use patterns globally. Dramatic land cover and land use changes that would have once required centuries now take place within a few decades. Africa is said to have the fastest rate of deforestation in the world as a result of over-dependence on primary resources with direct effect on the bio-diversity. All these call for an urgent need for proper geo-management of land; that is concomitant upon the availability of a detailed, accurate and up-to-date data. Although, there has been a world wide increase in awareness and studies on land use and land cover change analysis in the last four to five decades, there is still an extremely low level of research attention on land use and land cover change studies in Nigeria. Also, some of the few prominent land use and land cover analysis and change detection attempts in the country relied heavily on manual analysis procedure as against the modern recognized digital image interpretation and analysis procedure. It is against this background that this paper attempts the appraisal of some landuse/landcover mapping studies in Nigeria, with a view to ascertaining their usefulness and, more importantly, to suggest the usefulness and application of some of the 'modern' methods to relevant studies in Nigeria.																	1991-637X					SEP	2008	3	9					581	586										WOS:000259935100001

Assessing forest fragmentation in northeastern region (NER) of India using landscape matrices	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Northeastern region (NER) of India, one of the largest reserves of forests in India has so far been studied with a view to map the distribution of species or modeling the disturbance regimes and richness analysis. The present study focuses on the importance of regional level studies where the entire NER which is under the threat of forest fragmentation and degradation, is been assessed. In the present study, six historical data sets generated from remote sensing data (1972, 1982, 1987, 1989, 1993 and 1999) are used to assess forest cover loss, shape index and entropy to the degree of forest fragmentation over a multi-decadal period. The assessments have been carried out in the open (40-10% canopy density) and close (>40% canopy density) forest cover classes. The range of shape index and deviation from the actual mean in open forest and closed forest were computed separately. The patches among two categories were further analyzed based on patch area into six classes; ranging from <1 km(2) to >500 km(2). This also indicates variability of the forest patches. It is noteworthy that patches of area within 1-10 km(2) and 10-50 km(2) have been severely fragmented. This loss could be attributed to the shifting cultivation practice where the patches of moderate size are cultivated by group of families. The present study could give an insight to the patch configuration and composition in terms of shape index and the Shannon's entropy index. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Often a simple 'rough versus smooth' or 'structure versus no structure' characterisation is made. By applying surface analysis theory. developed by terrestrial ecologists. features within a seabed digital terrain model (DTM) can be identified and levels Of uncertainty placed on the classification of individual features. Classification models developed using these techniques have specific advantages over traditional techniques of generating habitat maps in they are non-subjective, scale-independent, are quantifiable and are repeatable. Using habitat classification models, generated at biologically relevant scales, we present examples between movement and habitat utilisation of the southern rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) and prominent features in rocky reef habitats. Incorporating habitat complexity models with fine-scale movement, at an appropriate spatial scale, has specific applications in future marine protected area design and represents the next step in managing the Tasmanian rock lobster fishery with an estimated wealth in excess of AU$ 70 MPa.

This makes it vital to regularly assess protected areas to confirm the efficacy of measures that protect that area from clearing. Satellite remote sensing offers a systematic and objective means for detecting bind monitoring deforestation. This paper examines a spectral change approach to detect deforestation using pattern decomposition (PD) coefficients from multitemporal Landsat data. Our results show that the PD coefficients for soil and vegetation can be used to detect deforestation using change vector analysis (CVA). CVA analysis demonstrates that deforestation in the Kinabalu area, Sabah, Malaysia has significantly slowed from 1.22% in period 1 (1973 and 1991) to 0.1% in period 2 (1991 and 1996). A comparison of deforestation both inside and outside Kinabalu Park has highlighted the effectiveness of the park in protecting the tropical forest against clearing. However, the park is still facing pressure from the area immediately surrounding the park (the 1 km buffer zone) where the deforestation rate has remained unchanged. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However, because of their patchy distribution, point sampling does not appropriately map their subtidal spatial distribution. This study evaluated the feasibility to detect L. conchilega reefs by very-high resolution side-scan sonar imagery. A subtidal very-high resolution (410 kHz) side-scan survey, combined with grab sampling, revealed high densities of L. conchilega (up to 1979 ind. m(-2)) to coincide with a higher reflectivity, patchy and grainy acoustic facies. From the side-scan sonar imagery, individual reefs were estimated to reach a maximum size of 15 m(2). To ground truth the acoustic facies, the distribution of intertidal L. conchilega reefs was mapped at low tide and side-scan sonar imagery was recorded during the following high tide. Intertidal L. conchilega reefs had a patch size of 0.8 m(2) up to 11.6 m(2), elevated 7.5 to 11.5 cm above the surrounding seafloor and covered approximately 10% of the selected area. The very-high (445 kHz) resolution side-scan sonar imagery revealed a similar acoustic facies as in the subtidal. Lower-resolution (132 kHz) side-scan sonar imagery was less efficient to detect physically less developed L. conchilega reefs. We conclude that (1) there are no major technical restrictions to map L. conchilega reefs using side-scan sonar, (2) the developmental stage of L. conchilega reefs impacts the detectability of the reefs, and (3) very-high resolution side-scan sonar imagery is considered a necessity when mapping small-scale structures, such as L. conchilega reefs.

Regional-scale seagrass habitat mapping in the Wider Caribbean region using Landsat sensors: Applications to conservation and ecology	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Seagrass meadows occupy a large proportion of the world's coastal oceans and are some of the most productive systems on Earth. Direct and indirect human-derived impacts have led to significant seagrass declines worldwide and the alteration of services linked to their biodiversity. Effective conservation and the provision of sustainable recovery goals for ecologically significant species are limited by the absence of reliable information on seagrass extent. This is especially true for the Wider Caribbean region (WCR) where many conservation initiatives are under way, but are impaired by the lack Of accurate baseline habitat maps. To assist with such a fundamental conservation need using high-resolution remote sensing data, both environmental and methodological challenges need to be tackled. First, the diversity of environments, the heterogeneity of habitats, and the vast extent of the targeted region mean that local expertise and field data of adequate quality and resolution are seldom available. Second, large-scale high-resolution mapping requires several hundred Landsat 5 and 7 images, which poses substantial processing problems. The main goal of this study was to test the feasibility of achieving Landsat-based large-scale seagrass mapping with limited ground-truth data and acceptable accuracies. We used the following combination of methods to map seagrass throughout the WCR: geomorphological segmentation, contextual editing, and supervised classifications. A total of 40 Landsat scenes (path-row) were processed. Three major classes were derived ('dense seagrass', 'medium-sparse seagrass', and a generic 'other' class). Products' accuracies were assessed against (i) selected in situ data; (ii) patterns detectable with very high-resolution IKONOS images; and (iii) published habitat maps with documented accuracies. Despite variable overall classification accuracies (46-88%), following their critical evaluation, the resulting thematic maps were deemed acceptable to (i) regionally Provide an adequate baseline for further large-scale conservation programs and research actions; and (ii) regionally re-assess carrying capacity estimates for green turtles. They certainly represent a drastic improvement relative to current regional databases. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

A comparative analysis of spatial, temporal, and ecological characteristics of forest fires in seasonally dry tropical ecosystems in the Western Ghats, India	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The Western Ghats in India is one of the 25 global hotspots of biodiversity, and it is the hotspot with the highest human density. This study considers variations in the regional fire regime that are related to vegetation type and past human disturbances in a landscape. Using a combination of remote sensing data and GIS techniques, burnt areas were delineated in three different vegetation types and various metrics of fire size were estimated. Belt transects were enumerated to assess the vegetation characteristics and fire effects in the landscape. Temporal trends suggest increasingly short fire-return intervals in the landscape. In the tropical dry deciduous forest, the mean fire-return interval is 6 years, in the tropical dry thorn forest mean fire-return interval is 10 years, and in the tropical moist deciduous forest mean fire-return interval is 20 years. Tropical dry deciduous forests burned more frequently and had the largest number of fires in any given year as well as the single largest fire (9900 ha). Seventy percent, 56%, and 30% of the tropical moist deciduous forests, tropical dry thorn forests, and tropical dry deciduous forests, respectively have not burned during the 7-year period of study. The model of fire-return interval as a function of distance from park boundary explained 63% of the spatial variation of fire-return interval in the landscape. Forest fires had significant impacts on species diversity and regeneration in the tropical dry deciduous forests. Species diversity declined by 50% and 60% in the moderate and high frequency classes, respectively compared to the low fire frequency class. Sapling density declined by ca. 30% in both moderate and high frequency classes compared to low frequency class. In tropical moist deciduous ecosystems, there were substantial declines in species diversity, tree density, seedling and sapling densities in burned forests compared to the unburned forests. In contrast forest fires in tropical dry thorn forests had a marginal positive effect on ecosystem diversity, structure, and regeneration. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The new management philosophy has four important pillars; integration of biodiversity conservation into forest management process, characterization and accommodation of multiple forest values, effective participation of stakeholders and the use of advanced information technologies and management science techniques. These components comprise a sound framework of a forest management planning system in Turkey as the ownership, land use policy, social structure and forest ecosystems are unique to the country. Among few implementation sites, some experiences from the case study area of Yanlizcam planning unit were documented to realize the performance of the concept. The liaison between the government institutions and major stakeholders is found necessary, and the effective use of geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) have been realized critically important to better communicate among stakeholders and generate precise database and the plan. The case study indicated that structured participation is an effective communication tool and has a better possibly to promote multiple use forest management rather than using participation as solo information gathering process. Primary challenges relate to the effectiveness of national conservation program, availability of coherent biodiversity data and adequacy of institutional capacity that involve awareness, training and common understanding of biodiversity and protected area concept; coordination among the related institutions and stakeholders, and willingness and enthusiasm of authorities to accept and implement the concept.

Objective global ocean biogeographic provinces	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												[1] Biogeographic provinces are categories used for comparing and contrasting biogeochemical processes and biodiversity between ocean regions. Provinces provide a framework for reasonable extrapolation of point or transect data to broader areas. However, their use is limited due to the non-automatic, subjective nature of province classification. Furthermore, it is unknown how province boundaries respond to seasonal and climate forcing. These issues make province related hypotheses difficult to test with static provinces. To solve this problem, we use objective classification on global remote sensing data to automatically produce time and space resolved ocean provinces. Seasonal patterns in province geography reflect well-known ocean processes. Our predictions of province boundaries are verified by in-situ ship track data and province distributions in the equatorial Pacific correlate well with ENSO indexes. This objective classification system captures spatial and temporal province dynamics and provides objective categories for cross-province biogeochemical hypotheses to be rigorously tested.

Yet, through retrospective research scientists can approach and understand ecosystem changes. This contributes to the fundamental understanding of both human-induced and natural dynamics in ecosystems worldwide. This also holds for fast changing coastal areas with mangrove ecosystems, which are important for biodiversity, for coastal protection, and for the daily livelihood of millions of people in tropical coastal developing countries. In addition, retrospective research generates a basis for predictions that can be used early on to protect an ecosystem. In attempting to protect ecosystems from adverse human-induced change and destruction, and to manage them for sustainability, scientists are only beginning to investigate and understand natural ecosystem dynamics. It is important and advisable to gather, combine and analyse all possible data that allow a researcher to look back in time. This paper reviews the available retrospective methods, and highlights the transdisciplinary way (i.e. combination between basic and applied sciences on one hand, and social and human sciences on the other) in which retrospective research on a scale between months and centuries can be carried out, but it also includes methods on larger scales that may be marginally relevant. The paper particularly emphasizes the lack of transdisciplinary (not interdisciplinary) integration between sciences in retrospective research on mangrove forests in the past. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

An aerial photographic time series from AD 1938 to 2003 quantifies dune movement that reflects processes over centuries and documents accelerated parabolic dune movement at similar to 4 m/yr from 1938 to 1977 during a drier interval. In contrast, dune movement between 1987 and 2003 slowed to similar to 1 m/yr with wetter conditions. Wetlands expand post dune movement often forming in dune blowouts with seasonally wet conditions. Stratigraphic studies, coupled with optically stimulated luminescence ages, place erosion and burial of the pre-settlement forest soil by migrating dunes at AD 1690 +/- 40 yr, with aeolian deposition continuing into the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, consistent with the historic record of land surface conditions. A threshold of landscape stability was exceeded in the late seventeenth to early eighteenth centuries, indicated by dune formation in response to human-induced land-cover changes, concomitant severe droughts and exposure to tropical storm/hurricane windfield. Dune orientation indicates preferential movement during winter with winds dominantly from the W-NW and with reduced vegetation cover. The present high biodiversity in interdunal wetlands is a legacy of aeolian processes from landscape disturbance initiated by European settlers in the seventeenth century.

Modelling species richness and life form composition in Sahelian Burkina Faso with remote sensing data	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Species distribution modelling is an important tool in planning conservation strategies, in predicting effects of environmental change and in delineating patterns of species diversity. Until now, the majority of studies dealing with predicted species distributions were conducted at regional scales by using climatic and biomass parameters with low spatial resolution as environmental variables. On the contrary, informed decision-making regarding conservation priorities mainly takes place on a local scale. We used the genetic algorithm for rule-set production (GARP), environmental layers (derivates of high-resolution LANDSAT ETM + satellite images) and 13,380 geo-referenced records from collection and releve data to model distributions of vascular plant species in the Sahelian zone of Burkina Faso. For each species, records were divided randomly in a training dataset for model generation and a test dataset to evaluate the modelled distribution maps. Single distributions of 138 highly accurately modelled species were summed up for life forms and total species richness. Highest values of species richness are found in the NW of the study area. The pattern of vascular plant diversity appears to be closely linked to sandy soils and to water availability: watercourses, tiger bush vegetation and dune ridges are more diverse than pediplain. Chamaephytes show a more pronounced preference of dunes over pediplain than other life forms, while geophyte diversity is highest near watercourses. Hemicryptophyte diversity is most evenly distributed. Therophyte diversity is closest to all vascular plant diversity. Phanerophyte diversity is highest in tiger bush vegetation and close to watercourses. Our approach holds a wide application potential to model species distributions and diversity where environmental data are scarce. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Tree size diversity based on tree basal area was determined using the Shannon index and Gini Coefficient at the sampling plot level. Image texture parameters were calculated based on the grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) for various image segmentation levels. Analyses of relationships between tree size diversity and texture parameters found that relationships between the Gini Coefficient and the GLCM values were the most statistically significant, with the highest correlation (r=0.69) being with GLCM Homogeneity values. In contrast, Shannon Index values were weakly correlated with image derived texture parameters. The results suggest that 15m resolution Aster imagery has considerable potential in estimating tree size diversity based on the Gini Coefficient for heterogeneous Mediterranean forests.

The biogeochemical heterogeneity of tropical forests	TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION												Tropical forests are renowned for their biological diversity, but also harbor variable combinations of soil age, chemistry and susceptibility to erosion or tectonic uplift. Here we contend that the combined effects of this biotic and abiotic diversity promote exceptional biogeochemical heterogeneity at multiple scales. At local levels, high plant diversity creates variation in chemical and structural traits that affect plant production, decomposition and nutrient cycling. At regional levels, myriad combinations of soil age, soil chemistry and landscape dynamics create variation and uncertainty in limiting nutrients that do not exist at higher latitudes. The effects of such heterogeneity are not well captured in large-scale estimates of tropical ecosystem function, but we suggest new developments in remote sensing can help bridge the gap.

Despite incremental improvements in our ability to quantify rates of forest clearing, there is still no definitive understanding on global trends. Without timely and accurate forest monitoring methods, policy responses will be uninformed concerning the most basic facts of forest cover change. Results of a feasible and cost-effective monitoring strategy are presented that enable timely, precise, and internally consistent estimates of forest clearing within the humid tropics. A probability-based sampling approach that synergistically employs low and high spatial resolution satellite datasets was used to quantify humid tropical forest clearing from 2000 to 2005. Forest clearing is estimated to be 1.39% (SE 0.084%) of the total biome area. This translates to an estimated forest area cleared of 27.2 million hectares (SE 2.28 million hectares), and represents a 2.36% reduction in area of humid tropical forest. Fifty-five percent of total biome clearing occurs within only 6% of the biome area, emphasizing the presence of forest clearing "hotspots." Forest loss in Brazil accounts for 47.8% of total biome clearing, nearly four times that of the next highest country, Indonesia, which accounts for 12.8%. Over three-fifths of clearing occurs in Latin America and over one-third in Asia. Africa contributes 5.4% to the estimated loss of humid tropical forest cover, reflecting the absence of current agro-industrial scale clearing in humid tropical Africa.																	0027-8424					JUL 8	2008	105	27					9439	9444		10.1073/pnas.0804042105								WOS:000257645400055	18591652

The study involves field studies and modelling of the geographical distribution of yams and seeks correlations between environmental and ethno-biological data. Terrain analysis consists of phyto-ecological surveys and interviews with local inhabitants. A cluster analysis of a multi-date image of data obtained by remote-sensing is used to assess land-cover. The Bayesian post-probabilities of occurrence of each species are inferred using Weight of Evidence modelling linked to a Geographical Information System. The model is implemented with land-cover units and annual Moisture Availability Index evidential-layers and is driven by species presence data. The probabilities of occurrence of each species throughout the whole area as well as within and without the protected areas and in the vicinity of the sites of enquiries are calculated. A multi-factorial analysis makes it possible to shed light on the relationships among land use, the availability of yams, the uses of yams, knowledge and local practice. Results provide statistical evidence of spatial association between the yam species and the environmental descriptors taken into account. The study also provides evidence of an important regional variability in the actual uses and knowledge of wild yams. The rather widespread use of wild yams as a food complement, in social relations and as merchandise in local trade in the North of the area studied, which is far less observed in the South, is one of the major components of this variability.

Frequent monitoring of urban sprawl is needed to limit the impact of this ongoing phenomenon. This paper proposes precise monitoring of building construction using an object-based classification methodology applied to Spot 5 images with a 2.5 m resolution. An application at a regional scale on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean shows that this building extraction methodology has limitations in the production of reference urban maps because of difficulties in defining the shape and the number of buildings compared to classical photo-interpretation of aerial photography. However, these results are of great value for planning in urban sprawl areas where up-to-date information is lacking because of the rapid pace of house construction and residential development.

For two bird species, we investigate the specific contributions of different types of remote sensing variables to the predictions and model accuracy at the regional scale, where the benefits of the MODIS and QSCAT satellite data are expected to be most significant. Location South America, with a focus on the tropical and subtropical Andes and the Amazon Basin. Methods Potential geographic distributions of eight species, namely two birds, two mammals and four trees, were modelled with the MAXENT algorithm at 1-km resolution over the South American continent using climatic and remote sensing data separately and combined. For each species and model scenario, we assess model performance by testing the agreement between observed and simulated distributions across all thresholds and, in the case of the two focal bird species, at selected thresholds. Results Quantitative performance tests showed that models built with remote sensing and climatic layers in isolation performed well in predicting species distributions, suggesting that each of these data sets contains useful information. However, predictions created with a combination of remote sensing and climatic layers generally resulted in the best model performance across the three taxonomic groups. In Ecuador, the inclusion of remote sensing data was critical in resolving the known geographically isolated populations of the two focal bird species along the steep Amazonian-Andean elevational gradients. Within remote sensing subsets, microwave-based data were more important than optical data in the predictions of the two bird species. Main conclusions Our results suggest that the newly available remote sensing data (MODIS and QSCAT) have considerable utility in modelling the contemporary geographical distributions of species at both regional and continental scales and in predicting range shifts as a result of large-scale land-use change.

We assessed the impact of land-use change on PAs. The majority of parks have been effective at protecting the ecosystems within their borders, even in areas with significant land-use pressures. More in particular, the capacity of PAs to slow down habitat degradation and to favour habitat restoration is clearly related to their size, with smaller areas that on average follow the dominant land-use change pattern into which they are embedded. Our results suggest that small parks are not going to be viable in the long term if they are considered as islands surrounded by a 'human-dominated ocean'. However, small PAs are, in many cases, the only option available, implying that we need to devote much more attention to the non-protected matrix in which PAs must survive.

Ground Control Points were collected from the field using Geographic Positioning System in which half of them were used for classification and the remaining for accuracy assessment. The image was classified into four dominant land use/cover types that represent the major habitats of the study site. Image classification was done using pixel-based supervised classification with the Maximum Likelihood Classification algorithm. The accuracy of classification was evaluated using error matrix and Kappa statistics. Finally, we found an overall classification accuracy of 80% and this implies that ASTER imagery can be used as a good source of data in mapping biodiversity at habitat scale in data scarce drylands of northern Ethiopia.																	0141-6707					JUN	2008	46			1			19	23		10.1111/j.1365-2028.2008.00925.x								WOS:000256627600004

Remote sensing methods currently used for generating maps of wetland ecosystems are largely based on spectral transformations of image data, preferably using high spatial resolution data. However, airborne hyperspectral imagery contains not only high spectral content but also considerable spatial information. To date, use of the spatial information in such imagery, particularly to determine biodiversity, has not been fully exploited. In this study, spatial heterogeneity in the reflectance values of hyperspectral imagery recorded over an inland wetland complex in South Dumfries Township, Ontario, Canada, is determined on a per-pixel basis by measuring the degree of local spatial association (local Moran's I(i)) within a 3 x 3 neighbourhood of pixels. These new spatio-spectral Moran's I(i) bands are then classified into heterogeneity categories using a modified version of the spectral angle mapper algorithm. Results show that the extraction of spatial information from hyperspectral data contributes to wetland management initiatives by providing quantitative information on the spatial arrangement of measured biological elements. The use of Moran's I(i), a local measure of spatial association, also provides a statistical basis on which to map heterogeneity characteristics of elements within a wetland environment and to determine how these characteristics change over time.

Forest transition in Vietnam and its environmental impacts	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												This study assesses the presence of a forest transition - that is, a shift from net deforestation to net reforestation - in Vietnam during the 1990s, and describes its key attributes relevant for global environmental change issues. Using Fuzzy Kappa and other indicators, we compared forest cover estimates and spatial patterns from global and national land cover maps from the early and late 1990s, and compiled other available statistics for years before and after that period. This showed that a forest transition indeed occurred in Vietnam: the forest cover dropped to 25-31% of the country area in 1991-1993, and then increased to 32-37% in 1999-2001. The reforestation occurred at a higher rate than deforestation in the previous decades, and was due in similar proportions, to natural forest regeneration and to planted forests. The carbon stock in forests followed a similar transition, decreasing to 903 (770-1307) Tg C in 1991-1993, and then increasing to 1374 (1058-1744) Tg C in 2005. However, forest density declined during the same period, with an increasing proportion of young and degraded forests. The effects on habitats measured with landscape pattern indices were contrasted: in several regions, the reforestation decreased forest fragmentation, while in others, clearing of old-growth forests continued and/or forest fragmentation increased. This shows that a transition in forest area is not sufficient to rehabilitate the different ecosystem functions and services of forests. Other forest transitions exist in Tropical Asia and in Latin America. Knowledge about the causes, pattern and environmental impacts of the forest transition in Vietnam is therefore relevant to understand possible emerging regional trends that would have implications for global environmental change.

Rajeshwar			Landscape Analysis in Fambong Lho Wildlife Sanctuary, East district, Sikkim, India using Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques	PHOTONIRVACHAK-JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												The high biological diversity and rich genetic forest resources of the state of Sikkim are to be conserved due to their sensitiveness to environmental degradation through continued human interference. The conservation of bioprospecting zones in natural forests as well as in protected areas is considered important for up keeping genetic resources and their germplasm. Keeping this in view, 'Fambong Lho' wildlife sanctuary in East district, Sikkim, has been selected to characterize different communities in the dominant vegetation type of Tropical Broad Leaved Hill Forest and to assess biodiversity controls in respect of different topographical features, such as altitude, slope, and aspects and use these inputs for prioritizing the protected area into different Bioprospective zones for conservation and planning. An altitude above 2000 m, having a slope in the range of 1-5 percent facing south east aspect are the ideal environmental conditions conducive to have high species richness. The analysis of fragmentation indicates that the forests are under stress along the fringes as they are closely associated with the habitations. The biological richness is recorded reasonably within the limits in the core area of the park but further prioritizing of such areas for conservation is necessary in view of impending danger of frequent interaction of human habitation with in the sanctuary for forest resources.																	0255-660X					JUN	2008	36	2					203	216										WOS:000264821500010

Fumero			Mapping tropical dry forest habitats integrating Landsat NDVI, Ikonos imagery, and topographic information in the Caribbean Island of Mona	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Assessing the status of tropical dry forest habitats using remote sensing technologies is one of the research priorities for Neotropical forests. We developed a simple method for mapping vegetation and habitats in a tropical dry forest reserve, Mona Island, Puerto Rico, by integrating the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Landsat, topographic information, and high-resolution Ikonos imagery. The method was practical for identifying vegetation types in areas with a great variety of plant communities and complex relief, and can be adapted to other dry forest habitats of the Caribbean Islands. NDVI was useful for identifying the distribution of forests, woodlands, and shrubland, providing a natural representation of the vegetation patterns on the island. The use of Ikonos imagery allowed increasing the number of land cover classes. As a result, sixteen land-cover types were mapped over the 5 500 ha area, with a kappa coefficient of accuracy equal to 79 %. This map is a central piece for modeling vertebrate species distribution and biodiversity patterns by the Puerto Rico Gap Analysis Project, and it is of great value for assisting research and management actions in the island.

GIS and Remote Sensing in Agriculture	VEGETOS												Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) have become an important tool in modern animal disease control. Geographical data ill digital form is now widely available but its accessibility is still limited by the high cost involved. However, as time is passing out, the cost will definitely come down with increased use of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and satellite imagery. GIS software are now available along with appropriate extension tools/software making the GIS suitable for advanced spatial analysis. Further, the realization of applicability and useful of GIS and RS in various fields has now convinced the stakeholders that without the use of these technologies it is not possible to attain the envisaged goals. Now information systems on diseases and pathogens, biodiversity, management of productivity of plant and animal are being developed which incorporates GIS as a source of various types of spatial data to be used for various simulations, risk assessment as well as for production of maps. Although RS and GIS have been employed for decades for animal diseases surveillance, prediction and intervention programs, its use in plant disease and pests is limited. Further, awareness of RS and GIS is low as application of RS and GIS in animal and plant sciences in developing countries is a recent phenomenon. However, now the use of GIS/RS is plant sciences is picking up as has been exemplified in this paper. However, to promote increased awareness and use of RS/GIS in plant sciences will require multilateral assistance in the training of personnel and equipping of RS/GIS units not only in plant science research laboratories but also in the field.																	0970-4078					JUN	2008	21	1					11	27										WOS:000260943800002

Airborne laser scanning-based prediction of coarse woody debris volumes in a conservation area	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The importance of dead wood (coarse woody debris, CWD) for biodiversity in boreal forests is high that is mainly due to its role in nutrient cycling and species habitation. Recognition of its importance in storing carbon has also raised an interest in developing new methods for assessing the quantity and quality of CWD. Since the traditional measuring techniques are often expensive to apply for the estimation of volume characteristics in the field, more attention is currently being paid to remote-sensing techniques that could provide lower cost data for forest inventories over large areas. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of airborne laser scanner (ALS) data for estimating downed and standing dead wood volumes. The analysis was based on field measurements from 33 sample plots which were evaluated against the ALS-derived height-intensity metrics obtained from the Koli National Park in eastern Finland. The accuracy of the ALS data proved adequate for predicting the downed dead wood volume (RMSE 51.6%), whereas the standing dead wood volume estimates were somewhat poorer (RMSE 78.8%). The ALS-based volume estimates for downed dead wood were found to be substantially more accurate than the estimates based on field-measured characteristics of living trees. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Assessing changes of forest area and shrub encroachment in a mire ecosystem using digital surface models and CIR aerial images	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												This paper presents an approach to assess increase and decrease (2002-1997) of forest area and other wooded areas in a mire biotope in the Pre-alpine zone of Central Switzerland using logistic regression models and airborne remote sensing data (CIR aerial images, DSM derived from them). The present study was carried out in the framework of the Swiss Mire Protection Program, where increase and decrease of forest areas are key issues. In a first step, automatic DSMs were generated using an image matching approach from CIR aerial images of 1997 and 2002. In a second step, the DSMs were co-registered and normalized using LiDAR data. Tree layers from both years of various levels of detail were then generated combining canopy covers derived from normalized DSMs with a multi-resolution segmentation and a frizzy classification. On the basis of these tree layers, fractional tree/shrub covers were calculated using explanatory variables derived from these DSMs only. Bias was estimated by analysing the distribution of the fractional model differences. The corrected models reveal a decrease of tree/shrub probability which indicates a decrease of forest and other wooded areas between 1997 and 2002. The models also indicate real shrub encroachment in open mire. The detection of shrub encroachment may be helpful for selective logging purposes for sustainable mire habitat management. The study stresses the importance of high-resolution and high-quality DSMs and highlights the potential of fractional covers for ecological modeling. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In particular, the biodiversity and ecosystem areas need information on landscape composition, structure of forests, species richness, as well as their changes. Field sample plots from National Forest Inventories (NFI) are, in combination with satellite data, a tremendous resource for fulfilling these information needs. NFIs have a history of almost 100 years and have developed in parallel in several countries. For example, the NFIs in Finland and Sweden measure annually more than 10,000 field plots with approximately 200 variables per plot. The inventories are designed for five-year rotations. In Finland nationwide forest cover maps have been produced operationally since 1990 by using the k-NN algorithm to combine satellite data, field sample plot information, and other georeferenced digital data. A similar k-NN database has also been created for Sweden. The potentials of NFIs to fulfil diverse information needs are currently analyzed also in the COST Action E43 project of the European Union. In this article, we provide a review of how NFI field plot information has been used for parameterization of image data in Sweden and Finland, including pre-processing steps like haze correction, slope correction, and the optimization of the estimation variables. Furthermore, we review how the produced small-area statistics and forest cover data have been used in forestry, including forest biodiversity monitoring and habitat modelling. We also show how remote sensing data can be used for post-stratification to derive the sample plot based estimates, which cannot be directly estimated from the spectral data. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Modeling distribution of Amazonian tree species and diversity using remote sensing measurements	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The availability of a wide range of satellite measurements of environmental variables at different spatial and temporal resolutions, together with an increasing number of digitized and georeferenced species occurrences, has created the opportunity to model and monitor species geographic distribution and richness at regional to continental scales. In this paper, we examine the application of recently developed global data products from satellite observations in modeling the potential distribution of tree species and diversity in the Amazon basin. We use data from satellite sensors, including MODIS, QSCAT, SRTM, and TRMM, to develop different environmental variables related to vegetation, landscape, and climate. These variables are used in a maximum entropy method (Maxent) to model the geographical distribution of five commercial trees and to classify the patterns of tree alpha-diversity in the Amazon basin. Maxent simulations are analyzed using binomial tests of omission rates and the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves to examine the model performance, the accuracy of geographic distributions, and the significance of environmental variables for discriminating suitable habitats. To evaluate the importance of satellite data, we used the Maxent jackknife test to quantify the training gains from data layers and to compare the results with model simulations using climate-only data. For all species and tree alpha-diversity, modeled distributions are in agreement with historical data and field observations. The results compare with climate-derived patterns, but provide better spatial resolution and detailed information on the habitat characteristics. Among satellite data products, QSCAT backscatter, representing canopy moisture and roughness, and MODIS leaf area index (LAI) are the most important variables in almost all cases. Model simulations suggest that climate and remote sensing results are complementary and that the best distribution patterns can be achieved when the two data sets are combined. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

As a result, methods are required that assess the effect of management activities on the biodiversity of floodplain ecosystems. In this paper, we show that dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) in combination with regional scale derived remote sensing products can be adopted to assess both current and future ecosystem development and biodiversity status of a complex floodplain ecosystem in the Netherlands. The dynamic vegetation model SMART2-SUMO2 in combination with the nature valuation model NTM3 predicting potential floristic diversity was applied to simulate the biodiversity status of the Millingerwaard floodplain along the river Rhine in the Netherlands. Estimates of net primary production (NPP) derived from airborne HyMap imaging spectrometer data were used for validation of the simulated NPP by the DVM at the time of data acquisition in 2004. Imaging spectrometer derived NPP was in good agreement with the SMART2-SUMO2 modeled results. The NTM3 derived nature valuation in 2004 expressed as plant diversity for the floodplain was high and well in agreement with field observations. In a next step, the DVM was re-initialized using imaging spectrometer derived NPP in 2004 and a forecast of plant diversity and biomass development in 2050 was made. A comparison was performed for three pre-defined floodplain management scenarios using a data-assimilation based approach as well as one without. Significant differences in biomass development can be observed between the scenarios. Predicted plant diversity for individual ecosystems in 2050 shows increased variability for forest ecosystems compared to grass ecosystems. This shows that floodplain management should take advantage of spatiotemporal dynamics of the floodplain as a basis for fostering the development of increased biodiversity. The results of this study demonstrate that imaging spectrometer derived products can be used for validation and initialization of DVMs. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Stickler, CM; Southworth, J				Stickler, Claudia M.; Southworth, Jane			Application of multi-scale spatial and spectral analysis for predicting primate occurrence and habitat associations in Kibale National Park, Uganda	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Remote sensing has made important contributions to biodiversity conservation planning through the measurement of deforestation rates, habitat fragmentation, habitat degradation, and isolation of protected areas in human altered landscapes. Progress in using remote sensing together with field data for the development of robust habitat suitability models has been more modest. In this paper, we present a habitat suitability model developed by relating field data on habitat characteristics and habitat selection of a medium-sized primate (redtail monkey, Cercopithecus ascanius) with a small home range (in contrast to many studies that focus on large-bodied, wide-ranging animals) to satellite-derived data, for predicting animal occurrence. We examined the relative performance of two high-resolution satellite sensors (2.5 m resolution Quickbird and 30 m resolution Landsat ETM+) in capturing patterns of habitat selection by redtail monkeys in Kibale National Park. Overall, our analyses suggest that a model combining data from both the Quickbird and ETM+ sensors predicts monkey presence-absence best, and that, individually, ETM+ data are better predictors than Quickbird data. Moreover, model fit was best at larger scales (ETM+ 120 m, 150 m and 240 m pixels). These results have important implications for future habitat modeling, biodiversity analyses and conservation studies given Landsat's temporal and spatial resolutions, long history of use, relatively well-developed methods for processing and analysis, and relatively low cost in comparison with many higher resolution sensors.

We investigated the degree to which floristically and structurally defined Costa Rican lowland rain forest types can be accurately discriminated by a non-parametric k nearest neighbors (k-nn) classifier or linear discriminant analysis. Pixel values of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation model extracted from segments or from 5 x 5 pixel windows were employed in the classifications. 104 field plots were classified into three floristic and one structural type of forest (regrowth forest). Three floristically defined forest types were formed through clustering the old-growth forest plots (n=52) by their species specific importance values. An error assessment of the image classification was conducted via cross-validation and error matrices, and overall percent accuracy and Kappa scores were used as measures of accuracy. Image classification of the four forest types did not adequately distinguish two old-growth forest classes, so they were merged into a single forest class. The resulting three forest classes were most accurately classified by the k-nn classifier using segmented image data (overall accuracy 91 %). The second best method, with respect to accuracy, was the k-nn with 5 x 5 pixel windows data (89% accuracy), followed by the canonical discriminant analysis using the 5 x 5 pixel window data (86%) and the segment data (82%). We conclude the k-nn classifier can accurately distinguish floristically and structurally different rain forest types. The classification accuracies were higher for the k-nn classifier than for the canonical discriminant analysis, but the differences in Kappa scores were not statistically significant.

J	Keles, S; Sivrikaya, F; Cakir, G; Kose, S				Keles, Sedat; Sivrikaya, Fatih; Cakir, Guenay; Kose, Selahattin			Urbanization and forest cover change in regional directorate of Trabzon forestry from 1975 to 2000 using landsat data	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												In this study, forest cover change and urbanization in the borders of Regional Directorate of Trabzon Forestry (RDTF), which is located in NE of Turkey, was investigated during a 25 year period. Spatial and temporal changes in forest cover were also analyzed using Geographical Information System (GIS) and FRAGSTATS (TM). Forest cover changes were detected from a time series of satellite images of Landsat MSS in 1975, Landsat TM in 1987, and Landsat ETM+ in 2000 using Remote Sensing (RS) and GIS. The results showed a decrease in forest area, productive forest area and degraded forest area. Total forest area decreased in the first period (1975-1987), however increased during the second (1987-2000) period. 36 807 hectares (7% of the study area) mixed forest area converted to conifer forest. During the whole study period, the average annual deforestation rate was 977 ha year(-1), equivalent to 0.42% year(-1) using the compound-interest-rate formula. Total number of forest fragments decreased from 135,039 to 132,839 (1.6%) during a 25 year period. On the other hand, total population lived in the borders of Trabzon City increased from 1975 to 2000 even though the rural population decreased. According to the results, the decrease of forest areas may well be explained by increasing population and urbanization. The decrease of number of patches and degraded forest area can be disclosed by the fact that the decline of rural population has positively affected the development of forest areas.

J	Bradley, BA; Fleishman, E				Bradley, Bethany A.; Fleishman, Erica			Relationships between expanding pinyon-juniper cover and topography in the central Great Basin, Nevada	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Increasing geographical range and density of conifers is a major form of land-cover change in the western United States, affecting fire frequency, biogeochemistry and possibly biodiversity. However, the extent and magnitude of the change are uncertain. This study aimed to quantify the relationship between changing conifer cover and topography. Location The central Great Basin in the state of Nevada, USA. Methods We used a series of Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite images from 1986, 1995 and 2005 to map change in pinyon-juniper woodlands (Pinus monophylla, Juniperus spp.) in the montane central Great Basin of Nevada. We derived fractional greenness for each year using spectral mixture analysis and identified all areas with an above average increase in greenness from 1986 to 1995 and 1995 to 2005. Results Areas with high fractional greenness in 2005 were most likely to occur at elevations between 2200 and 2600 m a.s.l. Increases in fractional greenness between 1986 and 2005 were most likely to occur at elevations below 2000 m a.s.l. and on south-facing slopes. However, relationships between elevation and increasing greenness for individual mountain ranges varied considerably from the average trend. Fractional greenness values measured by Landsat suggest that the majority of pinyon-juniper woodlands have not reached their maximum potential tree cover. Main conclusions Expansion of pinyon-juniper at low elevations and on south-facing slopes probably reflects increasing precipitation in the 20th century, higher water use efficiency caused by increasing atmospheric CO2 in the late 20th century and livestock grazing at the interface between shrubland and woodland. Identification of the spatial relationships between changing fractional greenness of pinyon-juniper woodland and topography can inform regional land management and improve projections of long-term ecosystem change.

Integrating remotely acquired and field data to assess effects of setback levees on riparian and aquatic habitats in glacial-melt water rivers	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Setback levees, in which levees are reconstructed at a greater distance from a river channel, are a promising restoration technique particularly for alluvial rivers with broad floodplains where river-floodplain connectivity is essential to ecological processes. Documenting the ecological outcomes of restoration activities is essential for assessing the comparative benefits of different restoration approaches and for justifying new restoration projects. Remote sensing of aquatic habitats offers one approach for comprehensive, objective documentation of river and floodplain habitats, but is difficult in glacial rivers because of high suspended-sediment concentrations, braiding and a lack of large, well-differentiated channel forms such as riffles and pools. Remote imagery and field surveys were used to assess the effects of recent and planned setback levees along the Puyallup River and, more generally, the application of multispectral imagery for classifying aquatic and riparian habitats in glacial-melt water rivers. Airborne images were acquired with a horizontal ground resolution of 0.5 m in three spectral bands (0.545-0.555, 0.665-0.675 and 0.790-0.8 10 mu m) spanning from green to near infrared (NIR) wavelengths. Field surveys identified river and floodplain habitat features and provided the basis for a comparative hydraulic analysis. Broad categories of aquatic habitat (smooth and rough water surface), exposed sediment (sand and boulder) and vegetated surfaces (herbaceous and deciduous shrub/forest) were classified accurately using the airborne images. Other categories [e.g. conifers, boulder, large woody debris (LWD)] and subdivisions of broad categories (e.g. riffles and runs) were not successfully classified either because these features did not form large patches that could be identified on the imagery or their spectral reflectances were not distinct from those of other habitat types. Airborne imagery was critical for assessing fine-scale aquatic habitat heterogeneity including shallow, low-velocity regions that were not feasible or practical to map in the field in many cases due to their widespread distribution, small size and poorly defined boundaries with other habitat types. At the reach-scale, the setback levee affected the amount and distribution of riparian and aquatic habitats: (1) the area of all habitats was greater where levees had been set back and with relatively more vegetated floodplain habitat and relatively less exposed sediment and aquatic habitat, (2) where levees confine the river, less low-velocity aquatic habitat is present over a range of flows with a higher degree of bed instability during high flows. As river restoration proceeds in the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere, remotely acquired imagery will be important for documenting its effects on the amount and distribution of aquatic and floodplain habitats, complimenting field data as a quantitative basis for evaluating project efficacy.

J	Broadbent, EN; Asner, GP; Pena-Claros, M; Palace, M; Soriano, M				Broadbent, Eben N.; Asner, Gregory P.; Pena-Claros, Marielos; Palace, Michael; Soriano, Marlene			Spatial partitioning of biomass and diversity in a lowland Bolivian forest: Linking field and remote sensing measurements	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Large-scale inventories of forest biomass and structure are necessary for both understanding carbon dynamics and conserving biodiversity. High-resolution satellite imagery is starting to enable structural analysis of tropical forests over large areas, but we lack an understanding of how tropical forest biomass links to remote sensing. We quantified the spatial distribution of biomass and tree species diversity over 4 ha in a Bolivian lowland moist tropical forest, and then linked our field measurements to high-resolution Quickbird satellite imagery. Our field measurements showed that emergent and canopy dominant trees, being those directly visible from nadir remote sensors, comprised the highest diversity of tree species, represented 86% of all tree species found in our study plots, and contained the majority of forest biomass. Emergent trees obscured 1-15 trees with trunk diameters (at 1.3 m, diameter at breast height (DBH)) >= 20 cm, thus hiding 30-50% of forest biomass from nadir viewing. Allometric equations were developed to link remotely visible crown features to stand parameters, showing that the maximum tree crown length explains 50-70% of the individual tree biomass. We then developed correction equations to derive aboveground forest biomass, basal area, and tree density from tree crowns visible to nadir satellites. We applied an automated tree crown delineation procedure to a high-resolution panchromatic Quickbird image of our study area, which showed promise for identification of forest biomass at community scales, but which also highlighted the difficulties of remotely sensing forest structure at the individual tree level.

J	Baguinon, NT				Baguinon, Nestor T.			Biogeography and tropical terrestrial ecosystem health	ASIA LIFE SCIENCES												Ecosystem health was discussed within the context of biogeography. The recorded number of animal and plant species can be ideal as standard for species completeness, hence ecosystem health. However, the idea is not practical. Small mobile organisms are difficult to account, unlike trees. Trees are obvious to monitor ecosystem health. The decrease of tree species number as a function of shrinking area due to deforestation is consistent with MacArthur and Wilson's Island Biogeography Theory (IBT). Natural ecosystems are alienated into agroecosystems, a relationship described as P (the natural ecosystem) = 1 - Q (agroecosystem). Q expands at the expense of P and this results in forest fragmentation, irreversible destruction of habitats and extinction of species. Their ratio, P/Q is a yardstick to ecosystem health, including interconnectivity of natural ecosystems at various spatial and temporal scales. The regions Greater Mindanao, Samar-Leyte and the Central Cordillera Highlands had their tree flora data based. Attributes such as elevation preferences and habitat were selected. Habitats ranged from primary forest to open grassland areas and seashores. Elevation ranged from seashore to several zones beyond sea level. Recorded tree species show that for all regions, primary forest dwelling species are a, risk to extirpation or extinction. Philippine forest cover sharply declined from 1900 to 1999. Forest decline was overlaid with a topographic and a mining risk assessment map. Results show climax tree species are at high risk. to extinction in Mindanao, Samar-Leyte and Cordillera. Remote sensing with ground truth inventory of tree species are activities that should measure ecosystem health. The discrepancy between actual and recorded tree species should measure ecosystem health deterioration. Presence of logging, swidden farming and mining are stress factors that enhance extinction of tree species and should include as criteria to poor ecosystem health. Said ecosystem stressors can be further exacerbated by anthropogenic climate change. Bioinvasion is another ernerging threat. Social criteria are as important but have only been here enumerated.																	0117-3375					APR 15	2008				2			77	101										WOS:000255387200008

Assessment of landscape changes in the Kizilirmak Delta, Turkey, using remotely sensed data and GIS	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												In this study, an integrated approach of remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) was used to investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of the Kizilirmak Delta. It is a major wetland complex on the Black Sea coast, which has a very rich biodiversity and critical habitat for globally endangered bird species, and was announced as an RAMSAR protection site in Turkey. Main objectives of this study were: (1) determination of the land use/cover changes, (2) examination of the effects of these changes on environment, and (3) assessment of the human impacts on the environment. 1987 Landsat TM and 2004 Aster images, topographic maps, field survey, and other ancillary data have been used to perform the study objectives. The obtained results delineated that the Kizilirmak Delta has been considerably changed as a result of human activities between 1987 and 2004. Analysis of satellite images and other data sources in the GIS environment introduced the changes in the delta and their impacts on the environment.

J	Kavzoglu, T				Kavzoglu, Taskin			Determination of environmental degradation due to urbanization and industrialization in Gebze, Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												Industrialization has been one of the major factors in the development of the countries, and has caused a population increase in cities, resulting in urban sprawl. Because industrialization and urbanization often advance in an uncontrolled or unorganized way in developing countries, they can have destructive effects on the environment, particularly on basic ecosystems, wildlife habitat, and global biodiversity. One of the places that has been subject to intense industrialization and resulting urbanization is the Gebze district of Kocaeli in Turkey. Land use and land cover changes that occurred in the region were investigated using satellite images acquired in 1987, 1997, and 2002. In the detection of changes postclassification comparison approach is employed using an artificial neural network classifier, specifically a multilayer perceptron with backpropagation learning algorithm. Results show some important findings regarding the size and nature of the change that occurred in the study area. In the despoiled areas, a large number of pixels of pasture and forest lands have been replaced by urban pixels; as a result, the total area of urban pixels doubled in the 15-year period with a higher urbanization rate between 1997 and 2002. A significant amount of forest land, about 38% for deciduous and 22% for coniferous forest, has been destroyed. In addition to the statistical estimates of the change, its spatial distribution was also investigated through a map of change that helps to determine the areas where considerable degradation and deforestation have taken place.
