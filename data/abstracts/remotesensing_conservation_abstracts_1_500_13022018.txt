J	Melville, B; Lucieer, A; Aryal, J				Melville, Bethany; Lucieer, Arko; Aryal, Jagannath			Object-based random forest classification of Landsat ETM plus and WorldView-2 satellite imagery for mapping lowland native grassland communities in Tasmania, Australia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												This paper presents a random forest classification approach for identifying and mapping three types of lowland native grassland communities found in the Tasmanian Midlands region. Due to the high conservation priority assigned to these communities, there has been an increasing need to identify appropriate datasets that can be used to derive accurate and frequently updateable maps of community extent. Therefore, this paper proposes a method employing repeat classification and statistical significance testing as a means of identifying the most appropriate dataset for mapping these communities. Two datasets were acquired and analysed; a Landsat ETM + scene, and a WorldView-2 scene, both from 2010. Training and validation data were randomly subset using a k-fold (k = 50) approach from a pre-existing field dataset. Poa labillardierei, Themeda triandra and lowland native grassland complex communities were identified in addition to dry woodland and agriculture. For each subset of randomly allocated points, a random forest model was trained based on each dataset, and then used to classify the corresponding imagery. Validation was performed using the reciprocal points from the independent subset that had not been used to train the model. Final training and classification accuracies were reported as per class means for each satellite dataset. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was undertaken to determine whether classification accuracy differed between the two datasets, as well as between classifications. Results showed mean class accuracies between 54% and 87%. Class accuracy only differed significantly between datasets for the dry woodland and Themeda grassland classes, with the WorldView-2 dataset showing higher mean classification accuracies. The results of this study indicate that remote sensing is a viable method for the identification of lowland native grassland communities in the Tasmanian Midlands, and that repeat classification and statistical significant testing can be used to identify optimal datasets for vegetation community mapping.																	0303-2434					APR	2018	66						46	55		10.1016/j.jag.2017.11.006								WOS:000423650500005

Accurate tree species maps support management and conservation planning, pest and disease control and biomass estimation. This study evaluated the performance of applying ensemble techniques with the goal of automatically distinguishing Pinus sylvestris L. and Pinus uncinata Mill. Ex Mirb within a 1.3 km(2) mountainous area in Barcelonnette (France). Three modelling schemes were examined, based on: (1) high-density LiDAR data (160 returns m(-2)), (2) Worldview-2 multispectral imagery, and (3) Worldview-2 and LiDAR in combination. Variables related to the crown structure and height of individual trees were extracted from the normalized LiDAR point cloud at individual-tree level, after performing individual tree crown (ITC) delineation. Vegetation indices and the Haralick texture indices were derived from Worldview-2 images and served as independent spectral variables. Selection of the best predictor subset was done after a comparison of three variable selection procedures: (1) Random Forests with cross validation (AUCREcv), (2) Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and (3) Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). To classify the species, 9 regression techniques were combined using ensemble models. Predictions were evaluated using cross validation and an independent dataset. Integration of datasets and models improved individual tree species classification (True Skills Statistic, TSS; from 0.67 to 0.81) over individual techniques and maintained strong predictive power (Relative Operating Characteristic, ROC = 0.91). Assemblage of regression models and integration of the datasets provided more reliable species distribution maps and associated tree-scale mapping uncertainties. Our study highlights the potential of model and data assemblage at improving species classifications needed in present-day forest planning and management.																	0303-2434					MAR	2018	65						12	23		10.1016/j.jag.2017.09.016								WOS:000418312200002						
J	Rego, JCL; Soares-Gomes, A; da Silva, FS				Lima Rego, Joherbeth Carlos; Soares-Gomes, Abilio; da Silva, Fabricio Sousa			Loss of vegetation cover in a tropical island of the Amazon coastal zone (Maranhao Island, Brazil)	LAND USE POLICY												Coastal zones are valtable environments for humankind and have been used for urban settlements, recreation, harbours, mining and the gathering of natural resources. However, human occupation and usage of coastal ecosystems is threatening their diverse natural vegetation. The aim of this study was to analyse the changes in coastal vegetation cover of Maranhao Island in the face of urban development over the last 20 years through remote sensing imagery. Our results reveal a loss of vegetation for four of the five beaches studied. The most extensive loss occurred at the beaches of Sao Luis Municipality (accounting for 146 ha), which is highly urbanized. Vegetation loss also occurred at sites protected under national environmental legislation, most of which was due to illegal human activity. The results were discussed in the light of the literature which pointed out to a deterioration in the urban environment coinciding with the loss of vegetation, mainly in terms of domestic sewage pollution and erosion. We present for the first time an estimate of the vegetation loss for Maranhao Island, which contribute to the knowledge of Atlantic Forest deforestation, specifically the restinga vegetation that is yet poorly studied.																	0264-8377	1873-5754				FEB	2018	71						593	601		10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.10.055								WOS:000423643400056

To protect these species, habitat suitability evaluation plays a central role. Hence, an attempt is made in this study to evaluate the suitability of sand cat's habitat in a sand dune-dominated landscape in Iran. Four Landsat-derived indices including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Weighted Difference Vegetation Index, Brightness Index (BI) and Salinity Index were combined to characterize sand cat's habitat requirements through a land use land cover (LULC) map. Furthermore, a set of landscape metrics were employed to explore the spatial pattern LULC classes. Sand cat's habitat suitability map was generated by linear combination of the standardized and relatively weighted NDVI and BI indices and then categorized into five classes of most suitable, highly suitable, moderately suitable, least suitable and not suitable. The results showed that about 75% of the total area is suitable for sand cat. Although this region is rich in biodiversity, it has not yet been subject to any conservation planning and should be granted more conservation attentions.																	2366-3286	2366-3294				FEB	2018	26	1					11	20		10.1007/s41324-017-0152-0								WOS:000423844500002						
J	O'Leary, DS; Kellermann, JL; Wayne, C				O'Leary, Donal S., III; Kellermann, Jherime L.; Wayne, Chris			Snowmelt timing, phenology, and growing season length in conifer forests of Crater Lake National Park, USA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY												Anthropogenic climate change is having significant impacts on montane and high-elevation areas globally. Warmer winter temperatures are driving reduced snowpack in the western USA with broad potential impacts on ecosystem dynamics of particular concern for protected areas. Vegetation phenology is a sensitive indicator of ecological response to climate change and is associated with snowmelt timing. Human monitoring of climate impacts can be resource prohibitive for land management agencies, whereas remotely sensed phenology observations are freely available at a range of spatiotemporal scales. Little work has been done in regions dominated by evergreen conifer cover, which represents many mountain regions at temperate latitudes. We used moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to assess the influence of snowmelt timing and elevation on five phenology metrics (green up, maximum greenness, senescence, dormancy, and growing season length) within Crater Lake National Park, Oregon, USA from 2001 to 2012. Earlier annual mean snowmelt timing was significantly correlated with earlier onset of green up at the landscape scale. Snowmelt timing and elevation have significant explanatory power for phenology, though with high variability. Elevation has a moderate control on early season indicators such as snowmelt timing and green up and less on late-season variables such as senescence and growing season length. PCA results show that early season indicators and late season indicators vary independently. These results have important implications for ecosystem dynamics, management, and conservation, particularly of species such as whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) in alpine and subalpine areas.																	0020-7128	1432-1254				FEB	2018	62	2					273	285		10.1007/s00484-017-1449-3								WOS:000423319100013	28965255

Building essential biodiversity variables (EBVs) of species distribution and abundance at a global scale	BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS												Much biodiversity data is collected worldwide, but it remains challenging to assemble the scattered knowledge for assessing biodiversity status and trends. The concept of Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) was introduced to structure biodiversity monitoring globally, and to harmonize and standardize biodiversity data from disparate sources to capture a minimum set of critical variables required to study, report and manage biodiversity change. Here, we assess the challenges of a Big Data' approach to building global EBV data products across taxa and spatiotemporal scales, focusing on species distribution and abundance. The majority of currently available data on species distributions derives from incidentally reported observations or from surveys where presence-only or presence-absence data are sampled repeatedly with standardized protocols. Most abundance data come from opportunistic population counts or from population time series using standardized protocols (e.g. repeated surveys of the same population from single or multiple sites). Enormous complexity exists in integrating these heterogeneous, multi-source data sets across space, time, taxa and different sampling methods. Integration of such data into global EBV data products requires correcting biases introduced by imperfect detection and varying sampling effort, dealing with different spatial resolution and extents, harmonizing measurement units from different data sources or sampling methods, applying statistical tools and models for spatial inter- or extrapolation, and quantifying sources of uncertainty and errors in data and models. To support the development of EBVs by the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON), we identify 11 key workflow steps that will operationalize the process of building EBV data products within and across research infrastructures worldwide. These workflow steps take multiple sequential activities into account, including identification and aggregation of various raw data sources, data quality control, taxonomic name matching and statistical modelling of integrated data. We illustrate these steps with concrete examples from existing citizen science and professional monitoring projects, including eBird, the Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring network, the Living Planet Index and the Baltic Sea zooplankton monitoring. The identified workflow steps are applicable to both terrestrial and aquatic systems and a broad range of spatial, temporal and taxonomic scales. They depend on clear, findable and accessible metadata, and we provide an overview of current data and metadata standards. Several challenges remain to be solved for building global EBV data products: (i) developing tools and models for combining heterogeneous, multi-source data sets and filling data gaps in geographic, temporal and taxonomic coverage, (ii) integrating emerging methods and technologies for data collection such as citizen science, sensor networks, DNA-based techniques and satellite remote sensing, (iii) solving major technical issues related to data product structure, data storage, execution of workflows and the production process/cycle as well as approaching technical interoperability among research infrastructures, (iv) allowing semantic interoperability by developing and adopting standards and tools for capturing consistent data and metadata, and (v) ensuring legal interoperability by endorsing open data or data that are free from restrictions on use, modification and sharing. Addressing these challenges is critical for biodiversity research and for assessing progress towards conservation policy targets and sustainable development goals.

In this paper; we focused on the application of multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) technique for co-locating offshore wind farms and open-water mussel cultivation. An index of co-location sustainability (SI) was developed based on the application of MCE technique constructed with physical and biological parameters on the basis of remote sensing data. The relevant physical factors considered were wind velocity, depth range, concerning the site location for energy production, and sea surface temperature anomaly. The biological variables used were Chlorofill-a (as a measurement of the productivity) and Particle Organic Carbon (POC) concentration, in order to assess their influence on the probable benefits and complete the requirements of this management framework. This SI can be easily implemented to do a first order selection of the most promising areas to be more specifically studied in a second order approach based on local field data.

A conceptual market framework for water-bound nitrate pollution	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT												The conversion of bottomland hardwood and swamp forests to irrigated agriculture has had problematic consequences for water bodies. Many of these problems can be linked to the use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers to increase crop production. To date, there is little monitoring of nitrogen use in watersheds, which may be due to large fixed costs. Using market-based techniques which have addressed previous environmental challenges, with remotely sensed data to track a pollutant's source, may be one alternative, by incentivizing nitrogen users to behave according to abatement costs traced back to the point of origin of a pollutant.																	0790-0627	1360-0648					2018	34	2					213	228		10.1080/07900627.2017.1296349								WOS:000423851700006

An assessment of commonly employed satellite-based remote sensors for mapping mangrove species in Mexico using an NDVI-based classification scheme	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Optimizing the classification accuracy of a mangrove forest is of utmost importance for conservation practitioners. Mangrove forest mapping using satellite-based remote sensing techniques is by far the most common method of classification currently used given the logistical difficulties of field endeavors in these forested wetlands. However, there is now an abundance of options from which to choose in regards to satellite sensors, which has led to substantially different estimations of mangrove forest location and extent with particular concern for degraded systems. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of mangrove forest classification using different remotely sensed data sources (i.e., Landsat-8, SPOT-5, Sentinel-2, and WorldView-2) for a system located along the Pacific coast of Mexico. Specifically, we examined a stressed semiarid mangrove forest which offers a variety of conditions such as dead areas, degraded stands, healthy mangroves, and very dense mangrove island formations. The results indicated that Landsat-8 (30 m per pixel) had the lowest overall accuracy at 64% and that WorldView-2 (1.6 m per pixel) had the highest at 93%. Moreover, the SPOT-5 and the Sentinel-2 classifications (10 m per pixel) were very similar having accuracies of 75 and 78%, respectively. In comparison to WorldView-2, the other sensors overestimated the extent of Laguncularia racemosa and underestimated the extent of Rhizophora mangle. When considering such type of sensors, the higher spatial resolution can be particularly important in mapping small mangrove islands that often occur in degraded mangrove systems.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JAN	2018	190	1							23	10.1007/s10661-017-6399-z								WOS:000422680800032

Combining Remote Sensing and Field Mapping Methods to Study the Vegetation Dynamics within a Coastal Wetland and Determine the Habitat Effects of a Threatened Bird Species (Emberiza schoeniclus witherbyi)	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Coastal wetlands are highly dynamic changing ecosystems because of the effects of meteorology, wildlife interactions and human activities. They are one of the world's most threatened ecosystems, and threats to them drive the most specialist species to unfavorable conservation status and population trends. Therefore, it is important to frequently monitor the coverage changes of the different vegetation types to understand these species' population dynamics. However, frequent and detailed cartography entails costly efforts. Here, satellite images with field mapping were combined to create vegetation classification maps for past years from SPOT-5 images in the Pego-Oliva coastal wetland (Spain) and obtained classification accuracies above 85%. Together with habitat selection models, this information was used to understand the changes in the habitat of a threatened bird species, the Eastern Iberian reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus witherbyi), whose population has sharply declined in recent decades in Spain. A statistically significant reduction in reed-rush patches (positively selected habitat) and an increase in homogeneous reed patches (negatively selected habitat) were observed in those areas where the species disappeared as breeders. This study shows the potential of remote sensing and GIS techniques for the a posteriori monitoring of variation in the habitats available for threatened species to set up management and conservation measures.

J	Ali, G; Pumijumnong, N; Cui, SH				Ali, Ghaffar; Pumijumnong, Nathsuda; Cui, Shenghui			Valuation and validation of carbon sources and sinks through land cover/use change analysis: The case of Bangkok metropolitan area	LAND USE POLICY												This study investigates carbon sources and carbon sink estimation, nexus and validation through Land cover/land use (LCLU) change analysis of Bangkok Metropolitan Area (BMA), Thailand. Considering spiking population and carbon emission trends, especially in metropolitan cities of developing countries, such estimations are direly needed. Moreover, quantification and empirical evidence involving such a multidisciplinary analysis are rarely available. Therefore, this study would help in understanding the relationship among economic development, carbon emissions, carbon sinks and land use change in BMA. CO2 emission and sequestration data from 1987 to 2015 were collected, and the changes and rate of change in LCLU were assessed by analyzing landsat satellite images of 1987, 1995, 2005, and 2015. Best efforts were put to attain net gains and losses in carbon sources and sinks analyses. Results showed that carbon sources have increased by almost 4-folds from 1987 to 2015 while sinks have declined rapidly to half of its original amount since 1987. The gap between carbon sources and sinks is widening year by year and will, if it continues in this manner cover up the whole green space of BMA in the next decade. The LCLU change results also verified and showed the same results, which helped in validating such outcomes. Urban/built up area sprawl over 60% of BMA's area while the remaining 40% constitutes agricultural land, green spaces, and water bodies. Furthermore, the rate of change of urban area was 157.4 sq km during 2005-2015 and 218 sq km during 1995-2005. Therefore, policy makers of BMA should seriously draft expansion plans of green spaces and public parks and implement it immediately to tackle with carbon emissions and land use change disquiets. Meanwhile, awareness regarding conservation of green areas, trees, and use of public transport could be another set of bottom-up policies.																	0264-8377	1873-5754				JAN	2018	70						471	478		10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.11.003								WOS:000419416600045

Quantifying apart what belongs together: A multi-state species distribution modelling framework for species using distinct habitats	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Species distribution models (SDMs) have been used to inform scientists and conservationists about the status and change in occurrence patterns in threatened species. Many mobile species use multiple functionally distinct habitats, and cannot occupy one habitat type without the other being within a reachable distance. For such species, classical applications of SDMs might lead to erroneous representations of habitat suitability, as the complex relationships between predictors are lost when merging occurrence information across multiple habitats. To better account for the spatial arrangement of complementaryyet mandatoryhabitat types, it is important to implement modelling strategies that partition occurrence information according to habitat use in a spatial context. Here, we address this issue by introducing a multi-state SDM framework. The multi-state SDM framework stratifies occurrences according to the temporal or behavioural use of distinct habitat types, referred to as states. Multiple SDMs are then run for each state and statistical thresholds of presence are used to combine these separate predictions. To identify suitable sites that account for distance between habitats, two optional modules are proposed where the thresholded output is aggregated and filtered by minimum area size, or through moving windows across maximum reachable distances. We illustrate the full use of this framework by modelling the dynamic terrestrial breeding habitat preferences of the New Zealand sea lion (NZSL) (Phocarctos hookeri), using Maxent and trialling both modules to identify suitable sites for possible recolonization. The Maxent predictions showed excellent performance, and the multi-state SDM framework highlighted 36-77 potential suitable breeding sites in the study area. This framework can be applied to inform management when defining habitat suitability for species with complex changes in habitat use. It accounts for temporal and behavioural changes in distribution, maintains the individuality of each partitioned SDM, and considers distance between distinct habitat types. It also yields one final, easy-to-understand output for stakeholders and managers.

J	Luo, JM; Shen, YJ; Qi, YQ; Zhang, YC; Xiao, DP				Luo, Jianmei; Shen, Yanjun; Qi, Yongqing; Zhang, Yucui; Xiao, Dengpan			Evaluating water conservation effects due to cropping system optimization on the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei plain, China	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS												Irrigation of the conventional double cropping system of winter wheat and summer maize has caused serious problems regarding water resources and the environment on the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei plain (HP), China. Reducing or replacing high water consumption crops (such as winter wheat) is the most impactful way to effectively save water in the HP region. In this study, crop coefficient and vegetation remote sensing data were used to estimate evapotranspiration (ETa for winter wheat and summer maize on the HP from 2009 to 2013. For early maize, ETa and yield were based on the results from the APSIM (Agricultural Production System Simulator) crop model, which had been calibrated and validated using field experimental data. The effects on groundwater conservation and grain yield were estimated at the regional scale for the conventional winter wheat (WW) and summer maize (SM) double cropping system (Y1M2) and three alternative cropping systems: three harvests in two years system (Y2M3, 1st year: WW-SM; 2nd year: early maize), four harvests in three years system (Y3M4, 1st year: WW-SM; the next two years: early maize), as well as a continuous early maize monoculture system (Y1M1). The results showed that: (1) Relative to YiM(2), the water savings in each alternative cropping system exceeded 50% of the groundwater overdraft on the HP. The evapotranspiration of Y2M3, Y3M4 and Y1M1 decreased by 14%, 19% and 29% over that of Y1M2 (740 mm), respectively. The economic water use efficiencies (WUEe) of the alternative cropping systems were 7%-16% greater than that of Y1M2. The groundwater drop by Y1M2 (0.59 m year(-1)) was higher than that by Y2M3 (0.20 m year(-1)) and Y3M4 (0.07 m year(-1)), and the drop by Y1M1 was negative, indicating a groundwater rise of 0.20 m. The groundwater overdraft in Y1M2 was 160 mm (3.83 billion m(3)), and the alternative cropping systems were more sustainable, with groundwater overdrafts that were less than the recharge value of 128 nun on the HP. (2) In comparison with Y1M2, the total yield was reduced by 2.28, 3.04 and 4.56 billion kg a(-1) (or 7.7%, 10.2% and 15.3%) for Y2M3, Y3M4 and Y1M1, respectively, which accounted for < 15% of the regional total or < 1% of the national total. It is important to note that the yield loss of the alternative cropping systems was below the net grain export amount in Hebei province, so the grain supply and demand could be roughly balanced. (3) In summary, Y2M3 is a preferred alternative cropping system over Y1M2 in the near future because of the advantages of high WUEe, economic return, mitigated groundwater level decline and balance between wheat supply and demand on the HP. Y1M1, which had the least water use and highest WUEe and economic return, is an option for the most serious groundwater overdraft area despite a contradiction between the traditional dietary habit and complete abandonment of wheat. Y3M4 is recommended as the transitional cropping system between Y2M3 and Y1M1. The method in this study is applicable to relevant regional research, and the results can be of use to the government when formulating policies on cropping systems and groundwater management.																	0308-521X	1873-2267				JAN	2018	159						32	41		10.1016/j.agsy.2017.10.002								WOS:000419415700004

Krishna			Quantifying nationwide land cover and historical changes in forests of Nepal (1930-2014): implications on forest fragmentation	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												This study quantifies the nationwide land cover and long-term changes in forests and its implications on forest fragmentation in Nepal. The multi-source datasets were used to generate the forest cover information for 1930, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2014. This study analyzes distribution of land cover, rate of deforestation, changes across forest types, forest canopy density and pattern of fragmentation. The land cover legend for 2014 is consisting of 21 classes: tropical dry deciduous sal forest, tropical moist deciduous sal forest, subtropical broad-leaved forest, subtropical pine forest, lower temperate broad leaved forest, upper temperate broad leaved forest, lower temperate mixed broad leaved forest, upper temperate mixed broad leaved forest, temperate needle leaved forest, subalpine forest, plantations, tropical scrub, subtropical scrub, temperate scrub, alpine scrub, grassland, agriculture, water bodies, barren land and settlements. The forest cover statistics for Nepal obtained in this study shows an area of 76,710 km(2) in 1930 which has decreased to 39,392 km(2) in 2014. A net loss of 37,318 km(2) (48.6%) was observed in last eight decades. Analysis of annual rate of net deforestation for the recent period indicates 0.01% during 2005-2014. An increase in the number of forest patches from 6925 (in 1930) to 42,961 (in 2014) was noticed. The significant observation is 75.5% of reduction in core 3 forest, whereas, patch, perforated and edge classes show the increase in percentage of fragmentation classes from 1930 to 2014. The results of this work will support the understanding of deforestation and its consequences on fragmentation for maintaining and improving the forest resources of Nepal.																	0960-3115	1572-9710				JAN	2018	27	1					91	107		10.1007/s10531-017-1423-8								WOS:000419149800005						
J	Vermeulen, F; Pince, P; Weekers, L; De Dapper, M				Vermeulen, Frank; Pince, Possum; Weekers, Lara; De Dapper, Morgan			Geoarchaeological study of abandoned Roman urban and suburban contexts from central Adriatic Italy	GEOARCHAEOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL												Over the past 15 years the Potenza Valley Survey project investigated Iron Age to Medieval settlement dynamics in the Central Adriatic Potenza Valley. Part of this research focuses on the Roman abandoned towns of Potentia and Trea by performing an integrated geoarchaeological study of their townscape. This largely noninvasive research consists of remote sensing analysis, geophysical surveys (magnetometry, electrical resistivity, and ground-penetrating radar), and geomorphological fieldwork such as microtopographic measurements and hand augering. The chosen techniques depend on the nature of each town and are integrated with more traditionally achieved research data. This paper presents the main interdisciplinary results of work on these two Roman towns and highlights the importance of obtaining complementary data and performing hand augering as a stratigraphic control of the remote sensing and geophysical results. Insights into the character and layout of the cities, the structural influence on the surrounding area, and the human-environment interactions and dynamics through time of both Roman cities could be achieved. Moreover, the results offer guidelines for conservation strategies of these abandoned towns and their suburbium, which are necessary to protect them from present-day threats such as agriculture and tourism. In this way the paper offers an insight in the tremendous potential of well-integrated geoarchaeological investigations of partly or fully abandoned urban contexts in the Mediterranean area and beyond.																	0883-6353	1520-6548				JAN-FEB	2018	33	1			SI		85	99		10.1002/gea.21642								WOS:000418403300007

C.			Relationships between forest cover and fish diversity in the Amazon River floodplain	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Habitat degradation leads to biodiversity loss and concomitant changes in ecosystem processes. Tropical river floodplains are highly threatened by land cover changes and support high biodiversity and important ecosystem services, but the extent to which changes in floodplain land cover affect fish biodiversity remains unknown. 2. We combined fish and environmental data collected in situ and satellite-mapped landscape features to evaluate how fish species with different ecological strategies and assemblage structures respond to deforestation in floodplains of the Amazon River. We surveyed 462 floodplain habitats distributed along a gradient of land cover, from largely forested to severely deforested. Rather than analyse only taxonomic metrics, we employed an integrative approach that simultaneously considers different aspects of fish biodiversity (i.e. beta diversity and taxonomic and functional assemblage structure) to facilitate mechanistic interpretations of the influence of land cover. 3. Spatial patterns of fish biodiversity in the Amazon River floodplain were strongly associated with forest cover as well as local environmental conditions linked to landscape gradients. Several species and functional groups defined by life-history, feeding, swimming/microhabitat-use strategies were positively associated with forest cover. Other species, including some that would usually be considered habitat generalists and species directly dependent on autochthonous resources (e.g. planktivores), were most common in areas dominated by herbaceous vegetation or open water habitats associated with the opposite extreme of the forest cover gradient. beta diversity and the degree of uniqueness of species combinations within habitats were also positively associated with forest cover. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrating that spatial patterns of fish biodiversity are associated with forest cover, indicate that deforestation of floodplains of the Amazon River results in spatial homogenization of fish assemblages and reduced functional diversity at both local and regional scales. Floodplains world-wide have undergone major land cover changes, with forest loss projected to increase during the next decades. Conserving fish diversity in these ecosystems requires protecting mosaics of both aquatic habitats and floodplain vegetation, with sufficient forest cover being critically important.

Throughout Namibia, four vegetation change processes are widespread, namely, deforestation, woodland degradation, the encroachment of the herbaceous and grassy layers by woody strata (woody thickening), and woodland regrowth. All of these vegetation change processes affect a range of key ecosystem services, yet their spatial and temporal dynamics and contributions to AGB change remain poorly understood. This study quantifies AGB associated with the different vegetation change processes over an 8-year period, for a region of Kalahari woodland savannah in northern Namibia. Using data from 101 forest inventory plots collected during two field campaigns (2014-2015), we model AGB as a function of the Advanced Land Observing Satellite Phased Array L-band synthetic aperture radar (PALSAR and PALSAR-2) and dry season Landsat vegetation index composites, for two periods (2007 and 2015). Differences in AGB between 2007 and 2015 were assessed and validated using independent data, and changes in AGB for the main vegetation processes are quantified for the whole study area (75,501km(2)). We find that woodland degradation and woody thickening contributed a change in AGB of -14.3 and 2.5 Tg over 14% and 3.5% of the study area, respectively. Deforestation and regrowth contributed a smaller portion of AGB change, i.e. -1.9 and 0.2 Tg over 1.3% and 0.2% of the study area, respectively.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2018	39	2					577	606		10.1080/01431161.2017.1390271								WOS:000416848600016						
J	Marcinkowski, P; Grabowski, RC; Okruszko, T				Marcinkowski, Pawel; Grabowski, Robert C.; Okruszko, Tomasz			Controls on anastomosis in lowland river systems: Towards process-based solutions to habitat conservation	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Anastomosing rivers were historically common around the world before extensive agricultural and industrial development in river valleys. Few lowland anastomosing rivers remain in temperate zones, and the protection of these river-floodplain systems is an international conservation priority. However, the mechanisms that drive the creation and maintenance of multiple channels, i.e. anabranches, are not well understood, particularly for lowland rivers, making it challenging to identify effective management strategies. This study uses a novel multi-scale, process-based hydro-geomorphological approach to investigate the natural and anthropogenic controls on anastomosis in lowland river reaches. Using a wide range of data (hydrologic, cartographic, remote-sensing, historical), the study (i) quantifies changes in the planform of the River Narew, Poland over the last 100 years, (ii) documents changes in the natural and anthropogenic factors that could be driving the geomorphic change, and (iii) develops a conceptual model of the controls of anastomosis. The results show that 110 km of anabranches have been lost from the Narew National Park (6810 ha), a 42% reduction in total anabranch length since 1900. The rates of anabranch loss have increased as the number of pressures inhibiting anabranch creation and maintenance has multiplied. The cessation of localized water level and channel management (fishing dams, water mills and timber rafting), the loss of traditional floodplain activities (seasonal mowing) and infrastructure construction (embanked roads and an upstream dam) are contributing to low water levels and flows, the deposition of sediment at anabranch inlets, the encroachment of common reed (Phragmites australis), and the eventual loss of anabranches. By identifying the processes driving the loss of anabranches, this study provides transferable insights into the controls of anastomosis in lowland rivers and the management solutions needed to preserve the unique anastomosing river pattern and diverse wet grasslands that are central to the conservation value of lowland floodplains.

Evaluating the effectiveness of conservation and development investments in reducing deforestation and fires in Ankeniheny-Zahemena Corridor, Madagascar	PLOS ONE												Forest conservation and REDD+ projects invest millions of dollars each year to reduce local communities' dependence on forests and prevent forest loss and degradation. However, to date, there is limited evidence on whether these investments are effective at delivering conservation outcomes. We explored the relationships between 600+ small-scale conservation and development investments that occurred from 2007 to 2014 and conservation outcomes (deforestation rates and fire detections) within Ankeniheny-Zahamena Corridor in Madagascar using linear fixed effects panel regressions. We derived annual changes in forest cover and fires from satellite remote sensing. We found a statistically significant correlation between presence of any investment and reduced deforestation rates in 2010 and 2011 +/- years with accelerated deforestation elsewhere in the study area. This result indicated investments abated deforestation rates during times of political instability and lack of governance following a 2009 coup in Madagascar. We also found a statistically significant relationship between presence of any investment and reduced fire detections in the study area, suggesting investments had an impact on reducing burning of forest for agriculture. For both outcomes (i.e., deforestation rates and fire detections), we found that more dollars invested led to greater conservation outcomes (i.e. fewer fires or less deforestation), particularly when funding was sustained for one to two years. Our findings suggest that conservation and development investments can reduce deforestation and fire incidence, but also highlight the many challenges and complexities in assessing relationships between investments and conservation outcomes in a dynamic landscape and a volatile political context.																	1932-6203					DEC 21	2017	12	12							e0190119	10.1371/journal.pone.0190119								WOS:000418587400094	29267356					
J	Shapero, M; Dronova, I; Macaulay, L				Shapero, Matthew; Dronova, Iryna; Macaulay, Luke			Implications of changing spatial dynamics of irrigated pasture, California's third largest agricultural water use	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Irrigated agriculture is practiced on 680 million acres worldwide. Irrigated grazing land is likely a significant portion of that area but estimating an accurate figure has remained problematic. Due to its significant contribution to agricultural water use worldwide, we develop a methodology to remotely sense irrigated pasture using a California case study. Irrigated pasture is the third largest agriculturalwater use in California, yet its economic returns are low. As pressures mount for the agricultural sector to be more water efficient and for water to be directed towards its most economically valuable uses, there will likely be a reduction in irrigated pasture acreage. A first step in understanding the importance of irrigated pasture in California is establishing a methodology to quantify baseline information about its area, location, and current rate of loss. This study used a novel object-based image analysis and supervised classification on publicly-available, high resolution, remote sensing National Agriculture Imaging Program (NAIP) imagery to develop a highly accurate map of irrigated pasture in a rural county in California's Sierra foothills. Irrigated pasture was found to have decreased by 19% during the ten-year period, 2005-2014, from 4,273 to 3,470 acres. The implications of this loss include potential impacts to wetland-dependent species, groundwater recharge, game species, traditional ranching culture, livestock production, and land conservation. Overall accuracy in classification across years was consistently over 89%. Comparing these results against available measurements of irrigated pasture provided by state and federal agencies reveals that this method significantly improves upon existing metrics and methods of data collection and points to critical needs for new targeted research and monitoring efforts. Broadly, the analysis presented here provides an improved methodology for mapping irrigated pasture that can be extended to provide accurate and spatially-explicit data for other counties in California and other arid and semi-arid regions worldwide.

SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Hydrological variability over seasonal and multi-annual timescales strongly shapes the ecological structure and functioning of floodplain ecosystems. The current IPCC climate scenario foresees an increase in the frequency of extreme events. This, in conjunction with other anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., river regulation or land-use changes) poses a serious threat to the natural functioning of these ecosystems. In this study we aimed to i) evaluate the long-term variability of the flooded area of the third largest floodplain lake in the Brazilian Pantanal using remote sensing techniques, and ii) analyze the possible factors influencing this variability. Changes in open-water and riparian floodplain-wetland vegetation areas were mapped by applying an ad hoc-developed remote-sensing method (including a newly developed normalized water index, NWI) to 221 Landsat-Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images, acquired between 1984 and 2011. Added to the lake's natural swing between riparian floodplain-wetland vegetation expansion and retraction, our analyses revealed large interannual changes, grouped into three main periods within the studied time interval. Moreover, our results indicate that this floodplain-lake system is losing open-water area, paired with an increase in riparian flood-plain- wetland vegetation. The system's long-term dynamics are not all climate related, but are the result of a combination of drivers. The start of the Manso dam's operation upstream of the studied system, and the subsequent river regulation because of the dam operation, coupled with climatic oscillation appear to be responsible for the observed changes. However, other factors which were not considered in this study might also be important in this process and contributing to the reduction of the system's resilience to droughts (e.g., land-use changes). This study illustrates the serious conservation risks that the Pantanal faces in the near future, given the current climate-change scenario and the accumulation of dam building projects in this region.

Here we present an unprecedentedly high resolution (250 x 250 m) global potential soil erosion model, using a combination of remote sensing, GIS modelling and census data. We challenge the previous annual soil erosion reference values as our estimate, of 35.9 Pg yr(-1) of soil eroded in 2012, is at least two times lower. Moreover, we estimate the spatial and temporal effects of land use change between 2001 and 2012 and the potential offset of the global application of conservation practices. Our findings indicate a potential overall increase in global soil erosion driven by cropland expansion. The greatest increases are predicted to occur in Sub-Saharan Africa, South America and Southeast Asia. The least developed economies have been found to experience the highest estimates of soil erosion rates.

This paper analyzes the dynamic transitions among identified land use and land cover (LULC) types in the Bosomtwe district of Ghana, from 1986 to 2014. An integrated approach of geo-information tools of satellite remote sensing in Earth Resource Data Analysis System (ERDAS) Imagine 13 and ArcMap 10.2 Geographic Information System (GIS), with Markov chain analytical techniques were used to examine the combined forest land cover transitions, relative to build-up, recent fallows and grasslands and projected possible factors influencing the transitions under business as usual and unusual situations. Statistical analyses of the classified Landsat TM, ETM+ and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIS) indicated that over the period of 24 years, the Bosomtwe district has undergone a series of land use conversions with remarkable forest losses especially between 2002 and 2010. In 2010 dense forest cover was degraded to low forest by 4040 ha indicating 0.40% transition probability in the future. There was a remarkable increase of built-up/bare and concrete area with a 380% increment in the 1986-2002 transition periods. The application of the Markov futuristic land use dynamics by the years 2018 and 2028, projected from the 2014 LULC indicated a future steady decline in the area coverage of the dense forest to low forest category. This is currently being driven (as at the 2017 LULC trends), by the combined effects of increasing build up bare and concrete surface land uses as well as the expanding recent fallows and grassland. The paper concluded that the health of the ecosystem and biodiversity of the lake Bosomtwe need to be sustainably managed by the Bosomtwe district assembly.																	2076-3263					DEC	2017	7	4							UNSP 125	10.3390/geosciences7040125								WOS:000419192500034

Taking the Loess Plateau of China as an example, a regionalization method and corresponding scheme were proposed to select suitable vegetation types (forested lands, woody grasslands/bushlands, grasslands, or xerophytic shrublands and semi-shrublands) for a given location using remote sensing technology in order to analyze the vegetation growth status before and after the largest ecological conservation project in the country: The Grain for Green Program (GTGP). To design the scheme, remote sensing data covering the periods before and after the implementation of the GTGP (the 1980s and 2001-2013) were collected, along with soil, meteorological, and topographic data. The net primary production (NPP) values for 2001-2013 were calculated using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model. Locations representing the native vegetation and the restored vegetation were first recognized using maps of vegetation cover. Then, for the restored vegetation area, the places suitable for planting the covered vegetation type were selected by comparing the NPP value of the corresponding vegetation type in the native vegetation area to the NPP value in the site under consideration. Third, half of these sites were uniformly selected based on their NPP value, and these areas and the native vegetation area were used as training regions. Based on weather, soil, and topographic data, a new regionalization scheme was designed using standardized Euclidean distances. Finally, data from the remainder of the Loess Plateau were used to validate the new regionalization scheme, which was also compared to an existing Chinese eco-geographical regionalization scheme. The results showed that the new regionalization scheme performed well, with an average potential classification accuracy of 81.81%. Compared with the eco-geographical regionalization scheme, the new scheme exhibited improved the consistency of vegetation dynamics, reflecting the potential to better guide vegetation restoration activities on the Loess Plateau.																	2072-4292					DEC	2017	9	12							1323	10.3390/rs9121323								WOS:000419235700118

Developing such maps has been traditionally performed using Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) methods, which usually reach good accuracies, but require a high human supervision and the best configuration for one image often cannot be extrapolated to a different image. Recently, deep learning Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown outstanding results in object recognition in computer vision and are offering promising results in land cover mapping. This paper analyzes the potential of CNN-based methods for detection of plant species of conservation concern using free high-resolution Google Earth (TM) images and provides an objective comparison with the state-of-the-art OBIA-methods. We consider as case study the detection of Ziziphus lotus shrubs, which are protected as a priority habitat under the European Union Habitats Directive. Compared to the best performing OBIA-method, the best CNN-detector achieved up to 12% better precision, up to 30% better recall and up to 20% better balance between precision and recall. Besides, the knowledge that CNNs acquired in the first image can be re-utilized in other regions, which makes the detection process very fast. A natural conclusion of this work is that including CNN-models as classifiers, e.g., ResNet-classifier, could further improve OBIA methods. The provided methodology can be systematically reproduced for other species detection using our codes available through (https://github.com/EGuirado/CNN-remotesensing).

Most previous studies on channel habitat units have focused on midlatitude rivers, which differ in several substantive ways from tropical rivers. Field delineation of channel habitat units is especially challenging in tropical rivers, many of which are remote and difficult to access. Here, we developed an approach for delineating channel habitat units based on a combination of field measurements, remote sensing, and hydraulic modeling, and applied it to a 4.1-km segment of the Bladen River in southern Belize. We found that the most prevalent channel habitat unit on the study segment was runs, followed by pools and riffles. Average spacing of channel habitat units was up to twice as high on the study segment than the typical values reported for midlatitude rivers, possibly because of high erosion rates in the tropical environment. The approach developed here can be applied to other rivers to build understanding of the controls on and spatial distribution of channel habitat units on tropical rivers and to support river management and conservation goals.

Morphometric characteristics are the viable entity to understand the hydrological behavior of the subwatershed. For prioritization of subwatershed, morphometric analysis was utilized by using the linear, areal, and relief aspects of the drainage basin. In this context, remote sensing and GIS has been proved to be an efficient tool to identify the morphological features. The Survey of India (SOI) topographical maps, satellite data IRS-LISS III, and Cartosat DEM data were utilized to understand the drainage pattern and also for prioritization of subwatershed areas. The prioritization of subwatershed has been attempted using novel and quantitative approaches based on compound parameter ranking for soil erosion. Lower compound factors were chosen as the most feasible for soil erosion. Based on the observation, eight subwatersheds with a higher degree of the slope were severely prone to soil erosion and remaining 21 subwatersheds occur in low-lying areas that can be developed as sustainable watersheds. The identified subwatershed requires immediate soil remediation and water conservation measures for efficient watershed planning and management. The proposed study might be helpful for resource planners, government agencies. private sectors, and other stake holders to take up soil conservation measures and fixation of water-harvesting structures for better decision making.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				DEC	2017	10	24							552	10.1007/s12517-017-3312-6								WOS:000419041400024

Linear models, constructed with field and satellite data, with high coefficients of determination for CGC (R-2 = 0.81, R-2 = 0.81 and R-2 = 0.72) and grass height (R-2 = 0.82, R-2 = 0.79 and R-2 = 0.73) were obtained. The maps showed a good level of CGC (>25%) and grass height (>25 cm), except for the year 2009, which presented the lowest values of grass height in the area. According to the Kappa Index, a moderate concordance among the three CGC maps was presented (0.49-0.59). Conversely, weak and moderate concordances were found among the grass height maps (0.36-0.59). It was observed that areas with a high CGC do not necessarily correspond to areas with greater grass height values. Based on the data analyzed in this study, the grassland areas are highly dynamic, structurally heterogeneous and the spatial distribution of the variables does not show a definite pattern. From the information generated, it is possible to determine those areas that are the most important for monitoring to then establish effective strategies for the conservation of these grasslands and the protection of threatened migratory bird species.																	2073-445X					DEC	2017	6	4							70	10.3390/land6040070								WOS:000419224200005

Collaborative Research on the Ecology and Management of the 'Wulo' Monsoon Rainforest in Wunambal Gaambera Country, North Kimberley, Australia	LAND												Indigenous groups are increasingly combining traditional ecological knowledge and Western scientific approaches to inform the management of their lands. We report the outcomes of a collaborative research project focused on key ecological questions associated with monsoon vine thickets in Wunambal Gaambera country (Kimberley region, Western Australia). The study mapped monsoon rainforests and analysed the environmental correlates of their current distribution, as well as the historical drivers of patch dynamics since 1949. Remote sensing was used to chart the effectiveness of an intervention designed to re-instate Aboriginal fire regimes according to customary principles. We identified the most vulnerable patches based on size, distance from neighbouring patches, and fire frequency. More than 6000 rainforest patches were mapped. Most were small (<1 ha), occurring predominantly on nutrient-rich substrates (e.g., basalt) and fire-sheltered topographic settings (e.g., slopes and valleys). Rainforests with low fire frequency and no cattle were more likely to expand into surrounding long-unburnt savannas. Frequent fires and cattle did not cause substantial contraction, although the latter affected rainforest understories through trampling. Fire management performed by Aboriginal rangers effectively shifted fire regimes from high-intensity late dry season fires to early dry season fires, particularly in areas with clusters of vulnerable rainforests. The remote sensing methods developed in this project are applicable to the long-term monitoring of rainforest patches on Aboriginal-managed land in North Kimberley, providing tools to evaluate the impacts of fire management, feral animal control, and climate change. The study confirmed the importance of the cattle-free and rarely burnt Bougainville Peninsula as one of the most important rainforest areas in Western Australia.

This is because properties, for example clay content, determine the ability of soil to hold cations and retain water. However, data acquisition is labour intensive and time-consuming. To add value to the limited soil data, remote sensing (e.g. airborne gamma-ray spectrometry) and proximal sensing, such as electromagnetic (EM) induction, are being used as ancillary data. Here, we provide examples of developing Digital Soil Maps (DSM) of soil physical, chemical and hydrological properties, for seven cotton-growing areas of southeastern Australia, by coupling soil data with remote and proximal sensed ancillary data. A greater challenge is how to get these DSM to a stakeholder in a way that is useful for practical soil use and management. This study describes how we facilitate access to the DSMs, using a simple-to-use web GIS platform, called terraGIS. The platform is underpinned by Google Maps API, which is an open-source development environment for building spatially enabled Internet applications. In conclusion, we consider that terraGIS and the supporting information, available on the sister web page (), allow easy access to explanation of DSM of soil properties, which are relevant to cotton growers, farm managers, consultants, extension staff, researchers, state and federal government agency personnel and policy analysts. Future work should be aimed at developing error budget maps to identify where additional soil and/or ancillary data is required to improve the accuracy of the DSMs.					Triantafilis, john/0000-0003-1561-0242												0266-0032	1475-2743				DEC	2017	33	4					568	582		10.1111/sum.12383								WOS:000418422500006

Krishna			Sustainable Biodiversity Management in India: Remote Sensing Perspective	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES												Remote sensing, a state of art technology has gained significance due to its capability to map and monitor compositional, structural and functional biodiversity. Remote sensing data provides a perspective on how ecosystems and species are being affected by the multiple disturbances. This paper presents consolidated information of earth observation based biodiversity research and conservation applications in India. Progress achieved for understanding essential biodiversity variables with reference to species populations, species traits, community composition, ecosystem function and ecosystem structure have been reviewed. Studies mostly focused on remote sensing based biodiversity indicators in understanding of land cover, forest cover, forest type, fragmentation, biological richness, carbon stocks, fires and protected area monitoring at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Fine resolution understanding with reference to vegetation structure, function, distribution of threatened, endemic and invasive species is required for effective conservation strategies. The declining trend of deforestation and effectiveness of protected area network indicates India's commitment towards the global conservation targets. Ensured continuity of remote sensing can support in near real monitoring of habitats and achieving conservation effectiveness.																	0369-8203	2250-1762				DEC	2017	87	4					617	627		10.1007/s40010-017-0438-6								WOS:000418819200011

The congruence between plant and animal biological richness (BR) was studied by extending the scope of methodology from past studies in order to understand the question; does higher plant richness encourages higher animal richness? Using satellite images, 16 forest vegetation classes to integrate BR attributes for 85 plants and 271 animal species were derived. Plant BR analysis linked six biodiversity attributes (i.e., spatial, phytosociological, social, physical, economic and ecological) together based on their relative importance. The information of four terrestrial animal taxa (i.e., mammal, bird, reptile and amphibian) from various resources was utilized over five surrogates of biological richness (habitat suitability, spatial heterogeneity, eco-climatic stability, plant structural properties, and forage). A methodological basis of spatial enumeration of animal richness was provided in one of the most biologically rich landscapes of India, forming part of Indian Gangetic plains. It was observed that positive congruence between BR of plant and animal with a spatial overlap of 82.23% for the inclusive BR. Significant positive correlation (R-2 : 0.7) was observed for high BR values (7-9) of animal and plant. Authors believe the strengths of our study are (i) translation of animal characterization onto a spatial map, (ii) collection and utilization of scattered data of animals from varied resources for Indian region where proper documentation is lacking (iii) generation of an inclusive BR map having higher conservation potential, and (iv) creation of a database having retrieval and future modification capability. This methodology has the potential for inclusive plant and animal biological richness for effective conservation implications with more site-specific data of a wider range of animals.																	0369-8203	2250-1762				DEC	2017	87	4					911	925		10.1007/s40010-017-0459-1								WOS:000418819200033

Several approaches used for DRP-mapping vary in relation to data and time requirement. Manual approaches which are based on field investigation and expert knowledge are time demanding and difficult to implement at regional scale. Automatic GIS-based approach on the other hand require simplification of data but is easier to implement and it is applicable on a regional scale. In this study, GIS-based automated approach was used to identify the DRPs in Anambra area. The result showed that Hortonian overland flow (HOF) has the highest coverage of 1508.3 km(2) (33.5%) followed by deep percolation (DP) with coverage of 1455.3 km(2) (32.3%). Subsurface flow (SSF) is the third dominant runoff process covering 920.6 km(2) (20.4%) while saturated overland flow (SOF) covers the least area of 618.4 km(2) (13.7%) of the study area. The result reveal that considerable amount of precipitated water would be infiltrated into the subsurface through deep percolation process contributing to groundwater recharge in the study area. However, it is envisaged that HOF and SOF will continue to increase due to the continuous expansion of built-up area. With the expected increase in HOF and SOF, and the change in rainfall pattern associated with perpetual problem of climate change, it is paramount that groundwater conservation practices should be considered to ensure continued sustainable utilization of groundwater in the study area.																	2084-5707	2299-8179				DEC	2017	6	2					80	93		10.1515/ctg-2017-0007								WOS:000418559200002

Remote sensing for restoration planning: how the big picture can inform stakeholders	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												The use of remote sensing in ecosystem management has transformed how land managers, practitioners, and policymakers evaluate ecosystem loss, gain, and change at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Less developed is the use of these spatial tools for planning, implementing, and evaluating ecosystem restoration projects and especially so in multifunctional landscapes. We use a case study approach in a multistakeholder tropical dryland restoration project to highlight the potential of remotely sensed products to quantitatively and economically guide often conflicting restoration priorities with stakeholder objectives. High-resolution digital elevation models derived from an airborne remote sensing platform informed land managers tasked with endangered species restoration by guiding their efforts to highly suitable areas of the landscape where plant growth, performance, and survival should be greater. In turn, satellite-based monitoring offered a temporal approach to broadly quantify vegetation fire risk in order to restrict fire promoting activities in dry landscapes most modified by fire promoting invasive grasses. Together, the delineation of high suitability areas for plant-based restoration and low suitability areas for wildfire management ultimately releases moderate suitability land for alternative land uses deemed important in multistakeholder landscapes. We review the benefits of using remotely sensed data for restoration planning, and highlight the costs and benefits of various data sources.																	1061-2971	1526-100X				DEC	2017	25			2	SI		S147	S154		10.1111/rec.12448								WOS:000418248100005

Mapping coral reef environments: A review of historical methods, recent advances and future opportunities	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Coral reef environments support high levels of marine biodiversity, they are important sites for coastal habitation and they provide a range of goods and ecosystem services such as nearshore fisheries, economic revenue from tourism and breeding sites for seabirds and turtles. Mapping is a fundamental activity that underpins our understanding of coral reef environments and helps to shape policies in resource management and conservation. This is particularly the case for quantifying the area of landcover types associated with reef environments, including coral patches, seagrasses and mangroves, but also for monitoring how these change over time and modelling how spatial patterns apparent on reefs are related to environmental drivers. Field techniques and aerial photography have historically played a crucial role in mapping coral reef environments, which has recently seen a transition toward the processing of satellite remote sensing images. This paper examines a series of maps produced of Low Isles, the most mapped island on the Great Barrier Reef, to review historical methods for mapping coral reefs because of the critical importance of understanding how past maps were made, which determines appropriate uses to which they can be put. Recent advances and future opportunities for the application of mapping technologies to coral reefs are also evaluated, including the use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms for airborne surveys, delivery of information through web-based platforms and improvements in the quality of information for making and presenting maps. Maps have transformed the way we have responded to both historic and contemporary coral reef problems. This timely review communicates how maps, and the fast growing technologies that are employed to produce them, are central to our understanding of coral reef environments. Recent advances that may drive exciting new environmental management tools are identified.																	0309-1333	1477-0296				DEC	2017	41	6					803	833		10.1177/0309133317744998								WOS:000418042100006						
J	Zhang, H; Gorelick, SM; Zimba, PV; Zhang, XD				Zhang, Hua; Gorelick, Steven M.; Zimba, Paul V.; Zhang, Xiaodong			A remote sensing method for estimating regional reservoir area and evaporative loss	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Evaporation from the water surface of a reservoir can significantly affect its function of ensuring the availability and temporal stability of water supply. Current estimations of reservoir evaporative loss are dependent on water area derived from a reservoir storage-area curve. Such curves are unavailable if the reservoir is located in a data-sparse region or questionable if long-term sedimentation has changed the original elevation-area relationship. We propose a remote sensing framework to estimate reservoir evaporative loss at the regional scale. This framework uses a multispectral water index to extract reservoir area from Landsat imagery and estimate monthly evaporation volume based on pan-derived evaporative rates. The optimal index threshold is determined based on local observations and extended to unobserved locations and periods. Built on the cloud computing capacity of the Google Earth Engine, this framework can efficiently analyze satellite images at large spatiotemporal scales, where such analysis is infeasible with a single computer. Our study involves 200 major reservoirs in Texas, captured in 17,811 Landsat images over a 32-year period. The results show that these reservoirs contribute to an annual evaporative loss of 8.0 billion cubic meters, equivalent to 20% of their total active storage or 53% of total annual water use in Texas. At five coastal basins, reservoir evaporative losses exceed the minimum freshwater inflows required to sustain ecosystem health and fishery productivity of the receiving estuaries. Reservoir evaporative loss can be significant enough to counterbalance the positive effects of impounding water and to offset the contribution of water conservation and reuse practices. Our results also reveal the spatially variable performance of the multispectral water index and indicate the limitation of using scene-level cloud cover to screen satellite images. This study demonstrates the advantage of combining satellite remote sensing and cloud computing to support regional water resources assessment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study aims to achieve a conservation-driven assessment of vegetation dynamics under such human-induced disturbances, as a strategy for informing the natural resources sector policy formulation. A 26-years change detection starting from 1987 to 2013 was performed on Landsats 4TM, 7ETM and 8 OLI/TIRS datasets at 30 m resolution. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) supervised methods of geospatial techniques in Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) were applied on these datasets. Results indicates severe decline of healthy forests and vegetation resources as revealed by 0.23 deviation in NDVI of 0.55 (41.98%) in 1987 to 0.32 (24.43%) in 2002. Nonetheless, in 2013, a 15.76% vegetation gain was registered given an NDVI value of 0.44 (33.59%), yet, falls below the initial NDVI threshold of 0.55. Thereby, implying that rates of forest and vegetation recovery are much slower compared to rates of degradation. However, this study provides baseline statistics and other helpful information for the effective management of vegetation and natural resources in the coming years.

These have a complex of values like food storage, water quality maintenance, livelihood and support species diversity, etc. Wetlands inventory is the pre-requisite process for conservation and management practices. The study makes an attempt to delineate wetlands and prepare inventory for turbidity and aquatic vegetation in Lower Barpani sub-watersheds (Assam), India. The study utilized Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) data during pre-and post-monsoon seasons, 2014. Wetlands during pre-and post-monsoon were delineated using supervised classification and threshold method. Wetland inventory for turbidity and aquatic vegetation was prepared during pre-and post-monsoon seasons. Single-band turbidity retrieval algorithm and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were used to assess the level of turbidity and aquatic vegetation in GIS environment. The study revealed that the variation in the extent of water logged wetlands in sub-watersheds was due to water spread variation during pre-and post-monsoon seasons. All the sub-watersheds were characterized by medium turbidity which was attributed to sediments and silts brought with runoff in wetlands. Aquatic vegetation showed variation in its distribution across subwatersheds. High vegetation indicated high turbidity and presence of nutrients. The study shows usefulness of remote sensing data in mapping and characterization of wetlands for preparing inventory and monitoring seasonal variation.

However, monitoring the ecological outcomes of these large-scale endeavours is challenging, and as a result, the factors and processes likely to shape their effectiveness remain poorly identified and understood. To address this knowledge gap, we tested three hypotheses pertaining to natural vegetation loss across the W-Arly-Pendjari protected area complex, a key biodiversity hotspot in West Africa. Using a new methodology to compare land cover change across large remote areas where independent validation data is unevenly distributed across time, we demonstrate widespread agricultural expansion outside protected areas over the past 13years. Protected areas with high protection status appear considerably more effective at preventing land conversion than other protected areas. We moreover report marked differences in cropland expansion rates between countries, which we suggest may be linked to differences in rural population growth. Altogether, our results suggest that there can be considerable spatial heterogeneity in anthropogenic pressure across transboundary protected area complexes and call for more comprehensive assessments that capitalize on the current availability of remote sensing information.																	2056-3485					DEC	2017	3	4					190	201		10.1002/rse2.47								WOS:000417252400002

Influence of artefacts in marine digital terrain models on habitat maps and species distribution models: a multiscale assessment	REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Remote sensing techniques are currently the main methods providing elevation data used to produce Digital Terrain Models (DTM). Terrain attributes (e.g. slope, orientation, rugosity) derived from DTMs are commonly used as surrogates of species or habitat distribution in ecological studies. While DTMs' errors are known to propagate to terrain attributes, their impact on ecological analyses is however rarely documented. This study assessed the impact of data acquisition artefacts on habitat maps and species distribution models. DTMs of German Bank (off Nova Scotia, Canada) at five different spatial scales were altered to artificially introduce different levels of common data acquisition artefacts. These data were used in 615 unsupervised classifications to map potential habitat types based on biophysical characteristics of the area, and in 615 supervised classifications (MaxEnt) to predict sea scallop distribution across the area. Differences between maps and models built from altered data and reference maps and models were assessed. Roll artefacts decreased map accuracy (up to 14% lower) and artificially increased models' performances. Impacts from other types of artefacts were not consistent, either decreasing or increasing accuracy and performance measures. The spatial distribution of habitats and spatial predictions of sea scallop distributions were always affected by data quality (i.e. artefacts), spatial scale of the data, and the selection of variables used in the classifications. This research demonstrates the importance of these three factors in building a study design, and highlights the need for error quantification protocols that can assist when maps and models are used in decision-making, for instance in conservation and management.

J	Rechsteiner, C; Zellweger, F; Gerber, A; Breiner, FT; Bollmann, K				Rechsteiner, Christian; Zellweger, Florian; Gerber, Anatole; Breiner, Frank T.; Bollmann, Kurt			Remotely sensed forest habitat structures improve regional species conservation	REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Recent studies show that light detection and ranging (LiDAR) derived habitat variables significantly increase the performance and accuracy of species distribution models (SDMs). In particular, the structure of complex habitats such as forest can be accurately parametrized by an area-wide, LiDAR-based vegetation profile. However, evidence of specific applications of such models in real-world conservation management still remains sparse. Here, we developed a resource selection SDM for hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia L.) in a Swiss nature park with the aim to map habitat suitability and to inform the park management about habitat improvement measures. We used remote sensing, particularly LiDAR to derive ecologically relevant forest vegetation characteristics at the local scale and used them as predictors in an ensemble SDM approach. The predicted habitat suitability was mainly affected by local, fine grained vegetation structure. Average vegetation height, shrub density and canopy height variation contributed most to the habitat quality for hazel grouse. This clearly shows how LiDAR provides the means to develop ecologically interpretable predictor variables of forest habitat structure and that these predictors can be used to reliably map local-scale habitat quality, indicated by high model performance scores (median AUC of 0.918). This improves spatial conservation planning, and at the same time, provides meaningful information to derive habitat improvement measures that can be implemented in the field by foresters. Hazel grouse occurrence in the park is restricted to a few highly suitable, disjunct habitat patches. Therefore, conservation management should increase the connectivity of suitable habitat with the aim to stimulate an increase and better exchange of individuals in the regional hazel grouse population. Habitat improvements can be achieved by forestry measures that regularly integrate early successional forest stages into production forests. They should contain stands with a shrub density of around 30% as well as heterogeneous stands in terms of vegetation height.																	2056-3485					DEC	2017	3	4					247	258		10.1002/rse2.46								WOS:000417252400006

Evaluation of morphometric parameters derived from Cartosat-1 DEM using remote sensing and GIS techniques for Budigere Amanikere watershed, Dakshina Pinakini Basin, Karnataka, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The quantitative analysis of drainage system is an important aspect of characterization of watersheds. Using watershed as a basin unit in morphometric analysis is the most logical choice because all hydrological and geomorphic processes occur within the watershed. The Budigere Amanikere watershed a tributary of Dakshina Pinakini River has been selected for case illustration. Geoinformatics module consisting of ArcGIS 10.3v and Cartosat-1 Digital Elevation Model (DEM) version 1 of resolution 1 arc Sec (32 m) data obtained from Bhuvan is effectively used. Sheet and gully erosion are identified in parts of the study area. Slope in the watershed indicating moderate to least runoff and negligible soil loss condition. Third and fourth-order sub-watershed analysis is carried out. Mean bifurcation ratio (R (b)) 3.6 specify there is no dominant influence of geology and structures, low drainage density (D (d)) 1.12 and low stream frequency (F (s)) 1.17 implies highly infiltration subsoil material and low runoff, infiltration number (I (f))1.3 implies higher infiltration capacity, coarse drainage texture (T) 3.40 shows high permeable subsoil, length of overland flow (L (g)) 0.45 indicates under very less structural disturbances, less runoff conditions, constant of channel maintenance (C) 0.9 indicates higher permeability of subsoil, elongation ratio (R (e)) 0.58, circularity ratio (R (c)) 0.75 and form factor (R (f)) 0.26 signifies sub-circular to more elongated basin with high infiltration with low runoff. It was observed from the hypsometric curves and hypsometric integral values of the watershed along with their sub basins that the drainage system is attaining a mature stage of geomorphic development. Additionally, Hypsometric curve and hypsometric integral value proves that the infiltration capacity is high as well as runoff is low in the watershed. Thus, these mormometric analyses can be used as an estimator of erosion status of watersheds leading to prioritization for taking up soil and water conservation measures.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				DEC	2017	7	8					4399	4414		10.1007/s13201-017-0585-6								WOS:000416833900019						
J	Zhao, YY; Wu, JG; He, CY; Ding, GD				Zhao, Yuanyuan; Wu, Jianguo; He, Chunyang; Ding, Guodong			Linking wind erosion to ecosystem services in drylands: a landscape ecological approach	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Wind erosion is a widespread environmental problem in the world's arid landscapes, which threatens the sustainability of ecosystem services in these regions. We investigated how wind erosion and key ecosystem services changed concurrently and what major biophysical and socioeconomic factors were responsible for these changes in a dryland area of China. Based on remote sensing data, field measurements, and modeling, we quantified the spatiotemporal patterns of both wind erosion and four key ecosystem services (soil conservation, crop production, meat production, and carbon storage) in the Mu Us Sandy Land in northern China during 2000-2013. Linear regression was used to explore possible relationships between wind erosion and ecosystem services. From 2000 to 2013, wind erosion decreased by as much as 60% and the four ecosystem services all increased substantially. These trends were attributable to vegetation recovery due mainly to government-aided ecological restoration projects and, to a lesser degree, slightly increasing precipitation and decreasing wind speed during the second half of the study period. The maximum soil loss dropped an order of magnitude when vegetation cover increased from 10% to 30%, halved again when vegetation increased from 30 to 40%, and showed little change when vegetation increased beyond 60%. Our study indicates that vegetation cover has nonlinear and threshold effects on wind erosion through constraining the maximum soil loss, which further affects dryland ecosystem services. These findings have important implications for ecological restoration and ecosystem management in dryland landscapes in China and beyond.																	0921-2973	1572-9761				DEC	2017	32	12					2399	2417		10.1007/s10980-017-0585-9								WOS:000416857800013

Review of native vegetation condition assessment concepts, methods and future trends	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION												The main aim of this review paper is to evaluate and make recommendations on how current and emerging remote sensing (RS) technology might be best used to improve vegetation condition assessment and monitoring. This research reviews the vegetation attributes used in various approaches to vegetation condition assessment, the most efficient and rapid techniques to assess those attributes, and proposes applicable suggestions for future vegetation condition assessment using fusion and ensemble techniques. The attributes are those that have strong correlations with components of vegetation condition and are expected to produce trustable indications of change. Further to this, it aims to identify those vegetation attributes that can be best assessed using field survey and those that can be remotely measured world-wide. Vegetation has various structural, functional and compositional characteristics. To measure specific vegetation characteristics, the suitable type of RS sensor is required. Multi-spectral, hyperspectral, Radio Detection And Ranging (RADAR) and Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) are the main types of RS sensors, and each type has a range of applications. A variety of automated and repeatable methods are provided by RS technology to monitor the indicators of vegetation condition. However, dependency on site-based data remains. Further work is essential to find a rapid, cost effective and transferable RS method to map and monitor vegetation condition. Moreover, near future improvements in RS, such as Sentinel products, are expected to ease the process of vegetation condition assessment and enhance the outcomes.

A national-scale model of linear features improves predictions of farmland biodiversity	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Modelling species distribution and abundance is important for many conservation applications, but it is typically performed using relatively coarse-scale environmental variables such as the area of broad land-cover types. Fine-scale environmental data capturing the most biologically relevant variables have the potential to improve these models. For example, field studies have demonstrated the importance of linear features, such as hedgerows, for multiple taxa, but the absence of large-scale datasets of their extent prevents their inclusion in largescale modelling studies. 2. We assessed whether a novel spatial dataset mapping linear and woody-linear features across the UK improves the performance of abundance models of 18 bird and 24 butterfly species across 3723 and 1547 UK monitoring sites, respectively. 3. Although improvements in explanatory power were small, the inclusion of linear features data significantly improved model predictive performance for many species. For some species, the importance of linear features depended on landscape context, with greater importance in agricultural areas. 4. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that a national-scale model of the extent and distribution of linear features improves predictions of farmland biodiversity. The ability to model spatial variability in the role of linear features such as hedgerows will be important in targeting agri-environment schemes to maximally deliver biodiversity benefits. Although this study focuses on farmland, data on the extent of different linear features are likely to improve species distribution and abundance models in a wide range of systems and also can potentially be used to assess habitat connectivity.

Its vast region concentrates also a large number of small farmers, who historically have been practicing swidden-fallow cultivation. Globally, there is contradictory evidence of the current fate of this traditional, integrated agricultural system, and the new land uses may have a strong impact on farmers' livelihoods and ecosystem conservation. In this study, we assessed the land cover and land use change in a watershed where slash-and-burn cultivation was prevalent, aiming at understanding the drivers of change and discussing past and possible future impacts, including the perception of farmers on the drivers of land use change. We combined information gathered from interviews with 15 key informant farmers and from the analysis of remote sensing images for the years 1957, 1978 and 2011. Swidden-fallow cultivation has declined steadily since the 1950s. Part of the land was abandoned and forest succession was allowed to occur, increasing the total forest area; an apparently positive outcome. However, conversion to pastures and Eucalyptus plantations not only used much of the open land but also converted successional forests through deforestation, based on remote sensing. The willingness of farmers to grow more Eucalyptus and raise more cattle further increases concerns about the prospect for conservation. Our approach, combining remote sensing-based land change quantification and interviews, revealed to be complementary, allowing a better understanding of the past and possible future scenarios for the land use dynamics.																	0264-8377	1873-5754				DEC	2017	69						417	426		10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.09.039								WOS:000414881200041

Heterogeneity indices based on land-use/land-cover maps typically do not integrate ecological dissimilarity between land-use/land-cover types. Here, we applied the concept of functional diversity to an existing land-use/land-cover diversity index (Satoyama index) to incorporate ecological dissimilarity and proposed a new index called the dissimilarity-based Satoyama index (DSI). Using Japan as a case study, we calculated the DSI for three land-use/land-cover maps with different spatial resolutions and derived similarity information from normalized difference vegetation index values. The DSI showed better performance in the prediction of Japanese damselfly species richness than that of the existing index, and a higher correlation between the index and species richness was obtained for higher resolution maps. Thus, our approach to improve the land-use/land-cover diversity index holds promise for future development and can be effective for conservation and monitoring efforts.																	0044-7447	1654-7209				DEC	2017	46	8					894	906		10.1007/s13280-017-0925-7								WOS:000412998600006	28573598					
J	Alves, DB; Perez-Cabello, F				Borini Alves, Daniel; Perez-Cabello, Fernando			Multiple remote sensing data sources to assess spatio-temporal patterns of fire incidence over Campos Amazonicos Savanna Vegetation Enclave (Brazilian Amazon)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Fire activity plays an important role in the past, present and future of Earth system behavior. Monitoring and assessing spatial and temporal fire dynamics have a fundamental relevance in the understanding of ecological processes and the human impacts on different landscapes and multiple spatial scales. This work analyzes the spatio-temporal distribution of burned areas in one of the biggest savanna vegetation enclaves in the southern Brazilian Amazon, from 2000 to 2016, deriving information from multiple remote sensing data sources (Landsat and MODIS surface reflectance, TRMM pluviometry and Vegetation Continuous Field tree cover layers). A fire scars database with 30m spatial resolution was generated using a Landsat time series. MODIS daily surface reflectance was used for accurate dating of the fire scars. TRMM pluviometry data were analyzed to dynamically establish time limits of the yearly dry season and burning periods. Burned area extent, frequency and recurrence were quantified comparing the results annually/seasonally. Additionally, Vegetation Continuous Field tree cover layers were used to analyze fire incidence over different types of tree cover domains. In the last seventeen years, 1.03 million ha were burned within the study area, distributed across 1432 fire occurrences, highlighting 2005, 2010 and 2014 as the most affected years. Middle dry season fires represent 86.21% of the total burned areas and 32.05% of fire occurrences, affecting larger amount of higher density tree surfaces than other burning periods. The results provide new insights into the analysis of burned areas of the neotropical savannas, spatially and statistically reinforcing important aspects linked to the seasonality patterns of fire incidence in this landscape.

We proposed a scale transformation (CT) method of converting the field sampling-site biomass from the quadrat to pixel scale and a new normalized water-adjusted vegetation index (NWAVI) based on remotely sensed imagery for the biomass estimation of aquatic vegetation (excluding emergent vegetation). We used a modeling approach based on the proposed CT method and NWAVI as well as statistical analyses including linear, quadratic, logarithmic, cubic, exponential, inverse and power regression to estimate the aquatic vegetation biomass, and we evaluated the performance of the biomass estimation. We mapped the spatial distribution and temporal change of the aquatic vegetation biomass using a geographic information system in a test lake in different months. The exponential regression models based on CT and the NWAVI had optimal adjusted R-2, F and Sig. values in both May and August 2013. The scatter plots of the observed versus the predicted biomass showed that most of the validated field sites were near the 1:1 line. The RMSE, ARE and RE values were small. The spatial distribution and change of the aquatic vegetation biomass in the study area showed clear variability. Among the NWAVI-based and other vegetation index-based models, the CT and NWAVI-based models had the largest adjusted R-2, F and the smallest ARE values in both tests. The proposed modeling scheme is effective for the biomass estimation of aquatic vegetation in lakes. It indicated that the proposed method can provide a most accurate spatial distribution map of aquatic vegetation biomass for lake ecological management. More accurate biomass maps of aquatic vegetation are essential for implementing conservation policy and for reducing uncertainties in our understanding of the lake carbon cycle.

J	Zarco-Perello, S; Simoes, N				Zarco-Perello, Salvador; Simoes, Nuno			Ordinary kriging vs inverse distance weighting: spatial interpolation of the sessile community of Madagascar reef, Gulf of Mexico	PEERJ												Information about the distribution and abundance of the habitat-forming sessile organisms in marine ecosystems is of great importance for conservation and natural resource managers. Spatial interpolation methodologies can be useful to generate this information from in situ sampling points, especially in circumstances where remote sensing methodologies cannot be applied due to small-scale spatial variability of the natural communities and low light penetration in the water column. Interpolation methods are widely used in environmental sciences; however, published studies using these methodologies in coral reef science are scarce. We compared the accuracy of the two most commonly used interpolation methods in all disciplines, inverse distance weighting (IDW) and ordinary kriging (OK), to predict the distribution and abundance of hard corals, octocorals, macroalgae, sponges and zoantharians and identify hotspots of these habitat-forming organisms using data sampled at three different spatial scales (5, 10 and 20 m) in Madagascar reef, Gulf of Mexico. The deeper sandy environments of the leeward and windward regions of Madagascar reef were dominated by macroalgae and seconded by octocorals. However, the shallow rocky environments of the reef crest had the highest richness of habitat-forming groups of organisms; here, we registered high abundances of octocorals and macroalgae, with sponges, Millepora alcicornis and zoantharians dominating in some patches, creating high levels of habitat heterogeneity. IDW and OK generated similar maps of distribution for all the taxa; however, cross-validation tests showed that IDW outperformed OK in the prediction of their abundances. When the sampling distance was at 20 m, both interpolation techniques performed poorly, but as the sampling was done at shorter distances prediction accuracies increased, especially for IDW. OK had higher mean prediction errors and failed to correctly interpolate the highest abundance values measured in situ, except for macroalgae, whereas IDW had lower mean prediction errors and high correlations between predicted and measured values in all cases when sampling was every 5 m. The accurate spatial interpolations created using IDW allowed us to see the spatial variability of each taxa at a biological and spatial resolution that remote sensing would not have been able to produce. Our study sets the basis for further research projects and conservation management in Madagascar reef and encourages similar studies in the region and other parts of the world where remote sensing technologies are not suitable for use.																	2167-8359					NOV 30	2017	5								e4078	10.7717/peerj.4078								WOS:000417096100005	29204321					
J	Navalgund, R; Rajani, MB				Navalgund, Ranganath; Rajani, M. B.			The science behind archaeological signatures from space	CURRENT SCIENCE												Archaeology has traditionally focused on studying historic or prehistoric people and their cultures by analysis of their artefacts, inscriptions, monuments and other such material remains, especially those that have been documented from excavations. This focus is somewhat narrow, because it excludes many new methods that have emerged in the last few decades (described in detail by Prabhakar and Korisettar in this special section (page 1873)). One such novel method is to study large imprints on the landscape caused by human activity. These tell-tale features include soil marks, crop marks, drainage patterns, field boundaries and a host of man-made structures, whose study can provide additional cultural insights. In some cases, these features are difficult to detect by the naked eye at ground level, but are detectable by remote sensing techniques from aerial/space-based platforms in a non-destructive manner. For these reasons, it is now well recognized that examining archaeological landscapes using remote sensing can complement traditional investigations. An analysis of remote sensing data can play an important role in (1) understanding spatial relationships between cultural materials and activities, (2) formulating archaeological sampling schemes, (3) measuring distances and spatial distributions of structures and monuments, and (4) evolving schemes for their conservation.																	0011-3891					NOV 25	2017	113	10					1859	1872		10.18520/cs/v113/i10/1859-1872								WOS:000415987800025

Mapping critical areas for migratory songbirds using a fusion of remote sensing and distributional modeling techniques	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Of the 338 species identified as Nearctic-Neotropical migrants occurring in North America, 98.5% have been recorded in Texas. The seasonal migration of these birds is a well-studied natural phenomenon individuals weighing < 15 g will cross in the Gulf of Mexico approximately 965 km non-stop, completing a total distance of 1900-3200 km over the course of 26-80 h. The physiologically demanding nature of this feat makes the Texas coastline crucial to the success of these species. We used a fusion of multi-spectral remote sensing data and distributional modeling techniques to generate and evaluate predictive maps identifying critical areas for migratory passerines on the Texas coast. Imagery acquired from Landsat 8 OLI, maps provided by United States Geological Survey and the Texas Department of Transportation, and migratory bird occurrence records from the eBird citizen-contributed database were used to build predictive distribution models using three algorithms. Using the AUC to compare model performance, the Random Forest produced the most accurate distribution model, followed by MaxEnt, and Support Vector Machine (0.98, 0.81, and 0.79, respectively). We interpreted, from Boosted Regression Tree analysis, that elevation is the single most influential factor in determining migrant occupancy, with vegetative biomass the least influential predictor. Our approach here allows conservation biologists a more sophisticated approach to identifying critical areas for migratory passerines across large spatial extents in a short amount of time.																	1574-9541	1878-0512				NOV	2017	42						55	60		10.1016/j.ecoinf.2017.09.007								WOS:000418985600007

A change prediction model was undertaken through the use of the IDRISI Land Change Modeller, to predict the changes that would occur by 2024 within Sand Forest, over a 10 year period from 2014 base data available. Using Markov chain, the anticipated loss in extent of Sand Forest that may occur from 2014 to 2024 is 10.51 km(2), over the entire Maputaland. The change prediction model illustrates that the expected loss centres on the larger communities that have established road networks. However, as these resources become depleted, this may change after 2024. The ability of trajectory analysis to predict potential changes based on observed and quantified trends provides a new dynamic to conservation and management strategies. In understanding where and how much Sand Forest will be lost in the forthcoming 10 years, more appropriate and accurate recommendations on conservation and management can be made. Furthermore, priority areas can be more readily identified for both conservation and for management intervention.

From instantaneous to continuous: Using imaging spectroscopy and in situ data to map two productivity-related ecosystem services	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Spatially well-informed decisions are essential to sustain and regulate processes and ecosystem services (ES), and to maintain the capacity of ecosystems to supply services. However, spatially explicit ES information is often lacking in decision-making, or exists only as ES maps based on categorical land cover data. Remote sensing (RS) opens new pathways to map ES, in particular biophysical ES supply. We developed an observation-based concept for spatially explicit and continuous ES mapping at landscape scale following the biophysical part of the ES cascade. We used Earth observations in combination with in situ data to map ecosystem properties, functions, and biophysical ES supply. We applied this concept in a case study to map two ES: carbon dioxide regulation and food supply. Based on Earth observations and in situ data, we determined the ecosystem property Sun-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) to indicate ecosystem state and applied scaling models to estimate gross primary production (GPP) as indicator for ecosystem functioning and consequently carbon dioxide regulation and food supply as ES. Resulting ES maps showed heterogeneous patterns in ES supply within and among ecosystems, which were particularly evident within forests and grasslands. All investigated land cover classes were sources of CO2, with averages ranging from -66 to -748 g C m(-2) yr(-1), after considering the harvest of total above ground biomass of crops and the storage organ, except for forest being a sink of CO2 with an average of 105 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Estimated annual GPP was related to food supply with a maize grain yield average of 9.5 t ha(-1) yr(-1) and a sugar beet root yield of 110 t ha(-1) yr(-1). Validation with in situ measurements from flux towers and literature values revealed a good performance of our approach for food supply (relative RMSE of less than 23%), but also some over- and underestimations for carbon dioxide regulation. Our approach demonstrated how RS can contribute to spatially explicit and continuous ES cascade mapping and suggest that this information could be useful for environmental assessments and decision-making in spatial planning and conservation.

Specifically, high-resolution satellite-based imaging systems, as WorldView-2 (WV-2), can generate information at spatial scales needed to implement conservation actions for protected littoral zones. However, coastal water-leaving radiance arriving at the space-based sensor is often small as compared to reflected radiance. In this work, complex approaches, which usually use an accurate radiative transfer code to correct the atmospheric effects, such as FLAASH, ATCOR and 6S, have been implemented for high-resolution imagery. They have been assessed in real scenarios using field spectroradiometer data. In this context, the three approaches have achieved excellent results and a slightly superior performance of 6S model-based algorithm has been observed. Finally, for the mapping of benthic habitats in shallow-waters marine protected environments, a relevant application of the proposed atmospheric correction combined with an automatic deglinting procedure is presented. This approach is based on the integration of a linear mixing model of benthic classes within the radiative transfer model of the water. The complete methodology has been applied to selected ecosystems in the Canary Islands (Spain) but the obtained results allow the robust mapping of the spatial distribution and density of seagrass in coastal waters and the analysis of multitemporal variations related to the human activity and climate change in littoral zones.

Gangadhara			Integration of geospatial technologies with RUSLE for analysis of land use/cover change impact on soil erosion: case study in Rib watershed, north-western highland Ethiopia	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												In recent times, soil erosion interlocked with land use and land cover (LULC) changes has become one of the most important environmental issues in developing countries. Evaluation of this complex interaction between LULC change and soil erosion is indispensable in land use planning and conservation works. This paper analysed the impact of LULC change on soil erosion in the north-western highland Ethiopia over the period 1986-2016. Rib watershed, the area with dynamic LULC change and severe soil erosion problem, was selected as a case study site. Integrated approach that combined geospatial technologies with revised universal soil loss equation model was utilized to evaluate the spatio-temporal dynamics of soil loss over the study period. Pixel-based overlay of soil erosion intensity maps with LULC maps was carried out to understand the change in soil loss due to LULC change. Results showed that the annual soil loss in the study area varied from 0 to 236.5 t ha(-1) year(-1) (tons per hectare per year) in 1986 and 0-807 t ha(-1) year(-1) in 2016. The average annual soil loss for the entire watershed was estimated about 40 t ha(-1) year(-1) in 1986 comparing with 68 t ha(-1) year(-1) in 2016, a formidable increase. Soil erosion potential that was estimated to exceed the average soil loss tolerance level increased from 34.5% in 1986 to 66.8% in 2016. Expansion of agricultural land at the expense of grassland and shrubland was the most detrimental factor for severe soil erosion in the watershed. The most noticeable change in soil erosion intensity was observed from cropland with mean annual soil loss amount increased to 41.38 t ha(-1) year(-1) in 2016 from 26.60 in 1986. Moreover, the most successive erosion problems were detected in eastern, south-eastern and northern parts of the watershed. Therefore, the results of this study can help identify the soil erosion hot spots and conservation priority areas at local and regional levels.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				NOV	2017	76	22							765	10.1007/s12665-017-7109-4								WOS:000416820300013

Artificial interpretation based on high spatial resolution images is the main method for monitoring ephemeral gullies in large areas; however, this method is time consuming. In this study, a semiautomatic method for extracting ephemeral gullies in loess hilly areas based on directional edge detection is proposed. First, the area where ephemeral gullies developed was extracted because the weak trace of ephemeral gullies in images can hardly be detected by most image detectors, which avoided the noise from other large gullies. Second, a Canny edge detector was employed to extract all edges in the image. Then, those edges along the direction where ephemeral gullies developed were searched and coded as candidate ephemeral gullies. Finally, the ephemeral gullies were identified through filtering of pseudo-gullies by setting the appropriate length threshold. Experiments in three loess hilly areas showed that accuracy ranged from 38.18% to 85.05%, completeness ranged from 82.35% to 92.86%, and quality ranged from 35.29% to 79.82%. The quality of the remote sensing images highly affected the results. The accuracy was significantly improved when the image was used with less grass and shrubs. The length threshold in directional searching also affected the accuracy. A small threshold resulted in additional noise and disconnected gullies, whereas a large threshold disregarded the short gullies. A reasonable threshold can be obtained through the index of quality. The threshold also exhibits a strong relationship with the average length of ephemeral gullies, and this relationship can help obtain the optimum threshold in the hilly area of the Northern Loess Plateau of China.

J	Li, DJ; Yang, C; Du, Y				Li, Dejun; Yang, Chao; Du, Yang			Efficient Method for Scattering From Cylindrical Components of Vegetation and Its Potential Application to the Determination of Effective Permittivity	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												Reliable and efficient analysis of electromagnetic scattering by cylindrical components of vegetation is important for microwave remote sensing of vegetated terrain. It allows for the characterization of anistropicity of the effective permittivity for vegetation or tree canopy, where averaging operation over distribution of cylinder orientation is needed in general. In this paper, we propose a T-matrix formulation based on our virtual partition method (VPM) for the whole cylindric component of either homogeneous or inhomogeneous nature. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed T-matrix preserves all the desirable features of the VPM method, including high fidelity prediction of the scattering amplitude function and fulfillment of energy conservation as well as the reciprocity theorem. More importantly, in the evaluation of averaging over orientation distribution, the proposed method is usually faster than the VPM by two orders of magnitude. The predicted effective permittivity for an exemplary orientation distribution shows appreciable difference from that of the infinite cylinder approximation. With its qualitatively characterized region of validity, the proposed method is expected to be helpful in multiband coherent scattering models of vegetated terrain.																	0196-2892	1558-0644				NOV	2017	55	11					6120	6127		10.1109/TGRS.2017.2720849								WOS:000413656900008

The NDVI exploits spectral information from red and near infrared bands of Landsat images and it does not consider canopy background conditions hence it is affected by soil brightness which lowers its sensitivity to vegetation. As such NDVI may be insufficient in explaining tree species diversity. Meanwhile, the Landsat program also collects essential spectral information in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) region which is related to plant properties. The study was intended to: (i) explore the utility of spectral information across Landsat-8 spectrum using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and estimate alpha diversity (alpha-diversity) in the savannah woodland in southern Africa, and (ii) define the species diversity index (Shannon (H'), Simpson (D-2) and species richness (S) - defined as number of species in a community) that best relates to spectral variability on the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager dataset. We designed 90 m x 90 m field plots (n = 71) and identified all trees with a diameter at breast height (DbH) above 10 cm. H', D-2 and S were used to quantify tree species diversity within each plot and the corresponding spectral information on all Landsat-8 bands were extracted from each field plot. A stepwise linear regression was applied to determine the relationship between species diversity indices (H', D-2 and S) and Principal Components (PCs), vegetation indices and Gray Level Co occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture layers with calibration (n = 46) and test (n = 23) datasets. The results of regression analysis showed that the Simple Ratio Index derivative had a higher relationship with H', D-2 and S (r(2) = 0.36; r(2) = 0.41; r(2) = 0.24 respectively) compared to NDVI, EVI, SAVI or their derivatives. Moreover the Landsat-8 derived PCs also had a higher relationship with H' and D-2 (r(2) of 0.36 and 0.35 respectively) than the frequently used NDVI, and this was attributed to the utilization of the entire spectral content of Landsat-8 data. Our results indicate that: (i) the measurement scales of vegetation indices impact their sensitivity to vegetation characteristics and their ability to explain tree species diversity; (ii) principal components enhance the utility of Landsat-8 spectral data for estimating tree species diversity and (iii) species diversity indices that consider both species richness and abundance (H' and D-2) relates better with Landsat-8 spectral variables.

The eDNA technique is based on the analysis of DNA fragments in sampled water; thus, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV; drone) would be a useful way of collecting water for eDNA sampling, and may consequently allow us to extend eDNA surveys both spatially and temporally. Here, we developed a new method of water collection by using UAV with bleachable equipment, to avoid DNA contamination. To test the performance and contamination risk of UAV water sampling in eDNA surveys, we sampled water from a dam reservoir, detected eDNA from two fish species, and compared the water samples obtained by UAV with those obtained by boat. Additionally, we investigated contamination using blank samples. The results revealed that our UAV water sampling method performed similar to the boat sampling method. No positive signals were detected in the blank samples, including those used for UAV sampling, transportation, filtering, and PCR blanks. Our UAV method can be used to investigate species distributions using eDNA. Combinations of UAV technologies, including remote and thermal sensing, will enable efficient environmental monitoring in various waterbodies.

With increasing commercial agriculture and biodiversity conservation efforts in forested tropical regions, many shifting cultivation systems are being intensified and their extent restricted. Studies examining the consequences of such pressures commonly overlook the diminishing role of wild food. Using a combination of collection diaries, participant observation, remote sensing, and interviews, we examined the role of agriculture-forest landscapes in the provision of wild food in rapidly transforming shifting cultivation communities in northern Laos. We found that wild food contributed less to human diets in areas where pressure on land from commercial agriculture and conservation efforts was more intense. Our results demonstrate that increasing pressure on land creates changes in the shifting cultivation landscape and people's use thereof with negative effects on the quality of nutrition, including protein deficiency, especially in communities adjacent to core conservation areas. Our study shows the importance of adopting a more nutrition-sensitive approach to the linkages between commercial agriculture and biodiversity conservation (and the policies that promote them), wild food provisioning, and food security.

Improving models of urban greenspace: from vegetation surface cover to volumetric survey, using waveform laser scanning	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Urban greenspace has a major impact on human health and quality of life, and thus the way in which such green infrastructure is constructed, managed and maintained is of critical importance. A range of studies have demonstrated the relationship between the areal coverage and distribution of vegetation and the provision of multiple urban ecosystem services. It is not known how sensitive findings are to the spatial resolution of the underlying data relative to the grain size of urban land cover heterogeneity. Moreover, little is known about the three-dimensional (3D) structure of urban vegetation and delivery of services, and addressing such questions is limited by the availability of data describing canopy structure from the tree tops to the ground. Waveform airborne laser scanning (lidar) offers a new way of capturing 3D data describing vegetation structure. We generated voxels (volumetric pixels) from waveform lidar (1.5m resolution), differentiated vegetation layers using height as a determinant, and computed statistics on surface cover, volume and volume density per stratum. We then used a range of widely available remote sensing products with varying spatial resolution (1 to 100m) to map the same greenspace, and compared results to those from the waveform lidar survey. We focused on data from three urban zones in the UK with distinct patterns of vegetation cover. We found -3%, +7.5% and +26.1% differences in green surface cover compared with, respectively, town planning maps (<10m resolution), national land cover maps (25m) and European land cover maps (100m). There were differences of -59.1%, +12.4% and -2.4% in tree cover compared with global (30m resolution), European (25m) and national (1m) estimates. Waveform lidar captured sub-canopy structure and detected empty spaces in the understorey which contributed a 16% bias in the total green volume derived from non-waveform lidar observations. We conclude that waveform lidar has a key role to play in estimating important quantitative metrics of urban green infrastructure, which is important because urban greenspace is highly fragmented and shows high levels of spatial and volumetric heterogeneity.																	2041-210X	2041-2096				NOV	2017	8	11					1443	1452		10.1111/2041-210X.12794								WOS:000414701900006

In this research work, delineation of groundwater potential zone in Birbhum district has been carried out. Various thematic layers viz. geology, geomorphology, soil type, elevation, lineament and fault density, slope, drainage density, land use/land cover, soil texture, and rainfall are digitized and transformed into raster data in ArcGIS 10.3 environment as input factors. Thereafter, multi-influencing factor (MIF) technique is employed where ranks and weights, assigned to each factor are computed statistically. Finally, groundwater potential zones are classified into four categories namely low, medium, high and very high zone. It is observed that 18.41% (836.86 km(2)) and 34.41% (1563.98 km(2)) of the study area falls under 'low' and 'medium' groundwater potential zone, respectively. Approximately 1601.19 km(2) area accounting for 35.23% of the study area falls under 'high' category and 'very high' groundwater potential zone encompasses an area of 542.98 km(2) accounting for 11.95% of the total study area. Finally, the model generated groundwater potential zones are validated with reported potential yield data of various wells in the study area. Success and prediction rate curve reveals an accuracy achievement of 83.03 and 78%, respectively. The outcome of the present research work will help the local authorities, researchers, decision makers and planners in formulating better planning and management of groundwater resources in the study area in future perspectives.

In order to address these declines, decision-makers need accurate assessments of the status of and pressures on biodiversity. However, these are heavily constrained by incomplete and uneven spatial, temporal and taxonomic coverage. For instance, data from regions such as Europe and North America are currently used overwhelmingly for large-scale biodiversity assessments due to lesser availability of suitable data from other, more biodiversity-rich, regions. These data-poor regions are often those experiencing the strongest threats to biodiversity, however. There is therefore an urgent need to fill the existing gaps in global biodiversity monitoring. Here, we review current knowledge on best practice in capacity building for biodiversity monitoring and provide an overview of existing means to improve biodiversity data collection considering the different types of biodiversity monitoring data. Our review comprises insights from work in Africa, South America, Polar Regions and Europe; in government-funded, volunteer and citizen-based monitoring in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. The key steps to effectively building capacity in biodiversity monitoring are: identifying monitoring questions and aims; identifying the key components, functions, and processes to monitor; identifying the most suitable monitoring methods for these elements, carrying out monitoring activities; managing the resultant data; and interpreting monitoring data. Additionally, biodiversity monitoring should use multiple approaches including extensive and intensive monitoring through volunteers and professional scientists but also harnessing new technologies. Finally, we call on the scientific community to share biodiversity monitoring data, knowledge and tools to ensure the accessibility, interoperability, and reporting of biodiversity data at a global scale.

Joseph; Weisrock, David W.; Jacobsen, Dean			Climate change and alpine stream biology: progress, challenges, and opportunities for the future	BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS												In alpine regions worldwide, climate change is dramatically altering ecosystems and affecting biodiversity in many ways. For streams, receding alpine glaciers and snowfields, paired with altered precipitation regimes, are driving shifts in hydrology, species distributions, basal resources, and threatening the very existence of some habitats and biota. Alpine streams harbour substantial species and genetic diversity due to significant habitat insularity and environmental heterogeneity. Climate change is expected to affect alpine stream biodiversity across many levels of biological resolution from micro- to macroscopic organisms and genes to communities. Herein, we describe the current state of alpine stream biology from an organism-focused perspective. We begin by reviewing seven standard and emerging approaches that combine to form the current state of the discipline. We follow with a call for increased synthesis across existing approaches to improve understanding of how these imperiled ecosystems are responding to rapid environmental change. We then take a forward-looking viewpoint on how alpine stream biologists can make better use of existing data sets through temporal comparisons, integrate remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) technologies, and apply genomic tools to refine knowledge of underlying evolutionary processes. We conclude with comments about the future of biodiversity conservation in alpine streams to confront the daunting challenge of mitigating the effects of rapid environmental change in these sentinel ecosystems.

Movement, distribution and marine reserve use by an endangered migratory giant	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												AimUnderstanding the spatial and temporal variation in the distribution of migratory species is critical for management and conservation efforts. However, challenges in observing mobile marine species throughout their migratory pathways can impede the identification of critical habitat, linkages between these habitats and threat-mitigation strategies. This study aimed to gain insight into the long-term residency and movement patterns of the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) and to reveal important habitat in the context of R.typus usage of existing Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). LocationSouth-eastern Indian Ocean. MethodsSatellite telemetry was used to remotely track the long-term movements of 29 R.typus, and to quantify shark usage of the existing MPA network. From the tracking data and environmental predictors, nonlinear models were developed to predict suitable R.typus habitat throughout the south-eastern Indian Ocean. ResultsThis study includes the first documented complete return migrations by R.typus to Ningaloo Marine Park, which was found to be an important area for R.typus all year-round. We found that while existing MPAs along Australia's west coast do afford some protection to R.typus, telemetry-based habitat models revealed large areas of suitable habitat not currently protected, particularly along the Western Australian coast, in the Timor Sea, and in Indonesian and international waters. Main conclusionsAnimal-borne telemetric devices allowed the gathering of long-term spatial information from the elusive and highly mobile R.typus, revealing the spatial scale of their migration in the south-eastern Indian Ocean. Suitable habitat was predicted to occur inside conservation areas, but our findings indicate that the current MPA network may not sufficiently protect R.typus throughout the year. We suggest that telemetry-based habitat models can be an important tool to inform conservation planning and spatial management efforts for migratory species.																	1366-9516	1472-4642				NOV	2017	23	11					1268	1279		10.1111/ddi.12618								WOS:000413545900005						
J	Richards, DR; Friess, DA				Richards, Daniel R.; Friess, Daniel A.			Characterizing Coastal Ecosystem Service Trade-offs with Future Urban Development in a Tropical City	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												With rapid urbanization in the coastal zone and increasing habitat losses, it is imperative to understand how urban development affects coastal biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. Furthermore, it is important to understand how habitat fragments can best be incorporated into broader land use planning and coastal management, in order to maximize the environmental benefits they provide. In this study, we characterized the trade-offs between (a) urban development and individual mangrove environmental indicators (habitat quality and ecosystem services), and (b) between different environmental indicators in the tropical nation of Singapore. A range of biological, biophysical, and cultural indicators, including carbon, charcoal production, support for offshore fisheries, recreation, and habitat quality for a threatened species were quantified using field-based, remote sensing, and expert survey methods. The shape of the trade-off Pareto frontiers was analyzed to assess the sensitivity of environmental indicators for development. When traded off individually with urban development, four out of five environmental indicators were insensitive to development, meaning that relatively minor degradation of the indicator occurred while development was below a certain threshold, although indicator loss accelerated once this threshold was reached. Most of the pairwise relationships between the five environmental indicators were synergistic; only carbon storage and charcoal production, and charcoal production and recreational accessibility showed trade-offs. Trade-off analysis and land use optimization using Pareto frontiers could be a useful decision-support tool for understanding how changes in land use and coastal management will impact the ability of ecosystems to provide environmental benefits.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				NOV	2017	60	5					961	973		10.1007/s00267-017-0924-2								WOS:000412755900012	28835991

Pelagic bioregionalisation using open-access data for better planning of marine protected area networks	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Systematic conservation planning (SCP) to design marine protected areas (MPAs) has traditionally focused on species distributions or benthic habitat features that drive the determination of conservation priorities. Pelagic ecosystem protection is usually incidental because these ecosystems are often data poor and are difficult to visualize in a planning context. Pelagic ecosystems, however, face increasing and cumulative impacts from threats such as overfishing and climate change, and a precautionary approach is required to protect both known and unknown biodiversity patterns and ecosystem processes. Data-driven pelagic habitat classifications are important when planning for habitat protection in the absence of sufficient in-situ data. In this study, we describe a method for creating a bioregional map of the upper-mixed layer of South Africa's pelagic realm. We selected relevant variables and parameters that best reflect key ecosystem properties at broad, meso, and local scales. We conducted a hierarchal cluster analysis using open-access sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll-a (chl-a), net primary productivity (NPP), mean sea level anomalies (MSLA), and seabed slope and depth data. The resulting map delineates three bioregions subdivided into seven biozones and sixteen pelagic habitats within South Africa's continental Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). This habitat map was incorporated into SCP of a proposed expanded MPA network that includes offshore protected areas and meets National objectives. The proposed network will increase protection of the pelagic realm (>30 m depth) of the EEZ from 0.002% to 6.0%. We contend that bioregional analyses based on publicly available remote-sensing data are useful for identification of offshore habitats, especially when robust biological data are unavailable, as a framework for ecosystem reporting, and for inclusion in a systematic design for a representative offshore MPA network. Further research should focus on modelling and mapping the permanence of pelagic habitats and different spatio-temporal scales of variability, validating habitat boundaries with biological data, and understanding the threats and efficacy of achieving pelagic protection through management mechanisms like MPAs.

In floodplain forests, historical pressures interplay with the complex multiscale dynamics of fluvial systems and require integrative approaches to pinpoint drivers for their deterioration and ecosystem services loss. Combining a conceptual framework such as the Driver Pressure -State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) with the development of valid biological indicators can contribute to the analysis of the driving forces and their effects on the ecosystem in order to formulate coordinated conservation measures. In the present study, we evaluate the initial results of a decade (2004-2014) of floodplain forest monitoring. We adopted the DPSIR framework to summarize the main drivers in land use and environmental change, analyzed the effects on biological indicators of foundation trees and compared the consistency of the main drivers and their effects at two spatial scales. The" monitoring program was conducted in one of the largest and best preserved floodplain forests in SW Europe located within Dofiana National Park (Spain) which is dominated by Salix atrocinerea and Fraxinus angustifolia. The program combined field (in situ) surveys on a network of permanent plots with several remote sensing sources. The accuracy obtained in spectral classifications allowed shifts in species cover across the whole forest to be detected and assessed. However, remote sensing did not reflect the ecological status of forest populations. The field survey revealed a general decline in Salix populations, especially in the first five years of sampling a factor probably associated with a lag effect from past human impact on the hydrology of the catchment and recent extreme climatic episodes (drought). In spite of much reduced seed regeneration, a resprouting strategy allows long-lived Salix individuals to persist in complex spatial dynamics. This suggests the beginning of a recovery resulting from recent coordinated societal responses to control excessive water extraction in the catchment, highlighting the need for continuing long-term monitoring. The DPSIR framework proved useful as a conceptual tool in analyzing the entire environmental system, while both field and remote sensing approaches complemented each other in quantifying indicator trends, improving the monitoring design and informing conservation plans.

However, no studies have quantified avian responses to powerful ground-based light sources in urban areas. We studied effects of ALAN on migrating birds by monitoring the beams of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum's "Tribute in Light" in New York, quantifying behavioral responses with radar and acoustic sensors and modeling disorientation and attraction with simulations. This single light source induced significant behavioral alterations in birds, even in good visibility conditions, in this heavily photopolluted environment, and to altitudes up to 4 km. We estimate that the installation influenced approximate to 1.1 million birds during our study period of 7 d over 7 y. When the installation was illuminated, birds aggregated in high densities, decreased flight speeds, followed circular flight paths, and vocalized frequently. Simulations revealed a high probability of disorientation and subsequent attraction for nearby birds, and bird densities near the installation exceeded magnitudes 20 times greater than surrounding baseline densities during each year's observations. However, behavioral disruptions disappeared when lights were extinguished, suggesting that selective removal of light during nights with substantial bird migration is a viable strategy for minimizing potentially fatal interactions among ALAN, structures, and birds. Our results also highlight the value of additional studies describing behavioral patterns of nocturnally migrating birds in powerful lights in urban areas as well as conservation implications for such lighting installations.

J	Day, T				Day, Terence			The Contribution of Physical Geographers to Sustainability Research	SUSTAINABILITY												A physical geographers' scope of practice is not defined by any regulatory or academic organization, so perception of the potential contribution of physical geography to sustainability research has been nebulous or informal, at best. In order to understand what physical geographers can do to enhance sustainability, this paper describes a systematic review of peer-reviewed research on sustainability published in three physical geography journals. The results show that physical geographers are active in sustainability research in terms of a spatial perspective, an understanding of human interactions with the environment, and an ability to recognize, interpret, and project environmental change and its impacts. The depth of this understanding is facilitated by a physical geographers' understanding of the natural world, process and system concepts, the ways that systems are linked and interact, and a willingness to deploy a wide range of methodologies to secure that knowledge. The expertise of physical geographers makes an important contribution to sustainability research and should be considered when multidisciplinary teams are assembled.																	2071-1050					OCT	2017	9	10							1851	10.3390/su9101851								WOS:000414896200181

Revisiting Ecosystem Services: Assessment and Valuation as Starting Points for Environmental Politics	SUSTAINABILITY												The paradigm of ecosystem services (ES) and the methods of monetary valuation have become boundary objects, spanning disciplines and earning particular purchase in policy circles. However, the notion of ES and ES valuation have also been subjected to multiple critiques, ranging from their varying precision to the potential for neoliberalization of nature. This paper does not attempt to refute such critiques but rather revisits the potentials of the ES paradigm and the specific method of benefit transfer valuation for their utility as a form of environmental politics and sustainability practice. We find they have particular relevance in contexts where "data" are not readily available or are not legible to policy makers as well as where the imperative of "development" remains ideological. We argue for ES assessment and, specifically, rapid ES valuation as a first-pass tactic to inform evaluation of potentially environmentally degrading projects or environmental management. We demonstrate this using a simple benefit transfer analysis to offer an initial evaluation of (wet) landscape ES in a lightly touched estuary in Karnataka, India, where a state-backed proposal to develop an industrial shipping port is gathering steam.

The rapid growth of deforestation has resulted in the loss of 91% of its original cover. Numerous efforts have been made to halt deforestation activities, however farmers' perception towards the forest and its benefits has not been considered either in studies conducted so far or by policy makers. This research provides the first multi-temporal analysis of the dynamics of the forest within the BAAPA region on the one hand, and assesses the way farmers perceive the forest and how this influences forest conservation at the farm level on the other. Remote sensing data acquired from Landsat images from 1999 to 2016 were used to measure the extent of the forest cover and deforestation rates over 17 years. Farmers' influence on the dynamics of the forest was evaluated by combining earth observation data and household survey results conducted in the BAAPA region in 2016. Outcomes obtained in this study demonstrate a total loss in forest cover of 7500 km(2). Deforestation rates in protected areas were determined by management regimes. The combination of household level and remote sensing data demonstrated that forest dynamics at the farm level is influenced by farm type, the level of dependency/use of forest benefits and the level of education of forest owners. An understanding of the social value awarded to the forest is a relevant contribution towards preserving natural resources.																	1999-4907					OCT	2017	8	10							389	10.3390/f8100389								WOS:000414627600036

Methods that apply remote sensing to calculate the C factor at a regional scale cannot directly use the C factor formula. That is because the C factor formula is obtained by experiments, and needs the coverage ratio data of croplands, woodlands, and grasslands at a standard plot scale. In this paper, we present a C factor conversion method from a standard plot to a km-sized grid based on large sample theory and multi-scale remote sensing. The results show that: (1) Compared with the existing C factor formula, our method is based on the coverage ratio of croplands, woodlands, and grasslands on a km-sized grid, and takes the C factor formula obtained from the standard plot experiment and applies it to a regional scale. This method improves the applicability of the C factor formula, and can satisfy the need to simulate soil erosion in large areas; (2) The vegetation coverage obtained by remote sensing interpretation is significantly consistent (paired samples t-test, t = -0.03, df = 0.12, 2-tail significance p < 0.05) and significantly correlated with the measured vegetation coverage; (3) The C factor of the study area is smaller in the middle, southern, and northern regions, and larger in the eastern and western regions. The main reason for that is the distribution of woodlands, the Hunshandake and Horqin sandy lands, and the valleys affected by human activities; (4) The method presented in this paper is more meticulous than the C factor method based on the vegetation index, improves the applicability of the C factor formula, and can be used to simulate soil erosion on a large scale and provide strong support for regional soil and water conservation planning.																	2072-4292					OCT	2017	9	10							1035	10.3390/rs9101035								WOS:000414650600065						
J	Mulatu, KA; Mora, B; Kooistra, L; Herold, M				Mulatu, Kalkidan Ayele; Mora, Brice; Kooistra, Lammert; Herold, Martin			Biodiversity Monitoring in Changing Tropical Forests: A Review of Approaches and New Opportunities	REMOTE SENSING												Tropical forests host at least two-thirds of the world's flora and fauna diversity and store 25% of the terrestrial above and belowground carbon. However, biodiversity decline due to deforestation and forest degradation of tropical forest is increasing at an alarming rate. Biodiversity dynamics due to natural and anthropogenic disturbances are mainly monitored using established field survey approaches. However, such approaches appear to fall short at addressing complex disturbance factors and responses. We argue that the integration of state-of-the-art monitoring approaches can improve the detection of subtle biodiversity disturbances and responses in changing tropical forests, which are often data-poor. We assess the state-of-the-art technologies used to monitor biodiversity dynamics of changing tropical forests, and how their potential integration can increase the detail and accuracy of biodiversity monitoring. Moreover, the relevance of these biodiversity monitoring techniques in support of the UNCBD Aichi targets was explored using the Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) as a framework. Our review indicates that although established field surveys were generally the dominant monitoring systems employed, the temporal trend of monitoring approaches indicates the increasing application of remote sensing and in -situ sensors in detecting disturbances related to agricultural activities, logging, hunting and infrastructure. The relevance of new technologies (i.e., remote sensing, in situ sensors, and DNA barcoding) in operationalising EBVs (especially towards the ecosystem structure, ecosystem function, and species population classes) and the Aichi targets has been assessed. Remote sensing application is limited for EBV classes such as genetic composition and species traits but was found most suitable for ecosystem structure class. The complementarity of remote sensing and emerging technologies were shown in relation to EBV candidates such as species distribution, net primary productivity, and habitat structure. We also developed a framework based on the primary biodiversity attributes, which indicated the potential of integration between monitoring approaches. In situ sensors are suitable to help measure biodiversity composition, while approaches based on remote sensing are powerful for addressing structural and functional biodiversity attributes. We conclude that, synergy between the recent biodiversity monitoring approaches is important and possible. However, testing the suitability of monitoring methods across scales, integrating heterogeneous monitoring technologies, setting up metadata standards, and making interpolation and/or extrapolation from observation at different scales is still required to design a robust biodiversity monitoring system that can contribute to effective conservation measures.

J	Naumov, V; Angelstam, P; Elbakidze, M				Naumov, Vladimir; Angelstam, Per; Elbakidze, Marine			Satisfying rival forestry objectives in the Komi Republic: effects of Russian zoning policy change on wood production and riparian forest conservation	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												Spatial segregation of different forest landscape functions can accommodate rival forestry objectives more comprehensively than integrated approaches. Russia has a unique history of forest zoning separating production and environmental functions. However, the Russian Forest Code of 2006 increased the focus on wood production. We reviewed the history of zoning policy in Russia and assessed if the recent policy change affected logging rates and conservation of riparian forests. Using Russia's Komi Republic as a case study, we specifically assessed (i) if policy change led to increased logging near streams, (ii) if logging rates were different in headwaters vs. main rivers, and (iii) how logging changed among catchments with different accessibility to logging. Using a global open-access remote sensing dataset, we compared mean annual forest loss as a proxy of logging rates in 10 large forested catchments in the Komi Republic in one period with strict zoning policy (2000-2006) and one with moderate zoning policy (2007-2014). Harvesting rate was positively related to the distance from streams. On the other hand, it increased after the policy change in the buffer zone but decreased outside it. Forests were harvested more in headwater buffers than along larger rivers, and harvest in the catchments near industries was higher and increasing; remote catchments had low forest loss. We discuss the opportunity for adopting forest zoning policy in different governance contexts.																	0045-5067	1208-6037				OCT	2017	47	10					1339	1349		10.1139/cjfr-2016-0516								WOS:000413923400004

The development and application of remote sensing to monitor sand dune habitats	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												Sand dunes are complex systems that contain several habitats, often as mosaics or transitions between types. Several of these habitats are afforded protection under European Legislation and in the UK nationally within Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) and Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Natural England has a statutory duty to report to Europe on the conservation status and condition of sand dunes; and is required to report to the UK Government on designated sites. To achieve this we have sought ways of capturing, analysing and interpreting data on the extent and location of sand dune habitats. This requires an ability to be able to obtain data over large areas of coastline in an efficient way. Natural England and Environment Agency Geomatics have worked collaboratively for over 16 years, sharing data and ecological knowledge. In 2012 work started to evaluate the use of remote sensing to map UK BAP and Annex I sand dune habitats. A methodology has now been developed and tested to map sand dune habitats. The key objective was to provide an operational tool that will help to map these habitats and understand change on sites around England. This has been achieved through analysis of LIDAR and Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) data using Object Orientated Image Analysis. Quality Control (QC) and accuracy assessments have shown this approach to be successful and 11 sites have been mapped to date. These techniques are providing a new approach to monitoring change in coastal vegetation communities and informing management of protected sites.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				OCT	2017	21	5					643	656		10.1007/s11852-017-0504-x								WOS:000414166600007

Development of National Database on Long-term Deforestation in Sri Lanka	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Sri Lanka is one of the biodiversity hotspots of the world. This study has utilized satellite remote sensing and GIS techniques to generate a nation-wide database on forests, forest types and land use/land cover of Sri Lanka. Spatial assessment of forest cover changes was carried out for the periods 1976-1985, 1985-1994, 1994-2005 and 2005-2014. The landscape fragmentation analysis has carried out to calculate the spatial and temporal patterns of forest. Land use/land cover map was prepared representing seven classes in 2014. The plantations occupy a large area (34.2%) followed by forests (33.4%) and agriculture (26.1%) in 2014. During the period of 1976-2014, the forest has been decreased by 5.5%. From 1976 to 1985 forest recorded a loss at an annual rate of 0.49%. This annual rate decreased to 0.01% during 2005-2014 indicates declining trend of deforestation and effective conservation measures. The study found deforestation hotspots in south east and northern most parts of the Sri Lanka. Total number of patches estimated has increased from 15193 in 1976 to 16136 in 2014. The study has found that main causes of deforestation in Sri Lanka were due to expansion of agriculture and plantations. The extent of change detected in the study through geospatial techniques has significance to the forest ecology and management of natural landscapes in Sri Lanka.																	0255-660X	0974-3006				OCT	2017	45	5					825	836		10.1007/s12524-016-0636-8								WOS:000413689600010

First, change rates of forests and residential areas were mapped using Landsat satellite images in 1972-1987, 1987-2000 and 2000-2010. Then, the forest change patterns were interpreted using univariate local Moran's I (local univariate spatial autocorrelation), and the spatial autocorrelation between deforestation and residential growth was tested through bivariate local Moran's I (bivariate local spatial autocorrelation). Furthermore, the spatial relationships between deforestation and residential growth rates were quantified by ordinary least squares, spatial lag (SL) and geographically weighted regression. Results indicated that approximately 25% of forests have been converted to other land-use types in the span of 38years, since 1972. Local univariate spatial autocorrelation maps showed that significant values of high-high cluster scattered in all locations in the first span, in the east and south aspects in the second duration, and in the eastern part in the third span. Bivariate local spatial autocorrelation indicated a meaningful Moran's I values of -0.12, -0.26 and -0.20 between deforestation and residential growth, chronologically. Analyses of spatial regression models showed that geographically weighted regression performed better than SL and ordinary least squares in the first (R-2 = 0.315, AIC = 6,160) and third periods (R-2 = 0.27, AIC = 6,351), whereas, the validity of SL was the highest in the second period (R-2 = 0.36, AIC = 6,288). However, the overall trends of deforestation and residential growth have decreased, but the rate of deforestation induced by residential growth is still significant. Spatial exploration of residential growth in deforestation leads to determine its influences in local scale for better conservation of these valuable natural resources.

Fungi are a megadiverse taxonomic group where lack of knowledge impedes sufficient conservation focus. Inventories of fungi require a high level of expertise and are difficult and expensive due to seasonal variation and fluctuation in sporocarp formation. Lidar offers objective, fine-resolution and potentially cheap and broad scale data for representing vegetation structure and has proven useful for prediction of the diversity of plant and animal species. In this study, we used lidar-derived variables as explanatory variables in models of fungal species richness and controlling gradients of species composition, represented by three ordination axes derived from multidimensional scaling. The fungal data comprised a data set of 1527 species recorded in three inventories of 121 sites covering all major terrestrial habitat types across Denmark. We compared the performance of lidar-derived explanatory variables with two field inventory-based sets of variables: 1) lists of vascular plants and 2) recordings of soil, microclimate and vegetation structure. Lidar-derived variables performed best in predicting fungal richness and the first ordination axis, interpreted as a gradient from low and open herb-dominated communities over Closed swards and scrubs to closed-canopy forests (cross validated r(2) of 0.50 and 0.81, respectively). The number of red-listed species and the second ordination axis were poorly predicted by lidar, and the third ordination axis was equally well detected by the three explanatory sets of variables (cross validated r(2) of 0.38). From a fungal conservation perspective, it is promising that lidar-based variables hold information suitable for detecting major gradients in fungal richness and composition.

J	Andrew, ME; Warrener, H				Andrew, Margaret E.; Warrener, Haylea			Detecting microrefugia in semi-arid landscapes from remotely sensed vegetation dynamics	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Microrefugia are sites with stable, high quality habitat within landscapes characterized by dynamic environmental conditions driven by climate variability or ecological disturbances. There is considerable interest in the potential of microrefugia to provide climate change resilience to landscapes and to biodiversity conservation. Although attractive conceptually, there is yet little guidance on how to identify climate change microrefugia in order to study and protect them, and the data required to do so are often lacking. This study demonstrates how time series remote sensing, using all available Landsat images of a study area, can be used to directly detect microrefugia maintained by water subsidies in a semi-arid landscape in southwest Western Australia. Microrefugia were identified as pixels with abundant vegetation and consistent vegetation dynamics between wet and dry years. At every pixel, a harmonic model was fit to the intra-annual time series of vegetation index values compiled from the wettest years in the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) archive. This model was then used to predict the phenological cycle of the driest years at that pixel. Candidate microrefugia were defined to be those pixels with (1) high vegetation activity in dry years and (2) highly predictable phenologies that are consistent regardless of the weather conditions experienced in a given year. Spatial relationships between candidate microrefugia and landscape features associated with elevated moisture availability (thought to drive climate microrefugia in these semi-arid landscapes) were assessed. The candidate microrefugia show great promise. Evaluations against high-resolution imagery reveal that candidate microrefugia most likely buffer against drought, although refugia from other disturbances, especially fire, were also detected. In contrast, spatial proxies of the physical features expected to maintain microrefugia failed to adequately represent the distribution of microrefugia across the landscape, likely due to data quality and the heterogeneity of microrefugia. Direct detection of microrefugia with Earth observation data is a promising solution in data limited regions. Landsat time series analyses are well suited to this application as they can characterize both the habitat quality and stability aspects of microrefugia.																	0034-4257	1879-0704				OCT	2017	200						114	124		10.1016/j.rse.2017.08.005								WOS:000412607600009

Using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS), this study took the northern area of Liaodong Bay as a case study to reveal shoreline changes to wetlands and to delineate coastal wetland loss and landscape succession both outside and inside reclamation areas. Results showed that: 1) Shoreline change fell into three stages: slow accretion (1977-1985), fast erosion (1985-1993) and rapid advancement (1993-2002, 2002-2014). 2) Reclamation has converted 85% of natural coastal wetlands into artificial coastal wetlands and non-wetland, causing significant wetland fragmentation. 3) The traditional landscape succession over nearly four decades went from natural coastal wetlands to inland halophytes/reed swamps to aquaculture ponds/cultivated lands and then to built-up areas. Due to advanced reclamation technologies, the successional process was simplified and the time was shortened. The accelerated industrialization and urbanization following economic reforms and population growth have greatly affected landscape succession through the increase of artificial coastlines and built-up areas. It is our anticipation that this work can provide valuable information for the management and conservation of the coastal zone in the future.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				OCT	2017	37	5					885	897		10.1007/s13157-017-0922-4								WOS:000412655600008

The present study used Geographic Information System and remote sensing technology to analyze temporal and spatial dynamics of landscape pattern and related driving forces in the Ebinur Lake Wetland National Nature Reserve (ELWNNR) in China. We used Landsat images from 1972, 1998, 2007 and 2013, and classified the landscape into six types of land cover: water body, wetland, vegetation, salinized land, desert, and other objects (i.e., Gobi and Mountain). Landscape transition matrices and change pattern analysis were used understand wetland dynamics. Our results showed that land cover had changed dramatically during 1972-2013. The spatial extent of much of the wetland areas in the ELWNNR had reduced gradually from 1972 to 2007, and wetland loss occurred more rapidly after 2007. From 1972 to 2013, 415.8 km(2) of wetland area had been lost and only 250.1 km(2) wetland area had expanded, which represents a 22% decrease in wetland area in the ELWNNR. At the same time, the landscape pattern experienced diverse changes in the Nature Reserve. The high-density human population of the region has an intensive effect on the region. Wetlands in the nature reserve have also changed with recent rapid development in the region. This study may provide scientific information for developing effective and sustainable conservation plans for the ELWNNR.																	0923-4861	1572-9834				OCT	2017	25	5					619	637		10.1007/s11273-017-9541-3								WOS:000413604400008

Following this, we retrieved vegetation cover data from the Chongqing area between 2001 and 2010 using this dataset, applying a dimidiate pixel method. We then used several analytical indices to analyze spatial and temporal changes and trends related to these changes. We determined that a reconstruction of the MODIS NDVI dataset using asymmetric Gaussian fitting in conjunction with a data quality weight coefficient improved data quality and created a foundation for accurate estimations of vegetation cover. We also determined that vegetation cover in the Chongqing area decreased gradually from east to west. During the 10-year study period, vegetation cover in the Chongqing area generally increased, changing from low to high coverage. This increase in vegetation cover was mainly the result of ecological protection policies and improving climate conditions. We also found that changes in vegetation cover were mainly the result of urban construction and afforestation initiatives, but vegetation cover improved overall.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				OCT	2017	189	10							493	10.1007/s10661-017-6210-1								WOS:000411166100011	28884302

A Methodological Experiment on Crop Residue Cover Measurement in Ethiopia	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Maintaining permanent coverage of the soil using crop residues is an important and commonly recommended practice in conservation agriculture. Measuring this practice is an essential step in improving knowledge about the adoption and impact of conservation agriculture. Different data collection methods can be implemented to capture the field level crop residue coverage for a given plot, each with its own implication on survey budget, implementation speed and respondent and interviewer burden. In this paper, six alternative methods of crop residue coverage measurement are tested among the same sample of rural households in Ethiopia. The relative accuracy of these methods are compared against a benchmark, the line-transect method. The alternative methods compared against the benchmark include: (i) interviewee (respondent) estimation; (ii) enumerator estimation visiting the field; (iii) interviewee with visual-aid without visiting the field; (iv) enumerator with visual-aid visiting the field; (v) field picture collected with a drone and analyzed with image-processing methods and (vi) satellite picture of the field analyzed with remote sensing methods. Results of the methodological experiment show that survey-based methods tend to underestimate field residue cover. When quantitative data on cover are needed, the best estimates are provided by visual-aid protocols. For categorical analysis (i.e., > 30% cover or not), visual-aid protocols and remote sensing methods perform equally well. Among survey-based methods, the strongest correlates of measurement errors are total farm size, field size, distance, and slope. Results deliver a ranking of measurement options that can inform survey practitioners and researchers.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				OCT	2017	60	4					705	716		10.1007/s00267-017-0898-0								WOS:000410806800011	28597052

Should I stay or should I go? Modelling year-round habitat suitability and drivers of residency for fin whales in the California Current	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim: Understanding the spatial ecology of endangered species is crucial to predicting habitat use at scales relevant to conservation and management. Here, we aim to model the influence of biophysical conditions on habitat suitability for endangered fin whales Balaenoptera physalus, with a view to informing management in a heavily impacted ocean region. Location: We satellite-tracked the movements of 67 fin whales through the California Current System (CCS), a dynamic eastern boundary upwelling ecosystem in the Northeast Pacific. Methods: We use a multi-scale modelling framework to elucidate biophysical influences on habitat suitability for fin whales in the CCS. Using generalized additive mixed models, we quantify the influence of a suite of remotely sensed variables on broad-scale patterns of occupancy and present the first year-round, high-resolution predictions of seasonal habitat suitability. Further, we model the influence of contemporaneous biophysical conditions on individual-level residence times in high-use habitat. Results: We present evidence of year-round habitat suitability in the southern California Current System, robust to interannual variability, establishing that North Pacific fin whales do not follow the canonical baleen whale migration model. Within the high-use habitat in the Southern California Bight (SCB), individual-level residency in localized areas (n = 16 for > 30 days; n = 4 for > 6 months) was associated with warm, shallow, nearshore waters (> 18 degrees C, < 500 m), with cool waters (14-15 degrees C) occurring over complex seafloor topographies and with convergent (sub) mesoscale structures at the surface. Main Conclusions: Biophysical conditions in the southern CCS generate productive foraging habitats that can support the fin whale population year-round and allow for extended periods of residency in localized areas. High-use habitats for fin whales are colocated with areas of intense human use, including international shipping routes and a major naval training range. Seasonal habitat suitability maps presented here could inform the management of anthropogenic threats to endangered baleen whales in this globally significant biodiversity hotspot.

J	Cao, S; Sanchez-Azofeifa, A				Cao, Sen; Sanchez-Azofeifa, Arturo			Modeling seasonal surface temperature variations in secondary tropical dry forests	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Secondary tropical dry forests (TDFs) provide important ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, and nutrient cycle regulation. However, their biogeophysical processes at the canopy atmosphere interface remain unknown, limiting our understanding of how this endangered ecosystem influences, and responds to the ongoing global warming. To facilitate future development of conservation policies, this study characterized the seasonal land surface temperature (LST) behavior of three successional stages (early, intermediate, and late) of a TDF, at the Santa Rosa National Park (SRNP), Costa Rica. A total of 38 Landsat-8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) data and the Surface Reflectance (SR) product were utilized to model LST time series from July 2013 to July 2016 using a radiative transfer equation (RTE) algorithm. We further related the LST time series to seven vegetation indices which reflect different properties of TDFs, and soil moisture data obtained from a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Results showed that the LST in the dry season was 15-20 K higher than in the wet season at SRNP. We found that the early successional stages were about 6-8 K warmer than the intermediate successional stages and were 9-10 K warmer than the late successional stages in the middle of the dry season; meanwhile, a minimum LST difference (0-1 K) was observed at the end of the wet season. Leaf phenology and canopy architecture explained most LST variations in both dry and wet seasons. However, our analysis revealed that it is precipitation that ultimately determines the LST variations through both biogeochemical (leaf phenology) and biogeophysical processes (evapotranspiration) of the plants. Results of this study could help physiological modeling studies in secondary TDFs.																	0303-2434					OCT	2017	62						122	134		10.1016/j.jag.2017.06.008								WOS:000408787100012

Measuring land-use and land-cover change using the US department of agriculture's cropland data layer: Cautions and recommendations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Monitoring agricultural land is important for understanding and managing food production, environmental conservation efforts, and climate change. The United States Department of Agriculture's Cropland Data Layer (CDL), an annual satellite imagery-derived land cover map, has been increasingly used for this application since complete coverage of the conterminous United States became available in 2008. However, the CDL is designed and produced with the intent of mapping annual land cover rather than tracking changes over time, and as a result certain precautions are needed in multi-year change analyses to minimize error and misapplication. We highlight scenarios that require special considerations, suggest solutions to key challenges, and propose a set of recommended good practices and general guidelines for CDL-based land change estimation. We also characterize a problematic issue of crop area underestimation bias within the CDL that needs to be accounted for and corrected when calculating changes to crop and cropland areas. When used appropriately and in conjunction with related information, the CDL is a valuable and effective tool for detecting diverse trends in agriculture. By explicitly discussing the methods and techniques for post-classification measurement of land-cover and land-use change using the CDL, we aim to further stimulate the discourse and continued development of suitable methodologies. Recommendations generated here are intended specifically for the CDL but may be broadly applicable to additional remotely-sensed land cover datasets including the National Land Cover Database (NLCD), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based land cover products, and other regional, national, and global land cover classification maps.																	0303-2434					OCT	2017	62						224	235		10.1016/j.jag.2017.06.007								WOS:000408787100021

Consequences of these socio-economic and political changes on ecosystems are largely uncertain, but there is growing concern about derived increases in environmental degradation. Here, we review the capacity of Colombia to monitor the state of its ecosystems and their rate of change over time. We found several important programs currently set in place by different institutions as well as by independent groups of scientists that address different aspects of environmental monitoring. However, most of the current initiatives could be improved in terms of data coverage, quality and access, and could be better articulated among each other. We propose a set of activities that would increase the capacity of Colombia to monitor its ecosystems, provide useful information to policy makers, and facilitate scientific research. These include: 1) the establishment of a national center for ecological synthesis that focuses on analyzing existing information; 2) the establishment of an ecological observatory system that collects new information, integrates remote sensing products, and produces near real-time products on key ecological variables; and 3) the creation of new platforms for dialog and action within existing scientific and policy groups.				anaya acevedo, jesus adolfo/J-3679-2016	anaya acevedo, jesus adolfo/0000-0001-8242-5712; Feilhauer, Hannes/0000-0001-5758-6303; Posada, Juan M./0000-0001-7794-9300; Reu, Bjorn/0000-0001-5271-6420; JIMENEZ, Rodrigo/0000-0002-8665-9484; Armenteras, Dolors/0000-0003-0922-7298												1462-9011	1873-6416				OCT	2017	76						40	49		10.1016/j.envsci.2017.06.011								WOS:000407981300005

The uncertainty and applicability of these heat source data are evaluated. Analysis regarding the formation of the AHS over the TP demonstrates that it is not only the cause of the atmospheric circulation, but is also a result of that circulation. Based on numerical experiments, the review further demonstrates that land-sea thermal contrast is only one part of the monsoon story. The thermal forcing of the Tibetan-Iranian Plateau plays a significant role in generating the Asian summer monsoon (ASM), i.e., in addition to pumping water vapor from sea to land and from the lower to the upper troposphere, it also generates a subtropical monsoon-type meridional circulation subject to the angular momentum conservation, providing an ascending-air large-scale background for the development of the ASM.																	0256-1530	1861-9533				OCT	2017	34	10			SI		1169	1184		10.1007/s00376-017-7014-5								WOS:000407841400005

Although migratory species move across a wide range of environments during migration, their dynamic response to environments has rarely been considered. Taking advantage of the fine spatial-temporal resolution of satellite tracking data, we studied habitat selection of East Asian greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons) along their spring migration route from Yangtze River Basin to Lena Delta and Yana Bay. We developed a novel methodology to improve dynamic species distribution models (SDMs) by incorporating environmental variables derived from remotely sensed data precisely corresponding to migration time. Our results demonstrate that distance to the nearest water body, elevation, human population density and temperature contribute greatly to the models. Water-related and topographic factors (e.g., elevation, slope and distance to the nearest water body) were consistently associated with habitat selection of the geese from wintering area to breeding area, while the varied influences of temperature and human population density in different migration periods are closely related to their adaptation to local environments. In addition, response curves of vegetation index indicate that the geese are more strongly associated with food quality than quantity in wintering area and stopover sites. By building SDMs in different periods, we provide a unique dynamic perspective on how a long-distance migrant responds to different environments. The methodology proposed here could be integrated to future conservation management plans for predicting species relationship with fast changing environmental conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, performance indicators of forest PAs are typically restricted to deforestation, although the extent of forest degradation is greater. We address these shortfalls through an empirical impact evaluation of state PAs, Indigenous Territories (ITs), and civil society and private Conservation Concessions (CCs) on deforestation and degradation throughout the Peruvian Amazon. We integrated remote-sensing data with environmental and socio-economic datasets, and used propensity-score matching to assess: (i) how deforestation and degradation varied across governance regimes between 2006-2011; (ii) their proximate drivers; and (iii) whether state PAs, CCs and ITs avoided deforestation and degradation compared with logging and mining concessions, and the unprotected landscape. CCs, state PAs, and ITs all avoided deforestation and degradation compared to analogous areas in the unprotected landscape. CCs and ITs were on average more effective in this respect than state PAs, showing that local governance can be equally or more effective than centralized state regimes. However, there were no consistent differences between conservation governance regimes when matched to logging and mining concessions. Future impact assessments would therefore benefit from further disentangling governance regimes across unprotected land.

A comprehensive methodology that integrates Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques was adopted to determine the soil erosion vulnerability within Katabuvuga, Nyamyumba and Mukamira watersheds in western part of Rwanda, with the aim of supporting planning of land and water management interventions. The dominant slop class in all watershed was 16-40% covering 50% in Katabuvuga watershed, 43% in Mukamira watershed and 70.6% in Nyamyumba watershed. High erosion risk was recorded in Mukamira (72 %) and it was followed by Nyamyumba (46 %). The average soil loss in selected watersheds was 32t/ha/year. Among the various studied watershed, highest average loss was reported in Nyamyumba watershed (37t/ha/year) while the lowest average was in Mukamira watershed (28t/ha/year). Soil loss was higher in cropland and lower in settlement. The average loss of nutrients was 1705 kg/ha/year of carbon, 155 kg/ha/year of nitrogen, 3 kg/ha/year of phosphurus and 111 kg/ha/year of potassium, the highest nutrient loss occurred in cropland. Based on the cost of NPK the average value of N lost per ha per year is 167507 Rwandan Francs (Rwf) while the value of P and K loss per ha per year is 3309 Rwf and 120189 Rwf respectively. The study shows that soil loss in studied watershed is high therefore compelling the appropriate soil conservation measures in order to make agricultural productivity sustainable. The spatial erosion risk maps generated with RUSLE method and GIS can serve as effective inputs for land use planning and management in the environmentally sensitive mountainous areas such as West Rwanda.																	2320-8694					SEP	2017	5	4					525	536		10.18006/2017.5(4).525.536								WOS:000415963200013

In this case study, we consider how two decades of pilot projects for integrated conservation and sustainable development (ICDPs) variously influenced forest governance across three agrarian reform settlements in northwestern Mato Grosso state. The analysis combines: i) remote sensing of deforestation from 1997-2015; ii) land use and economic data for individual settler farms and cooperatives; iii) settlers' perceptions regarding legitimacy and relevance of state policies, including land use regulations under the Brazilian Forest Code. Deforestation across settlements varied in association with synergies or lack thereof between policy instruments and socially embedded rules organizing economic alternatives to the dominant regional pattern of cattle ranching. In two of the settlements deforestation surpassed or was approaching 80% of their total area. In the third settlement deforestation stabilized at 45%, corresponding with the initiation of ICDP support for a pilot project focused on Brazil nut extractivism to consolidate community management of the settlement's collective forest reserve. The latter process involved a 'policy mix' or sequence of overlapping components: technical assistance, cooperative organization, environmental licensing, infrastructure, equitable contracts with surrounding indigenous communities and market development. Comparing with the two counterfactual cases, we suggest a framework for analysis of systemic socio-ecological change in settlements in the Brazilian Amazon, and reconsider the role of ICDPs in landscape approaches to environmental governance in tropical forests.

J	Singh, G; Panda, RK				Singh, Gurjeet; Panda, Rabindra Kumar			Grid-cell based assessment of soil erosion potential for identification of critical erosion prone areas using USLE, GIS and remote sensing: A case study in the Kapgari watershed, India	INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH												Estimation of soil erosion is of paramount importance due to its serious environmental and societal concern. Soil erosion would have impact on fertility of agricultural land and quality of water. The major objective of this study was to investigate the spatial heterogeneity of annual soil erosion on the grid-cell basis in a small agricultural watershed of eastern India. The study watershed has a drainage area of 973 ha and is subdivided into three sub-watersheds namely: KGSW1, KGSW2 and KGSW3, based on the land topography and drainage network. Average annual soil erosion was estimated on 100 m x 100 m grid-cells by integrating universal soil loss equation (USLE) model with GIS for subsequent identification of critical erosion prone areas. It was found that 82.63% area of the total watershed falls under slight erosion-class (0-5 t-ha(-1)-yr(-1)), 6.87% area lies under the moderate-erosion-class (5-10 t-ha(-1)-yr(-1)), 5.96% area is under high-erosion-class (10-20 t-ha(-1)-yr(-1)), 3.3% area of watershed lies under the very high-erosion-class (20-40 t-ha(-1)-yr(-1)) and 1.24% area falls under "severe-erosion-class" (40-80 t-ha(-1)yr(-1)). The study revealed that the sub-watershed KGSW3 is critical due to the presence of the highest number of critical erosion prone grid-cells. The sediment delivery ratio (SDR) was also estimated to analyze the contribution of sediment yield at the sub-watershed level. Lowest SDR for the whole watershed as compared to sub-watersheds indicates that most of the eroded soil got deposited in rice crop check-basins before reaching the outlet. The reported results can be used for prioritizing critical erosion prone areas and for determining appropriate soil erosion prevention and control measures.

Mapping of biotopes between Amasra and Inkum (Bartin), Western Black Sea Region of Turkey	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Aim: The aim of the study was to identify and map the biotope areas located between Amasra and Inkum settlements of Bartin Province, an important coastal province in the northwest of Black Sea Region in Turkey. This region represents the onshore Euxin part of Euro-Siberian phytogeographical province. Flora, abiotic characteristics, actual vegetation and land uses were taken into account for identification of biotopes found in the research area, which has a rich ecological and floristic diversity. Methodology: Remote sensing and GIS were effectively used for preparation and interpretation of data, and necessary satellite images, digital maps and databases for analysis were also generated. Composition of species belonging to plant cover was used as an indicator in addition to other factors for distinguishing different biotopes. Vegetation surveys were carried out and inventories were made in selected 156 sample plots that represent various ecological and floristic characteristics. Results: Eleven main biotopes were identified viz., deciduous forest lands, afforestation areas, agricultural lands, shrublands, cliffs, Inkum Dune area, Bartin Riverside, roadsides, degraded lands, urban settlements and rural settlements. These biotopes may be divided into 30 sub-biotopes. In other words, a total number of 41 biotopes were classified and mapped during the research. Interpretation: With the mapping of the biotopes covering species that have a special importance in the area, a base has been achieved to manage the formation of aims and the conservation status of the ecosystems special to the Black Sea at landscape level.																	0254-8704					SEP	2017	38	5			SI		1033	1042		10.22438/jeb/38/5(S1)/GM-20								WOS:000413107700020						
J	Allen, KE; Vasquez, SP				Allen, Karen E.; Vasquez, Steve Padgett			Forest cover, development, and sustainability in Costa Rica: Can one policy fit all?	LAND USE POLICY												Forest Transition Theory offers the hope that global economic development can continue in tandem with forest recovery. Costa Rica has been lauded for its successful forest transition-once the fastest deforesting country in Central America, forests began to regrow in the 1980s and have had a steady trajectory of recovery since. This forest regrowth can be linked temporally to Costa Rican policies that have promoted tourism and discouraged small-scale agriculture. We use a case study from the Bellbird Biological Corridor (Corredor Biologico Pajaro Campana; CBPC), Costa Rica, combining remote sensing analysis with interviews and ethnography, to unravel the relationship between national policy, forest regrowth, and social-ecological sustainability. The forest cover change analysis between 1986 and 2014 indicates that, at the parcel-level, national policy has served to promote farm abandonment in favor of tourism and that this change has been critical to forest regrowth. However, these changes have occurred within a development framework that has created new social-ecological challenges that threaten future forest and economic sustainability. Examining the parcel-level impacts of the driving forces of landscape change highlights that forest cover is an insufficient proxy for conservation success, and conservation policy focused primarily on forest recovery may create new sustainability challenges.																	0264-8377	1873-5754				SEP	2017	67						212	221		10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.05.008								WOS:000413280200019

Automatic Counting of Large Mammals from Very High Resolution Panchromatic Satellite Imagery	REMOTE SENSING												Estimating animal populations by direct counting is an essential component of wildlife conservation and management. However, conventional approaches (i.e., ground survey and aerial survey) have intrinsic constraints. Advances in image data capture and processing provide new opportunities for using applied remote sensing to count animals. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using very high resolution multispectral satellite images for animal detection, but to date, the practicality of detecting animals from space using panchromatic imagery has not been proven. This study demonstrates that it is possible to detect and count large mammals (e.g., wildebeests and zebras) from a single, very high resolution GeoEye-1 panchromatic image in open savanna. A novel semi-supervised object-based method that combines a wavelet algorithm and a fuzzy neural network was developed. To discern large mammals from their surroundings and discriminate between animals and non-targets, we used the wavelet technique to highlight potential objects. To make full use of geometric attributes, we carefully trained the classifier, using the adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system. Our proposed method (with an accuracy index of 0.79) significantly outperformed the traditional threshold-based method (with an accuracy index of 0.58) detecting large mammals in open savanna.

Improving the prediction of African savanna vegetation variables using time series of MODIS products	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												African savanna vegetation is subject to extensive degradation as a result of rapid climate and land use change. To better understand these changes detailed assessment of vegetation structure is needed across an extensive spatial scale and at a fine temporal resolution. Applying remote sensing techniques to savanna vegetation is challenging due to sparse cover, high background soil signal, and difficulty to differentiate between spectral signals of bare soil and dry vegetation. In this paper, we attempt to resolve these challenges by analyzing time series of four MODIS Vegetation Products (VPs): Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) for Etosha National Park, a semiarid savanna in north-central Namibia. We create models to predict the density, cover, and biomass of the main savanna vegetation forms: grass, shrubs, and trees. To calibrate remote sensing data we developed an extensive and relatively rapid field methodology and measured herbaceous and woody vegetation during both the dry and wet seasons. We compared the efficacy of the four MODIS-derived VPs in predicting vegetation field measured variables. We then compared the optimal time span of VP time series to predict ground-measured vegetation. We found that Multiyear Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) models were superior to single year or single date models. Our results show that NDVI-based PLSR models yield robust prediction of tree density (R-2 = 0.79, relative Root Mean Square Error, rRMSE = 1.9%) and tree cover (R-2 = 0.78, rRMSE = 0.3%). EVI provided the best model for shrub density (R-2 = 0.82) and shrub cover (R-2 = 0.83), but was only marginally superior over models based on other VPs. FPAR was the best predictor of vegetation biomass of trees (R-2 = 0.76), shrubs (R-2 = 0.83), and grass (R-2 = 0.91). Finally, we addressed an enduring challenge in the remote sensing of semiarid vegetation by examining the transferability of predictive models through space and time. Our results show that models created in the wetter part of Etosha could accurately predict trees' and shrubs' variables in the drier part of the reserve and vice versa. Moreover, our results demonstrate that models created for vegetation variables in the dry season of 2011 could be successfully applied to predict vegetation in the wet season of 2012. We conclude that extensive field data combined with multiyear time series of MODIS vegetation products can produce robust predictive models for multiple vegetation forms in the African savanna. These methods advance the monitoring of savanna vegetation dynamics and contribute to improved management and conservation of these valuable ecosystems.

Soil erosion is one of the major hazards affected by the climate change, particularly the increasing intensity of rainfall resulted in increasing erosion, apart from other factors like landuse change. Changes in climate have an adverse effect with increasing rainfall. It has caused increasing concern for modeling the future rainfall and projecting future soil erosion. In the present study, future rainfall has been generated with the downscaling of GCM (Global Circulation Model) data of Mandakini river basin, a hilly catchment in the state of Uttarakhand, India, to obtain future impact on soil erosion within the basin. The USLE is an erosion prediction model designed to predict the long-term average annual soil loss from specific field slopes in specified landuse and management systems (i.e., crops, rangeland, and recreational areas) using remote sensing and GIS technologies. Future soil erosion has shown increasing trend due to increasing rainfall which has been generated from the statistical-based downscaling method.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				SEP	2017	7	5					2373	2383		10.1007/s13201-016-0419-y								WOS:000411096700024

A review of camera trapping for conservation behaviour research	REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												An understanding of animal behaviour is important if conservation initiatives are to be effective. However, quantifying the behaviour of wild animals presents significant challenges. Remote-sensing camera traps are becoming increasingly popular survey instruments that have been used to non-invasively study a variety of animal behaviours, yielding key insights into behavioural repertoires. They are well suited to ethological studies and provide considerable opportunities for generating conservation-relevant behavioural data if novel and robust methodological and analytical solutions can be developed. This paper reviews the current state of camera-trap-based ethological studies, describes new and emerging directions in camera-based conservation behaviour, and highlights a number of limitations and considerations of particular relevance for camera-based studies. Three promising areas of study are discussed: (1) documenting anthropogenic impacts on behaviour; (2) incorporating behavioural responses into management planning and (3) using behavioural indicators such as giving up densities and daily activity patterns. We emphasize the importance of reporting methodological details, utilizing emerging camera trap metadata standards and central data repositories for facilitating reproducibility, comparison and synthesis across studies. Behavioural studies using camera traps are in their infancy; the full potential of the technology is as yet unrealized. Researchers are encouraged to embrace conservation-driven hypotheses in order to meet future challenges and improve the efficacy of conservation and management processes.

The forest-savanna ecotone of the Eastern Central African Republic (CAR) is one such poorly studied area. Using camera traps, transect walks and collected fecal samples, we provide the first quantitative survey of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in this region previously classified as a highly important chimpanzee conservation unit. In contrast to species distribution models and expert predictions, we did not find any evidence of chimpanzees in the large and remote forest blocks west of the Chinko River despite considerable search effort. Our study thus highlights the limitations of relying solely on remote sensing data to predict the presence or absence of endangered species and illustrates the necessity of extensive field surveys to accurately assess occurrence and density in remote areas. However, we did discover a sizeable and reproducing population of chimpanzees east of the Chinko River. Based on a density of 0.81 chimpanzees/km(2) in closed canopy forest that we inferred from nest count data, we estimate 910 weaned chimpanzees to inhabit the Chinko Nature Reserve (CNR) and further predict additional 2700 individuals in adjacent, unmanaged hunting zones and reserves. According to microsatellite data, these chimpanzees genetically cluster with P.t. schweinfurthii populations in East Africa. Conservation action and appropriate management plans are urgently needed to protect this important population and to prevent heavily-armed nomadic pastoralists from the Sahel, illegal miners, as well as elephant and meat poachers, from irretrievably destroying the natural vegetation and local biodiversity of the area.

Determining the number of measurements required to estimate crop residue cover by different methods	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Crop residue left after harvest plays an important role in controlling against soil erosion and in increasing soil organic matter content of agricultural soils. Crop residue management is a practice of great importance in southwestern Ontario, where soil management practices have an effect on Great Lakes water quality. The use of remote sensing data to measure and monitor crop residue can be fast and efficient. However, remote sensing based studies need calibration and validation using field observations. The objective of this study was to determine the optimal number of ground-truthing field measurements (i.e., digital photographs) required to estimate residue levels. To do so, we compared the residue estimates derived from digital photographs with those derived from the standard line-transect method. Residue was measured from 18 fields located in southern Ontario, and data collected included percentage of crop residue using line-transect and photographic grid methods. Results were analyzed using linear regression, correlation tests, ANOVA, and means tests. Analyses were also conducted to retrospectively determine the minimum number of line transects or digital photos required to estimate crop residue cover at specified levels of power. Results showed that (1) percentage of crop residue estimates derived from using digital photographs were strongly correlated (r = 0.91, p < 0.001, R-2 = 0.83, and n = 90) to those derived from using line transects; (2) counting 50 to 100 points per digital photograph was sufficient to accurately estimate the percentage of residue cover; and (3) there was greater variability in the results for soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) than for corn (Zea mays L.), with the highest variability for medium-level soybean residue. Overall, the digital photograph method to estimate percentage of residue was found to be a suitable alternative to the line-transect method, which is more time consuming and labor intensive. Determining the optimal numbers of measurements to estimate crop residue cover is important to those wishing to use digital photo capture methods to record, archive, and measure residue for remote sensing calibration and validation or for handheld mobile device applications.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				SEP-OCT	2017	72	5					471	479		10.2489/jswc.72.5471								WOS:000410019500009

Other fields (e.g. Archeology) are experiencing this momentous change even more rapidly. In this article, we review some of the challenges that the fields of tropical biology and conservation face during the first quarter of the twenty-first century from the perspective of various remote sensing technologies, and discuss the transformations that they may bring to these disciplines. In addition, we review two emerging technologies driving paradigm changes in the nexus of ecology, remote sensing, and analytics: near-surface remote sensing and Wireless Sensor Networks. These two technologies, arising from the eScience paradigm, offer unique opportunities to integrate field observations at hyper-temporal and spatial resolutions that were not possible as recently as 5years ago.

Protected areas buffer the Brazilian semi-arid biome from climate change	BIOTROPICA												The Caatinga is a botanically unique semi-arid ecosystem in northeast Brazil whose vegetation is adapted to the periodic droughts that characterize this region. However, recent extreme droughts events caused by anthropogenic climate change have challenged its ecological resilience. Here, we evaluate how deforestation and protection status affect the response of the Caatinga vegetation to drought. Specifically, we compared vegetation responses to drought in natural and deforested areas as well as inside and outside protected areas, using a time-series of satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and climatic data for 2008-2013. We observed a strong effect of deforestation and land protection on overall vegetation productivity and in productivity dynamics in response to precipitation. Overall, deforested areas had significantly lower NDVI and delayed greening in response to precipitation. By contrast, strictly protected areas had higher productivity and considerable resilience to low levels of precipitation, when compared to sustainable use or unprotected areas. These results highlight the importance of protected areas in protecting ecosystem processes and native vegetation in the Caatinga against the negative effects of climate change and deforestation. Given the extremely small area of the Caatinga currently under strict protection, the creation of new conservation areas must be a priority to ensure the sustainability of ecological processes and to avoid further desertification.

Field-measured variables outperform derived alternatives in Maryland stream biodiversity models	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim: In order to map patterns of biodiversity in support of conservation efforts, statistical models require environmental variables with full coverage across the study area, typically in the form of gridded surfaces derived from GIS, remote sensing or via interpolation. However, derived variables may not be as physiologically relevant or as representative of on-the-ground conditions as field-measured variables. Here, we examine differences in the abilities of derived and field-measured variables to explain and predict biogeographical patterns of freshwater fish and benthic invertebrate communities. Location: Maryland first-through fourth-order streams, USA. Methods: We fit generalized dissimilarity models to fish and benthic invertebrate occurrence data (n = 2,165 site-years sampled over 18 years) using one set of field-measured predictors collected concurrent and collocated with faunal sampling, two sets of derived predictors (one representing local and one representing upstream conditions) or a combination. We then compared how well models explained and predicted spatial turnover in taxonomic composition (beta diversity). Results: For all regions (four physiographic regions and the state as a whole) and for both fish and benthic invertebrates, models fit with field-measured variables were more explanatory and usually more predictive than models fit with derived variables. Within the category of derived predictors, those accounting for upstream conditions were more explanatory and predictive than local-scale versions. Main conclusions: Although derived variables are most commonly used to describe and map biodiversity, they may be broadly inferior to field-measured variables as predictors in low-order stream biodiversity models. Collection of field-measured data and development of derived data that consider upstream conditions and capture physiologically relevant environmental characteristics are likely to improve our capability to predict and explain spatial patterns of low-order stream biodiversity.

Landsat to monitor an endangered beetle population and its habitat: addressing annual life history and imperfect detection	INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY												Habitat-based conservation is a priority for the endangered American burying beetle (Nicrophorus americanus Olivier), but its annual life history, dispersal ability, and low detectability contribute to difficulties explaining its decline, identifying manageable habitat characteristics, and mapping its distribution. Objectives of this study were to (i) assess factors affecting detection of beetles with baited pitfall traps, (ii) identify important habitat characteristics, and (iii) map spatio-temporal patterns of habitat quality and beetle abundance. At a military installation in western Arkansas with one of the largest remaining N.americanus populations, 257 sites were surveyed over 5years using three nights of baited pitfall trapping at each site. Geographic information systems (GIS)-based habitat assessments included three site radii (100, 800, and 1600m). Year-specific vegetation condition was quantified using satellite images and other GIS data. N-mixture models were used to account for imperfect detection and to assess competing models of beetle abundance and detection. Detection rates (mean=20%) were dependent on overnight temperature, dew point, and wind speed with upper and lower temperature thresholds beyond which detection was reduced. Habitat assessments were most effective within 800m site radii, consistent with previous estimates of N.americanus trap sample range. Beetle abundance was associated with grasslands and open-canopy woodlands with rolling topography, sandy loam soils, and moderate patchy disturbances from wildfire. Landsat, unlike vegetation maps, quantified year-specific habitat quality and allowed spatio-temporal population dynamics to be mapped at a yearly time-step for this annual species.																	1752-458X	1752-4598				SEP	2017	10	5					385	398		10.1111/icad.12233								WOS:000409023600002						
J	Asner, GP; Tupayachi, R				Asner, Gregory P.; Tupayachi, Raul			Accelerated losses of protected forests from gold mining in the Peruvian Amazon	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Gold mining in Amazonia involves forest removal, soil excavation, and the use of liquid mercury, which together pose a major threat to biodiversity, water quality, forest carbon stocks, and human health. Within the global biodiversity hotspot ofMadre de Dios, Peru, gold mining has continued despite numerous 2012 government decrees and enforcement actions against it. Mining is now also thought to have entered federally protected areas, but the rates of miner encroachment are unknown. Here, we utilize high-resolution remote sensing to assess annual changes in gold mining extent from 1999 to 2016 throughout theMadre de Dios region, including the high-diversity Tambopata National Reserve and buffer zone. Regionally, gold mining-related losses of forest averaged 4437 ha yr(-1). A temporary downward inflection in the annual growth rate of mining-related forest loss following 2012 government action was followed by a near doubling of the deforestation rate from mining in 2013-2014. The total estimated area of gold mining throughout the region increased about 40% between 2012 and 2016, including in the Tambopata National Reserve. Our results reveal an urgent need for more socio-environmental effort and law enforcement action to combat illegal gold mining in the Peruvian Amazon.

It is therefore necessary to predict snow and glacier melt runoff to manage future water resource of Upper Indus Basin (UIB). The snowmelt runoff model (SRM) coupled with MODIS remote sensing data was employed in this study to predict daily discharges of Gilgit River in the Karakoram Range. The SRM was calibrated successfully and then simulation was made over four years i.e. 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 achieving coefficient of model efficiency of 0.96, 0.86, 0.9 and 0.94 respectively. The scenarios of precipitation and mean temperature developed from regional climate model PRECIS were used in SRM model to predict future flows of Gilgit River. The increase of 3 degrees C in mean annual temperature by the end of 21th century may result in increase of 35-40% in Gilgit River flows. The expected increase in the surface runoff from the snow and glacier melt demands better water conservation and management for irrigation and hydel-power generation in the Indus basin in future.

Objectives The objective of this study was to evaluate the information provided by a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image for landscape connectivity modeling compared to aerial photographs (APs). Methods We present a novel method that integrates habitat suitability derived from remote sensing imagery into a connectivity model to explain species abundance. More precisely, we compared how two resistance maps constructed using landscape and/or local metrics derived from AP or SAR imagery yield different connectivity values (based on graph theory), considering hedgerow networks and forest carabid beetle species as a model. Results We found that resistance maps using landscape and local metrics derived from SAR imagery improve landscape connectivity measures. The SAR model is the most informative, explaining 58% of the variance in forest carabid beetle abundance. This model calculates resistance values associated with homogeneous patches within hedgerows according to their suitability (canopy cover density and landscape grain) for the model species. Conclusions Our approach combines two important methods in landscape ecology: the construction of resistance maps and the use of buffers around sampling points to determine the importance of landscape factors. This study was carried out through an interdisciplinary approach involving remote sensing scientists and landscape ecologists. This study is a step forward in developing landscape metrics from satellites to monitor biodiversity.																	0921-2973	1572-9761				SEP	2017	32	9					1867	1879		10.1007/s10980-017-0546-3								WOS:000406962100008

Knowledge of the soil water storage (SWS) within soil profiles in black locust stands is thus critical for optimization of forest management for sustainable production. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the temporal stability of SWS to identify the most time-stable locations (MTSLs) for reliably estimating the mean SWS and to further investigate the factors influencing its temporal stability. The SWS values of various soil layers (0-1, 1-2, and 2-3 m) were measured from May 2014 to October 2015 at 70 locations along two 187-m long transects on a hillslope covered with black locust in the Loess Plateau, China. A total of 18 SWS datasets were collected over the period of measurement. Results indicated that the temporal variation of spatial mean SWS decreased and the spatial variation of SWS increased with increasing soil depth. A strong temporal persistence in all soil layers was demonstrated by high Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (P < 0.01), with the temporal stability in deep soil layers relatively more stable than in shallow layer. Among four methods (MRD, mean relative difference; SDRD, standard deviation of relative difference; ITS, index of temporal stability; and MABE, mean absolute bias error) used to identify the MTSLs for the estimation of the mean SWS, the ITS provided the best results. The MTSLs identified in diverse layers of the first transect were then used to successfully predict the mean SWS along the second transect (R-2 > 0.91). Elevation, soil saturated hydraulic conductivity, leaf area index, and fine root area density were the major factors influencing the temporal stability of SWS. The results of this study were useful for estimating mean SWS and could improve soil water management and hydrological applications in sloping black locust forested areas of the Loess Plateau.																	0341-8162	1872-6887				SEP	2017	156						51	61		10.1016/j.catena.2017.03.023								WOS:000404305700006

PES monitoring however presents challenges, including in balancing technical accuracy with cost, local equity and legitimacy. This is particularly true in smallholder carbon PES, where managers have limited resources and capacity. Here we explore ways to improve monitoring in smallholder projects. We looked at two well-established projects in Uganda and Mexico, and appraised five monitoring methodologies: two remote sensing and three field measurement approaches. Each methodology varied in data resolution, methodological complexity and degree of local participation. We collected quantitative and qualitative information on four aspects of performance: accuracy; costs; local equity; and local legitimacy. We show that methodologies with greater data resolution and local participation performed better in all four aspects, while greater methodological complexity was not associated with significantly improved performance. We conclude that monitoring in smallholder and other types of PES may be improved through: 1) devolving analyses to the local level; 2) communicating to stakeholders a distinction between 'applied' and 'scientific' accuracy; and 3) documenting and communicating the diverse functions of monitoring, referred to here as co-benefits - a contrast to simple 'monitor and pay' conceptions of PES.

The application of airborne mapping LiDAR for the documentation of ancient cities and regions in tropical regions	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					Meeting of the Society-for-American-Archaeologists	2016	Orlando, FL	Soc Amer Archaeologists				It is a conundrum of the 21st Century that there is much left to discover and yet never before has our cultural and ecological patrimony been so threatened. This is especially true in tropical regions where heavy vegetation, inaccessibility, and rugged topography hamper investigation. Here we present two case studies that add to a growing body of literature demonstrating the utility of airborne mapping LiDAR (a.k.a. Airborne Laser Scanning) for rapid archaeological assessments in poorly documented regions. The first outlines a program of LiDAR scanning to better understand the urban center of Angamuco in the Mexican State of Michoacan. This work shows that (1) large urban centers with complex spatial organization were present centuries prior to the formation of the Purepecha Empire; (2) the settlement incorporates gardens and other landscape features within and around the settlement demonstrating a high degree of human environmental modification; and (3) current models for the evolution of social complexity in the region cannot account for the presence of Angamuco. The second presents the results of a LiDAR survey of a remote valley in the Mosquitia tropical wilderness of Honduras which has seen little archaeological research. Here we demonstrate that (1) though today the valley is awilderness it was densely inhabited in the past; (2) this population was organized into a three-tiered system composed of 19 settlements dominated by a city; and (3) this occupation was embedded within a human engineered landscape. For both, LiDAR data fundamentally changed the understanding of coupled human/natural systems in these areas while providing critical baseline data for conservation and management.

The benefits of the recent developments in SAR satellite sensors towards higher resolution (up to less than 1 m) and shorter revisiting times (up to a few days) are discussed in relation to established techniques using the two key SAR parameters - amplitude and phase. Selected case studies from Middle East to South America illustrate how SAR can be effectively used to detect subtle archaeological features in modern landscapes, monitor historic sites and assess damage in areas of conflict. These examples form the basis to highlight the current trends in archaeological remote sensing based on space-borne SAR data in the era of the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 constellation and on-demand high resolution space missions such as TerraSAR-X.

Studied area includes the zone of influence of the Rudarski basen Kolubara, which covers the exploitation area of the Kolubara coal basin in the Republic of Serbia. The analysis is based on the processing of Landsat 5 satellite images from 2001 and 2011. In the analysis of satellite images, the supervised classification method was used. The results suggest that the observed spatial-temporal area is exposed to erosion as a result of land-use changes. Preliminary conclusion is that the dominant anthropogenic factor, responsible for changes in land use, is pronounced through the mining activity, industrialization, construction as well as agricultural activities. Very small changes in land use that occurred in the period 2001-2010 have led to relatively small amount of change from the aspect of land degradation. Also, due to the planned exploitation of the mine which included into account the sustainability of ecosystems, primarily through appropriate conservation measures, RB Kolubara is not in danger of a possible erosion processes that could undermine the stability of the basin.

This paper presents and validates an innovative remote sensing based approach for a countrywide mapping of broadleaved and coniferous trees in Switzerland with a spatial resolution of 3 m. The classification approach incorporates a random forest classifier, explanatory variables from multispectral aerial imagery and a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data, digitized training polygons and independent validation data from the National Forest Inventory (NFI). The methodological workflow was optimized for an area of 41,285 km(2) that is characterized by temperate forests within a complex topography. Whereas high model overall accuracies (0.99) and kappa (0.98) were achieved, the comparison of the tree type map with independent NFI data revealed significant deviations that are related to underestimations of broadleaved trees (median of -3.17%). Constraints of the tree type mapping approach are mostly related to the acquisition date and time of the imagery and the topographic (negative) effects on the prediction. A comparison with the most recent High Resolution Layers (HRL) forest 2012 from the European Environmental Agency revealed that the tree type map is superior regarding spatial resolution, level of detail and accuracy. The high-quality map achieved with the approach presented here is of great value for optimizing forest management and planning activities and is also an important information source for applications outside the forestry sector.

Potential Effects of Projected Decrease in Annual Rainfall on Spatial Distribution of High Andean Wetlands in Southern Peru	WETLANDS												High in the Central Andes, wetlands important to people and wildlife occur as medium to small patches within vast montane grasslands. Determining the effects of projected climate change on these high Andean wetlands is hindered by the lack of fine-scale environmental data. We used remote sensing data to develop an estimate of approximately 2.5% for wetland habitat in the study region. Assessing the potential effects of climate change relied on two assumptions. First, mean annual rainfall is an essential variable in the occurrence of wetlands (R-2 = 0.82, p < 0.01) within the semi-arid climate of the high Andes. Second, climate change projections indicate a decrease in mean annual rainfall within the study region. In our linear regression model the projected decrease in annual rainfall resulted in a total wetland loss for watersheds within most semi-arid parts of the study region. Here, we provide quantitative data for Andean wetlands to inform conservation and land use decisions. Our study results also suggest that conservation efforts should focus on a more integrative approach including smaller wetlands at the watershed level as well as regions outside protected areas.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				AUG	2017	37	4					647	659		10.1007/s13157-017-0896-2								WOS:000408670000004						
J	Senf, C; Pflugmacher, D; Hostert, P; Seidl, R				Senf, Cornelius; Pflugmacher, Dirk; Hostert, Patrick; Seidl, Rupert			Using Landsat time series for characterizing forest disturbance dynamics in the coupled human and natural systems of Central Europe	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Remote sensing is a key information source for improving the spatiotemporal understanding of forest ecosystem dynamics. Yet, the mapping and attribution of forest change remains challenging, particularly in areas where a number of interacting disturbance agents simultaneously affect forest development. The forest ecosystems of Central Europe are coupled human and natural systems, with natural and human disturbances affecting forests both individually and in combination. To better understand the complex forest disturbance dynamics in such systems, we utilize 32-year Landsat time series to map forest disturbances in five sites across Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, and Slovakia. All sites consisted of a National Park and the surrounding forests, reflecting three management zones of different levels of human influence (managed, protected, strictly protected). This allowed for a comparison of spectral, temporal, and spatial disturbance patterns across a gradient from natural to coupled human and natural disturbances. Disturbance maps achieved overall accuracies ranging from 81% to 93%. Disturbance patches were generally small, with 95% of the disturbances being smaller than 10 ha. Disturbance rates ranged from 0.29% yr(-1) to 0.95% yr(-1), and differed substantially among management zones and study sites. Natural disturbances in strictly protected areas were longer in duration (median of 8 years) and slightly less variable in magnitude compared to human-dominated disturbances in managed forests (median duration of 1 year). However, temporal dynamics between natural and human-dominated disturbances showed strong synchrony, suggesting that disturbance peaks are driven by natural events affecting managed and unmanaged areas simultaneously. Our study demonstrates the potential of remote sensing for mapping forest disturbances in coupled human and natural systems, such as the forests of Central Europe. Yet, we also highlight the complexity of such systems in terms of agent attribution, as many natural disturbances are modified by management responding to them outside protected areas.

Over the past decades, the rapid socio-economic development has increased the pressure on the prevailing water and land resources with various repercussions on the environment and society. Counteracting ecological degradation in the basin, large-scale conservation and restoration plans have been initiated to expand vegetation coverage on deteriorated land, simultaneously fostering rural sustainable agriculture production. In this context, we derived precise spatial thematic products from long-term satellite time series about high-frequency temporal dynamics. This information, available in a consistent and repeatable fashion is rare and relevant for many regional and local stakeholders and must be monitored annually to capture the rapid rate of change. Such information serves as a valuable base for decision making processes. In this study, we used all the archived Landsat images between 2000 and 2015 (4520 scenes) to computed annually the spatially continuous spectral-temporal and textual metrics based on dense Landsat time-series to derive annual maps showing the most prominent land-cover change types related to mining, agriculture, forestry, and urbanization in four sub-regions spread over the Yellow River Basin. These novel land cover/use products provide new insights into recent regional and local dynamics. For final classification, we employed random forest classifiers for each thematic focus-region, trained and tested based on a stable-pixels data set. The resulting maps achieved high accuracies and show afforestation on the Loess Plateau and urbanization as the most prominent drivers of land use/cover dynamics. Agricultural land remained stable, showing local small-scale dynamics. Our study highlights the great potential of using consistent spectral-temporal metrics derived from dense Landsat time-series data together with a stable pixels reference set, allowing for local and regional land surface dynamics mapping at high spatial resolution and the prediction of implications of future change for effective and sustainable basin management.

Canopy structure drives orangutan habitat selection in disturbed Bornean forests	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												The conservation of charismatic and functionally important large species is becoming increasingly difficult. Anthropogenic pressures continue to squeeze available habitat and force animals into degraded and disturbed areas. Ensuring the long-term survival of these species requires a well-developed understanding of how animals use these new landscapes to inform conservation and habitat restoration efforts. We combined 3 y of highly detailed visual observations of Bornean orangutans with high-resolution airborne remote sensing (Light Detection and Ranging) to understand orangutan movement in disturbed and fragmented forests of Malaysian Borneo. Structural attributes of the upper forest canopy were the dominant determinant of orangutan movement among all age and sex classes, with orangutans more likely to move in directions of increased canopy closure, tall trees, and uniform height, as well as avoiding canopy gaps and moving toward emergent crowns. In contrast, canopy vertical complexity (canopy layering and shape) did not affect movement. Our results suggest that although orangutans do make use of disturbed forest, they select certain canopy attributes within these forests, indicating that not all disturbed or degraded forest is of equal value for the long-term sustainability of orangutan populations. Although the value of disturbed habitats needs to be recognized in conservation plans for wide-ranging, large-bodied species, minimal ecological requirements within these habitats also need to be understood and considered if long-term population viability is to be realized.

Influence of the resolution of forest cover maps in evaluating fragmentation and connectivity to assess habitat conservation status	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The analysis of fragmentation and habitat connectivity is important in determining their conservation status and ensuring their long-term survival. However, the reliability of assessments on habitat conservation status may depend on the resolution of forest cover maps used as inputs. The aim of this paper is to quantify differences in the results of habitat fragmentation and connectivity analysis found when using three different forest cover maps of various resolutions, and discusses their effect in the assessment of habitat conservation status. The study was conducted in a Natura 2000 habitat (9120:Atlantic acidophilous beech forests) in Spain. To measure fragmentation, we carried out a morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) which provided a very detailed spatial landscape description (core, islet, bridge, loop, branch and perforation elements). We compared the habitat total area (Hta) with the habitat area without edge width (Hwe), which correspond to the obtained previous cores. To measure connectivity, we used the probability of connectivity index (PC). We used three different forest cover maps with different spatial resolutions: (1) a 2 m map derived from remote sensing using very high resolution satellite imagery (GeoEye) processed with object-based image analysis (OBIA_layer); (2) a 10 m map derived from fieldwork and aerial photo-interpretation at 1:10,000 scale (Forest layer); and (3) a 50 m map obtained by a similar method at 1:50,000 scale (Atlas layer). Our results confirm results obtained by previous studies showing that the resolution of input forest cover maps substantially influences MSPA results. The habitat area proportion classified as core decreased as the resolution of input forest cover maps increased, whereas the amount of islets, bridges, loops, branches and perforations increased. The spatial resolution of forest cover maps influences the assessment of habitat conservation status. Habitat conservation status was assessed as being 'unfavourable inadequate' (the middle rank out of three) with the coarse Atlas layer, and as 'unfavourable bad' (the bottom rank out) when using the higher resolution Forest layer and OBIA layer. This can be critical for European environmental funding. Results obtained also show that resolution of input forest cover maps influence the calculated values of PC index. The use of high-resolution forest cover maps is critical to study habitat connectivity, since otherwise the outcome presents no appreciable result. We conclude that using remote sensing techniques together with OBIA is the most appropriate and cost-effective method for analyzing forest fragmentation and connectivity for habitat conservation status assessments. The source and/or the method of generation of the habitat data layer used (also the spatial resolution) as well as the connectivity analysis method applied must at all times be reported in such analyses.

PLANT ECOLOGY												The recovery of vegetation cover is a process that has important implications for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Generally, the recovery of vegetation cover is documented over large areas using remote sensing, and it is often assumed that ecosystem properties and processes recover along with remotely sensed canopy cover. Here we analyze and compare the structure, composition, and diversity of trees and shrubs among plots established in a stratified random sampling design over four remotely sensed canopy cover change (CCC) categories defined according to a gradient in the percent of canopy cover. Plots were located in the Lake Cuitzeo basin (Mexico), where canopy recovery associated with agricultural abandonment has occurred in recent decades (1975-2000). We found that diversity measures, basal area, tree and shrub density, ground-truthed canopy cover, and mean plant height increased with increasing CCC category. However, Shannon index (H') was lower in the CCC category with the most closed canopy cover category than in plots apparently not affected by agriculture. Furthermore, ordination analyses showed that composition of dominant species were not associated with CCC categories. Our results suggest that canopy closure in our study area is not associated with the recovery of species diversity, and does not result in similar species dominance as in sites not affected by agriculture.

Urban outdoor water use and response to drought assessed through mobile energy balance and vegetation greenness measurements	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Urban vegetation provides many highly valued ecosystem services but also requires extensive urban water resources. Increasingly, cities are experiencing water limitations and managing outdoor urban water use is an important concern. Quantifying the water lost via evapotranspiration (ET) is critical for urban water management and conservation, especially in arid or semi-arid regions. In this study, we deployed a mobile energy balance platform to measure evaporative fraction throughout Riverside, California, a warm, semi-arid, city. We observed the relationship between evaporative fraction and satellite derived vegetation index across 29 sites, which was then used to map whole-city ET for a representative mid-summer period. Resulting ET distributions were strongly associated with both neighborhood population density and income. By comparing 2014 and 2015 summer-period water uses, our results show 7.8% reductions in evapotranspiration, which were also correlated with neighborhood demographic characteristics. Our findings suggest a mobile energy balance measurement platform coupled with satellite imagery could serve as an effective tool in assessing the outdoor water use at neighborhood to whole city scales.

Townsend			Planning for conservation and restoration under climate and land use change in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												AimTo propose and compare priority sites for conservation and restoration of woody plants under diverse climate and land use scenarios, considering socio-economic costs, presence of protected areas and distribution of forest remnants. LocationThe Atlantic Forest Biodiversity Hotspot, Brazil. MethodsWe used ecological niche modelling to estimate geographical distributions for 2,255 species under current and future climate scenarios, which we analysed in relation to spatially explicit land use projections, maps of forest remnants derived from remote sensing and socio-economic variables for each municipality within the Atlantic Forest region. We identified spatial priorities that complement the current network of protected areas under three different prioritization scenarios: (1) conservation of existing forest remnants only; (2) conservation of remnants followed by restoration of degraded habitat; and (3) unconstrained actions, in which management location is not defined a priori. We compared our results under different levels of land protection, with targets of 10%, 17% and 20% of the Atlantic Forest extent. ResultsCurrent forest remnants cover only 12% of the Atlantic Forest, so targets of 17% and 20% were achieved only through active restoration. Targets of 17% and 20% captured most species and represented on average 26%-34% of species' distributions. The spatial pattern of degraded habitats negatively affected representation of biodiversity and implied higher costs and reduced efficiency of planning. We did not observe major differences between conservation prioritizations based on contrasting climate change scenarios. Main conclusionsProtection of forest remnants alone will not suffice to safeguard woody plant species under climate and land use changes; therefore, restoration actions are urgently needed in the Atlantic Forest. With integrated management actions and multicriterion nationwide planning, reaching the 17% of land protection of Aichi biodiversity targets will constitute an important step towards protecting Atlantic Forest biodiversity.

In light of this importance, eight palm species were explored [Borassus aethiopum (L.) Mart, Eremospatha macrocarpa (G. Mann et H. Wendl.) H. Wendl., Laccosperma opacum (G. Mann et H. Wendl.) Drude, Hyphaene thebaica (L.) Mart, Phoenix reclinata Jacq., Raphia hookeri G. Mann et H. Wendl., R. sudanica A. Chev., and R. vinifera P. Beauv.] as targets for conservation, domestication, and cultivation in Benin. Cultivation potential was evaluated in a coarse-resolution, first-pass effort using ecological niche models to relate known occurrences of each species to vegetation indices (VEG), gross primary productivity (GPP), and soil characteristics (SOIL), and model outputs were related to human distribution and land-use patterns. Results showed that wild palms responded differentially to different suites of environmental factors: some species showed best model performance with VEG + GPP + SOIL, others with GPP + SOIL or VEG + GPP, or with a single factor. Two species had broad potential distributions across the country; others had potential areas in the north (2 species) or the south (4 species). Raphia hookeri and R. vinifera showed greatest overlap in terms of ecology and distribution, whereas L. opacum and R. sudanica had the lowest similarity. These models constitute initial steps toward a sustainable scheme for planning exploration of the possibility of cultivation of these species.																	0925-9864	1573-5109				AUG	2017	64	6					1383	1393		10.1007/s10722-016-0443-7								WOS:000404901300020

Hyperspectral remote sensing imagery combined with field validation were used to map and characterise the 300-km coast including shore type, land cover and vehicle track footprint. Adjacent to Ningaloo Marine Park, only sparse coastal vegetation cover was present. However, there exists an extensive (1256 km) vehicle track network with the highest densities near accommodation nodes and sandy beaches (over 65% of tracks). Areas managed for conservation had fewer tracks and the lowest track density (0.3 km/km(2)) compared to pastoral stations (similar to 1.9 km/km(2)). The cumulative lengths of tracks were highest on pastoral stations used for livestock grazing, coastal access and camping (945 km out of the total of 1256 km of tracks). The fragility of the arid landscape and this assessment of off-road vehicle impact obtained through detailed mapping of tracks indicate the need for management measures to mitigate the damage and cope with the increasing numbers of visitors.

The effects of specific anthropogenic measures have generally been ignored by large-scale assessments, which has probably resulted in irrational regulations and imprecise understanding of these specific measures. This paper aims to reveal the effect of a grassland restoration measure fencing in northern China as well as the spatial patterns of fencing efficiency. Spatially continuous Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data based on remote sensing was used to detect grassland vegetation changes during fencing periods. Using subsequent processes to smooth the impact of precipitation from the current year and by setting thresholds for identifying changed/unchanged NDVI, the spatial vegetation changes were converted into two groups of statistical data: the mean NDVI-increase value in each sample region and the pixel areas with different grassland change types in each sample region. The precipitation lag effect on NDVI increases was assessed by multiple comparison tests, and regions with a significant precipitation lag effect were removed from the fencing effect assessment. Finally, the areas with different grassland change types were related to changes in fenced area using regression analyses under different precipitation gradients. The results indicated that the precipitation lag effect caused by legacy moisture significantly affected the spatio-temporal vegetation changes. By excluding the regions with legacy moisture, the increase in fenced area facilitated an expansion of improved grassland and a reduction in degraded grassland. Fencing efficiency was maximized in the 250-300-mm precipitation zone, where the expansion rate of improved grassland area reached 0.70 (R-2 = 0.54, p < 0.01). The second-best and least effective zones lay in the mean annual precipitation (MAP) >300-mm and MAP <250 mm zones, respectively. We conclude that a wetter climate does not automatically result in a better fencing effect, and legacy moisture will lead to an overestimation of the fencing effect. A rational fencing implementation should consider the resilience and degradation degree of steppes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, for many areas of conservation interest, there is still a considerable gap between field-based operational monitoring guidelines and the current remote sensing-based approaches. This hampers application in practice of the latter. Here, we propose a remote sensing approach for mapping the conservation status of Calluna-dominated Natura 2000 dwarf shrub habitats that is closely related to field mapping schemes. We transferred the evaluation criteria of the field guidelines to three related variables that can be captured by remote sensing: (1) coverage of the key species, (2) stand structural diversity, and (3) co-occurring species. Continuous information on these variables was obtained by regressing ground reference data from field surveys and UAV flights against airborne hyperspectral imagery. Merging the three resulting quality layers in an RGB representation allowed for illustrating the habitat quality in a continuous way. User-defined thresholds can be applied to this stack of quality layers to derive an overall assessment of habitat quality in terms of nature conservation, i.e. the conservation status. In our study, we found good accordance of the remotely sensed data with field-based information for the three variables key species, stand structural diversity and co-occurring vegetation (R-2 of 0.79, 0.69, and 0.71, respectively) and it was possible to derive meaningful habitat quality maps. The conservation status could be derived with an accuracy of 65%. In interpreting these results it should be considered that the remote sensing based layers are independent estimates of habitat quality in their own right and not a mere replacement of the criteria used in the field guidelines. The approach is thought to be transferable to similar regions with minor adaptions. Our results refer to Calluna heathland which we consider a comparably easy target for remote sensing. Hence, the transfer of field guidelines to remote sensing indicators was rather successful in this case but needs further evaluation for other habitats.

More specifically, spectral response function (SRF) curves were used to compare the two imagery, showing that the SRF curve shape of SPOT-6 is more like a rectangle compared to GF-1 in blue, green, red and near-infrared bands. NNDiffuse image fusion algorithm was used to evaluate the capability of information conservation in comparison with wavelet transform (WT) and principal component (PC) algorithms. The results show that NNDiffuse fused image has extremely similar entropy vales than original image (1.849 versus 1.852) and better color quality. In addition, the object-oriented classification tool set (ENVIEX) was used to identify greenlands for comparing the effect of self-fusion image of SPOT-6 and inter-fusion image between SPOT-6 and GF-1 based on the NNDiffuse algorithm. The over all accuracy is 97.27% and 76.88%, respectively, showing that self-fused image of SPOT-6 has better identification capability.																	0217-9849	1793-6640				JUL 30	2017	31	19-21			SI				1740043	10.1142/S0217984917400437								WOS:000406383600044

Match between soaring modes of black kites and the fine-scale distribution of updrafts	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Understanding how soaring birds use updrafts at small spatial scales is important to identify ecological constraints of movement, and may help to prevent conflicts between wind-energy development and the conservation of wildlife. We combined high-frequency GPS animal tracking and fine-spatial-scale uplift modelling to establish a link between flight behaviour of soaring birds and the distribution of updrafts. We caught 21 black kites (Milvus migrans) and GPS-tracked them while flying over the Tarifa region, on the Spanish side of the Strait of Gibraltar. This region has a diverse topography and land cover, favouring a heterogeneous updraft spatial distribution. Bird tracks were segmented and classified into flight modes from motion parameters. Thermal and orographic uplift velocities were modelled from publically available remote-sensing and meteorological data. We found that birds perform circular soaring in areas of higher predicted thermal uplift and linear soaring in areas of higher predicted orographic uplift velocity. We show that updraft maps produced from publically available data can be used to predict where soaring birds will concentrate their flight paths and how they will behave in flight. We recommend the use of this methodological approach to improve environmental impact assessments of new wind-energy installations.																	2045-2322					JUL 25	2017	7								6421	10.1038/s41598-017-05319-8								WOS:000406280500001	28743947

This study illustrates how the use of species distribution models that combine remote sensing data and information about biodiversity surrogates can contribute to develop a systematic protocol for monitoring PAs. In particular, we assessed the effectiveness of the Natura 2000 (N2000) network, for conserving and preserving the representativeness of seven raptor species in a highly-dynamic landscape in northwest Spain between 2001 and 2014. We also evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the N2000 network by using the total area under protection as a proxy for conservation costs. Overall, the N2000 network was found to poorly represent the habitats of the raptor species. Despite the low representativeness, this network showed a high degree of effectiveness due to increased overall habitat availability for generalist and forest specialist species between 2001 and 2014. Nevertheless, additional protected areas should be established in the near future to increase their representativeness, and thus ensure the protection of open-habitat specialist species and their priority habitats. In addition, proactive conservation measures in natural and semi-natural ecosystems (in particular, montane heathlands) will be essential for long-term protection of Montagu's harrier (species listed in the Annex I of the Bird Directive), and thus complying with the current European Environmental Legislation. This study sheds light on how the development and application of new protected area indices based on the combined use of freely-available satellite data and species distribution models may contribute substantially to the cost-efficiency of the PA monitoring systems, and to the 'Fitness Check' process of EU Nature Directives.

The potential of geostatistical features, derived from medium spatial resolution satellite imagery, to characterize contrasted landscape vegetation cover and improve object-based image classification is studied. The study site in Brazil includes cerrado sensu stricto, deciduous forest, and palm swamp vegetation cover. Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 images were acquired and divided into objects, for each of which a semivariogram was calculated using near-infrared (NIR) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to extract the set of geostatistical features. The features selected by principal component analysis were used as input data to train a random forest algorithm. Tests were conducted, combining spectral and geostatistical features. Change detection evaluation was performed using a confusion matrix and its accuracies. The semivariogram curves were efficient to characterize spatial heterogeneity, with similar results using NIR and NDVI from Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8. Accuracy was significantly greater when combining geostatistical features with spectral data, suggesting that this method can improve image classification results.

Taking the fragmented nature reserves in Xishuangbanna as a case, road impacts on Asian elephant habitats were determined based on a suitability analysis. Potential corridors between different sub reserves were located using "least-cost" method as a systematic way incorporating remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS). Our results revealed that road networks, especially high-level roads (expressway, national road and city-county city road), had the largest effects on the suitability according to the sensitivity analysis. Suitability ( > 40) area will increase about 40% if there were no high-level roads. In total, seven potential linkages were located and found to be capable of connecting the habitats of the four sub-reserves. We suggested the Menglun reserve could serve as a stepping-stone for elephant migration. Four further conservation priorities were also identified between the Menglun reserve and the Mengla reserve where the road impacts were intensive. Our study provided information for the development of an efficient reserve network for elephant conservation between existing nature reserves in China and neighboring provinces in Lao PDR.

Application of remote sensing and geographical information system for generation of runoff curve number	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Watershed is an ideal unit for planning and management of land and water resources (Gajbhiye et al., IEEE international conference on advances in technology and engineering (ICATE), Bombay, vol 1, issue 9, pp 23-25, 2013a; Gajbhiye et al., Appl Water Sci 4(1): 51-61, 2014a; Gajbhiye et al., J Geol Soc India (SCI-IF 0.596) 84(2): 192-196, 2014b). This study aims to generate the curve number, using remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) and the effect of slope on curve number values. The study was carried out in Kanhaiya Nala watershed located in Satna district of Madhya Pradesh. Soil map, Land Use/Land cover and slope map were generated in GIS Environment. The CN parameter values corresponding to various soil, land cover, and land management conditions were selected from Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) standard table. Curve number (CN) is an index developed by the NRCS, to represent the potential for storm water runoff within a drainage area. The CN for a drainage basin is estimated using a combination of land use, soil, and antecedent soil moisture condition (AMC). In present study effect of slope on CN values were determined. The result showed that the CN unadjusted value are higher in comparison to CN adjusted with slope. Remote sensing and GIS is very reliable technique for the preparation of most of the input data required by the SCS curve number model.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUL	2017	7	4					1773	1779		10.1007/s13201-015-0350-7								WOS:000411095500017

Hence, a proper training is crucial for developing effective conservation practices based on remote sensing data. In this paper we aim to highlight the potential of open access data and open source software and the importance of the inter-linkages between these and remote sensing training, with an interdisciplinary perspective. We will first deal with the importance of open access data and then we provide several examples of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) for a deeper and more critical understanding of its application in remote sensing.

For terrestrial animals, 1 Hz GPS-position, 3D-body acceleration, and ambient temperature provide standard data to link to the physiology of life histories. Environmental context is added at ever finer scales using remote sensing earth observation data. Here we showcase the use of such bio-logging approaches in a conservation physiology study on endangered Himalayan vultures (Gyps himalayensis). We determine environmental, behavioural, and physiological causes of survival in immature birds that roam from wintering sites in India, Bhutan, and Nepal towards summer areas in Tibet and Mongolia. Five of 18 immature griffons died during one year. Individuals that died had failed to migrate sufficiently far northward (> 1500 km) in spring. Individuals likely died if they flew against headwinds from the north or were less able to find thermal updrafts. Surviving individuals migrated to cold and dry areas with low population density. We highlight flight experience, long distance movements, and remote places with low human population as factors critical for the survival of Himalayan vultures. High-resolution bio-logging studies can advance conservation management by pinpointing where and why migratory animals have problems and die.																	0340-7594	1432-1351				JUL	2017	203	6-7			SI		531	542		10.1007/s00359-017-1180-x								WOS:000406794100014	28612235

Fire activity is determined by a wide range of factors, including long and short term climatic conditions, climate seasonality, wind speed and direction, topography, and fuel biomass. In Brazil, fire shapes the structure and composition of cerrado savannas, and the impact of fire on vegetation dynamics is well explored, but the drivers of variation in fire disturbance across landscapes and over time are still poorly understood. We reconstructed 31 years of fire occurrence history in the Serra do Cipo region, a highly-diverse cerrado landscape, located in the southern portion of the Espinhaco mountain range, state of Minas Gerais, Southeastern Brazil. We mapped burn scars using a time series of Landsat satellite images from 1984 to 2014. Our questions were 1) How does fire occurrence vary in time and space across the Serra do Cipo cerrado landscape? 2) Which climatic drivers may explain the spatial and inter-annual variation in fire occurrence on this landscape? 3) Is fire occurrence in this cerrado landscape moisture-limited or fuel-limited? We evaluated the inter-annual variation and distribution of burned areas, and used linear models to explain this variation in terms of rainfall amount (determinant of fuel load production), seasonal rainfall distribution (determinant of dry fuel availability), abnormality of precipitation (Standardized Precipitation Index - SPI), and vegetation type (Enhanced Vegetation Index - EVI). Contrary to our expectations, annual rainfall volume was weakly and negatively correlated with burned area, and the strongest predictor of burned area was drought during the ignition season. The length of the dry season and the distribution of rain along the season determined ignition probability, increasing fire occurrence during the driest periods. We conclude that the mountain cerrado vegetation at Serra do Cipo has a moisture-dependent fire regime, in contrast to the fuel-dependent fire regimes described for African savannas. These findings imply that savannas at different continents may have different recovery and resilience capabilities when subjected to changes in the fire regime, caused by direct anthropogenic activities or indirectly through climatic changes. The possible effects of these changes on cerrado landscapes are still unknown, and future studies should investigate if currently observed fire regimes have positive or negative impacts on vegetation diversity, recovery, resilience and phenology, thus helping managers to include fire management as conservation measure.

Resilience potential of the Ethiopian coffee sector under climate change	NATURE PLANTS												Coffee farming provides livelihoods for around 15 million farmers in Ethiopia and generates a quarter of the country's export earnings. Against a backdrop of rapidly increasing temperatures and decreasing rainfall, there is an urgent need to understand the influence of climate change on coffee production. Using a modelling approach in combination with remote sensing, supported by rigorous ground-truthing, we project changes in suitability for coffee farming under various climate change scenarios, specifically by assessing the exposure of coffee farming to future climatic shifts. We show that 39-59% of the current growing area could experience climatic changes that are large enough to render them unsuitable for coffee farming, in the absence of significant interventions or major influencing factors. Conversely, relocation of coffee areas, in combination with forest conservation or re-establishment, could see at least a fourfold (> 400%) increase in suitable coffee farming area. We identify key coffee-growing areas that are susceptible to climate change, as well as those that are climatically resilient.																	2055-026X	2055-0278				JUL	2017	3	7							17081	10.1038/nplants.2017.81								WOS:000406037200011	28628132					
J	Van Calster, H; Damgaard, C				Van Calster, Hans; Damgaard, Christian			Integral occurrence probability: combining cover and relative shoot frequencies based on bounded point-to-plant distances	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Aims: To introduce a new distance-based field method for (herbaceous, terrestrial) plant species that relates cover to relative shoot frequency as a continuous process of occurrence probabilities and to explain how these data can be analysed. Methods: We propose to measure shortest distances from a sample of sampling points to the nearest above-ground part of plant species (up to a maximum search distance). We show how, after appropriate transformation of the point-to-plant distances to a 0-1 interval scale, cover as well as relative shoot frequency at any area up to the searched area can be read from the same curve. This leads to the notion of an integral occurrence probability, which we propose as a new species abundance measure. For estimation and regression modelling we make use of the zero-and-one inflated beta distribution. We supply all code required for these analyses. Results: Simulations of plant distribution patterns showed that the integral occurrence probability is able to differentiate between plant abundance patterns that differed in terms of relative cover, density and type of spatial distribution pattern. It is more sensitive to these differences than either cover or relative shoot frequency alone. The method allows summing occurrence probabilities over species to predict expected species richness as a function of the area searched. Aggregation across species, while accounting for overlap in species spatial distributions, is a simple matter of taking theminimum among the point-to-plant distances at each sampling point. The latter was demonstrated with data from a field trial in Nardetea grassland. Conclusions: The method could be a viable alternative for currently employed field methods, such as visual cover estimates, point-intercept sampling and recording the frequency of plant species in equal-area plots. Applications include, but are not limited to, conservation management monitoring and ground-truthing of remote sensing data.

Estimating crop residue cover using SPOT 5 data	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Remote sensing of percentage residue cover (PRC) is required to manage crop residue and to provide a key parameter for several biogeochemistry models. However, the growth of the next crop, crop residue decomposition, and precipitation or irrigation can affect the spectral features of crop residue and decrease the spectral difference between crop residue and soil. These factors limit the time window of image acquisition for estimating PRC, especially for double cropping systems (two crops harvested in one year). Remote sensing sensors with a short revisit interval allow imagery to be captured for a specific period (e.g., soon after harvest) when these effects are minimal. SPOT imagery has a short revisit interval of two to three days because of. its oblique viewing capacity, and provides balance between high resolution and wide-area coverage. The study aimed to investigate the potential of SPOT 5 imagery for predicting PRC in a typical area of China with a wheat (Triticum aestivum)-corn (Zea ways L.) double cropping system. A SPOT 5 image was acquired with three visible and near infrared bands and one shortwave infrared (SWIR) band, from which six normalized difference indices (NDI) were built. Wheat PRC values (n = 94) were measured immediately after wheat harvest using ground vertical photographs and divided into a calibration set (n = 62) and a validation set (n = 32). To estimate PRC linear spectral analysis and three regression methods were used. Simple linear regression (SLR) was used for its simplicity, and stepwise regression (SR) and principal component regression (PCR) were used because they could exploit the spectral information from all available image bands. Besides, the bootstrap was used to assess the prediction uncertainty of the regression methods. The results demonstrated that the NDI41 index (derived from SWIR and green bands) performed the best among the four bands and the six indices for estimating PRC when using the SLR method, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.588 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.114 for the validation set. This estimation accuracy was similar to that observed for the SR and PCR models and much better than that for the linear spectral analysis (R-2 and RMSE were 0.326 and 0.208, respectively). However, NDI41 accompanied by SLR was the optimal choice for estimating PRC because of its simplicity. These results indicate that SPOT 5 imagery could be used to estimate PRC. Therefore, this study should contribute to crop residue management.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				JUL-AUG	2017	72	4					343	350		10.2489/jswc.72.4.343								WOS:000405360300008						
J	Gordon, CE; Price, OF; Tasker, EM				Gordon, Christopher E.; Price, Owen F.; Tasker, Elizabeth M.			Mapping and exploring variation in post-fire vegetation recovery following mixed severity wildfire using airborne LiDAR	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												There is a public perception that large high-severity wildfires decrease biodiversity and increase fire hazard by homogenizing vegetation composition and increasing the cover of mid-story vegetation. But a growing literature suggests that vegetation responses are nuanced. LiDAR technology provides a promising remote sensing tool to test hypotheses about post-fire vegetation regrowth because vegetation cover can be quantified within different height strata at fine scales over large areas. We assess the usefulness of airborne LiDAR data for measuring post-fire mid-story vegetation regrowth over a range of spatial resolutions (10 x 10 m, 30 x 30 m, 50 x 50 m, 100 x 100 m cell size) and investigate the effect of fire severity on regrowth amount and spatial pattern following a mixed severity wildfire in Warrumbungle National Park, Australia. We predicted that recovery would be more vigorous in areas of high fire severity, because park managers observed dense post-fire regrowth in these areas. Moderate to strong positive associations were observed between LiDAR and field surveys of mid-story vegetation cover between 0.5-3.0 m. Thus our LiDAR survey was an apt representation of on-ground vegetation cover. LiDAR-derived mid-story vegetation cover was 22-40% lower in areas of low and moderate than high fire severity. Linear mixed-effects models showed that fire severity was among the strongest biophysical predictors of mid-story vegetation cover irrespective of spatial resolution. However much of the variance associated with these models was unexplained, presumably because soil seed banks varied at finer scales than our LiDAR maps. Dense patches of mid-story vegetation regrowth were small (median size 0.01 ha) and evenly distributed between areas of low, moderate and high fire severity, demonstrating that high-severity fires do not homogenize vegetation cover. Our results are relevant for ecosystem conservation and fire management because they: indicate that native vegetation are responsive and resilient to high-severity fire, and show the usefulness of remote sensing tools such as LiDAR to monitor post-fire vegetation recovery over large areas in situ.																	1051-0761	1939-5582				JUL	2017	27	5					1618	1632		10.1002/eap.1555/full								WOS:000405174300017	28390084					
J	Singh, M; Tokola, T; Hou, ZY; Notarnicola, C				Singh, Minerva; Tokola, Timo; Hou, Zhengyang; Notarnicola, Claudia			Remote sensing-based landscape indicators for the evaluation of threatened-bird habitats in a tropical forest	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Avian species persistence in a forest patch is strongly related to the degree of isolation and size of a forest patch and the vegetation structure within a patch and its matrix are important predictors of bird habitat suitability. A combination of space-borne optical (Landsat), ALOS-PALSAR (radar), and airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data was used for assessing variation in forest structure across forest patches that had undergone different levels of forest degradation in a logged forest-agricultural landscape in Southern Laos. The efficacy of different remote sensing (RS) data sources in distinguishing forest patches that had different seizes, configurations, and vegetation structure was examined. These data were found to be sensitive to the varying levels of degradation of the different patch categories. Additionally, the role of local scale forest structure variables (characterized using the different RS data and patch area) and landscape variables (characterized by distance from different forest patches) in influencing habitat preferences of International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red listed birds found in the study area was examined. A machine learning algorithm, MaxEnt, was used in conjunction with these data and field collected geographical locations of the avian species to identify the factors influencing habitat preference of the different bird species and their suitable habitats. Results show that distance from different forest patches played a more important role in influencing habitat suitability for the different avian species than local scale factors related to vegetation structure and health. In addition to distance from forest patches, LiDAR-derived forest structure and Landsat-derived spectral variables were important determinants of avian habitat preference. The models derived using MaxEnt were used to create an overall habitat suitability map (HSM) which mapped the most suitable habitat patches for sustaining all the avian species. This work also provides insight that retention of forest patches, including degraded and isolated forest patches in addition to large contiguous forest patches, can facilitate bird species retention within tropical agricultural landscapes. It also demonstrates the effective use of RS data in distinguishing between forests that have undergone varying levels of degradation and identifying the habitat preferences of different bird species. Practical conservation management planning endeavors can use such data for both landscape scale monitoring and habitat mapping.																	2045-7758					JUL	2017	7	13					4552	4567		10.1002/ece3.2970								WOS:000404645400004	28690786

Major land development types (reservoirs, pond, aquafarm, salt pan, road, residential land, industry land, farming land, and fishing land) in or around the YRDNR from 1995 to 2014 were identified using spatial data sets derived from remote sensing imageries. The spatial stresses were simulated by considering disturbance due to land development activities and accessibility of disturbance using a geographic information system based model. The stresses were then used to identify the impacted area by land development (IALD). The results indicated that main increasing land development types in the study area from 1995 to 2014 were salt pan and construction land. The 98.2% of expanded land development area and 93.7% of increased pump number showed a good control of reserve function zone on land development spread. The spatial stress values and percentages of IALD increased from 1995 to 2014, and IALD percentage exceeded 50% for both parts of YRDNR in 2014. The results of this study also provided the information that detailed planning of the YRDNR (2014-2020) could decrease the spatial stress and IALD percentage of the whole YRDNR on the condition that the area of land development activities increased by 24.4 km(2) from 2014 to 2020. Effective measures should be taken to protect such areas from being further disturbed in order to achieve the goal of a more effective conservation of the YRDNR, and attention should be paid to the disordered land development activities in or around the natural reserves.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2017	189	7							331	10.1007/s10661-017-6038-8								WOS:000404652900028	28608299					
J	Foster, NR; Fotheringham, DG; Brock, DJ; Waycott, M				Foster, Nicole R.; Fotheringham, Douglas G.; Brock, Daniel J.; Waycott, Michelle			A resourceful and adaptable method to obtain data on the status of seagrass meadows	AQUATIC BOTANY												Coastline degradation, as well as subsequent ecosystem loss, has long been attributed to anthropogenic stress and is an all too familiar issue affecting coastal habitats. Should management and conservation efforts fail to improve the quality of coastal ecosystems and the services they provide, they may be irrevocably damaged. A significant limitation to conservation efforts is often the ability to track change in seagrass meadows due to the significant time and cost of monitoring efforts in underwater habitats. Remote sensing is often a tool used to improve our knowledge of habitat status, however, ground-truthing remote sensing results is difficult when historical data is required. We apply an innovative and resourceful approach to the attainment of data to check the status of seagrass meadows from resources that are available in many areas due to the collection of other data sets. We employ the use of underwater digital photographs originally taken for monitoring sediment movement patterns. We were successfully able to develop a method to critically and easily evaluate these photographs for habitat status, enabling the generation of a data set unable to be obtained in other ways. This method can further be utilised in a citizen science project, for other underwater digital photographs, to support the assessment of coastal submerged ecosystem habitat status.																	0304-3770	1879-1522				JUL	2017	141						17	21		10.1016/j.aquabot.2017.04.006								WOS:000404320800003

The identification of priority areas for conservation is crucial for land use planning to ensure the protection of biodiversity and ecological function. Intact Forest Landscapes (IFLs), as defined by Greenpeace and World Resources Institute (WRI), are areas of the forest ecosystems not subjected to human activities. They have been identified by mapping human disturbances through remote sensing. Contrary to similar global-scale concepts, IFLs have been integrated into the standards of the certification body Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and therefore have practical implications for forest management policies. The Motion 65, approved in the general assembly of FSC in 2014, mandates the protection of IFLs located in FSC certified logging concessions. Until the implementation of national standards, forestry operations are banished from 80% of the IFL area within each forest management unit. To trace the history and evaluate the suitability of IFLs in the Central African context, we searched for documents related to the IFL method, and related approaches focusing on the identification of areas devoid of human disturbances. The IFL method is simple and cost-effective and allows for a global assessment of the influence of human infrastructures and industrial exploitation on forests. However, the method does not consider the situation below the canopy and those forest components not visible by satellites. For example, hunting, one of the main threats faced by wildlife in Central African forests today, cannot be detected with satellite imagery. On the other hand, other anthropogenic activities which remote sensing may detect may be compatible with forest ecosystem conservation. To better tailor the IFL approach to Central African forests, we recommend (i) the consideration of wildlife communities in the intactness analysis, (ii) a thorough evaluation of the impacts of human activities on forest ecosystems, and (iii) the integration of local stakeholders and governments in the design of land management strategies to respond to social, economic and environmental needs.

Using super-high resolution satellite imagery to census threatened albatrosses	IBIS												This study is the first to utilize 30-cm resolution imagery from the WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite to count wildlife directly. We test the accuracy of the satellite method for directly counting individuals at a well-studied colony of Wandering Albatross Diomedea exulans at South Georgia, and then apply it to the closely related Northern Royal Albatross Diomedea sanfordi, which is near-endemic to the Chatham Islands and of unknown recent population status due to the remoteness and limited accessibility of the colonies. At South Georgia, satellite-based counts were comparable to ground-based counts of Wandering Albatross nests, with a slight over-estimation due to the presence of non-breeding birds. In the Chatham Islands, satellite-based counts of Northern Royal Albatross in the 2015/2016 season were similar to ground-based counts undertaken on the Forty-Fours islands in 2009/2010, but much lower than ground-based counts undertaken on The Sisters islands in 2009/2010, which is of major conservation concern for this endangered albatross species. We conclude that the ground-breaking resolution of the newly available WV-3 satellite will provide a step change in our ability to count albatrosses and other large birds directly from space without disturbance, at potentially lower cost and with minimal logistical effort.																	0019-1019	1474-919X				JUL	2017	159	3					481	490		10.1111/ibi.12482								WOS:000403102000001						
J	Huber, N; Kery, M; Pasinelli, G				Huber, Nica; Kery, Marc; Pasinelli, Gilberto			Occupancy dynamics of the Wood Warbler Phylloscopus sibilatrix assessed with habitat and remote sensing data	IBIS												The study of population dynamics and species-habitat interactions is important for many ecological and conservation issues. We analysed the occupancy dynamics of the Wood Warbler Phylloscopus sibilatrix, a forest interior passerine that has suffered long-term declines in many European countries. Considering a broad range of habitat descriptors, including LiDAR-based variables characterizing forest structure, we identified environmental factors influencing the probabilities of occupancy, colonization, extinction and detection, and mapped these probabilities at a landscape scale. We used presence-absence data collected between 1999 and 2013 in a robust-design protocol with replicated surveys within each primary sampling season (i.e. breeding season). To analyse occupancy dynamics, we fitted dynamic occupancy models with covariates describing topography, forest extent and structure, soil, seed masting (as a proxy for rodent abundance) and weather conditions during settlement. Initial occupancy was positively related to slope, forest cover and the proportion of broadleaf forest, and negatively related to forest edge length, canopy height variation and soil nutrients. Colonization probability was positively associated with slope and negatively with canopy height variation and soil nutrients. Extinction probability was negatively related to slope, positively related to forest edge length and was lowest at intermediate vegetation heights. Detection probability decreased during the season and was positively related to forest cover. This study provides insights into the settlement dynamics of a declining forest species by identifying potential drivers of the processes underlying occupancy dynamics, instead of simply modelling species abundance or occurrence. Forest-related covariates were of overwhelming importance for the settlement dynamics of the Wood Warbler. Conservation measures should focus on providing and maintaining the species' preferred forest structure, specifically in extended forests. In Switzerland, forests located on slopes and on nutrient-poor soils should be prioritized for conservation. Finally, comparing findings derived from the relatively coarse scale of this study with those from the small scale of individual territories suggests that conservation recommendations deduced from large-scale monitoring schemes alone may be incomplete, and vice versa.																	0019-1019	1474-919X				JUL	2017	159	3					623	637		10.1111/ibi.12472								WOS:000403102000014

With the increasing carbon constraints in the context of climate change, the capacity of carbon sequestration becomes an important resource to address regional sustainable development. However, there is still a lack of an integrated methodology to evaluate urban sustainability within a local urbanization process from a carbon cycle perspective. This paper presents a new way of understanding regional sustainability, which assumes that the status of carbon balance is closely related to low carbon management and local sustain ability. The concept of carbon neutral coefficient (CNC) is proposed based on the estimation of carbon emissions and sinks, which emphasizes the fundamental role of carbon sinks in achieving low carbon development and improving local sustainability. Taking Chongming Island (China), the largest alluvial island in the world, as a case study, carbon emissions and sinks are calculated respectively according to an integrated carbon inventory and local coefficients. From 2005-2013, a temporal-spatial variation of CNC was observed on Chongming Island, owing to the different growth rate of carbon emissions and sinks. Furthermore, a spatial variation of change of CNC was detected, caused by the imbalanced spatial distribution of carbon emissions and sinks. Remote Sensing based analysis shows that the change of land use and cover which was induced by human activities can greatly influence local carbon balance and sustainable development. It is also found that the CNC results can help explaining the positive impacts and limitations of ecological environment policies in Chongming Island during the same period. Consequently, the approach of carbon balance analysis serves as an additional tool for monitoring policy effectiveness, which contributes to the debate of sustainable carbon management for local sustainable development.

Linkages between benthic assemblages and physical environmental factors: The role of geodiversity in Eastern Gulf of Finland ecosystems	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												We analyzed hydrology, geology and benthic species composition to determine benthic habitat distribution patterns in a geologically complex area of the Gulf of Finland, Northern Baltic Sea. The analysis included several datasets describing coastal influence and geodiversity at multiple spatial scales. Geodiversity in this context refers to variation and/or patchiness of benthic substrates and seabed features. Multivariate statistical methods including BEST and LINKTREE routines were used to identify correlative relationships between different ecological variables. Environmental variables (e.g. water depth, Secchi depth, salinity) were either measured by sampling and remote sensing methods or parameterized from geographic and oceanographic data. Benthic assemblages were assayed by both video recordings and zoobenthic sampling (benthic grabs). Statistical analyses identified correlations between benthic datasets and environmental variables, but correlation parameters were not consistent especially with respect to differing zoobenthic and video-based estimates of benthic diversity. The ratio of Secchi depth to water depth showed strong correlation with species distributions observed in video recordings (rho = 0.56) whereas variables describing broad-scale geodiversity and archipelago gradient (the abundance of islands, ratio of land and sea area) correlated with zoobenthic sample data (generally rho > 0.30). A model that included independent variables of Secchi depth and terrain roughness within a 20 km radius explained the greatest proportion of spatial variation in zoobenthic sample data (rho = 0.69). Secchi depth and roughness values were positively correlated with species richness. We designated nine benthic marine landscapes on the basis of these two variables. Linkage tree statistical analysis (LINKTREE) routine utilized zoobenthic sample data as these offered better regional coverage and therefore effectively tracked relationships with other environmental variables. The benthic marine landscapes found in topographically complex seabed areas possessed higher species diversity than flatter areas with fewer seabed features. Our results indicate that on broad spatial scales, geodiversity and archipelago gradient directly influence benthic assemblages by providing a range of different habitats. These factors also indirectly influence benthic assemblages by channeling water movement and thereby distributing hydrologic conditions. This study demonstrates that broad-scale geodiversity should be considered in regional and mesoscale habitat mapping, maritime spatial planning and conservation policies.

A comparison of Dynamic Habitat Indices derived from different MODIS products as predictors of avian species richness	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Understanding past and current patterns of species richness is essential for predicting how these patterns may be affected by future global change. The species energy hypothesis predicts that higher abundance and richness of animal species occur where available energy is higher and more consistently available. There is a wide range of remote sensing proxies for available energy, such as vegetation productivity, but it is not clear which best predict species richness. Our goal here was to evaluate different proxies for annual plant productivity from Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) as input for the Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs), and to determine how well they predict the richness of breeding bird species in six functional guilds across the conterminous United States. The DHIs are measures of vegetation productivity over the course of a year and consist of three components: (1) cumulative productivity (DHI Cum), (2) minimum productivity (DHI Min), and (3) intra-annual variation of productivity (DHI Var). We hypothesized that increases in cumulative and minimum productivity and reductions in intra-annual variation will be associated with higher species richness. We calculated the DHIs from a range of MODIS 1000-m vegetation productivity data sets for 20032014, i.e., the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Fraction of absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP). We summarized bird species richness of different guilds within ecoregions (n = 85) based on abundance maps derived from the >3000 routes of the North American Breeding Bird Survey for 2006 to 2012. Generally, we found all the DHI5 had high explanatory power for predicting breeding bird species richness. However, the strength of the associations between the DHI5 and bird species richness depended on habitat, nest placement, and migratory behavior. We found highest correlations for habitat-based guilds, such as grassland breeding species (R-adj(2) 0.66-0.73 for the multiple DHI regression model; R-adj(2) 0.41-0.61 for minimum DHI) and woodland breeding species (R-adj(2), 0.34-0.60 for the multiple DHI regression model; R-adj(2), 0.26-0.51 for cumulative DHI). The strong relationship between the DHI5 and bird species richness reinforces the importance of vegetation productivity as a determinant of species diversity patterns, and the usefulness of satellite data for applying the species energy hypothesis to predictions in service to conservation.

Remote sensing combined with social-ecological data: The importance of diverse land uses for ecosystem service provision in north-eastern Madagascar	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES												Through ongoing deforestation in the tropics, forest-related ecosystem services are declining, while ecosystem services provided by agricultural land uses are on the increase. Land system science provides a framework for analysing the links between land use change and the resulting socio-environmental trade-offs. However, the evidence base to support the navigation of such trade-offs is often lacking, as information on land use cannot directly be obtained through remote sensing and census data is often unavailable at sufficient spatial resolution. The global biodiversity hotspot of north-eastern Madagascar exemplifies these challenges. Combining land use data obtained through remote sensing with social-ecological data from a regional level household survey, we attempt to make the links between land use and ecosystem service benefits explicit. Our study confirmed that remotely sensed information on landscapes reflects households' involvement in rice production systems. We further characterized landscapes in terms of "ecosystem service bundles" linked to specific land uses, as well as in terms of ecosystem service benefits to households. The map of landscape types could help direct future conservation and development efforts towards places where there is potential for success. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using Landscape Characteristics to Predict Distribution of Temperate-Breeding Canada Geese	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST												Accurate estimates of species' distributions are needed to ensure that conservation-planning efforts are directed at appropriate areas. Since the early 1980s, temperate-breeding populations of Branta canadensis (Canada Goose) have increased, yet reliable estimates of the species' distribution are lacking in many regions. Our objective was to identify the landcover features that best predicted Canada Goose distribution. In April 2015, we surveyed 300 one-km(2) plots across North Carolina and observed 449 Canada Geese. We quantified percent coverage of 7 continuous landcover variables at 5 different spatial extents for each of the 300 plots. We fit logistic regression models using presence and absence at the 300 plots as the dependent variable and percent-cover covariates as independent variables. The best model for predicting Canada Goose presence included percent pasture within the 9 km(2) surrounding the survey plot and percent open water within the 1-km(2) survey plot. The probability of Canada Goose presence increased with increasing percent open water and percent pasture, albeit at different spatial extents, which provided important cover and food resources, respectively. Our approach using remote-sensing data to accurately predict Canada Goose presence across a large spatial extent can be employed to determine distributions for other easily surveyed, widely distributed species.																	1528-7092	1938-5412				JUN	2017	16	2					127	139										WOS:000418425100003

Modelling of Recent Erosion Rates in a Lake Catchment in the North-Western Siwalik Himalayas	ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL												Investigations have been carried out on Sukhna Lake catchment in the northwestern Siwalik Hills in the Himalayas, to estimate recent erosion rates and to assess the impact of conservation measures on the erosion rate. The RUSLE model has been used using data for the period of 2011-2014 and its suitability has been evaluated by comparing its estimates with the observed bathymetric data. The model was found to estimate the erosion rate with fair degree of accuracy. The average recent erosion rate for the catchment comes out to be 34.27 t ha(-1) y(-1). The slope and steepness factor is found to have a major effect on the erosion process in the catchment. About 56% of the catchment area is observed to have high to very severe soil erosion rates. It is, however, observed that the recent erosion rates in the catchment are significantly reduced compared to the erosion rates in the initial years after the construction of the lake. This significant reduction is observed to be less due to the support practices of construction of silt detention dams and terracing etc., and more due to the cover management practices like extensive reforestation and plantation undertaken in the catchment.																	2198-7491	2198-7505				JUN	2017	4	2					355	374		10.1007/s40710-017-0234-y								WOS:000414367800004

This problem is severe in Ethiopia due to its topographic features. The present research was aimed to estimate spatiotemporal changes in land-use/ land-cover pattern and soil erosion in the Yezat watershed in Ethiopia. This study was carried out by using landsat imageries of 2001, 2010 and 2015. Images were classified into categories using supervised classification by maximum likelihood algorithm. They were also classified into different biomass levels by using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) analysis. Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation modeling was applied in a GIS environment to quantify the potential soil erosion risk. The area under grassland, woodland and homesteads have increased by 610.69 (4%), 101.69 (0.67%) and 126.6 ha (0.83%) during 2001-2015. The extent of cultivated land and shrub/bushland was reduced by 323.43(0.02%) and 515.44 ha (3.41%), respectively, during the same period. The vegetation cover in the watershed decreased by 91% during 2001-2010, and increased by 88% during 2010-2015. Increase of NDVI values indicates better ground cover due to implementation of integrated watershed development program in the region. The estimated annual soil losses were 7.2 t ha(-1) yr(-1) in 2001, 7.7 t ha(-1) yr(-1) in 2010 and 4.8 t ha-1 yr kin 2015. Management interventions are necessary to improve the status and utilization of watershed resources in response to sustainable land management practices for sustainable livelihood of the local people.

Madagascar contains 2% of the world's mangroves, over 20% of which is estimated to have been deforested through charcoal production, timber extraction and agricultural development. This study presents a carbon stock assessment of the mangroves in Helodrano Fagnemotse in southwest Madagascar alongside an analysis of mangrove land-cover change from 2002 to 2014. Similar to other mangrove ecosystems in East Africa, higher stature, closed-canopy mangroves in southwest Madagascar were estimated to contain 454.92 (+/- 26.58) Mg.C.ha(-1). Although the mangrove extent in this area is relatively small (1500 ha), these mangroves are of critical importance to local communities and anthropogenic pressures on coastal resources in the area are increasing. This was evident in both field observations and remote sensing analysis, which indicated an overall net loss of 3.18% between 2002 and 2014. Further dynamics analysis highlighted widespread transitions of dense, higher stature mangroves to more sparse mangrove areas indicating extensive degradation. Harnessing the value that the carbon stored within these mangroves holds on the voluntary carbon market could generate revenue to support and incentivise locally-led sustainable mangrove management, improve livelihoods and alleviate anthropogenic pressures.																	1999-4907					JUN	2017	8	6							PMID 190	10.3390/f8060190								WOS:000404099800014

We analyzed secondary forest and shrubland dynamics over 30 years (1985-2015) in a densely populated area of the Colombian Andes using satellite and biophysical data. We performed a land-cover change analysis, assessed landscape fragmentation, and applied regression models to evaluate the effects of environmental and geographical correlates with the observed forest transitions. Forest cover area increased during the 30 year-span, due mostly to forest regrowth in areas marginal for agriculture, especially during the first half of the study period. However, a high dynamic of both forest regrowth and clearing near urban centers and roads was observed. Soil fertility turned out to be a key correlate of both forest recovery and deforestation. Secondary forests, < 30 years old represent the most fragmented component. Our findings reflect the complexity of the processes occurring in highly transformed and densely populated regions. Overall, this study provides elements for a better understanding of the factors driving land cover change near large urban areas, and raises new iideas for further research.

J	Gercek, D				Gercek, Deniz			A Conceptual Model for Delineating Land Management Units (LMUs) Using Geographical Object-Based Image Analysis	ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION												Land management and planning is crucial for present and future use of land and the sustainability of land resources. Physical, biological and cultural characteristics of land can be used to define Land Management Units (LMUs) that aid in decision making for managing land and communicating information between different research and application domains. This study aims to describe the classification of ecologically relevant land units that are suitable for land management, planning and conservation purposes. Relying on the idea of strong correlation between landform and potential landcover, a conceptual model for creating Land Management Units (LMUs) from topographic data and biophysical information is presented. The proposed method employs a multi-level object-based classification of Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) to derive landform units. The sensitivity of landform units to changes in segmentation scale is examined, and the outcome of the landform classification is evaluated. Landform classes are then aggregated with landcover information to produce ecologically relevant landform/landcover assemblages. These conceptual units that constitute a framework of connected entities are finally enriched given available socio-economic information e.g., land use, ownership, protection status, etc. to generate LMUs. LMUs attached to a geographic database enable the retrieval of information at various levels to support decision making for land management at various scales. LMUs that are created present a basis for conservation and management in a biodiverse area in the Black Sea region of Turkey.																	2220-9964					JUN	2017	6	6							170	10.3390/ijgi6060170								WOS:000404525800016

One of the major obstacle is defining the boundary of an open ocean Marine Protected Area (MPA). In contrast to coastal ecosystems, which are mostly constrained by topographic structures fixed in time, the life of marine organisms in the open ocean is entrained by fluid dynamical structures like eddies and fronts, whose lifetime occurs on ecologically-relevant timescales. The position of these highly dynamical structures can vary interannually by hundreds of km, and so too will regions identified as ecologically relevant such as the foraging areas of marine predators. Thus, the expected foraging locations suggested from tracking data cannot be directly extrapolated beyond the year in which the data were collected. Here we explore the potential of Lagrangian methods applied to multisatellite data as a support tool for a MPA proposal by focusing on the Crozet archipelago oceanic area (Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean). By combining remote sensing with biologging information from a key marine top predator (Eudyptes chrysolophus, or Macaroni penguin) of the Southern Ocean foodweb, we identify a highly dynamic branch of the Subantarctic front as a foraging hotspot. By tracking this feature in historical satellite data (1993-2012) we are able to extrapolate the position of this foraging ground beyond the years in which tracking data are available and study its spatial variability.

Informing conservation strategies for the endangered Atlantic sturgeon using acoustic telemetry and multi-state mark-recapture models	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Causes of non-intentional mortality may pose conservation challenges for long-lived, migratory species. Recovery attempts for Atlantic sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus populations in the USA have mainly involved closures of targeted fishing, but bycatch mortality from fisheries targeting other species remains a significant obstacle. Natural and fishing mortality levels are highly uncertain and difficult to separate, but quantifying spatial and temporal patterns of movements and total mortality can directly inform management policies regarding fishing activity that affects sturgeon. 2. Subadult sturgeon were tagged with acoustic transmitters to track their movements with receivers deployed in active fishing areas within the New York Bight. Multi-state mark-recapture models were used to quantify seasonal patterns in survival and migration while accounting for detection probabilities of tagged fish. 3. Movement patterns of sturgeon were highly variable among seasons along the Long Island Coast, with frequent south-westward movements during the increase in sea surface temperature in spring. North-eastward movements were most pronounced during winter, when temperatures were lowest. Sturgeon were less common along coastal Long Island during summer. 4. Larger fish transitioned among strata more frequently, but also had slightly lower survival than smaller fish, which may result from selectivity for larger individuals caught incidentally in bottom trawl or gillnet fisheries. Weekly total mortality rates, including both natural and fishing mortality, averaged 0.24%. Highest weekly survival rates were observed during periods of decreasing sea surface temperature in autumn and winter, while lowest survival was observed during periods of increasing temperature in spring and summer while sturgeon migrated through areas of known bycatch. 5. Policy implications. Movement and survival patterns of Atlantic sturgeon suggest that late spring, coinciding with periods of ocean bycatch in fisheries along the coast of Long Island, is a particularly sensitive period for Atlantic sturgeon. Conservation efforts could target these few weeks using real-time observations from acoustic telemetry and remote sensing technologies to implement in-season fishery closures, thereby reducing incidental mortality of Atlantic sturgeon. Such bycatch management measures would aid in recovery attempts of a long-lived, migratory population with endangered status.																	0021-8901	1365-2664				JUN	2017	54	3					914	925		10.1111/1365-2664.12799								WOS:000401239100025

Coastal zones that are increasingly impacted by anthropogenic development have experienced substantial declines in seagrass abundance around the world. Australia, which has some of the world's largest seagrass meadows and is home to over half of the known species, is not immune to these losses. In 1999 a review of seagrass ecosystems knowledge was conducted in Australia and strategic research priorities were developed to provide research direction for future studies and management. Subsequent rapid evolution of seagrass research and scientific methods has led to more than 70% of peer reviewed seagrass literature being produced since that time. A workshop was held as part of the Australian Marine Sciences Association conference in July 2015 in Geelong, Victoria, to update and redefine strategic priorities in seagrass research. Participants identified 40 research questions from 10 research fields (taxonomy and systematics, physiology, population biology, sediment biogeochemistry and microbiology, ecosystem function, faunal habitats, threats, rehabilitation and restoration, mapping and monitoring, management tools) as priorities for future research on Australian seagrasses. Progress in research will rely on advances in areas such as remote sensing, genomic tools, microsensors, computer modeling, and statistical analyses.

Nolte and A. Agrawal (Land Use Policy 52:15-22)	LAND USE POLICY												This viewpoint paper presents a reaction to the article by Brandt et al. (2016). It highlights the complexities inherent to the attribution of deforestation impacts to policy interventions when using remote-sensing data. This critique argues that in the context of the Congo a suite of factors (i.e., population density in particular) other than those considered by Brandt et al. (e.g., type of forest, distance from roads and markets) play essential roles in determining the fates of forests. It also contends that care is needed when making decisions regarding which units will be included in the comparison group so that contextual factors and on-the-ground information are properly considered (e.g., when logging operations are inactive or when a concession is used for 'conservation' purposes). Finally, it proposes that a focus on an analysis of deforestation rates for a given level of timber production might be a metric that more accurately represents one aspect of the consequences of forest management, which should also consider the appraisal of trade-offs associated with a larger set of social, financial and ecological objectives.

Other states of protection like the UNESCO world heritage sites, for example, are created for maintaining culturally important places or lifestyles. In the Matobo Hills (Zimbabwe) both states of protection are present, a national park and a world heritage site. In addition, the land outside the National Park belongs to two different systems of ownership, namely "common" (i.e. community-owned) and "not-common" (privately or governmentally owned) land. In this paper, we investigated how the state of protection and the ownership affected the land use and land cover. We derived maps using Landsat images from 1989, 1998 and 2014 by supervised classification with Random Forests. To compensate for the lack of ground data we inferred past land use and land cover from recent observations combining photographs, Google Earth images and change detection. We could identify four classes, namely shrub land, forest, patchy vegetation and agricultural area. The Matobo National Park showed a stable composition of land cover during the study period and the main changes were observable in the surroundings. Outside the national park, forest increased by about 7%. The common lands have changed substantially and their agricultural area decreased. We attribute this development to the Fast Track Land Reform, which took place in the early 2000s. Our approach shows that combining information on recent land cover with change detection allows to study the, temporal development of protected areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Introduction of the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) scanning system, an optical remote sensing technology, for scientific purposes have open many research possibilities especially on cave wildlife surveys. Scanned images at high resolution provide new effective biological tools for assessing bat roosts inside caves on walls or ceiling in total darkness. LiDAR system was applied to census bats that roost in Wind Cave Nature Reserve, Sarawak, Malaysia, based on laser return intensity values from the images. Bats that roost in large clusters, specifically Penthetor lucasi were determined through automated counting using connected components labelling, a graph theory algorithm mostly used in image analysis applications. Roost surface area of bats species was calculated based on point clouds extracted and using simple trigonometry. Wind Cave was successfully modelled into three dimensional (3D) cave images with bats roosting inside the cave. The roost sites of bats in the cave were represented in coloured point clouds that represent the species. Through LiDAR images, bats in Wind Cave consisted of about 979 individuals of P. lucasi and 1,907 individuals of insectivorous bats from nine species representing four families. There is a positive correlation between group size and roost area. For every additional bat, roost area is expected to increase by an average of 1.75 m(2). Our result suggested that terrestrial LiDAR technology is capable of assessing bat roosts in their natural habitat to determine their roost size and number of individuals that roost in the cave. Terrestrial LiDAR application is most complementary when integrated with field surveys to produce more reliable outcomes which open up possibilities of effective conservation action plans.																	1508-1109	1733-5329				JUN	2017	19	1					199	210		10.3161/15081109ACC2017.19.1.016								WOS:000401616000016

Drivers of bird diversity in an understudied African centre of endemism: The Angolan Central Escarpment Forest	BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL												Natural habitats are being rapidly lost due to human activities. It is therefore vital to understand how these activities influence biodiversity so that suitable guidelines can be established for conservation. This is particularly important in understudied, high biodiversity, areas such as the Angolan Escarpment. Here we examine which habitat characteristics drive bird diversity and endemic species presence at Kumbira Forest, a key site in the Central Escarpment Forest. Bird diversity was sampled by 10 min bird point counts, whereas habitat characteristics were measured by a combination of ground-based vegetation surveys and remotely sensed data modelling of Landsat images. GLM, multi-model inference and model averaging were used to determine the most important variables driving species richness and the presence of endemics. The remote sensing variables performed poorly in predicting presence of Red-crested Turaco Tauraco erythrolophus and Gabela Bushshrike Laniarius amboimensis but they contributed significantly to explain species richness and Gabela Akalat Sheppardia gabela presence, both of which were associated with greater canopy cover. Liana density and elevation were also important explanatory variables in certain cases. Conservation actions at Kumbira should focus on increasing canopy cover and maintaining forest integrity (as measured by liana density), as these actions are likely to have the most positive outcomes for the avifauna.

LocationTin Toumma desert, Niger MethodsIntegrating field surveys, collected over a 7-year period (2008-2014), with remote sensing-derived measures of vegetation productivity (NDVI) and surface roughness, we fit models in a generalized linear regression framework to predict and evaluate the occurrence of addax and dorcas gazelle. ResultsAddax declined significantly over the course of the study, strongly affecting the outcomes of our regression models. Other factors, namely surface roughness and the occurrence of the perennial grass Stipagrostis acutiflora, were important in predicting addax occurrence. Dorcas gazelle, inhabiting areas further to the south of our study area, were more positively associated with increases in vegetation productivity than addax. Both species were observed to have a strong negative response to human disturbance. Predictive models, relying only on remotely sensed derived variables, provided insight into areas of habitat suitability and highlighted niche partitioning across the Sahelo-Saharan biome. Main conclusionsOur results provide improved insight into the factors contributing to the occurrence of this critically endangered (addax) and vulnerable (dorcas gazelle) species and may help guide future field surveys across the region to locate small and geographically isolated populations. Developing statistically based ecological habitat models provide a first-step towards improved management and policy development for the long-term conservation of these species and complement field surveys conducted across the region to monitor species that are increasingly being pushed to extinction.

Decline of a giant salamander assessed with historical records, environmental DNA and multi-scale habitat data	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Freshwater species are declining rapidly but more complete data are needed for determining the extent and cause(s) of population declines and extirpations. Integrating newer survey techniques, freely available data, and traditional field work may allow for more effective assessment of population decline. We used detailed historical species records and environmental DNA (eDNA) survey methods to identify changes in population distribution of a long-lived, imperiled stream salamander, the eastern hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis: Cryptobranchidae). We used logistic regression with Bayesian inference to test whether selected environmental variables may be good predictors of hellbender population persistence and extirpation. Hellbenders persisted in only 42% of the 24 historical record sites. The best fit model indicated electrical conductivity (EC) was the strongest predictor of hellbender population persistence (EC<278S/cm) and extirpation. Conductivity was strongly negatively correlated with canopy cover within the total watershed (r=-0.83, n=21, p<0.001) and riparian buffer of the watershed (r=-0.77, n=21, p<0.001). Electrical conductivity tends to increase following deforestation, and may inhibit sperm motility and thus limit recruitment of hellbenders and other aquatic vertebrate species with external fertilisation. By integrating historical data, eDNA, field data, and freely available high resolution remote sensing data, our study design allowed for rapid assessment of predictors of and changes in hellbender distribution over a relatively broad geographic area. This cost- and time-effective approach may be used for evaluating other rare aquatic species.																	0046-5070	1365-2427				JUN	2017	62	6					967	976		10.1111/fwb.12917								WOS:000400571200001

Energy Development in Colorado's Pawnee National Grasslands: Mapping and Measuring the Disturbance Footprint of Renewables and Non-Renewables	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												This paper examines the pattern and extent of energy development in steppe landscapes of northeast Colorado, United States. We compare the landscape disturbance created by oil and gas production to that of wind energy inside the Pawnee National Grasslands eastern side. This high-steppe landscape consists of a mosaic of federal, state, and private lands where dominant economic activities include ranching, agriculture, tourism, oil and gas extraction, and wind energy generation. Utilizing field surveys, remote sensing data and geographic information systems techniques, we quantify and map the footprint of energy development at the landscape level. Findings suggest that while oil and gas and wind energy development have resulted in a relatively small amount of habitat loss within the study area, the footprint stretches across the entire zone, fragmenting this mostly grassland habitat. Futhermore, a third feature of this landscape, the non-energy transportation network, was also found to have a significant impact. Combined, these three features fragment the entire Pawnee National Grasslands eastern side, leaving very few large intact core, or roadless areas. The primary objective of this ongoing work is to create a series of quantifiable and replicable surface disturbance indicators linked to energy production in semi-arid grassland environments. Based on these, and future results, we aim to work with industry and regulators to shape energy policy as it relates to environmental performance, with the aim of reducing the footprint and thus increasing the sustainability of these extractive activities.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				JUN	2017	59	6					995	1016		10.1007/s00267-017-0846-z								WOS:000400444100010	28374225

Biodiversity mapping can benefit from multi-spectral instruments such as WorldView-2 with very high spatial resolution and a spectral configuration encompassing important spectral regions not previously available for vegetation mapping. This study investigated i) the benefits of the eight-band WorldView-2 (WV-2) spectral configuration for discriminating tree species in Southern African savannah and ii) if multiple-images acquired at key points of the typical phenological development of savannahs (peak productivity, transition to senescence) improve on tree species classifications. We first assessed the discriminatory power of WV-2 bands using interspecies-Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) via Band Add-On procedure and tested the spectral capability of WorldView-2 against simulated IKONOS for tree species classification. The results from interspecies-SAM procedure identified the yellow and red bands as the most statistically significant bands (p = 0.000251 and p = 0.000039 respectively) in the discriminatory power of WV-2 during the transition from wet to dry season (April). Using Random Forest classifier, the classification scenarios investigated showed that i) the 8-bands of the WV-2 sensor achieved higher classification accuracy for the April date (transition from wet to dry season, senescence) compared to the March date (peak productivity season) ii) the WV-2 spectral configuration systematically outperformed the IKONOS sensor spectral configuration and iii) the multi-temporal approach (March and April combined) improved the discrimination of tress species and produced the highest overall accuracy results at 80.4%. Consistent with the interspecies-SAM procedure, the yellow (605 nm) band also showed a statistically significant contribution in the improved classification accuracy from WV-2. These results highlight the mapping opportunities presented by WV-2 data for monitoring the distribution status of e.g. species often harvested by local communities (e.g. Sclerocharya birrea), encroaching species, or species-specific tree losses induced by elephants.

Specifically, plant invasions in understory tropical forests are detrimental to the persistence of healthy ecosystems. Monitoring such invasions using Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite remote sensing has been shown to be valuable in designing management interventions for conservation of native habitats. Object-based classification methods are very helpful in identifying invasive plants in various habitats, by their inherent nature of imitating the ability of the human brain in pattern recognition. However, these methods have not been tested adequately in dense tropical mixed forests where invasion occurs in the understorey. This study compares a pixel-based and object-based classification method for mapping the understorey invasive shrub Lantana camara (Lantana) in a tropical mixed forest habitat in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot in India. Overall, a hierarchical approach of mapping top canopy at first, and then further processing for the understorey shrub, using measures such as texture and vegetation indices proved effective in separating out Lantana from other cover types. In the first method, we implement a simple parametric supervised classification for mapping cover types, and then process within these types for Lantana delineation. In the second method, we use an object-based segmentation algorithm to map cover types, and then perform further processing for separating Lantana. The improved ability of the object-based approach to delineate structurally distinct objects with characteristic spectral and spatial characteristics of their own, as well as with reference to their surroundings, allows for much flexibility in identifying invasive understorey shrubs among the complex vegetation of the tropical forest than that provided by the parametric classifier. Conservation practices in tropical mixed forests can benefit greatly by adopting methods which use high resolution remotely sensed data and advanced techniques to monitor the patterns and effective functioning of native ecosystems by periodically mapping disturbances such as invasion.																	1664-462X					MAY 31	2017	8								892	10.3389/fpls.2017.00892								WOS:000402385000001	28620400

Large-scale coastal land reclamation can have adverse effects on the coastal environment, including loss of marine habitats and deterioration of coastal water quality. In recent decades, coastal land reclamation has occurred extensively to meet the increasing needs of rapid economic development and urbanization in China. The overall objective of this study is to understand the coastal reclamation status of China from 1979 to 2014 and analyzed its driving factors for mitigating negative ecological effects. The data of coastal reclamation were done with the ERDAS Imagine V9.2 platform and ArcGIS software based on remote images including Landsat, SPOT, ZY-2 and ZY-3. Potential driving factors for sea reclamation were selected based on statistics bulletins and the knowledge of experts in coastal management. In order to understand the relationships among possible impact factors and coastal reclamation, the Partial Least-Squares Regression models was constructed. The analysis results indicated that the total area of reclamation was 11162.89 km(2) based on remote sensing images between 1979 and 2014. Shandong Province is the largest reclamation area, reaching 2736.54 km(2), and the reclamation is mainly concentrated in Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Liaoning, where the reclamation areas were all more than 1000 km(2). According to the remote sensing images, there are three coastal reclamation hotspot regions including Bohai bay (in which is located Liaoning, Tianjin and Hebei), Jiangsu province coastal area and Hangzhou bay (in Zhejiang province). A large scale land reclamation plan of more than 5880 km(2) has been made by local government and 2469 km(2) has approved by the State Council. From the analyzed results, there is a significant collinearity between these indicators, and no significant correlation between the area of reclamation and selected indicators. Economic development and employees in marine industries have weak positive correlation and correspondingly, the area of cultivated land (ACL) had a negative correlation. Because of the weak correlation, there is an assumption that economic development, outcome of coastal reclamation and population growth were not only was the direct driving factor, but also the outcome of coastal reclamation and population growth was not the direct driving indicator. Construction land quota and huge economic returns to local government may be the direct driving factors according to our field investigation. To resolve the contradiction between the need for land and coastal wetland conservation, it is recommended that China should establish a special management agency and coordination mechanisms, reconsidered the implementation of the reclamation plans and projects that have been approved, enhance law enforcement and increase penalties and strengthen public participation in reclamation management.

Major efforts are being made to implement soil and water conservation measures that counteract soil erosion and help secure vital ecosystem services. However, where and to what extent such measures have been implemented is often not well documented. Knowledge about this could help to identify areas where soil and water conservation measures are successfully supporting sustainable land management, as well as areas requiring urgent rehabilitation of conservation structures such as terraces and bunds. This study explores the potential of the latest satellite-based remote sensing technology for use in assessing and monitoring the extent of existing soil and water conservation structures. We used a set of very high resolution stereo Geoeye-1 satellite data, from which we derived a detailed digital surface model as well as a set of other spectral, terrain, texture, and filtered information layers. We developed and applied an object-based classification approach, working on two segmentation levels. On the coarser level, the aim was to delimit certain landscape zones. Information about these landscape zones is useful in distinguishing different types of soil and water conservation structures, as each zone contains certain specific types of structures. On the finer level, the goal was to extract and identify different types of linear soil and water conservation structures. The classification rules were based mainly on spectral, textural, shape, and topographic properties, and included object relationships. This approach enabled us to identify and separate from other classes the majority (78.5%) of terraces and bunds, as well as most hillside terraces (81.25%). Omission and commission errors are similar to those obtained by the few existing studies focusing on the same research objective but using different types of remotely sensed data. Based on our results, we estimate that the construction of the conservation structures in our study area in Eritrea required over 300,000 person-days of work, which underlines the huge efforts involved in soil and water conservation.

They provide critical habitats and a variety of ecosystem services in this arid environment. Since desert riparian forests are also sensitive to disturbance, examining the spatial distribution and temporal variation of these forests and their influencing factors is important to determine the limiting factors of vegetation recovery after long-term restoration. In this study, field experiment and remote sensing data were used to determine the spatial distribution and temporal variation of desert riparian forests and their relationship with the environmental factors. We classified five types of vegetation communities at different distances from the river channel. Community coverage and diversity formed a bimodal pattern, peaking at the distances of 1000 and 3000 m from the river channel. In general, the temporal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) trend from 2000 to 2014 was positive at different distances from the river channel, except for the region closest to the river bank (i.e. within 500m from the river channel), which had been undergoing degradation since 2011. The spatial distribution of desert riparian forests was mainly influenced by the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties (e.g. soil moisture, bulk density and soil particle composition). Meanwhile, while the temporal variation of vegetation was affected by both the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties (e.g. soil moisture and soil particle composition) and to a lesser extent, the temporal variation of water availability (e.g. annual average and variability of groundwater, soil moisture and runoff). Since surface (0-30 cm) and deep (100-200 cm) soil moisture, bulk density and the annual average of soil moisture at 100 cm obtained from the remote sensing data were regarded as major determining factors of community distribution and temporal variation, conservation measures that protect the soil structure and prevent soil moisture depletion (e.g. artificial soil cover and water conveyance channels) were suggested to better protect desert riparian forests under climate change and intensive human disturbance.																	1027-5606	1607-7938				MAY 9	2017	21	5					2405	2419		10.5194/hess-21-2405-2017								WOS:000419816000001

We produced consistent Central Asia forest cover (CAFC) maps based on a cost-efficient approach using multi-resolution satellite imagery from Landsat and MODIS during 2009-2011. The spectral-temporal metrics derived from 2009-2011 Landsat imagery (overall accuracy of 0.83) was used to predict sub-pixel forest cover on the MODIS scale for 2010. Accuracy assessment confirmed the validity of MODIS-based forest cover map with a normalized root-mean-square error of 0.63. A general paucity of forest resources in post-Soviet Central Asia was indicated, with 1.24% of the region covered by forest. In comparison to the CAFC map, a regional map derived from MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields tended to underestimate forest cover, while the Global Forest Change product matched well. The Global Forest Resources Assessments, based on individual country reports, overestimated forest cover by 1.5 to 147 times, particularly in the more arid countries of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Multi-resolution imagery contributes to regionalized assessment of forest cover in the world's drylands while developed CAFC maps (available at https://data.zef.de/) aim to facilitate decisions on biodiversity conservation and reforestation programs in Central Asia.

Thus, from 1997 to 2006, it was observed an increase in the classes of medium to very high physiognomy and the occurrence of an ecological succession process, allowing greater soil protection. However, from 2006 to 2016, the studied section showed a reduction in the classes of greater protection of the land cover. In relation to economic activities, there was a reduction in permanent crops and an increase in temporary cropsfrom 1997 to 2015, resulting in a larger area exposed to natural inclemencies. On the other hand, a reduction of 21.7% in livestock (bovine, ovine and caprine) from 1997 to 2015 and a 20.2% decrease in the withdrawal of wood for the production of charcoal and firewood from 2004 to 2015, Enabled the vegetation to regenerate. In view of the above, the data presented should allow the development of other studies and constitute a basis for the elaboration of strategies aimed at the conservation of the environment in question.																	1980-5772	2177-4307				MAY-AUG	2017	11	26					160	172										WOS:000411161400011

Estimating the degree of ecosystem response attributable specifically to eradication of exotic herbivores versus restoration of native herbivores is often difficult and is complicated by concurrent temporal changes in other factors, especially climate. We investigated the interactive impacts of native mega-herbivores (giant tortoises) and the eradication of large alien herbivores (goats) on vegetation productivity across the Galapagos Archipelago. We examined archipelago-wide patterns of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a proxy for vegetation productivity between 2001 and 2015 and evaluated how goat and historical and current tortoise occurrence influenced productivity. We used a breakpoint analysis to detect change in trends in productivity from five targeted areas following goat eradication. We found a positive association between tortoise occurrence and vegetation productivity and a negative association with goat occurrence. We also documented an increase in plant productivity following goat removal with recovery higher in moister regions than in arid region, potentially indicating an alternate stable state has been created in the latter. Climate variation also contributed to the detected improvement in productivity following goat eradication, sometimes obscuring the effect of eradication but more usually magnifying it by up to 300%. Our work offers perspectives regarding the effectiveness and outcomes of eradicating introduced herbivores and re-introducing native herbivores, and the merits of staging them simultaneously in order to restore critical ecosystem processes such as vegetation productivity.

Currently, there is insufficient information on the magnitude of human pressure affecting one such important forest community, namely Sand Forest, particularly in communal areas. The temporal monitoring of the spatial structures of forest areas, such as Sand Forest, within landscapes has been recommended in order to detect and model deteriorating trends in the forest structures and functioning. Remote sensing is critical in the generation of data that enables the identification and quantification of degraded and deforested areas. The constrained distribution and fragmented patches associated with Sand Forest, and the effects of a declining canopy closure, resulting from selective wood harvesting, requires the use of remote sensing techniques and procedures that could potentially account for these characteristics. A spectral index that has been widely successful in monitoring disturbances in forests is the Disturbance Index. The success of the Disturbance Index in detecting changes could be attributed to the components that comprise the Disturbance Index, in that it takes into account the relationship that exists between soil; vegetation; and canopy & soil moisture. The suitability of determining changes could also be attributed to the approach taken by the Disturbance Index i.e. monitoring disturbance versus a component of vegetation, such as the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (biomass). The rates of change derived for the study period (1998 to 2014) provided quantified information on the magnitude of human pressure affecting Sand Forest throughout Maputaland. The rates of change showed that the accumulated total loss in the extent of Sand Forest, across the South African section of Maputaland, was 15.53 km(2) over a period of 16 years.

A.			Alluvial groundwater recharge estimation in semi-arid environment using remotely sensed data	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Data limitations on groundwater (GW) recharge over large areas are still a challenge for efficient water resource management, especially in semi-arid regions. Thus, this study seeks to integrate hydrological cycle variables from satellite imagery to estimate the spatial distribution of GW recharge in the Ipanema river basin (IRB), which is located in the State of Pernambuco in Northeast Brazil. Remote sensing data, including monthly maps (2011-2012) of rainfall, runoff and evapotranspiration, are used as input for the water balance method within Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Rainfall data are derived from the TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) Version 7 (3B43V7) product and present the same monthly average temporal distributions from 15 rain gauges that are distributed over the study area (r = 0.93 and MAE = 12.7 mm), with annual average estimates of 894.3 (2011) and 300.7 mm (2012). The runoff from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) method, which is based on regional soil information and Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor image, represents 29% of the TMPA rainfall that was observed across two years of study. Actual evapotranspiration data, which were provided by the SEBAL application of MODIS images, present annual averages of 1213 (2011) and 1067 (2012) mm. The water balance results reveal a large inter-annual difference in the IRB GW recharge, which is characterized by different rainfall regimes, with averages of 30.4 (2011) and 4.7 (2012) mm year(-1). These recharges were mainly observed between January and July in regions with alluvial sediments and highly permeable soils. The GW recharge approach with remote sensing is compared to the WTF (Water Table Fluctuation) method, which is used in an area of alluvium in the IRB. The estimates from these two methods exhibit reliable annual agreement, with average values of 154.6 (WTF) and 124.6 (water balance) mm in 2011. These values correspond to 14.89 and 13.53% of the rainfall that was recorded at the rain gauges and the TMPA, respectively. Only the WTF method indicates a very low recharge of 15.9 mm for the second year. The values in this paper provide reliable insight regarding the use of remotely sensed data to evaluate the rates of alluvial GW recharge in regions where the potential runoff cannot be disregarded from WB equation and must be calculated spatially.

J	Mo, Y; Kearney, M; Momen, B				Mo, Yu; Kearney, Michael; Momen, Bahram			Drought-associated phenological changes of coastal marshes in Louisiana	ECOSPHERE												Drought poses serious threats to the valuable coastal marsh ecosystems, especially considering that the frequency, intensity, and acuteness of drought may increase with prospective climate change. We study the drought-associated phenological changes of Louisiana coastal marshes through combining remote sensing-derived phenological record (i.e., Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, or NDVI) and field-based environmental data during the past 30 yr. We find that drought condition in southeast Louisiana is characterized by decreased discharge of the Mississippi River and reduced precipitation, which correlate with the continental weather patterns over the conterminous United States influenced by La Nina. The peak NDVI day of saline marshes delays for two months (P < 0.01), from mid-July to mid-September, and their growth duration consequently shortens for two months (P < 0.01) in drought years. Such phenological changes might result from the inhibition of the growth of Spartina alterniflora, a dominant species in saline marshes whose biomass peaks earlier than the coexisting species, perhaps due to reduced freshwater input and increased water deficit. Drought might also cause Spartina dieback via similar mechanisms. Our results underline the correlation between drought in southeast Louisiana and La Nina and highlight the sensitivity of saline marshes to drought, thereby providing valuable information for coastal marsh management and conservation facing climate change.																	2150-8925					MAY	2017	8	5							e01811	10.1002/ecs2.1811								WOS:000402472300022

Scrubbing Up: Multi-Scale Investigation of Woody Encroachment in a Southern African Savannah	REMOTE SENSING												Changes in the extent of woody vegetation represent a major conservation question in many savannah systems around the globe. To address the problem of the current lack of broad-scale cost-effective tools for land cover monitoring in complex savannah environments, we use a multi-scale approach to quantifying vegetation change in Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa. We test whether medium spatial resolution satellite data (Landsat, existing back to the 1970s), which have pixel sizes larger than typical vegetation patches, can nevertheless capture the thematic detail required to detect woody encroachment in savannahs. We quantify vegetation change over a 13-year period in KNP, examine the changes that have occurred, assess the drivers of these changes, and compare appropriate remote sensing data sources for monitoring change. We generate land cover maps for three areas of southern KNP using very high resolution (VHR) and medium resolution satellite sensor imagery from February 2001 to 2014. Considerable land cover change has occurred, with large increases in shrubs replacing both trees and grassland. Examination of exclosure areas and potential environmental driver data suggests two mechanisms: elephant herbivory removing trees and at least one separate mechanism responsible for conversion of grassland to shrubs, theorised to be increasing atmospheric CO2. Thus, the combination of these mechanisms causes the novel two-directional shrub encroachment that we observe (tree loss and grassland conversion). Multi-scale comparison of classifications indicates that although spatial detail is lost when using medium resolution rather than VHR imagery for land cover classification (e.g., Landsat imagery cannot readily distinguish between tree and shrub classes, while VHR imagery can), the thematic detail contained within both VHR and medium resolution classifications is remarkably congruent. This suggests that medium resolution imagery contains sufficient thematic information for most broad-scale land cover monitoring requirements in heterogeneous savannahs, while having the benefits of being cost-free and providing a longer historical archive of data than VHR sources. We conclude that monitoring of broad-scale land cover change using remote sensing has considerable potential as a cost-effective tool for both better informing land management practitioners, and for monitoring the future landscape-scale impacts of management policies in savannahs.

The goal of this study was to develop a fine-scale, remote-sensing-based approach that indicates favorable burrow locations for G. agassizii in the Boulder City (Nevada) Conservation Easement area (35,500 ha). This was done by analyzing airborne LiDAR data (5-7 points/m(2)) and color imagery (four bands, 0.15-m resolution) and determining the percent vegetation cover; shrub height and area; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); and several geomorphic characteristics including slope, azimuth, and roughness. Other field data used herein include estimates of canopy area and species richness using 1271 line transects, and shrub height and canopy area using plant-specific measurements of similar to 200 plants. Larrea tridentata and Ambrosia dumosa shrubs were identified using an algorithm that obtained an optimum combination of NDVI and average reflectance of the four bands (IR, R, G, and B) from pixels in each image. The results, which identified more than 65 million shrubs across the study area, indicate that percent vegetation cover from aerial imagery across the site (13.92%) compared favorably (14.52%) to the estimate obtained from line transects, though the LiDAR method yielded shrub heights approximately 60% those of measured shrub heights. Landscape and plant properties were combined with known locations of tortoise burrows, as visually observed in 2014. Masks were created using roughness coefficient, slope percent, azimuth of burrow openings, elevation, and percent vegetation cover to isolate areas more likely to host burrows. Combined, the masks isolated 55% of the total survey area, which will help target future field surveys. Overall, the approach provides areas where tortoise burrows are more likely to be found, though additional ecological data would help refine the overall method.

J	Awadallah, AG; Farahat, MS; Haggag, M				Awadallah, Ayman G.; Farahat, Mahmoud S.; Haggag, Mohammed			Discussion of "Interfacing the geographic information system, remote sensing, and the soil conservation service-curve number method to estimate curve number and runoff volume in the ASIR region of Saudi Arabia" by Fawzi S. Mohammad, Jan Adamowski	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The soil conservation service curve number (SCSCN) method is one of the most commonly used methods to compute the direct runoff from a rainfall event. Since the method was established, numerous researches were undertaken to improve the method through accurate estimation of its parameter and especially the curve number (CN). However, the essence of the SCS method, as an event-based Hortonian mechanism method, remained unchanged. The main assumption of the method related to the rainfall input is that the rainfall is continuous in time and uniform over the watershed. Mohammad and Adamowski (2015) paper apparently used the SCS method to estimate the annual runoff using the annual rainfall as one cumulative rainfall input value, which is a violation of the event-based principle of the method and of the assumption of the continuity of the rainfall event. To re-estimate the average annual runoff more realistically for the Asir region, Saudi Arabia, daily rainfall data from 14 rainfall stations are used for calculating the resulting runoff depths, on a daily event-by-event rainfall basis, throughout the whole simulation period. The resulting runoff depths are added for each year, and the total cumulative annual runoff values for each year are averaged to get the average annual runoff. The runoff values based on the previously mentioned procedure are an upper limit of the actual average annual runoff as the underlying SCS equations discard evaporation and similar long-term losses. Nevertheless, the average runoff values obtained in the discussion paper are an order ofmagnitude (at least five to tenfold) lower than the ones of the original paper. An equation is proposed to obtain a more realistic estimate of the average annual runoff, to be used with the average annual rainfall as an input, if the annual value is the only available rainfall information.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				MAY	2017	10	9							214	10.1007/s12517-017-2984-2								WOS:000401323000017

Based on land use pattern and benefit transfer method, this research estimated value of ecosystem services in Taiwan. Scientific information of land use and land cover change is accessed through multi-year satellite imagery moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), and geographic information system (GIS) technology. Combined with benefit transfer method, this research estimated the ecosystem service valuation of forest, grassland, cropland, wetland, water, and urban for the period of 2000 to 2015 in Taiwan. It is found that forest made the greatest contribution and the significant increasing area of wetland has huge potential benefit for environmental conservation in Taiwan. We recommend placing maintaining wetland ecosystem in Taiwan with higher priority. This research also compared ecosystem service value with natural capital consumption which would essentially facilitate policy makers to understand the relationship between benefits gained from natural capital and the loss from human-made capital.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				MAY	2017	24	13					12144	12154		10.1007/s11356-017-8795-x								WOS:000400765500029	28349311

Comparing the Use of Camera Traps and Farmer Reports to Study Crop Feeding Behavior of Moor Macaques (Macaca maura)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY												Investigating crop feeding patterns by primates is an increasingly important objective for primatologists and conservation practitioners alike. Although camera trap technology is used to study primates and other wildlife in numerous ways, i.e., activity patterns, social structure, species richness, abundance, density, diet, and demography, it is comparatively underused in the study of human-primate interactions. We compare photographic (N = 210) and video (N = 141) data of crop feeding moor macaques (Macaca maura) from remote sensor cameras, functioning for 231 trap days, with ethnographic data generated from semistructured interviews with local farmers. Our results indicate that camera traps can provide data on the following aspects of crop feeding behavior: species, crop type and phase targeted, harvesting technique used, and daily and seasonal patterns of crop feeding activity. We found camera traps less useful, however, in providing information on the individual identification and age/sex class of crop feeders, exact group size, and amount of crops consumed by the moor macaques. While farmer reports match camera trap data regarding crop feeding species and how wildlife access the gardens, they differ when addressing crop feeding event frequency and timing. Understanding the mismatches between camera trap data and farmer reports is valuable to conservation efforts that aim to mitigate the conflict between crop feeding wildlife and human livelihoods. For example, such information can influence changes in the way certain methods are used to deter crop feeding animals from damaging crops. Ultimately, we recommend using remote-sensing camera technology in conjunction with other methods to study crop feeding behavior.																	0164-0291	1573-8604				MAY	2017	38	2					224	242		10.1007/s10764-016-9945-6								WOS:000400934800007

Modern tools and techniques of Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) were used for assessment of runoff generating potential using the Hydrologic Soil Cover Complex (HSCC) Method [U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)-Soil Conservation System-Curve Number (SCS-CN) approach]. RS and GIS were used in generation and integration of thematic maps [such as Land use/Land cover (using LISS-III data) and Hydrologic Soil Group (HSG), (using soil map of study area) to derive the Curve Number (CN) for simulating Runoff (R-o)]. The daily rainfall (P) data for the study period 2002-2015 were acquired from NOAA Climate Prediction Center (NCPC). Corresponding R-o from the watershed for intense storm events for 14 years were calculated through RS and GIS. GIS and SCS-CN model was employed for modelling the runoff production to study its hydrological behaviour. The study showed that the Manesar Nala watershed was having a composite Curve Number - II (CNII) value of 82.5 for normal conditions. For dry and wet conditions these values were estimated at 66.44 (CNI) and 91.56 (CNIII), respectively. This investigation showed that Manesar Nala watershed exhibited an annual average (of 14 years, 2002-2015) R-o volume of 4 542 514.37 m(3) based on the average annual rainfall (P) of 0.72 m (720 mm). The average annual surface runoff (R-o) was predicted to be approximately 0.21 m with annual runoff coefficient (C-R) of 0.29. During the study, we also found a strong correlation 'r' between satellite driven P and R-o from NRCS-CN method of the order of 0.94. The methodology so developed has the potential to be used in other similar ungauged watersheds in the same agro-climatic conditions for the purpose of planning of watershed conservation measures and other developmental activities.

Numerical simulations demonstrate that VPM possesses the desired features, such as high fidelity prediction of the scattering amplitude function and fulfillment of energy conservation as well as the reciprocity theorem.

However, the comprehensive understanding of urban environmental change in China based on multi-source remote sensing data remains inadequate because current studies have mainly focused on a single aspect of the urban environment using a specific source of remote sensing data. In this study, we developed a comprehensive evaluation index (CEI) combining the remote sensing data of the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration, land surface temperature (1ST) and vegetation cover (VC) to assess the urban environmental change in China at the national scale, among urban agglomerations and across the rapidly urbanized regions. We found a trend of environmental degradation in the urban areas of China between 2000 and 2012. Environmentally degraded and moderately degraded urban areas accounted for 48.14% of the total urban area in China. In particular, the expanded urban areas exhibited the most extensive environmental degradation, with 52.33% of the total expanded urban areas from 1992 to 2012 exhibiting environmental degradation or moderately environmental degradation. The increase in the PM2.5 concentration was one of the main manifestations of the environmental degradation in the expanded urban areas. We suggest that more attention should be paid to urban environmental issues during future urban development in China. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

There is a growing interest in using the C services of wetlands to help reduce habitat loss and finance restoration projects. However, including wetlands in C markets worldwide requires a better mechanistic understanding of CO2 and methane exchange and instruments and models that can accurately and inexpensively monitor and predict these fluxes across global wetlands. Remote sensing technology, including near-surface and satellite instruments/approaches, is an effective tool for modeling C fluxes including gross primary productivity (GPP) from the site to global scale. In this study, we evaluate the potential of using digital cameras as a simple, cost-effective means of estimating GPP in restored wetlands, and assess the suitability of using Landsat data to model GPP in these environments for regional upscaling. Our research focused on restored temperate freshwater marshes due to their high C sequestration potential. As observed in other ecosystems, daily GPP was strongly correlated with site greenness derived from camera imagery (GCC(cam)). Based on this, we show the potential of using GCCcam and eddy covariance data to adapt and parameterize a light use efficiency (LUE) model to predict daily GPP. The LUE model combining GCCcam and meteorological data was able to explain up to 91% of the variation in daily GPP at the restored marshes, and predict annual GPP budgets within 0% to 20% of observed budgets. However, model performance decreased with increasing site complexity, highlighting the need to explicitly consider spatial heterogeneity in LUE models. We also tested a similar model using Landsat-derived indices, and found that although model performance was high at a homogeneous wetland dominated by emergent vegetation, data-model agreement decreased at a site comprised of a mixture of open water and vegetation, reflecting limitations of Landsat data. Nonetheless, we show that digital camera and Land sat imagery can be used to model photosynthesis in restored wetlands, providing low-cost methods for monitoring C capture that can be used in C market-funded wetland conservation and restoration.

J	Moore, JW; Olden, JD				Moore, Jonathan W.; Olden, Julian D.			Response diversity, nonnative species, and disassembly rules buffer freshwater ecosystem processes from anthropogenic change	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Integrating knowledge of environmental degradation, biodiversity change, and ecosystem processes across large spatial scales remains a key challenge to illuminating the resilience of earth's systems. There is now a growing realization that the manner in which communities will respond to anthropogenic impacts will ultimately control the ecosystem consequences. Here, we examine the response of freshwater fishes and their nutrient excretion -a key ecosystem process that can control aquatic productivity -to human land development across the contiguous United States. By linking a continental-scale dataset of 533 fish species from 8100 stream locations with species functional traits, nutrient excretion, and land remote sensing, we present four key findings. First, we provide the first geographic footprint of nutrient excretion by freshwater fishes across the United States and reveal distinct local-and continental-scale heterogeneity in community excretion rates. Second, fish species exhibited substantial response diversity in their sensitivity to land development; for native species, the more tolerant species were also the species contributing greater ecosystem function in terms of nutrient excretion. Third, by modeling increased land-use change and resultant shifts in fish community composition, land development is estimated to decrease fish nutrient excretion in the majority (63%) of ecoregions. Fourth, the loss of nutrient excretion would be 28% greater if biodiversity loss was random or 84% greater if there were no nonnative species. Thus, ecosystem processes are sensitive to increased anthropogenic degradation but biotic communities provide multiple pathways for resistance and this resistance varies across space.																	1354-1013	1365-2486				MAY	2017	23	5					1871	1880		10.1111/gcb.13536								WOS:000397800600010	27761971

Potential of satellite-derived ecosystem functional attributes to anticipate species range shifts	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												In a world facing rapid environmental changes, anticipating their impacts on biodiversity is of utmost relevance. Remotely-sensed Ecosystem Functional Attributes (EFAs) are promising predictors for Species Distribution Models (SDMs) by offering an early and integrative response of vegetation performance to environmental drivers. Species of high conservation concern would benefit the most from a better ability to anticipate changes in habitat suitability. Here we illustrate how yearly projections from SDMs based on EFAs could reveal short-term changes in potential habitat suitability, anticipating mid-term shifts predicted by climate-change-scenario models. We fitted two sets of SDM5 for 41 plant species of conservation concern in the Iberian Peninsula: one calibrated with climate variables for baseline conditions and projected under two climate-change-scenarios (future conditions); and the other calibrated with EFAs for 2001 and projected annually from 2001 to 2013. Range shifts predicted by climate-based models for future conditions were compared to the 2001-2013 trends from EFAs-based models. Projections of EFAs-based models estimated changes (mostly contractions) in habitat suitability that anticipated, for the majority (up to 64%) of species, the mid-term shifts projected by traditional climate-change scenario forecasting, and showed greater agreement with the business-as-usual scenario than with the sustainable-development one. This study shows how satellite-derived EFAs can be used as meaningful essential biodiversity variables in SDM5 to provide early-warnings of range shifts and predictions of short-term fluctuations in suitable conditions for multiple species.

Nationwide assessment of forest burnt area in India using Resourcesat-2 AWiFS data	CURRENT SCIENCE												This study provides application of Resourcesat-2 AWiFS satellite imagery for forest burnt area assessment in India. AWiFS datasets covering peak forest fire months of 2014 have been analysed. The total burnt area under vegetation cover (forest, scrub and grasslands) of India was estimated as 57,127.75 sq. km. In 2014, 7% of forest cover of India was affected by fires. Of the major forest types, dry deciduous forests are affected by the highest burnt area, followed by moist deciduous forests. Among the biogeographic zones, the highest forest burnt area was recorded in Deccan followed by North East and Western Ghats. The highest burnt area was recorded in Odisha followed by Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Jharkhand, Manipur and Karnataka. Spatial analysis shows that 232 grid cells in India have a burnt area greater than 20 sq. km. The database generated would be useful in ecological damage assessment, fire risk modelling, carbon emissions accounting and biodiversity conservation.

Landsats 4TM, 5TM and 7ETM+ data-sets were accessed and analysed using the Maximum Likelihood Classification algorithm to discriminate and geovisualize the spatiotemporal variations in the general vegetation and other land cover types, from 1984 to 2014. This was supported with detailed field surveys in dry and rainy seasons of 2011 and 2014 to ascertain the status of wide-ranging vegetation cover stands. A 44% vegetation decline was recorded given the reduction in dense vegetation spatial extent from 330.63 km(2) in 1984 to 170.87 km(2) in 2014. Sparse vegetation equally increased in spatial extent by 25% given the variations registered from 6.86 km(2) in 1984 to 97.16 km(2) in 2014. The reduction in vegetation cover was found to have been replaced by increase in other land cover types-residential (18.97 km(2)) and industrial areas (39.87 km(2)). Suggesting that, heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of land resources, in addition to weak concerns towards preserving the accruing benefits of vegetation resources attracted anthropogenic phenomenon (e.g. urbanization) to vegetated areas. As such, strengthening institutional monitoring and urban planning frameworks would help to improve sustainable governance of the tropical rainforests.																	2331-2041					APR 4	2017	3								UNSP 1307566	10.1080/23312041.2017.1307566								WOS:000400054200001

IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL RAINWATER-HARVESTING SITES FOR THE SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF A SEMI-ARID WATERSHED	IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE												In the present study, the potential locations for constructing different water-harvesting structures in a semi-arid watershed located at Goparajpalli, in southern India, were derived using GIS in three stages. The locations were first identified based on land use land cover, land slope, rainfall characteristics, soil texture and soil depth. Then a number of structures and suitable semi-arid rainfed regions have limitations in their runoff potential availability; these locations were further optimized based on the runoff available after in situ water conservation and storage in existing water-harvesting structures. The surplus runoff volume available in a normal year after storage was estimated to be 870 000 m(3). Suitable locations for 25 rock fill dams (RFD), 74 farm ponds and 5 check dams were identified. These derived sites were validated by exporting to Google Earth and investigated for their suitability with ground truth information. At present, the number of structures existing is more than the optimum number of structures derived, but they have less storage capacity. Hence those structures such as farm ponds located at potential sites are recommended for desiltation and renovation by increasing their size along with lining so that they can be utilized for rainwater harvesting and supplementary irrigation. This methodology for identification of potential locations for water-harvesting structures is less time-consuming, more precise and can be utilized for the planning of large catchments to improve the water availability and productivity.

This should be understood in relationship with the persistence in time and the current and future conception of the human-made environment. This study deals with the spatial characterization over time of the urban sprawl close to and around two important archaeological areas: Kom el Shoqafa, Egypt and Shush, Iran. For both of the investigated sites, change detection analyses have been conducted using satellite declassified Corona and multidate Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery available for free from the USGS Earth Explorer. The study involves the collection of Corona 1964, Landsat TM 1984, Landsat ETM+ 1998 and L8 2016. The past and current urban and agricultural areas have been extracted by using consolidated classification techniques. Analyses and quantification of the spatial dimension of the urban expansion showed that, for both the study sites, urban areas have expanded to a significant percentage. In particular, the analysis of Corona and Landsat TM, ETM+, L8 imagery in Kom el Shoqafa revealed that, for the urban area, the evaluation of the change detection presented generally increasing chronology in both of the study areas, but for the agriculture lands, we can see that the changes sometimes decreased and sometimes increased. As a whole, outputs from our investigations clearly highlight that the current availability free of charge of long term satellite time series provides an excellent low cost tool for several applications including environmental monitoring and change detection to observe and quantify urban and land use changes from a global down to a local scale. We examine the capabilities of integrating remote sensing and GIS and suggest some innovative solutions to preserve the archaeological sites.

Under the National Biological Corridor Program, the long-running Payment for Environmental Services Program was newly prioritized into biological corridors throughout the country. The National Biological Corridor Program caused a nationwide spatial shift in placement of payments for environmental services throughout Costa Rica. We classified ASTER 15-m resolution imagery in a central Costa Rica corridor connecting the eastern and western protected areas networks to analyze the change in forests during the National Biological Corridor Program with its targeted payments for environmental services effort. We used object-based classification methods, and compared land cover changes over an initial four-year period of corridor policy enactment. We calculated the changes within PES properties and outside of PES regions, and we also calculated forest patch metrics during the same time period. Results indicate a decline in forest cover over the study period, along with an increase in urban and pasture land. covers, with higher change and loss of forest centered inside of the biological corridor, near the construction area for the new San Carlos highway, and within eastern pasture areas. We also saw a higher percentage of forest loss inside of the biological corridor area as compared to areas outside of the biological corridor. Forest loss was drastically less within current and historic PES properties, as compared to the overall study region. Across the entire study region, patch metrics show a decrease in the number of patches and a slight decrease in average patch size. These results suggest that current and past designation of PES prevents forest loss within PES properties while the current designation of priority conservation status via the National Biological Corridor Program is not increasing connectivity and forest conservation. This is shown by increased land use change and a decrease in forest associated with biological corridor designation. These results are antithetical to the goals of the National Biological Corridor Program. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Remote sensing studies have shown that AGB has recovered in the grasslands of northern China, but the recovery of soil organic carbon (SOC) or SOM is still unclear. Here, based on the published data between the 1980s and 2014, we used the variation in carbon (C) density observed in the vegetation and soils of four regions across northern China as integrative indicator to explore grassland restoration. Overall, northern Chinese grasslands were a weak carbon source (-14 Tg C), although C density in AGB and below-ground biomass increased on average by 0.019 and 0.224 kg C/m(2), respectively, during the period considered in the present study. Unexpectedly, SOC density in the 0-20 cm soil layer decreased by 0.193 kg C/m(2) on average, and all regions registered a decrease in SOC, although values differed among them. Our findings were consistent with previous evaluations using remote sensing and with the idea that vegetation in northern China has been restored. However, SOC has not been restored, and given its importance for sustaining nutrient supply and water conservation, as well as the high difficulty of SOC restoration, grassland restoration in northern China is still far from being achieved.				于, 贵瑞/C-1768-2014													2150-8925					APR	2017	8	4							e01750	10.1002/ecs2.1750								WOS:000400985300012

Unravelling the response of diurnal raptors to land use change in a highly dynamic landscape in northwestern Spain: an approach based on satellite earth observation data	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH												Land use and land cover change (LULCC) is one of the main components of current anthropogenic global change. Unravelling the ecological response of biodiversity to the combined effect of land use change and other stressors is essential for effective conservation. For this purpose, we used co-inertia analysis to combine LULCC analysis of earth observation satellite data-derived maps and raptor data obtained from road censuses conducted in 2001 and 2014 at sampling unit level (10 km(2) spatial resolution), in northwestern Spain (province of Ourense, c. 7281 km(2)). In addition, habitat suitability models were also computed using ten widely used single-modelling techniques providing an ensemble of predictions at landscape level (four spatial resolutions: 500-m, 1-km, 2-km and 5-km radius around each sighting) for each year and raptor species to analyse the habitat suitability changes in the whole study area through three niche overlap indices. The models revealed an increase in occurrence and habitat suitability of forest raptor species coupled with a strong decrease in species associated with open habitats, mainly heaths and shrub formations. Open-habitat specialist species were negatively affected by the concomitant effects of intensive forest management and a long-lasting trend of rural abandonment coupled with an unusually high frequency of wildfires. Sustainable forest management and agricultural practices should be encouraged by both public and private sectors, through, e.g. policies related to European funds for rural and regional development (FEDER and FEADER programs) to effectively protect threatened habitats and species, and to comply with current environmental legislation. The combined use of satellite imagery and ground-level biodiversity data proved to be a cost-effective and systematic method for monitoring priority habitats and their species in highly dynamic landscapes.

Our knowledge on the spatial patterns of deforestation and its proximate drivers remains partial though. We used the full Landsat image archive to reconstruct deforestation and post-deforestation dynamics between 1987 and 2012 for the entire Paraguayan Chaco, where deforestation has been rampant recently. Our classification resulted in reliable land-use change maps (86.16%), highlighting drastic forest losses of almost 44,000 km(2) between 1987 and 2012, equaling a deforestation rate of 27% and about 1% yearly, predominantly for grasslands. These likely represented new pastures, making pasture expansion the dominant proximate cause of deforestation. Cropland expansion, in contrast, only played a minor role as a proximate deforestation cause in the Paraguayan Chaco. Deforestation more than doubled between 2001 and 2012 (similar to 29,000 km(2)) compared to 1987-2000 (similar to 14,000 km(2)), due to leakage effects from the deforestation ban in the Paraguayan Atlantic Forests in 2004. Interestingly, while grasslands expanded in the Paraguayan Chaco between 1987 and 2000, cattle numbers decreased during the same time period, though strongly increased since. This apparent decoupling of area change and land-use intensity may indicate that the Paraguayan Chaco experienced an amplification period during the 1990s followed by an intensification period since 2001. Thus, our results highlight the need for both, a more detailed monitoring of post-deforestation dynamics and a land systems perspective in order to understand deforestation frontiers and thus ultimately to identify strategies to better balance production and conservation goals.

Such study can have many implications on people-forest interactions in the sanctuary and promote symbiotic approach in dealing with biodiversity conservation in protected area. Marat Longri WLS is indispensable to forest dwellers for subsistence and livelihoods. The result of pair-wise ranking revealed jhum (3160) is the major threat to forest cover followed by illegal felling (2850), agricultural expansion (2346), encroachment (2211) and collection pressure (2080). To reduce dependence on Marat Longri WLS, domestication of wild plants and other agroforestry systems can augment food production and realize other needs of forest dwellers.																	2348-5191	2348-8980				APR	2017	4	1								10.21276/ambi.2017.04.1.ra03								WOS:000399200300002

Mapping boreal peatland ecosystem types from multitemporal radar and optical satellite imagery	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												The ability to distinguish peatland types at the landscape scale has implications for inventory, conservation, estimation of carbon storage, fuel loading, and postfire carbon emissions, among others. This paper presents a multisensor, multiseason remote sensing approach to delineate boreal peatland types (wooded bog, open fen, shrubby fen, treed fen) using a combination of multiple dates of L-band (24 cm) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) from ALOS PALSAR, C-band (similar to 5.6 cm) from ERS-1 or ERS-2, and Landsat 5 TM optical remote sensing data. Imagery was first evaluated over a small test area of boreal Alberta, Canada, to determine the feasibility of using multisensor SAR and optical data to discriminate peatland types. Then object-based and (or) machine-learning classification algorithms were applied to 3.4 million ha of peatland-rich subregions of Alberta, Canada, and the 4.24 million ha region of Michigan's Upper Peninsula where peatlands are less dominant. Accuracy assessments based on field-sampled sites show high overall map accuracies (93%-94% for Alberta and Michigan), which exceed those of previous mapping efforts.																	0045-5067	1208-6037				APR	2017	47	4					545	559		10.1139/cjfr-2016-0192								WOS:000398915400014

Assessing post-industrial land cover change at the Pine Point Mine, NWT, Canada using multi-temporal Landsat analysis and landscape metrics	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												This study investigates land cover change near the abandoned Pine Point Mine in Canada's Northwest Territories. Industrial mineral development transforms local environments, and the effects of such disturbances are often long-lasting, particularly in subarctic, boreal environments where vegetation conversion can take decades. Located in the Boreal Plains Ecozone, the Pine Point Mine was an extensive open pit operation that underwent little reclamation when it shut down in 1988. We apply remote sensing and landscape ecology methods to quantify land cover change in the 20 years following the mine's closure. Using a time series of near-anniversary Landsat images, we performed a supervised classification to differentiate seven land cover classes. We used raster algebra and landscape metrics to track changes in land cover composition and configuration in the 20 years since the mine shut down. We compared our results with a site in Wood Buffalo National Park that was never subjected to extensive anthropogenic disturbance. This space-for-time substitution provided an analog for how the ecosystem in the Pine Point region might have developed in the absence of industrial mineral development. We found that the dense conifer class was dominant in the park and exhibited larger and more contiguous patches than at the mine site. Bare land at the mine site showed little conversion through time. While the combination of raster algebra and landscape metrics allowed us to track broad changes in land cover composition and configuration, improved access to affordable, high-resolution imagery is necessary to effectively monitor land cover dynamics at abandoned mines.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				APR	2017	189	4							185	10.1007/s10661-017-5893-7								WOS:000398714200051	28349312

In aid of (re)discovered species: maximizing conservation insights from minimal data	ANIMAL CONSERVATION												New species discoveries or the rediscovery of species once considered extinct or extirpated is good news, and yet prospects for long-term survival may be bleak if remnant populations are small and isolated. Because (re)discovered species are commonly rare or cryptic, data to inform appropriate conservation actions are usually sparse. We demonstrate how to make the most of available data, using the recent rediscovery in Ghana of sitatunga Tragelaphus spekei as an illustrative case study. Sitatunga were thought extinct in Ghana for over 50years, but were rediscovered' by science in Avu Lagoon in 1998. Little is known about this species, especially West African populations, given its cryptic nature and inaccessible wetland habitat. Our approach to maximizing insights given limited data first paired observations of occurrence with landscape characteristics derived from open-access remote sensing data, creating the first ever habitat suitability model for sitatunga. This model then served to: (1) elucidate habitat preferences; (2) assess possible existence and connectivity of remnant populations elsewhere in Ghana; and (3) estimate maximum total and effective population size. Moreover, the timing of occurrence sightings provided insights into behavior. Sitatunga sightings were rare, heavily male-biased and mostly occurred between 6pm and 6am. Suitable habitat was limited, suggesting that habitat in and near Avu Lagoon is insufficient to ensure long-term population viability, and the existence of other, connected populations in Ghana is improbable. Without continued protection, and possibly additional interventions to augment population numbers or gene flow, the sitatunga in Avu Lagoon will likely go extinct. Our case study demonstrates the conservation challenges associated with the rediscovery of relict populations, and the utility of applying tools such as habitat suitability models to sparse data. Moreover, our research stresses the need to implement immediate conservation action upon species (re)discoveries to prevent (regional) extinction.

Deforestation risk due to commodity crop expansion in sub-Saharan Africa	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Rapid integration of global agricultural markets and subsequent cropland displacement in recent decades increased large-scale tropical deforestation in South America and Southeast Asia. Growing land scarcity and more stringent land use regulations in these regions could incentivize the offshoring of export-oriented commodity crops to sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We assess the effects of domestic-and export-oriented agricultural expansion on deforestation in SSA in recent decades. Analyses were conducted at the global, regional and local scales. We found that commodity crops are expanding in SSA, increasing pressure on tropical forests. Four Congo Basin countries, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Cte d ' Ivoire were most at risk in terms of exposure, vulnerability and pressures from agricultural expansion. These countries averaged the highest percent forest cover (58% +/- 17.93) and lowest proportions of potentially available cropland outside forest areas (1% +/- 0.89). Foreign investment in these countries was concentrated in oil palm production (81%), with a median investment area of 41 582 thousand ha. Cocoa, the fastest expanding export-oriented crop across SSA, accounted for 57% of global expansion in 2000-2013 at a rate of 132 thousand ha yr(-1). However, cocoa only amounted to 0.89% of foreign land investment. Commodity crop expansion in SSA appears largely driven by small-and mediumscale farmers rather than industrial plantations. Land-use changes associated with large-scale investments remain to be observed in many countries. Although domestic demand for commodity crops was associated with most agricultural expansion, we provide evidence of a growing influence of distant markets on land-use change in SSA.																	1748-9326					APR	2017	12	4							044015	10.1088/1748-9326/aa6509								WOS:000398370600004

Spatial Ecology and Habitat Selection of Eastern Hognose Snakes	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The eastern hognose snake (Heterodon platirhinos) is a species of conservation concern, especially in the northeastern portion of its range. They remain relatively common at Cape Cod National Seashore, Barnstable County, Massachusetts, USA, where we studied their spatial ecology and habitat selection. We radio-tracked 17 adult snakes (10 F, 7 M) from May 2009 to November 2011, yielding 765 relocations. We conducted a use-availability analysis to investigate patterns of microhabitat selection using a subset of snake locations. We conducted a compositional analysis of habitat selection at multiple spatial scales within home ranges using a high-resolution (1-m pixel size) vegetation cover map of the study area. Snakes moved frequently and had large home ranges (x = 35.4 ha) relative to other snake species of similar body size but exhibited variation in home range size among individuals (1- 209 ha). Movements peaked at different times of year for each sex, and were most different between sexes in fall. In gravid females, movement was significantly greater in the 2-week post-oviposition period versus the 2-week pre-oviposition period. Estimates of home range and average daily movements (x = 30.1 m/day) were lower than estimates from other studies of eastern hognose snakes, possibly because of a greater density of resources at our study area. Probability of snake habitat use increased with grass and leaf litter and decreased with open soil. Compositional analysis revealed a strong avoidance of open dune areas. A comparison of edge density between use and random locations within home ranges revealed an apparent preference for edge habitat. We recommend that resource managers should limit recreational disturbance to and maintain the patchy mosaic of early successional vegetation with abundant edge to ensure the persistence of appropriate habitat for the species. We identified the timing of peak seasonal movements and recommend that this information be used to help prevent road mortality for this important population.

In this study, unsupervised classification of mangrove density is performed on Landsat images of folk time periods over 35 years (1975-77, 1989, 2000 and 2010) to identify the spatiotemporal evolution of the Sundarban mangrove, and infer the causes of observed changes. Specifically the influences of environmental and anthropogenic drivers on these changes are discriminated by correlating the observed change patterns with cyclones' tracks, erosion processes and areas of expected human influences as assessed by local stakeholders. Results highlight a very dynamic systerh, with rapid changes characterized by decreasing mangrove density, mainly in India, erosion and accretion. There is similar to 1.2% (or 11,500 ha) net erosion in 35 years in Sundarban, which remains limited relative to the documented high rate of sea level rise of 6 mm/yr. Mangrove density changes are attributed to cyclones, increased salinity and anthropogenic influences. Based on interpretation of the spatial pattern of density changes by local stakeholders, we conclude that the zones accessible to human activities are significantly more affected by land cover changes. Management policies of Sundarban by Bangladeshi and Indian authorities should acknowledge the important role played by natural or global drivers like sea level change, cyclones in affecting the mangrove as well as manage the localized anthropogenic pressures.

J	Takahashi, R; Todo, Y				Takahashi, Ryo; Todo, Yasuyuki			Coffee Certification and Forest Quality: Evidence from a Wild Coffee Forest in Ethiopia	WORLD DEVELOPMENT												Shade coffee certification programs that aim to conserve the forest and to prevent forest degradation have attracted an increasing amount of attention. However, such programs' impact on forest degradation remains unclear because of the absence of empirical evidence. In addition, there is heated debate about whether certification programs create an incentive for producers to expand their coffee-growing areas, which may accelerate forest degradation in the surrounding natural forest. This study, which was conducted in Ethiopia, aimed to evaluate the impact of a shade coffee certification program on forest degradation. Additionally, to provide empirical evidence for the debate, we examined the spillover effects of certification to surrounding forest areas and used remote sensing data of 2005 and 2010 to classify forest areas based on their density. We applied matching methods, such as the propensity score matching with different algorithms, to compare forest coffee areas with and without the certification. We found that the certified forest coffee areas slightly increased in forest density. By contrast, we observed drastic forest degradation in the forest coffee areas without certification. We checked the sensitivity of our results and found that our results are robust to potential hidden bias. Furthermore, our empirical results revealed that the natural forest areas within a 100-m radius from the forest coffee boundary area exhibited significantly reduced forest degradation compared with forest areas under similar environmental conditions but that such positive and significant impact diminished after 100-m distance. These results indicate that the certification program is effective in alleviating forest degradation in the certified area and in the surrounding natural forest. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

A multidisciplinary approach to digital mapping of dinosaurian tracksites in the Lower Cretaceous (Valanginian-Barremian) Broome Sandstone of the Dampier Peninsula, Western Australia	PEERJ												The abundant dinosaurian tracksites of the Lower Cretaceous (Valanginian - Barremian) Broome Sandstone of the Dampier Peninsula, Western Australia, form an important part of the West Kimberley National Heritage Place. Previous attempts to document these tracksites using traditional mapping techniques (e. g., surface overlays, transects and gridlines combined with conventional photography) have been hindered by the non-trivial challenges associated with working in this area, including, but not limited to: (1) the remoteness of many of the tracksites; (2) the occurrence of the majority of the tracksites in the intertidal zone; (3) the size and complexity of many of the tracksites, with some extending over several square kilometres. Using the historically significant and well-known dinosaurian tracksites at Minyirr (Gantheaume Point), we show how these issues can be overcome through the use of an integrated array of remote sensing tools. A combination of high-resolution aerial photography with both manned and unmanned aircraft, airborne and handheld high-resolution lidar imaging and handheld photography enabled the collection of large amounts of digital data from which 3D models of the tracksites at varying resolutions were constructed. The acquired data encompasses a very broad scale, from the sub-millimetre level that details individual tracks, to the multiple-kilometre level, which encompasses discontinuous tracksite exposures and large swathes of coastline. The former are useful for detailed ichnological work, while the latter are being employed to better understand the stratigraphic and temporal relationship between tracksites in a broader geological and palaeoecological context. These approaches and the data they can generate now provide a means through which digital conservation and temporal monitoring of the Dampier Peninsula's dinosaurian tracksites can occur. As plans for the on-going management of the tracks in this area progress, analysis of the 3D data and 3D visualization will also likely provide an important means through which the broader public can experience these spectacular National Heritage listed landscapes.

In addressing this challenge, we propose a remote sensing-based approach to forecast the future habitat quality for European badger, a species not abundant and at risk of local extinction in the arid environments of southeastern Spain, by incorporating environmental variables related with the ecosystem functioning and correlated with climate and land use. Using ensemble prediction methods, we designed global spatial distribution models for the distribution range of badger using presence-only data and climate variables. Then, we constructed regional models for an arid region in the southeast Spain using EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) derived variables and weighting the pseudo-absences with the global model projections applied to this region. Finally, we forecast the badger potential spatial distribution in the time period 2071-2099 based on IPCC scenarios incorporating the uncertainty derived from the predicted values of EVI-derived variables. By including remotely sensed descriptors of the temporal dynamics and spatial patterns of ecosystem functioning into spatial distribution models, results suggest that future forecast is less favorable for European badgers than not including them. In addition, change in spatial pattern of habitat suitability may become higher than when forecasts are based just on climate variables. Since the validity of future forecast only based on climate variables is currently questioned, conservation policies supported by such information could have a biased vision and overestimate or underestimate the potential changes in species distribution derived from climate change. The incorporation of ecosystem functional attributes derived from remote sensing in the modeling of future forecast may contribute to the improvement of the detection of ecological responses under climate change scenarios.

An approach for the combination of advanced polarimetric decompositions and textures of Advanced Land Observing Satellite Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar full polarimetric data for the purpose of forest type classification is proposed. Using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, we classified forest types over a selected Indian region. Further, we tested the classification performance of the Wishart method for the same forest types. The classified results were assessed with confusion matrix-based statistics. The results suggest that incorporation of various polarimetric decompositions features into gray-level co-occurrence matrix textures refines the SVM classification overall accuracy (OA) from 73.82% (k = 0.69) to 76.34% (k = 0.72). The Wishart supervised classification algorithm has the OA of 73.38% (kappa = 0.68). We observed that integration of polarimetric information with textures can give complimentary information in forest type discrimination and produce high accuracy maps. Further, this approach overcomes the limitations of optical remote sensing data in continuous cloud coverage areas. (C) 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

With the launch of comprehensive management engineering of transforming slopes into terraces in China, the area of terraces is continuously expanding. To plan for soil and water conservation in a scientific way and ensure rational soil and water conservation measures, it is important to determine a timely and accurate inventory of the spatial distribution of the existing terraces. High-resolution satellite data (China GF-1) was used in this study to automatically identify and extract terraces. The edge characteristics statistics algorithm, template-matching algorithm and the Fourier transformation algorithm were used. The results suggest that the template-matching algorithm, based on high gray features of terraces, has higher identification accuracy and lower extraction miss rate, and is able to determines the complete map spots, which works well for identification and extraction of typical terraces. The Fourier transformation algorithm, based on the texture of the terraces, is easily affected by gray changes on the terrace field surfaces and field ridges and is hardly reliable as a stand-alone technique for terrace identification. In this study, we focused on an area near Hengshan County, Yulin of Shanxi Province, and performed field validation of the terrace automatic identification and extraction algorithms. The results suggest that the accuracy of automatic identification and extraction of the terraces is greater than 80%. The method proposed is helpful to meet the requirements for planning and monitoring soil and water conservation projects.																	2095-6339					MAR	2017	5	1					17	25		10.1016/j.iswcr.2017.02.002								WOS:000413330100002

The climatic variables considered were precipitation, Land Surface Temperature (LST), and evapotranspiration (ET), whereas the topographic factors considered were elevation and aspect. The dataset consisted of MODIS NDVI data, satellite-delivered precipitation, ET, and the LST. A 2014 Landsat 8 OLI image was used to produce a vegetation map of the study area, while DEM was used to derive the elevation attributes and to calculate the aspect angles. Moran's I and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) Model was used to analyze the relationships between the climatic factors and NDVI changes over elevation and aspect. The results indicated that among the nine vegetation types inventoried in the area, the Mean NDVI varied from 0.33 to 0.59 and the optimal vegetation growth was found at an elevation between 2000 and 3900 m, with mean NDVI values larger than 0.50. The peak mean NDVI value of 0.59 was found at the elevation from 2100 to 2800 m. Vegetation growth was found to be more sensitive to elevation, as NDVI values were more varied at a lower elevation (<4000 m) than at a higher elevation (>4000 m). Considering the aspect, the greater vegetation growth was found in SE (132 degrees, 148 degrees), SW (182 degrees, 186 degrees), and NW (309.5 degrees -337.5 degrees), with mean NDVI values larger than 0.56. This indicated that vegetation was susceptible to better growth conditions in the lower elevation ranges and in shady areas. The vegetation NDVI in this study area was mostly uncorrelated with precipitation (R-2 = 0.34), but was strongly correlated with LST (R-2 = 0.99) and ET (R-2 = 98). LST (>= 18 degrees C) and ET (1286 mm/year(-1)) were found to provide optimal conditions for vegetation growth in the Virunga Volcanoes Massif. Empirically, the results concluded that elevation, aspect, LST, and ET are the main factors controlling the spatial distribution and vegetation growth in this area. This information is significantly helpful for biodiversity conservation and constitutes a valuable input to environmental and ecological research.																	2076-3263					MAR	2017	7	1							UNSP 17	10.3390/geosciences7010017								WOS:000410163000015

Conditions influencing the adoption of effective anti-deforestation policies in South America's commodity frontiers	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS												Reducing large-scale deforestation in commodity frontiers remains a key challenge for climate change mitigation and the conservation of biodiversity. Public and private anti-deforestation policies have been shown to effectively reduce forest loss, but the conditions under which such policies get adopted are rarely examined. Here we propose a set of conditions that we expect to be associated with the adoption of effective anti-deforestation policies in commodity frontiers. We then examine whether these conditions have influenced policy adoption in South America's major soy-and-cattle frontiers: the Brazilian Amazon, the Cerrado, the Chaco, the Chiquitano, and Paraguay's Atlantic Forest. By collating empirical data from diverse sources, including literature review, extensive expert interviews, and analysis of primary and secondary data, we show that the Cerrado, the Chaco, and the Chiquitano differ from the Brazilian Amazon in multiple ways that might have inhibited adoptions of effective anti-deforestation instruments. These conditions include: a higher importance of the agricultural sector within the respective countries, lower carbon stocks and species richness, higher prevalence of private land tenure, and higher baseline compliance with forest reserve regulations on private lands. We also observe that the adoption of the most effective private anti-deforestation instrument, commodity moratoria, may respond to similar conditions as those influencing the adoption of public instruments. Incentivizing public and private actors to adopt effective anti-deforestation policies in the Cerrado, Chaco, and the Chiquitano will likely be more challenging than it has been in the Brazilian Amazon.

Remote sensing can provide a systematic, synoptic view at regular time intervals, and is therefore often suggested as a powerful tool to assist with the mapping and monitoring of protected habitats and vegetation. In this study, we present a multi-step mapping framework that enables detailed NATURA 2000 (N2000) heathland habitat patch mapping and the assessment of their conservation status at patch level. The method comprises three consecutive steps: (1) a hierarchical land/vegetation type (LVT) classification using airborne AHS imaging spectroscopy and field reference data; (2) a spatial re-classification to convert the LVT map to a patch map based on life forms; and (3) identification of the N2000 habitat type and conservation status parameters for each of the patches. Based on a multivariate analysis of 1325 vegetation reference plots acquired in 2006-2007, 24 LVT classes were identified that were considered relevant for the assessment of heathland conservation status. These labelled data were then used as ground reference for the supervised classification of the AHS image data to an LVT classification map, using Linear Discriminant Analysis in combination with Sequential-Floating-Forward-Search feature selection. Overall classification accuracies for the LVT mapping varied from 83% to 92% (Kappa approximate to 0.82-0.91), depending on the level of detail in the hierarchical classification. After converting the LVT map to a N2000 habitat type patch map, an overall accuracy of 89% was obtained. By combining the N2000 habitat type patch map with the LVT map, two important conservation status parameters were directly deduced per patch: tree and shrub cover, and grass cover, showing a strong similarity to an independent dataset with estimates made in the field in 2009. The results of this study indicate the potential of imaging spectroscopy for detailed heathland habitat characterization of N2000 sites in a way that matches the current field-based workflows of the user.

As the city of greatest importance in China, the capital Beijing has experienced eco-environmental changes with unprecedented economic and population growth during the past few decades. To better understand the ecological transition and its correlations in Beijing, Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) images were used to investigate vegetation coverage changes using a dimidiate pixel model. Piecewise linear regression, bivariate-partial correlation analysis, and factor analysis were applied to the probing of the relationship between vegetation coverage changes and climatic/human-induced factors. The results showed that from 2000 to 2005, 2005 to 2010, and 2010 to 2015, Beijing experienced both restoration (6.33%, 10.08%, and 12.81%, respectively) and degradation (13.62%, 9.35%, and 9.49%, respectively). The correlation analysis results between climate and vegetation changes demonstrated that from 2000 to 2015, both the multi-year annual mean temperature (r = -0.819, p < 0.01) and the multi-year annual mean precipitation (r = 0.653, p < 0.05) had a significantly correlated relationship with vegetation change. The Beijing-Tianjin Sandstorm Source Control Project (BTSSCP) has shown beneficial spatial effects on vegetation restoration; the total effectiveness in conservation areas (84.94 in 2000-2010) was much better than non-BTSSCP areas (34.34 in 2000-2010). The most contributory socioeconomic factors were the population (contribution = 54.356%) and gross domestic product (GDP) (contribution = 30.677%). The population showed a significantly negative correlation with the overall vegetation coverage (r = -0.684, p < 0.05). The GDP was significantly negatively correlated with vegetation in Tongzhou, Daxing, Central city, Fangshan, Shunyi, and Changping (r = -0.601, p < 0.01), while positively related in Huairou, Miyun, Pinggu, Mentougou and Yanqing (r = 0.614, p < 0.01). These findings confirm that human activity is a very significant factor in impacting and explaining vegetation changes, and that some socioeconomic influences on vegetation coverage are highly spatially heterogeneous, based on the context of different areas.																	2072-4292					MAR	2017	9	3							271	10.3390/rs9030271								WOS:000398720100085						
J	Stenzel, S; Fassnacht, FE; Mack, B; Schmidtlein, S				Stenzel, Stefanie; Fassnacht, Fabian Ewald; Mack, Benjamin; Schmidtlein, Sebastian			Identification of high nature value grassland with remote sensing and minimal field data	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												In the last 50 years intensification of agricultural land use systems drastically reduced extensively used grassland areas. These areas are of high ecological value due to high species richness and occurring rare species. Therefore, recent European Union (EU) laws stipulate the conservation and monitoring of this farmland, also called "high nature value" (HNV) farmland. As a consequence of these new laws, a so called HNV indicator system was implemented that requires all EU member states to establish a nationwide monitoring system for HNV areas. These monitoring systems are challenged among other by the difficult differentiation between grassland types which today at fine scale is only possible with time and cost intensive field work. Due to this high work-load and financial limitations, nationwide field campaigns have to be sample-based and hence will not deliver a spatially consistent result. In this study, we examine whether low and high nature value grasslands can be differentiated with remotely-sensed reflectance data, which could support existing field survey-based monitoring approaches. We used multi-seasonal, multispectral remote sensing data (RapidEye) in combination with sparse field data (collected in southern Germany) and three one-class classifiers to classify A) HNV grassland against other areas and to differentiate between B) three quality classes of HNV grassland according to the current German HNV monitoring approach. The results for A) indicated high performances of the tested approaches to identify HNV grassland areas. Biased support vector machine delivered best overall results (high detection rate and low false positive rates). However, the results also showed a consistent underestimation of HNV grasslands. Results for B) showed that a separation into several HNV quality classes is not possible with any of the tested approaches. We conclude that with the presented approach HNV grasslands can be identified from the landscape matrix based on its spectral signal. Combining the presented approach with an object oriented classifier or with land registry data could further improve the results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To its deeply esthetic values, the practical values and, respectively, ecosystem services delivered by the urban biodiversity are added (amelioration of the environment and urban microclimate, flood control, diminishing of the environmental pollution, increasing of biodiversity and habitats etc.). Accurate remote sensing techniques have been used widely in locating and mapping urban vegetation (Light Detection And Ranging-LiDAR, satellite images). The purpose of this study is to point out the vegetation status in correlation with the number of the bird species (as indicator of the ecosystem's health), using remote sensing techniques (Landsat satellite images), between 1991-2006 in Bucharest, Romania's capital. Rapid urban evolution of Bucharest led to important changes within the structure of the city, underlined by the increasing of the built area to the detriment of the green one. The intensity of the urbanization rate also led to the decreasing of the number of the bird species. The results obtained through analysis of satellite images indicate the necessity to acquire the up-to-date information related to the vegetation status in order to establish in the future, through urban landscape projects, protection measures for the vegetation cover and for the bird habitats in Bucharest Municipality.																	0354-8724	1820-7138				MAR	2017	21	1					9	25		10.18421/GP21.01-02								WOS:000397713900002						
J	Iqbal, N; Hossain, F; Lee, H; Akhter, G				Iqbal, Naveed; Hossain, Faisal; Lee, Hyongki; Akhter, Gulraiz			Integrated groundwater resource management in Indus Basin using satellite gravimetry and physical modeling tools	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Reliable and frequent information on groundwater behavior and dynamics is very important for effective groundwater resource management at appropriate spatial scales. This information is rarely available in developing countries and thus poses a challenge for groundwater managers. The in situ data and groundwater modeling tools are limited in their ability to cover large domains. Remote sensing technology can now be used to continuously collect information on hydrological cycle in a cost-effective way. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a remote sensing integrated physical modeling approach for groundwater management in Indus Basin. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Satellite (GRACE)-based gravity anomalies from 2003 to 2010 were processed to generate monthly groundwater storage changes using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model. The groundwater storage is the key parameter of interest for groundwater resource management. The spatial and temporal patterns in groundwater storage (GWS) are useful for devising the appropriate groundwater management strategies. GRACE-estimated GWS information with large-scale coverage is valuable for basin-scale monitoring and decision making. This frequently available information is found useful for the identification of groundwater recharge areas, groundwater storage depletion, and pinpointing of the areas where groundwater sustainability is at risk. The GWS anomalies were found to favorably agree with groundwater model simulations from Visual MODFLOW and in situ data. Mostly, a moderate to severe GWS depletion is observed causing a vulnerable situation to the sustainability of this groundwater resource. For the sustainable groundwater management, the region needs to implement groundwater policies and adopt water conservation techniques.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				MAR	2017	189	3							128	10.1007/s10661-017-5846-1								WOS:000395000800035	28243930

A GIS-based soil erosion prediction using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) (Lebna watershed, Cap Bon, Tunisia)	NATURAL HAZARDS												Soil erosion is a natural process causing grave land degradation problems. In Tunisia, soil erosion represents a serious environmental problem. Both man-made and natural phenomenon is reducing acres of agricultural land. The problem of soil erosion by water is very critical in Lebna watershed. In fact, Lebna is a town in the northeast of Tunisia and it seems high time to protect water and ground resources and to prevent the Lebna dam situated in the downstream from silting. In this context, the application of geographic RUSLE model using the techniques of geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing has made it possible to assess the estimation of the soil erosion risk at the targeted watershed. This model is composed of several factors associated with climate, topography, soil and vegetation. The spatial distribution of annual average rate of soil loss resulting of this methodology shows an average of 24 ton/ha/year. Consequently, this method based on a combination of RUSLE as erosion model gave very similar results with bathymetric measures performed by Institute of Research for Development. It was about 29 ton/ha/year. Accordingly, Lebna watershed belongs to a zone of rather a steep erosive potential knowing that the maximum acceptable limit value of the erosive potential estimated is 12 ton/ha/year (Roose in Introduction A la gestion conservatoire de l'eau, de la biomasse et de la fertilit, des sols (GCES). FAORome, 1994). The results have shown that Lebna watershed has a serious risk on soil erosion on sloping land. The highest values are mainly associated with the steep slopes, poor conservation practices, low vegetation cover and high rainfall. The final soil loss map can be thus a base to plan appropriate strategies for decision-makers to avoid soil erosion risks and consequently to lengthen dam life.																	0921-030X	1573-0840				MAR	2017	86	1					219	239		10.1007/s11069-016-2684-3								WOS:000394327500011

Trade-offs between data resolution, accuracy, and cost when choosing information to plan reserves for coral reef ecosystems	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Conservation planners must reconcile trade-offs associated with using biodiversity data of differing qualities to make decisions. Coarse habitat classifications are commonly used as surrogates to design marine reserve networks when fine-scale biodiversity data are incomplete or unavailable. Although finely-classified habitat maps provide more detail, they may have more misclassification errors, a common problem when remotely-sensed imagery is used. Despite these issues, planners rarely consider the effects of errors when choosing data for spatially explicit conservation prioritizations. Here we evaluate trade-offs between accuracy and resolution of hierarchical coral reef habitat data (geomorphology and benthic substrate) derived from remote sensing, in spatial planning for Kubulau District, Fiji. For both, we use accuracy information describing the probability that a mapped habitat classification is correct to design marine reserve networks that achieve habitat conservation targets, and demonstrate inadequacies of using habitat maps without accuracy data. We show that using more detailed habitat information ensures better representation of biogenic habitats (i.e. coral and seagrass), but leads to larger and more costly reserves, because these data have more misclassification errors, and are also more expensive to obtain. Reduced impacts on fishers are possible using coarsely-classified data, which are also more cost-effective for planning reserves if we account for data collection costs, but using these data may under-represent reef habitats that are important for fisheries and biodiversity, due to the maps low thematic resolution. Finally, we show that explicitly accounting for accuracy information in decisions maximizes the chance of successful conservation outcomes by reducing the risk of missing conservation representation targets, particularly when using finely classified data.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Spatial resolution of environmental data may influence the results of habitat selection models. As high resolution data are usually expensive, an assessment of their contribution to the reliability of habitat models is of interest for both researchers and managers. We evaluated how vegetation cover datasets of different spatial resolutions influence the inferences and predictive power of multi-scale habitat selection models for the endangered brown bear populations in the Cantabrian Range (NW Spain). We quantified the relative performance of three types of datasets: (i) coarse resolution data from Corine Land Cover (minimum mapping unit of 25 ha), (ii) medium resolution data from the Forest Map of Spain (minimum mapping unit of 2.25 ha and information on forest canopy cover and tree species present in each polygon), and (iii) high-resolution Lidar data (about 0.5 points/m(2)) providing a much finer information on forest canopy cover and height. Despite all the models performed well (AUC > 0.80), the predictive ability of multi-scale models significantly increased with spatial resolution, particularly when other predictors of habitat suitability (e.g. human pressure) were not used to indirectly filter out areas with a more degraded vegetation cover. The addition of fine grain information on forest structure (LiDAR) led to a better understanding of landscape use and a more accurate spatial representation of habitat suitability, even for a species with large spatial requirements as the brown bear, which will result in the development of more effective measures to assist endangered species conservation.

Structural attributes of individual trees for identifying homogeneous patches in a tropical rainforest	International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation												Mapping and monitoring tropical rainforests and quantifying their carbon stocks are important, both for devising strategies for their conservation and mitigating the effects of climate change. Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) has advantages over other remote sensing techniques for describing the three-dimensional structure of forests. This study identifies forest patches using ALS-based structural attributes in a tropical rainforest in Sumatra, Indonesia. A method to group trees with similar attributes into forest patches based on Thiessen polygons and k-medoids clustering is developed, combining the advantages of both raster and individual tree-based methods. The structural composition of the patches could be an indicator of habitat type and quality. The patches could also be a basis for developing allometric models for more accurate estimation of carbon stock than is currently possible with generalised models. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Predictions from machine learning ensembles: marine bird distribution and density on Canada's Pacific coast	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Increasingly disrupted and altered, the world's oceans are subject to immense and intensifying anthropogenic pressures. Of the biota inhabiting these ecosystems, marine birds are among the most threatened. For conservation efforts targeting marine birds to be effective, quantitative information relating to their at-sea density and distribution is typically a crucial knowledge component. In this study, we generated predictive machine learning ensemble models for 13 marine bird species and 7 groups (representing 24 additional species) in Canada's Pacific coast waters, including several species listed under Canada's Species at Risk Act. Predictive models were based on systematic marine bird line transect survey information collected in spring, summer, and fall on Canada's Pacific coast (2005-2008). Multiple Covariate Distance Sampling (MCDS) was used to estimate marine bird density along transect segments. Spatial and temporal environmental predictors, including remote sensing information, were used in model ensembles, which were constructed using 4 machine learning algorithms in Salford Systems Predictive Modeler v7.0 (SPM7): Random Forests, TreeNet, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, and Classification and Regression Trees. Predictive models were subsequently combined to generate seasonal and overall predictions of areas important to marine birds based on normalized marine bird species or group richness and densities. Our results employ open access data sharing and are intended to better inform marine bird conservation efforts and management planning on Canada's Pacific coast and for broader-scale geographic initiatives across North America and elsewhere.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				FEB 27	2017	566						199	216		10.3354/meps12030								WOS:000396051300015

Forest carbon emissions from cropland expansion in the Brazilian Cerrado biome	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Land use, land use change, and forestry accounted for two-thirds of Brazil's greenhouse gas emissions profile in 2005. Amazon deforestation has declined by more than 80% over the past decade, yet Brazil's forests extend beyond the Amazon biome. Rapid expansion of cropland in the neighboring Cerrado biome has the potential to undermine climate mitigation efforts if emissions from dry forest and woodland conversion negate some of the benefits of avoided Amazon deforestation. Here, we used satellite data on cropland expansion, forest cover, and vegetation carbon stocks to estimate annual gross forest carbon emissions from cropland expansion in the Cerrado biome. Nearly half of the Cerrado met Brazil's definition of forest cover in 2000 (>= 0.5 ha with >= 10% canopy cover). In areas of established crop production, conversion of both forest and non-forest Cerrado formations for cropland declined during 2003-2013. However, forest carbon emissions from cropland expansion increased over the past decade in Matopiba, a new frontier of agricultural production that includes portions of Maranhao, Tocantins, Piau, and Bahia states. Gross carbon emissions from cropland expansion in the Cerrado averaged 16.28 Tg C yr(-1) between 2003 and 2013, with forest-to-cropland conversion accounting for 29% of emissions. The fraction of forest carbon emissions from Matopiba was much higher; between 2010-2013, large-scale cropland conversion in Matopiba contributed 45% of total Cerrado forest carbon emissions. Carbon emissions from Cerrado-to-cropland transitions offset 5%-7% of the avoided emissions from reduced Amazon deforestation rates during 2011-2013. Comprehensive national estimates of forest carbon fluxes, including all biomes, are critical to detect cross-biome leakage within countries and achieve climate mitigation targets to reduce emissions from land use, land use change, and forestry.

J	Schmidt, J; Fassnacht, FE; Lausch, A; Schmidtlein, S				Schmidt, Johannes; Fassnacht, Fabian Ewald; Lausch, Angela; Schmidtlein, Sebastian			Assessing the functional signature of heathland landscapes via hyperspectral remote sensing	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Wall-to-wall information about the state and change of vegetation is needed in many ecological applications, such as the monitoring of large conservation areas. In support of this task, remote sensing can provide valuable information that is complementary to the results from field work. Remote sensing is also well suited for change detection, but the question arises how a rate of change can be expressed in a generalized and objective way that allows comparisons between different areas. We think that true comparability can hardly be achieved by using conventional vegetation classification approaches, which are not transferable if they take account of the individuality of areas. To reach such comparability, an approach would be needed that combines generality with flexibility to adapt to local conditions. Therefore, we propose that the local vegetation is broken down into basic strategy types as proposed by Phil Grime in 1974. He observed general rules in the occurrence of three general plant strategies: competitive ability (C), stress tolerance (S), and ruderal strategy (R). Our research question is whether these strategy types can be used to derive functional signatures of landscapes as a basis for comparison between conservation areas. We used the CSR concept to map plant strategies in a heath landscape based on remote sensing data. Average Grime CSR values of vegetation samples were regressed against airborne hyperspectral imagery, resulting in spatial representations of C, S, and R (val. r(2) of 0.55, 0.59, and 0.28, respectively). Based on this continuous information we created functional signatures for two subareas of the study site, the 'CSR-fingerprints'. We found clear differences in the CSR signatures of different parts of the investigated area. We think that similar differences in time can also be assessed using the same approach. This could provide a simple but powerful expression of the state of vegetation that would be comparable across regions and time. We therefore assume that the method is suitable for comparative studies with a focus on vegetation functioning. While it does not explicitly take into account differences in species composition, it can also work as an early warning system with follow-up investigations in areas subjected to change.

Field surveys were used to assess and complement to the results of the remote sensing (RS)-based analysis. The RS-based biodiversity hotspot (BH) identification process was accomplished in three steps. The lands with native vegetation cover, including the national natural reserve lands, were first selected as the baseline BHs (BBHs). Then, after assigning resistance coefficients to each land use, the least accumulative cost (LAC) of the BBHs was calculated by distance analysis, while the normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) from the Landsat Thematic Mapper was reclassified into 20 grades based on the Euclidean distance to the main anthropogenic sources. Finally, the RS-based BH identification was realized through the logistic calculation of LAC less than a series of thresholds and NDVI more than 10. While the field survey-based BH identification was through the logistic calculation between HM potential ecological risks of low to moderate and BHs acquired by NDVI-based integrated assessments. The results proved that RS-based analysis could be an important surrogate for necessary field surveys to manage BHs along coasts.

In this study, a method was proposed to assess the spatiotemporal differences in SSC derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images and numerical simulation for coastal waters, using the Bohai Sea in China as an example. An empirical model for SSC retrieval from remote sensed images was initially established. A comparison of the temporal synchronicity over a single day period was performed between the observed data and the numerically simulated results. The range in the SSC at different observation sites was significantly different. Both the SSC values and their daily variation ranges were larger near the estuary of the Yellow River compared with the open area due to the concurrence of tidal flow and the introduction of fresh river water with high turbidity near the estuary. The areas that exhibited spatial differences were defined according to their differences in remotely sensed and numerically simulated SSC distribution patterns. Finally, the reasons for these spatiotemporal differences were discussed. The results provided understanding into the spatiotemporal differences that were introduced when multi-source data were used, thus improving the accuracy of the results when monitoring coastal environments for the management of coastal conservation.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				FEB	2017	21	1					197	207		10.1007/s11852-016-0491-3								WOS:000399030200018

The mechanism, direction and magnitude of climatic and anthropogenic influences on net primary productivity (NPP) of various alpine pastures remain under debate. Here, we simulated the potential productivity (with only climate variables being considered as drivers; NPPP) and actual productivity (based on remote sensing dataset including both climate and anthropogenic drivers; NPPA) from 1993 to 2011. We denoted the difference between NPPP and NPPA as NPPpc to quantify how much forage can be potentially consumed by livestock. The actually consumed productivity (NPPac) by livestock were estimated based on meat production and daily forage consumption per standardized sheep unit. We hypothesized that the gap between NPPpc and NPPac (NPPgap) indicates the direction of vegetation dynamics, restoration or degradation. Our results show that growing season precipitation rather than temperature significantly relates with NPPgap, although warming was significant for the entire study region while precipitation only significantly increased in the northeastern places. On the Northern Tibetan Plateau, 69.05% of available alpine pastures showed a restoration trend with positive NPPgap, and for 58.74% of alpine pastures, stocking rate is suggested to increase in the future because of the positive mean NPPgap and its increasing trend. This study provides a potential framework for regionally regulating grazing management with aims to restore the degraded pastures and sustainable management of the healthy pastures on the Tibetan Plateau.

Long-term trends of vegetative decline (browning) or improvement (greening) have thus not been evaluated despite their importance for assessing conservation strategy implementation in regions where field-based monitoring by environmental authorities is limited. Using Colombia's Cordillera de los Picachos National Natural Park as a case study, we provide a temporally rigorous assessment of regional vegetation change from 2001-2015 with two remote sensing-based approaches using the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) algorithm. First, we measured long-term vegetation trends using a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) time series, and, second, we mapped short-term disturbances using all available Landsat images. MAIAC-derived trends indicate a net greening in 6% of the park, but in the surrounding 10 km area outside of the park, a net browning trend prevails at 2.5%. We also identified a 12,500 ha area within Picachos (4% of the park's total area) that has shown at least 13 years of consecutive browning, a result that was corroborated with our Landsat-based approach that recorded a 12,642 ha (+/- 1440 ha) area of disturbed forest within the park. Landsat vegetation disturbance results had user's and producer's accuracies of 0.95 +/- 0.02 and 0.83 +/- 0.18, respectively, and 75% of Landsat-detected dates of disturbance events were accurate within +/- 6 months. This study provides new insights into the contribution of short-term disturbance to long-term trends of vegetation change, and offers an unprecedented perspective on the distribution of small-scale disturbances over a 15-year period in one of the most inaccessible national parks in the Andes.																	2072-4292					FEB	2017	9	2							179	10.3390/rs9020179								WOS:000397013700081

The present study focuses specifically on the Paraguayan part of the tri-national Atlantic Forest. Over the last decades, the Paraguayan Atlantic Forest presented one of the highest deforestation rates in the world, and today, only a small share remains. Hence, forest loss in Paraguay's Atlantic Forest was detected and analysed through remote sensing and GIS methodologies based on Landsat images obtained in 2003 and 2013. The objective of this study was to examine the spatial impact of forest loss in Paraguay's Atlantic Forest over the past decade with a special focus on biodiversity conservation. Classifications results obtained overall accuracies above 83% and revealed that over 6000 km(2) of forest was cleared during the study period. The forest landscape and its fragmentation level were characterised through a set of landscape metrics, in particular the proximity analysis which support the identification of forest priority areas for nature conservation and potential biological corridors. In summary, the study revealed that deforestation and fragmentation of the Atlantic Forest area continued, but at a slower pace than that in the previous decade. Protected areas were conserved very effectively; however, forest core areas without any protection status require further attention. Intact forest patches and their connectivity are a crucial prerequisite to biodiversity conservation in a highly fragmented forest area. The combination of different remote sensing and GIS methods provides valuable information for sustainable forest management in the region. 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Tagged turtles were incidentally captured by recreational fishermen and rehabilitated at the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Gulfport, Mississippi. The average size of the core habitat areas (50% KDE (kernel density estimation)) was 1660.2km(2)3438.2 SD. Turtles displayed strong intra- and inter-annual site fidelity to the Mississippi Sound during the spring, summer, and autumn months. During the winter months, most turtles, probably influenced by water temperatures, migrated to nearshore waters of Louisiana on either side of the Mississippi River Delta. However, other migration strategies were also observed. Overall, these data indicate that the Mississippi Sound is an important developmental habitat for this critically endangered species. In addition, their wintering grounds in Louisiana are utilized by adult Kemp's ridleys and other sea turtle species as foraging grounds and migratory corridors. The high use of these areas by sea turtle populations increases the potential for negative impacts from anthropogenic disturbances (e.g. shrimp trawling, oil production, hypoxia) that occur there.

J	LaRue, MA; Stapleton, S; Anderson, M				LaRue, Michelle A.; Stapleton, Seth; Anderson, Morgan			Feasibility of using high-resolution satellite imagery to assess vertebrate wildlife populations	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Although remote sensing has been used for >40 years to learn about Earth, use of very high-resolution satellite imagery (VHR) (<1-m resolution) has become more widespread over the past decade for studying wildlife. As image resolution increases, there is a need to understand the capabilities and limitations of this exciting new path in wildlife research. We reviewed studies that used VHR to examine remote populations of wildlife. We then determined characteristics of the landscape and the life history of species that made the studies amenable to use of satellite imagery and developed a list of criteria necessary for appropriate use of VHR in wildlife research. From 14 representative articles, we determined 3 primary criteria that must be met for a system and species to be appropriately studied with VHR: open landscape, target organism's color contrasts with the landscape, and target organism is of detectable size. Habitat association, temporal exclusivity, coloniality, landscape differentiation, and ground truthing increase the utility of VHR for wildlife research. There is an immediate need for VHR imagery in conservation research, particularly in remote areas of developing countries, where research can be difficult. For wildlife researchers interested in but unfamiliar with remote sensing resources and tools, understanding capabilities and current limitations of VHR imagery is critical to its use as a conservation and wildlife research tool.																	0888-8892	1523-1739				FEB	2017	31	1					213	220		10.1111/cobi.12809								WOS:000394428100022	27564920

In recent decades, however, satellite images reveal patterns of enhanced vegetation termed the "greening of the Sahel." This greening is well-documented but its mechanisms remain poorly understood. The Sahel is also a region emerging from a 30 year period of reduced rainfall in which several severe droughts occurred. As a response to droughts and land degradation, farmers have rehabilitated thousands of hectares of degraded soils by constructing low barriers of rock through widespread soil and water conservation (SWC) development projects. Remote sensing analyses suggest that these extensive soil conservation projects may explain greening in northern Burkina Faso. This study combines ethnographic fieldwork with the analysis of Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) data to test whether SWC investments contribute to greening. Ethnographic data reveal a tension between the perceptions of rural producers who feel that their SWC efforts contribute to greening and those of state officials who contend that SWC has only local impacts and that the regional landscape continues to degrade. Our analysis of GIS and RS data suggest that both perspectives are valid but contingent on the particular spatial and temporal scale used for analysis.																	0300-7839	1572-9915				FEB	2017	45	1					89	101		10.1007/s10745-016-9888-8								WOS:000395079600007

Monitoring of fire incidences in vegetation types and Protected Areas of India: Implications on carbon emissions	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												Carbon emissions released from forest fires have been identified as an environmental issue in the context of global warming. This study provides data on spatial and temporal patterns of fire incidences, burnt area and carbon emissions covering natural vegetation types (forest, scrub and grassland) and Protected Areas of India. The total area affected by fire in the forest, scrub and grasslands have been estimated as 48765.45, 6540.97 and 1821.33 km(2), respectively, in 2014 using Resourcesat-2 AWiFS data. The total CO2 emissions from fires of these vegetation types in India were estimated to be 98.11 Tg during 2014. The highest emissions were caused by dry deciduous forests, followed by moist deciduous forests. The fire season typically occurs in February, March, April and May in different parts of India. Monthly CO2 emissions from fires for different vegetation types have been calculated for February, March, April and May and estimated as 2.26, 33.53, 32.15 and 30.17 Tg, respectively. Protected Areas represent 11.46% of the total natural vegetation cover of India. Analysis of fire occurrences over a 10-year period with two types of sensor data, i.e., AWiFS and MODIS, have found fires in 281 (out of 614) Protected Areas of India. About 16.78 Tg of CO2 emissions were estimated in Protected Areas in 2014. The natural vegetation types of Protected Areas have contributed for burnt area of 17.3% and CO2 emissions of 17.1% as compared to total natural vegetation burnt area and emissions in India in 2014. 9.4% of the total vegetation in the Protected Areas was burnt in 2014. Our results suggest that Protected Areas have to be considered for strict fire management as an effective strategy for mitigating climate change and biodiversity conservation.																	0253-4126	0973-774X				FEB	2017	126	1							UNSP 11	10.1007/s12040-016-0791-x								WOS:000397298500011

Recently, several geographical partitions of the global ocean have been proposed using statistical approaches applied to remote sensing or observations gathered during oceanographic cruises. Such geographical frameworks defined at a macroscale appear hardly applicable to characterise the biogeochemical features of semi-enclosed seas that are driven by smaller-scale chemical and physical processes. Following the Longhurst's biogeochemical partitioning of the pelagic realm, this study investigates the environmental divisions of the Mediterranean Sea using a large set of environmental parameters. These parameters were informed in the horizontal and the vertical dimensions to provide a 3D spatial framework for environmental management (12 regions found for the epipelagic, 12 for the mesopelagic, 13 for the bathypelagic and 26 for the seafloor). We show that: (1) the contribution of the longitudinal environmental gradient to the biogeochemical partitions decreases with depth; (2) the partition of the surface layer cannot be extrapolated to other vertical layers as the partition is driven by a different set of environmental variables.

J	Sunwoo, W; Choi, M				Sunwoo, Wooyeon; Choi, Minha			Robust Initial Wetness Condition Framework of an Event-Based Rainfall-Runoff Model Using Remotely Sensed Soil Moisture	WATER												Runoff prediction in limited-data areas is vital for hydrological applications, such as the design of infrastructure and flood defenses, runoff forecasting, and water management. Rainfall-runoff models may be useful for simulation of runoff generation, particularly event-based models, which offer a practical modeling scheme because of their simplicity. However, there is a need to reduce the uncertainties related to the estimation of the initial wetness condition (IWC) prior to a rainfall event. Soil moisture is one of the most important variables in rainfall-runoff modeling, and remotely sensed soil moisture is recognized as an effective way to improve the accuracy of runoff prediction. In this study, the IWC was evaluated based on remotely sensed soil moisture by using the Soil Conservation Service-Curve Number (SCS-CN) method, which is one of the representative event-based models used for reducing the uncertainty of runoff prediction. Four proxy variables for the IWC were determined from the measurements of total rainfall depth (API(5)), ground-based soil moisture (SSMinsitu), remotely sensed surface soil moisture (SSM), and soil water index (SWI) provided by the advanced scatterometer (ASCAT). To obtain a robust IWC framework, this study consists of two main parts: the validation of remotely sensed soil moisture, and the evaluation of runoff prediction using four proxy variables with a set of rainfall-runoff events in the East Asian monsoon region. The results showed an acceptable agreement between remotely sensed soil moisture (SSM and SWI) and ground based soil moisture data (SSMinsitu). In the proxy variable analysis, the SWI indicated the optimal value among the proposed proxy variables. In the runoff prediction analysis considering various infiltration conditions, the SSM and SWI proxy variables significantly reduced the runoff prediction error as compared with API(5) by 60% and 66%, respectively. Moreover, the proposed IWC framework with remotely sensed soil moisture indicates an improved Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency from 0.48 to 0.74 for the four catchments in the Korean Peninsula. It can be concluded that the SCS-CN method extended with remotely sensed soil moisture for reducing uncertainty in the runoff prediction and the proxy variables obtained from the soil moisture data provided by the ASCAT can be useful in enhancing the accuracy of runoff prediction over a range of spatial scales.																	2073-4441					FEB	2017	9	2							UNSP 77	10.3390/w9020077								WOS:000395435800008

These countries are prone to environmental disturbance due to high population growth and high rainfall intensity. The aim of this study is to assess the state of soil erosion by water in Uganda at national and district levels, for various land cover and land use (LCLU) types, in protected areas as well to predict the impact of support practices on soil loss reduction. Predictions obtained using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model indicated that the mean rate of soil loss risk in Uganda's erosion-prone lands was 3.2 t.ha(-1).y(-1), resulting in a total annual soil loss of about 62 million tons in 2014. About 39% of the country's erosion-prone lands were comprised of unsustainable mean soil loss rates > 1 t.ha(-1).y(-1). Out of 112 districts in Uganda, 66 districts were found to have unsustainable estimated soil loss rates > 1 t.ha(-1).y(-1). Six districts in Uganda were found to have mean annual soil loss rates of > 10 t.ha(-1).y(-1): Bududa (46.3 t.ha(-1).y(-1)), Kasese (37.5 t.ha(-1).y(-1)), Bundibugyo (28.9 t.ha(-1).y(-1)), Bulambuli (20.9 t.ha(-1).y(-1)), Sironko (14.6 t.ha(-1).y(-1)) and Kotido (12.5 t.ha(-1).y(-1)). Among the LCLU types, the highest soil loss rates of 11 t.ha(-1).y(-1) and 10.6 t.ha(-1).y(-1) were found in moderate natural forest and dense natural forest, respectively, mainly due to their locations in highland areas characterized by steep slopes ranging between 16% to 21% and their high rainfall intensity, ranging from 1255 mm.y(-1) to 1292 mm.y(-1). Only five protected areas in Uganda were found to have high mean estimated mean soil loss rates > 10 t.ha(-1).y(-1): Rwenzori Mountains (142.94 t.ha(-1).y(-1)), Mount Elgon (33.81 t.ha(-1).y(-1)), Bokora corridor (12.13 t.ha(-1).y(-1)), Matheniko (10.39 t.ha(-1).y(-1)), and Nangolibwel (10.33 t.ha(-1).y(-1)). To manage soil erosion in Uganda's protected areas, there is an urgent need to control wildfires and human-induced disturbances such as timber harvesting and soil compaction from domestic animals. Our study analysis revealed that well-established terraces and strip-cropping could significantly reduce soil loss rates in Uganda's croplands by 80% (from 1.5 t.ha(-1).y(-1) to 0.3 t.ha(-1).y(-1)) and by 47% (from 1.5 t.ha(-1).y(-1) to 0.8 t.ha(-1).y(-1)), respectively, well below the sustainable soil erosion tolerance rate (1 t.ha(-1).y(-1)) for land and water conservation.																	1999-4907					FEB	2017	8	2							52	10.3390/f8020052								WOS:000395659200022

This paper conducted a systematic assessment of ecological connectivity using remote sensing images of Dongshan Island in 1994, 2003 and 2011. Based on least-cost modelling, the method takes into consideration the type of barrier, the distance impact, and the adjacent land use types to obtain the Barrier Effect Index (BEI) and Ecological Connectivity Index (ECI). The application of this method to Dongshan Island showed the ecological connectivity index (ECI) was low in 1994, improved in 2003, and decreased significantly in 2011. The results of the dynamic analysis of landscape structure showed farmland and roads were the main landscape classes that caused the low observed ECI in 1994 and 2003; these tended to divide the landscape and cause fragmentation. Construction land and roads were the main landscape classes resulting in low ECI in 2011, while forest and grassland had a high ECI. Trajectory analysis showed ECI tended to decrease in the low mountain forest zone of the northwestern and southeastern parts of Dongshan Island as well as in the coastal protection forest area. The areas where ECI became high were located in the northeastern part of Dongshan Island where cities and towns are concentrated with high human populations. Therefore, rapid urbanization has been the most important factor driving changes in landscape structure and patterns during the last 17 years on Dongshan Island. The approach not only assists us in revealing the driving mechanism of landscape dynamics from another aspect, but also can assess the impacts of regional and urban plans on landscape structure and function.

Do livelihood typologies influence local perceptions of forest cover change? Evidence from a tropical forested and non-forested rural landscape in western Uganda	JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES												Validation of scientific findings from satellite remote sensing against local ecological knowledge could make the interpretation of forest cover patterns more robust. In this paper, we examine local perceptions of forest cover change in parishes around Budongo and Bugoma for a 30-year period (1985-2014), compare the results with those obtained from remote sensing (Twongyirwe et al., 2015), and interrogate whether the perceptions could be related to livelihood typologies. First, we characterise household strategies for the entire landscape to place livelihood strategies of communities in deforestated areas in a broader local context. An in-depth questionnaire was administered to 706 households in 13 parishes situated in 4 Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZs). The data included household demographic characteristics, energy use, cropping and livestock husbandry, and seasonal time- and labour-budgets. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analysis (CA) were employed to help identify dominant structures in the data. Secondly, the 375 households in 7 parishes around Budongo and Bugoma forests (part of the 706) responded to additional questions that sought their perceptions on the forest cover trend. The PCA results for the entire landscape show that significant variation amongst households is mainly related to the cultivation time input, on-farm income particularly from cropping activities, livestock husbandry, demographic characteristics, agricultural extension activities, and cultivation labour input. Hierarchical CA shows that households at the landscape level fall into about nine different types, with variation in spatial distribution. The analysis suggests that poor households do live near forested regions, and that the rural poor are more reliant on forest products than pen-urban populations. Regarding perceptions of forest cover change, the majority (70.1%: n = 375) of the respondents in the parishes think that there has been a decline in forest cover, and this percentage is larger than the percentage of non-respondents (18.9%), those that thought it had increased (5.6%), not changed (3.7%), and those that did not know (1.6%). In addition, perceptions on forest change were significantly related to the household livelihood typologies (X-2 = 623.4, df = 4, p = 0.000): respondents who perceived forest cover as having declined and those that provided no response belonged to cluster 2 ("low income mixed farming households"), which is also the dominant livelihood typology around these forests. While the data largely suggest that there is a remarkable agreement between remote sensing results and local knowledge on forest change, and that local people may play a big role in filling data gaps where a dearth of information is prevalent (or where remote sensing 'evidence is fuzzy), there is a clear signal that people in different social classes and age groups can have very different views on what the change in forest cover might be despite what the remote sensing data show. This might have policy implications if decision makers tend to come from the groups that are not likely to have perceived forest cover change, or base their judgement on views from certain social classes. This implies that it is important to have the remote sensing data available as a counter balance to local perception (and vice versa) and therefore these data should be considered concurrently.

Idukki is the largest district in the state of Kerala having a total geographical area of 5019 km(2). The objectives of the present study are to map forest cover in Idukki district using multi-temporal remote sensing data (1975, 1990, 2001 and 2012) and topographical maps (1925), to analyze the trends in deforestation and land use changes. Overall statistics for the period of 1925 indicate that about 4675.7 km(2) (93.2 %) of the landscape was under forest. The forest cover in 2012 was estimated as 2613.4 km(2) (52.1 %). Recently, due to the implementation of policies and protection efforts, the rate of deforestation was greatly reduced. The commencement of hydroelectric projects during 1925-1990 responsible for an increase of area under water bodies by inundating other land uses. The long term analysis shows agricultural area been decreasing and commercial plantations been increasing in the district. There has been a significant increase in the area of plantations from 1236.2 km(2) (1975) to 1317.3 km(2) (2012).																	0255-660X	0974-3006				FEB	2017	45	1					163	170		10.1007/s12524-015-0521-x								WOS:000394243200017						
J	Camilleri, S; De Giglio, M; Stecchi, F; Perez-Hurtado, A				Camilleri, Sarah; De Giglio, Michaela; Stecchi, Francesco; Perez-Hurtado, Alejandro			Land use and land cover change analysis in predominantly man-made coastal wetlands: towards a methodological framework	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												In areas with a long history of human occupation, coastal wetlands have undergone extensive modification to accommodate extractive activities as salt-extraction and aquaculture. These man-made wetlands maintain some of the ecological functions of natural wetlands in spite of their artificial character: their suitability as complimentary waterbird habitat is well documented. In cases of wetlands composed of mixed natural and man-made areas, similarities in substrate-vegetation-water compositions may pose challenges in the applicability of remote sensing and GIS techniques for the study of landscape changes, requiring tailor-made, case-specific methods. We explored this supposition by testing these techniques for the study of the Bahia de Cadiz Nature Park (Spain). Using Landsat imagery spanning the 1985-2011 period, natural and man-made marsh areas were classified separately and results merged to produce land cover classification maps. Different change dynamics were observed for the natural and man-made areas, the latter exhibiting prominent changes, including widespread vegetative succession. Further, through the overlay of ancillary land use data for 2011, an integrated land use and cover map was produced for this year. Different scenarios arising from the abandonment of extractive activity and structural negligence were highlighted. Furthermore, a methodological framework for the classification of predominantly man-made wetlands was designed. The method is cost-effective and open for integration of additional datasets, and is considered a beneficial input to conservation and land use management. Its applicability for monitoring of landscape change not only pertains to the study area, but also extends to other coastal wetland areas of a similar nature.					perez-hurtado, alejandro/0000-0002-3524-4107; CAMILLERI, SARAH/0000-0003-0107-993X												0923-4861	1572-9834				FEB	2017	25	1					23	43		10.1007/s11273-016-9500-4								WOS:000394165100003

Three-dimensional habitat structure and landscape genetics: a step forward in estimating functional connectivity	ECOLOGY												Estimating connectivity among fragmented habitat patches is crucial for evaluating the functionality of ecological networks. However, current estimates of landscape resistance to animal movement and dispersal lack landscape-level data on local habitat structure. Here, we used a landscape genetics approach to show that high-fidelity habitat structure maps derived from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data critically improve functional connectivity estimates compared to conventional land cover data. We related pairwise genetic distances of 128 Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) genotypes to least-cost path distances at multiple scales derived from land cover data. Resulting beta values of linear mixed effects models ranged from 0.372 to 0.495, while those derived from LiDAR ranged from 0.558 to 0.758. The identification and conservation of functional ecological networks suffering from habitat fragmentation and homogenization will thus benefit from the growing availability of detailed and contiguous data on three-dimensional habitat structure and associated habitat quality.

In variegated landscapes, however, organisms face continuous variation in micro-habitat features, which makes necessary to consider ecologically meaningful estimates of habitat quality at different spatial scales. We evaluated the spatial scales at which forest cover and tree quality make the greatest contribution to the occupancy of the long-horned beetle Microplophorus magellanicus (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) in a variegated forest landscape. We used averaged data of tree quality (as derived from remote sensing estimates of the decay stage of single trees) and spatially independent pheromone-baited traps to model the occurrence probability as a function of multiple cross-scale combinations between forest cover and tree quality (with scales ranging between 50 and 400 m). Model support and performance increased monotonically with the increasing scale at which tree quality was measured. Forest cover was not significant, and did not exhibit scale-specific effects on the occurrence probability of M. magellanicus. The interactive effect between tree quality and forest cover was stronger than the independent (additive) effects of tree quality and particularly forest cover. Significant interactions included tree quality measured at spatial scales 200 m, but cross-scale interactions occurred only in four of the seven best-supported models. M. magellanicus respond to the high-quality trees available in the landscape rather than to the amount of forest per se. Conservation of viable metapopulations of M. magellanicus should consider the quality of trees at spatial scales > 200 m.																	0921-2973	1572-9761				FEB	2017	32	2					279	293		10.1007/s10980-016-0443-1								WOS:000393050700005

Macaws have been studied for decades in their natural habitat, but we still have no knowledge of how natural landscape features influence their dispersal. We tested for correlations between landscape resistance models and the current population genetic structure of macaws in continuous rainforest to explore natural barriers to their dispersal. We studied scarlet macaws (Ara macao) over a 13,000 km(2) area of continuous primary Amazon rainforest in south-eastern Peru. Using remote sensing imagery from the Carnegie Airborne Observatory, we constructed landscape resistance surfaces in CIRCUITSCAPE based on elevation, canopy height and above-ground carbon distribution. We then used individual- and population-level genetic analyses to examine which landscape features influenced gene flow (genetic distance between individuals and populations). Across the lowland rainforest we found limited population genetic differentiation. However, a population from an intermountain valley of the Andes (Candamo) showed detectable genetic differentiation from two other populations (Tambopata) located 20-60 km away (F (ST) = 0.008, P = 0.001-0.003). Landscape resistance models revealed that genetic distance between individuals was significantly positively related to elevation. Our landscape resistance analysis suggests that mountain ridges between Candamo and Tambopata may limit gene flow in scarlet macaws. These results serve as baseline data for continued landscape studies of parrots, and will be useful for understanding the impacts of anthropogenic dispersal barriers in the future.

Mapping the soil loss is a useful and necessary in planning and maintenance works in Marqya river basin. At present study, the soil loss model, revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) integrated with GIS and RS techniques (DEM and Landsat 8 OLI image) remote sensing data) to map soil loss in the Marqya basin, located in the west part of Syria. The Marqya basin is a Mediterranean coastal humid area, and covers a drainage area of 384 km(2). Soil loss affected by rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, topography, vegetation, and conservation support practice factors. According to RUSLE model, soil loss was mapped through the production of raster maps of previous factors and then was multiplied by using GIS and RS techniques. The results show that 58% of the study basin has a low loss of soil, 27% moderate loss, 11% high loss, and 4% a very high loss, respectively. Marqya basin is in the extremely severe level of soil erosion rates with about 15% of land affected by high and very high soil loss risk. Consequently, the produced map represents the first step in the right direction to start taking the maintenance and support procedures with spatial implementations.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				FEB	2017	76	3							114	10.1007/s12665-017-6424-0								WOS:000393021800016						
J	You, HY				You, Heyuan			Orienting rocky desertification towards sustainable land use: An advanced remote sensing tool to guide the conservation policy	LAND USE POLICY												Due to non-sustainable land management, desertification has been occurring widely across the world and continues to be a global land use problem. In this context, appropriate methodological tools, which can provide a biased estimation of desertification, are critical for learning from past failures and local successes in orienting desertification towards sustainable land use. This paper proposes a locally adaptive multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) algorithm to extract the rocky desertification information from medium resolution images at subpixel level and applies it to the case of Danjiangkou reservoir region (DRR), China. Quantitative comparisons show that the locally adaptive MESMA has achieved more accurate and reliable estimations of rocky desertification information in DRR than the traditional MESMA. An inversed U-shaped trend is observed for desertified land with different severity levels from 1987 and 2013 in DRR. In particular, the inflection point roughly emerged in period 2000-2005. Casual mechanism-based regressions demonstrate that such dynamics of rocky desertification are closely coupled with socioeconomic, biophysical, and policy factors. More specifically, we identify a significantly positive role of land conservation policy in combating and relieving rocky desertification in DRR. Positive effects are observed particularly through afforestation, investment, and professionals input. Based on the conclusions and lessons of DRR, I finally make relevant recommendations for formulating policies and strategies that attempt to orient desertification towards sustainable land use. The proposed locally adaptive MESMA can act as an advanced remote sensing tool to guide the conservation policy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Modeling the spatial dynamics of deforestation and fragmentation using Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network and landscape fragmentation tool	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												This study has assessed forest cover changes, rate of deforestation, levels of fragmentation and modeled the spatial dynamics of deforestation and forest fragmentation in Assam, India. The analysis of the forest change shows that between 1975 and 2015, the area coverage of forest has reduced from 23749 km(2) (30.3% of the state geographical area) to 21145 km(2) (27% of the state geographical area). The total predicted forest area of Assam is 20189 km(2) (25.7%) for 2030. Forest and non-forest classes were evaluated in order to assess changes and to study influence of five physical factors distance from road and settlement areas, elevation, slope and distance from the water bodies on the deforestation. The Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network modeling was used for predicting the spatial distribution of deforestation. According to the Cramer coefficients, the elevation was strongly associated with deforestation in Assam followed by the slope, distance to water bodies and the distance to roads. The forest areas undergoing high concentration of negative changes have been modelled in the form of deforestation hotspots by using optimised hotspot tool. The results of fragmentation analysis have indicated the reduction of core forests throughout the study period. The spatial database generated in the study is a useful input for understanding of the impact of deforestation and fragmentation on biodiversity and land use change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, because the ecological effects of this project remain unknown, decision making for future project implementation is hindered. Thus, in this study, we developed an index system to evaluate the effects of the ecological restoration project, by integrating field observations, remote sensing, and process-based models. Effects were assessed using trend analyses of ecosystem structures and services. Results showed positive trends in the TRSR since the beginning of the project, but not yet a return to the optima of the 1970s. Specifically, while continued degradation in grassland has been initially contained, results are still far from the desired objective, 'grassland coverage increasing by an average of 20%-40%'. In contrast, wetlands and water bodies have generally been restored, while the water conservation and water supply capacity of watersheds have increased. Indeed, the volume of water conservation achieved in the project meets the objective of a 1.32 billion m(3) increase. The effects of ecological restoration inside project regions was more significant than outside, and, in addition to climate change projects, we concluded that the implementation of ecological conservation and restoration projects has substantially contributed to vegetation restoration. Nevertheless, the degradation of grasslands has not been fundamentally reversed, and to date the project has not prevented increasing soil erosion. In sum, the effects and challenges of this first-stage project highlight the necessity of continuous and long-term ecosystem conservation efforts in this region.																	1009-637X	1861-9568				FEB	2017	27	2					183	204		10.1007/s11442-017-1371-y								WOS:000390068200004

Enhancing the energy conservation benefits of shade trees in dense residential developments using an alternative tree placement strategy	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Modern residential land development has trended toward densification, resulting in limited space to plant shade trees. As a result, shade trees are often planted in sub-optimal locations around homes for energy conservation benefits. Using a simulation program-called EnergyPlus, we examined the effects of existing trees on energy consumption of recently constructed homes in three U.S. cities with distinctly different climates: Metro Minneapolis, MN, Charlotte, NC, and Metro Orlando, FL. We used remote sensing to identify placement of existing trees around homes, revealing that there were 1.5 to 2.9 trees within 15 m of the homes on average. When modeled as large-stature deciduous trees in the simulator, existing trees provided average annual energy savings per parcel of 14 kWh (MN), 25 kWh (NC), and 44 kWh (FL). We then tested an alternative tree placement strategy that spatially reconfigured the existing trees, based on parcel orientation, to both minimize space conflicts and maximize energy savings. This alternative strategy optimized the placement of over 70% of the existing trees and significantly improved annual energy savings per parcel to 57 kWh (MN), 47 kWh (NC), and 103 kWh (FL). In Metro Orlando, the impact of optimization on annual energy savings across our sampling frame was 574,000 kWh. Although our alternative strategy was no more effective than the conventional strategy (always plant a shade tree on the west aspect). It is more responsive to space constraints and therefore can guide developers and homeowners more practically toward optimal tree placement for energy conservation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This study proposed a remote sensing based approach to evaluate the long-term efforts of the ERPs started in 2000. The method applies a time-series trend analysis of satellite based vegetation data corrected for climatic influences to reveal human induced vegetation changes. The improved residual method is combined with statistics on the invested project funds to derive an index, Project Effectiveness Index (PEI), measuring the project effectiveness at county scale. High effectiveness is detected in the Guangxi Province, moderate effectiveness in the Guizhou Province, and low and no effectiveness in the Yunnan Province. Successful implementations are closely related to the combined influences from climatic conditions and human management. The landforms of Peak Forest Plain and Peak Cluster Depression regions in the Guangxi Province are characterized by temperate climate with sufficient rainfall generally leading to a high effectiveness. For the karst regions of the Yunnan and Guizhou Provinces with rough terrain and lower rainfall combined with poor management practices (unsuitable species selection, low compensation rate for peasants), only low or even no effect of project implementations can be observed. However, the effectiveness distribution is not homogeneous and counties with high project effectiveness in spite of complex natural conditions were identified, while counties with negative vegetation trends despite relatively favorable conditions and high investments were also distinguished. The proposed framework is expected to be of high relevance in general monitoring of the successfulness of ecological conservation projects in relation to invested funds.

RS is critical to meet requirements of existing laws such as the EU Habitats Directive (HabDir) and more importantly to meet future challenges. The full potential of RS has yet to be harnessed as different nomenclatures and procedures hinder interoperability, comparison and provenance. Therefore, automated tools are needed to use RS data to produce comparable, empirical data outputs that lend themselves to data discovery and provenance. These issues are addressed by a novel, semi-automatic ontology-based classification method that uses machine learning algorithms and Web Ontology Language (OWL) ontologies that yields traceable, interoperable and observation-based classification outputs. The method was tested on European Union Nature Information System (EUNIS) grasslands in Rheinland-Palatinate, Germany. The developed methodology is a first step in developing observation-based ontologies in the field of nature conservation. The tests show promising results for the determination of the grassland indicators wetness and alkalinity with an overall accuracy of 85% for alkalinity and 76% for wetness. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Soil erosion is now a global environmental crisis that threatens the natural environment and agriculture. This study aimed to assess the annual rate of soil erosion using distributed information for topography, land use and soil, with a remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) approach and comparison of simulated with observed sediment loss. The Shakkar River basin, situated in the Narsinghpur and Chhindwara districts of Madhya Pradesh, India, was selected for this study. The universal soil loss equation (USLE) with RS and GIS was used to predict the spatial distribution of soil erosion occurring in the study area on a grid-cell basis. Thematic maps of rainfall erosivity factor (R), soil erodibility factor (K), topographic factor (LS), crop/cover management factor (C), and conservation/support practice factor (P) were prepared using annual rainfall data, soil map, digital elevation model (DEM) and an executable C++ program, and a satellite image of the study area in the GIS environment. The annual rate of soil erosion was estimated for a 15-year period (1992-2006) and was found to vary between 6.45 and 13.74tha(-1)year(-1), with an average annual rate of 9.84tha(-1)year(-1). The percentage deviation between simulated and observed values varies between 2.68% and 18.73%, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.874.																	0262-6667	2150-3435				FEB	2017	62	2					217	231		10.1080/02626667.2016.1217413								WOS:000392602000005

The connection between breeding and non-breeding grounds is defined as migratory connectivity. The quantification of such connectivity is important, because movements between different locations can have strong consequences for the moving animal as well as the encountered habitats or ecosystems. Connectivity is usually investigated either on the basis of (few unsystematic) re-encounters of (often large numbers of) marked individuals or by observations of a few individuals tracked by remote sensing techniques, i.e. GPS or geolocation. The combination of qualitatively different data sets can reduce the limitations of each type of data and thus improve the accuracy of the estimated connectivity parameters considerably. We formally combine individual tracking data and mark re-encounter data in a probabilistic model framework for quantifying connectivity. In a first example, we quantify migratory connectivity of a long-distance passerine migrant based on ring re-encounter and geolocator data. As a second example, we combine re-encounter data of ear-tagged wild boars with GPS tracking data to estimate the spatial distribution of wild boars during the hunting and the non-hunting seasons. These two examples illustrate the use of the model in two different framework: 1) long-distance migration and, 2) seasonal (e.g. hunting induced) non-migratory movements. Results from the integrated analyses provided more information than the informal comparison of the results from independent analyses on each data set separately. Parameter estimates were more precise in the integrated analyses compared to the separate analyses and stronger conclusions could be drawn. The integration of mark re-encounter and tracking data reduces sampling bias and increases the value of both data sets but the weighting of each data set needs further investigation.

Two scales are better than one: Monitoring multiple-use northern temperate forests	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Managing forests for multiple, often conflicting values, coupled with the uncertainty of global environmental change, requires a more flexible approach to maintaining functioning ecosystems into the future. Adaptive management offers such flexibility, but is often hampered by a lack of targeted monitoring data collected in a consistent manner the evidence base. Moreover, effective management of expansive forest ecosystems requires data on both landscape scale processes, as well as finer-scale data on vegetation structure and composition. To address the challenges of adaptive management in forest ecosystems, we tested the ability of a small set of multi-scale indicators to inform management of Minnesota's Northern Great Lakes forest. Using remotely sensed and field data, we monitored changes in forest condition over a 20-year period in the 42,000 ha Manitou forest landscape in northeastern Minnesota. We used multi-temporal remote sensing data to assess landscape-scale changes in disturbance rates, patch size and age structure. With field data, we used a chronosequence method to assess management effects over time on finer scale characteristics such as canopy composition, tree regeneration, vertical structure and coarse woody debris. Combining remotely sensed and field data provided a more robust evidence base for decision-making than either approach could have provided alone. For example, examining remote-sensing data alone indicates that the rate of severe disturbance (timber harvest) peaked during the 20-year analysis period, and has declined in recent years. As disturbance rates declined, patch size and the proportion of forest in later successional stages all increased from year 2000 levels. These indicators of landscape structure showed positive shifts towards conservation objectives, but only tell part of the whole story. Field data elucidate a number of negative trends, including poor regeneration of key species (Picea glauca, Pinus strobus, Thuja occidentalis, Betula alleghaniensis), and simplified structure in young and mature growth stages. In addition, much of the mature forest transitioning into later-successional growth stages lacks the long-lived species and structural characteristics needed to develop late successional conditions. An evidence base compiled from data gathered at both the stand and landscape scale provides the flexibility on which sound adaptive management depends. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The area is known for the variety of annual and perennial crops grown, its breeds of livestock and diversified vegetation, and especially its forest resources. In the years between 1986 and 2013, both built-up areas and cultivated land cover increased. This indicates that, due to expansion of cultivated land and human settlements, the natural forest land cover declined. Similar to natural forest, grassland cover was also found to decrease. Land use and land cover change and consequent land degradation in the Lake Tana watershed limits the potential to develop a sustainable livelihood for its inhabitants. The effectiveness of the regional and local efforts to improve the environment and livelihoods of the residents in the Lake Tana watershed through natural resource conservation programs are limited due to capacity and financial barriers. Land use and water resource related barriers that were identified include weak policy implementation, low capacity (technical and financial), poor information management system, low or no incentives, and frequent restructuring of core and principal institutions at national/regional levels. Alleviation of these constraints will be important for better delivery of technical support and enabling local users to implement good land use related practices, to influence policies; reduce dependency on aids and implement environmentally friendly watershed management activities; terraces, gully rehabilitation check dams and alley cropping as biological measures.																	2509-9787	2509-9795	978-3-319-45755-0; 978-3-319-45753-6				2017							479	521		10.1007/978-3-319-45755-0_28	10.1007/978-3-319-45755-0							WOS:000419723900029

Riparian and landscape disturbance effects on stream fish community composition in an agriculturally-dominated drainage	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												We compared historical stream fish community sampling and remote sensing data from 1993-2011 in an agriculturally-dominated drainage basin to determine the effects of varying levels of riparian and landscape disturbances on fish communities. Stream fish guilds were analyzed with National Land Cover Database and aerial imagery products to quantify disturbance levels at a local and watershed scale. Insectivores and benthic insectivores were associated with intact riparian areas, whereas environmentally tolerant and omnivorous species were found in environments with degraded riparian areas. Riparian disturbances had the greatest effect near the stream (0-10 m), and the effects diminished with increasing distance from the stream. This spatial scale corresponds with those reported in the literature whereby allocthonous inputs and riparian filtering influenced stream fish communities and water quality. The landscape disturbance was not a strong predictor for any fish guild, indicating that local riparian conditions were more biologically meaningful. Considering the rapid rates of land conversion to production agriculture across the midwestern United States, ensuring adequate riparian buffering of streams may help protect specialist aquatic species and their habitat. Given the broad temporal and spatial nature of our data, these results suggest that targeted conservation of the 10-m scale of intact riparian vegetation directly adjacent to streams is a sound practice and should be considered the minimum conservation goal for watershed restoration in low-gradient landscapes historically dominated by agricultural land-use practices.																	1463-4988	1539-4077					2017	29	4					445	456		10.1080/14634988.2017.1368831								WOS:000423091000015

FACTORS INFLUENCING ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF OVERWINTERED WATERBIRDS IN PARISHAN INTERNATIONAL WETLAND IN IRAN	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Parishan International Wetland, an Iranian Ramsar Site in Fars Province, is one of the two demonstration sites for the UNDP/GEF Conservation of Iranian Wetlands Project. The aim of this study was to examine the factors influencing water bird abundance, density, the number of species, and species richness in Parishan wetland from 1991 to 2010. We used remote sensing techniques to study some environmental factors affecting waterbirds community. Spearman's Correlation Coefficient and linear regression were also used to examine the impact of environmental factors on the community of waterbirds. The results showed that only the nearest wetland area was significantly correlated with abundance and density of species (p < 0.01). Also, the vegetation cover surface of wetland (P < 0.01); the deepest depth of wetland (P < 0.01); and the areas shallower than 1m (P < 0.05) were significantly correlated with the number and richness of species (Margalef Index). The Resulting models of the backward multiple regression test also indicated that the nearest wetland area was a good predictor of abundance (P value < 0.01) and density of waterbirds (P value < 0.05). Furthermore, the vegetation cover surface of wetland, was a good predictor of the number of species (P value<0.01) and of the richness species based on Margalef Index (P value<0.01). The area of the Parishan wetland has fallen very low in 2010 and reducing the area of the wetland has led to a sharp decrease in the number of birds in the wetland.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	4					1565	1579		10.15666/aeer/1504_15651579								WOS:000419994800102

Therefore, the demand for creation of protective areas like Unities of Conservation is justified by the need to intensify the preservation of remaining forests and the biodiversity maintenance. The Area of Environmental Protection (APA in Portuguese) is a category of Sustainable Unity of Conservation that aims to protect the environment and to decrease the impact of human activities. In this sense, the city of Martinopolis created from its Director Plan the APA of the Laranja Doce Dam. This article analyzes the process and the motivations of this protected area's creation and proposes its zoning, in order to establish the adequate rule of the protected area inside the current limits and possibilities. For this purpose, bibliographic survey and field studies were performed, interviews with residents of the neighborhood adjacent to the dam and elaboration of maps through geoprocessing techniques and remote sensing, as the vectorization and classification of satellite images through QGIS software. The results showed that the affected population was not consulted about the creation of the APA, neither were conducted studies to analyze its viability, concerning the land use and the vegetation cover. As final proposal, the suggested zoning looked for ally these aspects, aiming to conciliate the discovered reality and the objectives of environmental conservation of the APA.																	2178-7298	1517-543X					2017	1	25					81	104										WOS:000419535700005

However, most research has focused on habitat quality, and we still lack approaches for tracking habitat quality dynamics. In this paper, by establishing qualitative and quantitative relationships between waterbird populations and key habitat indicators such as water abundance, food, shelter conditions and disturbance, we developed an object-oriented classification method, in conjunction with a geographic information systems (GIS) based centroid moving method, to assess habitat suitability dynamics for waterbirds at the Momoge Nature Reserve, China. Our results showed that habitat suitability improved during 1990-2000 and declined during 2000-2014. Habitats with very good and good grades increased by 71.47 km(2) (4.88%) during 1990-2000 and decreased by 200.66 km(2) (13.78%) during 2000-2014. The habitat area with a good grade moved to the north, while the habitat area with a poor grade moved to the south during 1990-2014. This was mainly because the surrounding cropland area increased and shifted as oil and gas projects developed. These findings suggest that our object-oriented classification and centroid moving methods have great potential for use in biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management.																	1648-6897	1822-4199					2017	25	4					367	378		10.3846/16486897.2017.1316982								WOS:000419310900005

It also aims to achieve sustainable livelihood by addressing the causes of chronic poverty as well as strengthening of the natural resource base. The assets created under the MGNREGA related to water and soil conservation and management have contributed to an increased availability of water for sustainable agriculture especially in the semi-arid and arid regions. Dug well at the farmer's land, locally known as Kapil Dhara, is one of the highly demanded assets created under the MGNREGA in the state of Madhya Pradesh. Dug wells have benefitted the rural population in form of increased irrigated area, crop productivity, and cropping intensity. An integrated approach based on remote sensing (RS) and field survey was used to assess the impact of dug wells toward change in cropped area and cropping intensity. Six sampling units representing one/two micro-watershed has been randomly selected for in-depth study. Interpretation of RS data has shown that there has been an increase in double crop area after the MGNREGA intervention in five selected sampling units spread in two blocks of the Ratlam district. Watershed with diverse water recharge activities recorded comparatively higher impact of dug wells as compared to watershed that had lesser associated water recharge activities. The analysis further revealed that application of RS and watershed approach in planning can enhance sustainability of assets created under the MGNREGA.																	2198-0721	2198-073X	978-3-319-46010-9; 978-3-319-46008-6				2017							87	95		10.1007/978-3-319-46010-9_6	10.1007/978-3-319-46010-9							WOS:000419229200008

In this study, multiple logistic regression is integrated with remote sensing and geographic information system to evaluate the suitable habitats available for sambar (Rusa unicolor) in Chandoli Tiger Reserve, Maharashtra, India (17 degrees 04' 00 '' N to 17 degrees 19' 54 '' N and 73 degrees 40' 43 '' E to 73 degrees 53' 09 '' E). Satellite imageries of LISS-III of IRS-P6 of study area were digitally processed. To generate collateral data topographic maps were analysed in a GIS framework. Layers of different variables such as land use land cover, forest density, proximity to disturbances and water resources and a digital terrain model were created from satellite imageries and topographic maps. These layers along with GPS location of sambar presence/absence and multiple logistic regression (MLR) techniques were integrated in a GIS environment to model habitat suitability index of sambar. The results indicate that approximately 69.92 km(2) (24 %) of the forest of tiger reserve was least suitable for sambar, whereas 82.60 km(2) (28 %) was moderately suitable, 88.25 km(2) (30 %) suitable and 54.01 km2 (18 %) was highly suitable. The accuracy level of this model was 80.2 %. The model advocates that forests of this area are most appropriate for declaring it as a reserve for sambar conservation.																	2198-0721	2198-073X	978-3-319-46010-9; 978-3-319-46008-6				2017							231	246		10.1007/978-3-319-46010-9_15	10.1007/978-3-319-46010-9							WOS:000419229200017

Our study utilized remote sensing techniques combined with Geographic Information Systems-based hydrological modelling to identify flood risk in this urban area. QuickBird imagery was used to create land-use/land-cover information, an important input into the U.S. Soil Conservation Service Technique Release 55 (SCS TR-55) model which is used for predicting rainfall-induced flood. Tidal floods were examined using a Digital Elevation Model in a GIS framework with water level in rivers as an input. The findings indicated that rainfall-induced flood is not a serious problem with the flood depth of 2-10 cm while tidal flood is a substantial issue with 10-100 cm flood depths. Increasing impervious surfaces and decreasing flow length areas resulting from the growth of urbanization in combination with tidal effects contributed significantly to increased flood risk. These findings have implications on solutions for flood risk control in the district, including managing urbanization processes with appropriate infrastructure and improving the infiltration capacity of the runoff with optimized drainage systems.																	1947-5705	1947-5713					2017	8	2					1792	1811		10.1080/19475705.2017.1388853								WOS:000418899200095

Satellite and Airborne Remote Sensing Applications for Freshwater Fisheries	FISHERIES												Remote sensing has been pivotal to our understanding of freshwater fisheries, and we review this rapidly changing field with a focus on satellite and airborne applications. Historical applications emphasized spatial variation in the environment (e.g., watershed land use and in situ primary productivity), but improved access to imagery archives facilitates better change detection over time. New sensor platforms and technology now yield imagery with higher spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions than ever before, which has accelerated development of remote sensing products that more accurately characterize aquatic environments. Free access to imagery archives, cloud computing, and availability of derived products linked to national hydrography databases are all removing historical barriers to its use by fisheries professionals. These advances in remote sensing have allowed new questions to be answered at finer spatial resolutions across broader landscapes and longer time frames, providing a new big-picture perspective to freshwater fisheries conservation and management.																	0363-2415	1548-8446					2017	42	10					526	537		10.1080/03632415.2017.1357911								WOS:000418732800009

Spatial dynamic of the agriculture fields towards their shape and size	UKRAINIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												We estimated the size and shape characteristics of agricultural fields within the administrative area and identified patterns of the margin trends from 1950-1960 till the present time. Here we considered large-scale soil maps for the area of Vasilkovsky district of the Dnepropetrovsk region, which were drawn up in 1950-1960. To assess the landscape metric we used FRAGSTATS program which allow to make conformity assessment of the observed distributions of field sizes regards the normal, exponential, log-normal, gamma, Weibull, and Pareto distributions. We also used Box-Cox transformation to convert the experimental data into the normal distribution law for the further application of the transformed data in regression analysis. We estimated that the area of agricultural fields ranged from 1.20 to 269.00 hectares during the period of large-scale mapping in 1950-1960. The variation limits of the field sizes based on the results of remote sensing data and in our time they are 2,. 5-266.57 hectares. Area of the fields in different periods strongly correlate and are statistically significant (r = 0.98, p = 0.00). Field sizes currently associated with the field sizes in the 50-60 years of linear regression. Shape parameters and field sizes significantly correlated, therefore, to establish the main trends of varying shape and size of fields, as well as for non-multicollinearity variables for regression analysis, we performed a multivariate factor analysis. An important aspect of the structuring of the agri-landscape is the location of settlements and, therefore, the fields distance from them. In results obtained indicate that the processes increase and decrease the size of fields in agricultural production are determined by various factors. Aspects of the shape and size of the fields associated with the dynamics of the processes that lead to variations in field areas.

Its coastal wetland and tidal flats offer significant ecological services including floodwater storage, wildlife habitat, and buffers against tidal surges. Yet, large-scale land reclamation and new land development may dramatically change ecosystem services. In this research, we assess changes in ecosystem service values in Zhoushan Island during 1990-2000-2011. Three LANDSAT TM and/or ETM data sets were used to determine the spatial pattern of land use, and previously published value coefficients were used to calculate the ecosystem service values delivered by each land category. The results show that total value of ecosystem services in Zhoushan Island declined by 11% from 2920.07 billion Yuan to 2609.77 billion Yuan per year between 1990 and 2011. This decrease is largely attributable to the 51% loss of tidal flats. The combined ecosystem service values of woodland, paddy land and tidal flats were over 90% of the total values. The result indicates that future land- use policy should pay attention to the conservation of these ecosystems over uncontrolled reclamation and coastal industrial development, and that further coastal reclamation should be on rigorous environmental impact analyses.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-1307-2; 978-1-5106-1306-5				2017	10421								UNSP 1042123	10.1117/12.2277899								WOS:000417373000048

Especially intensive precipitation events, changing land-use and thin soil layer trigger surface runoff generation and hence, soil erosion, sediment transport, flooding and related damages. In this study, we propose a methodology using remotely sensed data, terrain analysis and stochastic modeling to characterize the soil hydrological and physical components of the Teiro catchment. Particularly, we focus on the triggering land-cover and soil information that can be derived with multispectral remote sensing techniques. To study the hydrological dynamics of the Teiro catchment we applied the Soil Conservation Service Curve Number method implemented in a GIS system for different precipitation events related to various return periods. The input data was calculated based on multispectral indices describing the heterogeneity of soils and vegetation. The discharges obtained show reasonable values that have been validated with mapped flooded areas of the 4th October 2011 flood event. This event corresponds roughly to a 10 years return period. However, it is striking that a 50 years return period event was calculated to yield the double amount of discharge and thus, implies a major hazard for the local population.

Extraction of shoreline changes in Selangor coastal area using GIS and remote sensing techniques	2017 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SPACE SCIENCE AND COMMUNICATION	Journal of Physics Conference Series				International Conference on Space Science and Communication - Space Science for Sustainability	MAY 03-05, 2017	Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA	Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Climate Change, Space Sci Ctr				Nowadays, coastal zones are facing shoreline changes that stemming from natural and anthropogenic effect. The process of erosion and accretion will affect the physical environment of the shoreline. Therefore, the study of shoreline changes is important to identify the patterns of changes over time. The rapid growth of technology nowadays has facilitated the study of shoreline changes. Geographical Information System (GIS) alongside Remote Sensing (RS) technology is a useful tool to study these changes due to its ability to generate information, monitoring, analysis and prediction of the shoreline changes. Hence, the future projection of the trend for a specific coastal area can be done effectively. This study investigates the impact of shoreline changes to the community in Selangor area which mainly focus on the physical aspects. This study presents preliminary result using satellite image from SPOT 5 to identify the shoreline changes from the year 1984 to 2013 at Selangor coastal area. Extraction of shoreline from satellite image is vital to analyze the erosion and accretion along the shoreline area. This study shows that a shoreline change for the whole area is a categorized as a medium case. The total eroded and accretion of Selangor area from 1984 to 2013 is 2558 hectares and 2583 hectares respectively. As a result, Kapar, Jugra, Telok Panglima Garang and Kelanang are categorized as high risk erosion area. Shoreline changes analysis provides essential information to determine on the shoreline changes trends. Therefore, the results of this study can be used as essential information for conservation and preservation of coastal zone management.																	1742-6588						2017	852								UNSP 012031	10.1088/1742-6596/852/1/012031								WOS:000417438600031

In playing this role, greening of cities needs to move beyond mere provision of amenities or ecosystem services to one of providing habitats for native biodiversity. This chapter describes one of the approaches for enhancing urban biodiversity conservation through the ecological network approach. The concept of ecological networks is not new in the field of ecology. However, its application to cities, both in conceptual and operational forms, is highly limited. As a high-rise, high-density city in which biodiversity conservation is threatened by other competing land uses, Singapore is used as an example to illustrate the development and application of the ecological network approach. The ecological network is built on the concept of network, spatial and landscape cohesions. Using methods in landscape ecology, remote sensing, biodiversity conservation and the Analytic Hierarchy Process, this chapter describes how a toolkit for ecological network can be developed, as well as the efficacy of its use for biodiversity management. The toolkit is categorized into monitoring tools, mapping tools, and communication and decision making tools. The learning outcomes gleaned from the research are presented as the 5-multis: multispecies, multiscalar, multilevel, multifunctionality, and multidisciplinarity.																	2198-2546	2198-2554	978-981-10-4113-6; 978-981-10-4111-2				2017							251	277		10.1007/978-981-10-4113-6_12	10.1007/978-981-10-4113-6							WOS:000417611500014

Characterisation of spatial and temporal distribution of the fire regime in Niassa National Reserve, northern Mozambique	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												The Niassa National Reserve (NNR) is the largest conservation area of the Miombo woodlands in southern Africa, representing one of the most remote and pristine biodiversity spots. Anthropogenic fires have long been one of the main ecological drivers in these woodlands. However, the constraint in understanding fire effects results from limited data and accessibility to existing fire records. This study is intended to contribute to the understanding of fire ecology in these woodlands by assessing the fire regime in NNR. We used the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily active fire (MDC14ML) and burned-area (MCD45A1) products to characterise the fire regime in terms of seasonality, intensity, density, burned area, frequency and mean return interval for the period from 2000 to 2012. The results indicated that fire activity starts c. April and peaks in the late dry season (August-October). Approximately 45% of the area burns every year, especially the north-central and eastern sectors, with fire intensity displaying an inverse relationship with frequency. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the relevance of remote sensing for describing the spatial and temporal patterns of fire occurrence in the Miombo eco-region and highlights the necessity for controlling fire and managing fuels in this important conservation area.																	1049-8001	1448-5516					2017	26	12					1021	1029		10.1071/WF17085								WOS:000417477500004

HOW DOES SPATIAL SCALE AFFECT SPECIES RICHNESS MODELLING? A TEST USING REMOTE SENSING DATA AND GEOSTATISTICS	ANNALI DI BOTANICA												Spatially-explicit dataset of plant species occurrences collected in the Province of Siena (Central Italy) is analysed, with the aim of investigating a) the relative role of environmental factors in shaping spatial patterns of plant species richness, and b) how the spatial scale at which predictors have been sampled determines the explicative power of species richness models. The optimal spatial resolution of analysis was evaluated with respect to the total deviance explained by models, using a set of environmental and remotely sensed derived predictors calculated at different spatial scales. Results confirm the hypothesis that the predictive power of landscape structure is influenced by the spatial scale at which predictor variables have been sampled. Furthermore, the relevance of identifying a proper geographical scale of investigation, hence minimizing the redundancy in the predictor variables and maximising the explanatory power of the single groups of predictor variables, is highlighted as well.

As a consequence, both classifying and monitoring wetland areas are necessary for wetland conservation and human services in the province. In this study, wetlands in 5 pilot sites, distributed across NL, were classified using multi-source and multi-temporal optical remote sensing images. The procedures involved the application of an object-based method to segment and classify the images. To classify the areas, 5 different machine learning algorithms were examined. The results showed that the Random Forest (RF) algorithm in combination with an object-based approach was the most accurate method to classify wetlands. The average producer and user accuracies of wetland classes considering all pilot sites were 68% and 73%, respectively. The overall classification accuracies, which considered the accuracy of all wetland and non-wetland classes varied from 86% to 96% across all pilot sites confirming the robustness of the methodology despite the biological, ecological, and geographical differences among the study areas. Additionally, we assessed the effects of the tuning parameters on the accuracy of results, as well as the difference between pixel-based and object-based methods for wetland classification in this study.																	0703-8992	1712-7971					2017	43	4					360	373		10.1080/07038992.2017.1346468								WOS:000416720900005

Notably, it is the only province in Atlantic Canada that does not have a wetland inventory system. Wetlands are important areas of research because they play a pivotal role in ecological conservation and impact human activities in the province. Therefore, classifying wetland types and monitoring their changes are crucial tasks recommended for the province. In this study, wetlands in five pilot sites, distributed across NL, were classified using the integration of aerial imagery, Synthetic Aperture Radar, and optical satellite data. First, each study area was segmented using the object-based method, and then various spectral and polarimetric features were evaluated to select the best features for identifying wetland classes using the Random Forest algorithm. The accuracies of the classifications were assessed by the parameters obtained from confusion matrices, and the overall accuracies varied between 81% and 91%. Moreover, the average producer and user accuracies for wetland classes, considering all pilot sites, were 71% and 72%, respectively. Since the proposed methodology demonstrated high accuracies for wetland classification in different study areas with various ecological characteristics, the application of future classifications in other areas of interest is promising.

Identification of rainwater harvesting sites using SCS-CN methodology, remote sensing and Geographical Information System techniques	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL												This study presents a method to identify potential sites for soil and water conservation techniques for the demarcation of suitable sites for artificial recharge of groundwater aquifers, in the study area. The run-off derived by the Soil Conservation Service Curve Number method is a function of run-off potential which can be expressed in terms of run-off coefficient. The augmentation of water resource is proposed by the construction of rainwater harvesting structures like check dam, percolation pond, farm pond and gully check dam. The site suitability for different water harvesting structures is determined by considering spatially varying parameters like slope, infiltration, run-off potential, landuse/land cover, stream order, soil texture, land capability class, hydrological soil group and micro-watershed area. The determined suitable site has been validated with existing recharge structures of the study area.

Much of this decline has been attributed to the loss and fragmentation of native grasslands throughout the lesser prairie-chicken range. However, quantification of changes in land cover in the distribution of the lesser prairie-chicken is lacking. Our objectives were to (1) document changes in the areal extent and connectivity of grasslands in the identified lesser prairie-chicken range in Kansas, USA, (>60% of extant lesser prairie-chicken population) from the 1950s to 2013 using remotely sensed data and (2) assess the potential of the Conservation Reserve Program (U.S. Department of Agriculture Program converting cropland to permanent cover; CRP) to mitigate grassland loss. Digital land cover maps were generated on a decadal time step through spectral classification of LANDSAT images and visual analysis of aerial photographs (1950s and 1960s). Landscape composition and configuration were assessed using FRAGSTATS to compute a variety of landscape metrics measuring changes in the amount of grassland present as well as changes in the size and configuration of grassland patches. With the exception of a single regional portion of the range, nearly all of the grassland converted to cropland in the lesser prairie-chicken range of Kansas occurred prior to the 1950s. Prior to the implementation of CRP, the amount of grassland decreased 3.6% between the 1950s and 1985 from 18,455 km(2) to 17,788 km(2). Since 1985, the overall amount of grassland in the lesser prairie-chicken range has increased 11.9% to 19,898 km(2) due to implementation of CRP, although the area of grassland decreased between 1994 and 2013 as CRP contracts were not renewed by landowners. Since 1986 grassland in Kansas became more connected and less fragmented in response to the CRP. While the CRP has been successful in increasing grassland quantity and connectivity throughout the lesser prairie-chicken range in Kansas, offsetting loss of grassland since the 1950s, abundance and occupied range of lesser prairie-chickens has declined since the 1980s, suggesting that habitat quality is the principal factor influencing population demography of the species. Although the CRP is contributing to conservation actions for lesser prairie-chickens, efforts to improve habitat quality throughout the range of the lesser prairie-chicken are likely necessary to meet management goals. Continuation of the CRP faces an uncertain future in the face of rising commodity prices, energy development, and reduction in program scope, leaving open the possibility that these areas that have created habitat for lesser prairie-chickens could be lost.

Filling the gaps	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Detecting and predicting how populations respond to environmental variability are crucial challenges for their conservation. Knowledge about the abundance and distribution of the emperor penguin is far from complete despite recent information from satellites. When exploring the locations where emperor penguins breed, it is apparent that their distribution is circumpolar, but with a few gaps between known colonies. The purpose of this paper is therefore to identify those remaining areas where emperor penguins might possibly breed. Using the locations of emperor penguin breeding colonies, we calculated the separation distance between each pair of geographically adjacent colonies. Based on mean separation distances between colonies following a circumpolar distribution, and known foraging ranges, we suggest that there may yet be six undiscovered breeding locations with half of these in Eastern and the remainder in Western Antarctica. Productivity in these regions suggests that food resources are likely to sustain emperor penguin populations. Our analysis highlights a fundamental requirement, that in order to predict how species might respond to regional climate change, we must better understand their biogeography and the factors that lead to their occupation of particular sites. Regarding emperor penguins, remote sensing should target the identified gaps apparently devoid of penguins in order to update the total number of colonies, to re-evaluate both the regional and global population of emperor penguins, and to gain a better understanding of their biogeography.

Soil, water and forests are degraded, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Deforestation in recent years has led to changes in the environment and more of soil erosion and loss of potable water. In order to conserve and sustainably use soil and water, a watershed management approach is necessary. It helps in restoring water by increasing the infiltration and reducing the erosion of soil. Such measures should be propagated in rainfall deficit areas. The present study has attempted to study the upper watershed part of Subarnarekha basin in Jharkhand state of India. Remote sensing satellite data (Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS 2013) was used for delineation of the land use/land cover and vegetation index maps. Several thematic layers like slope, drainage and rainfall were integrated to achieve a priority area map using spatial multicriteria decision making. It delineated high medium and low priority areas within the watershed for soil and water conservation. The high priority area was 16.63% of the total study area. Further, the causes were analysed and conservation measures proposed.																	2471-2132						2017	3	3					375	395		10.3934/geosci.2017.3.375								WOS:000411805700004

Methods for assessing anthropogenic threats to freshwater ecosystems biodiversity	DNIPROPETROVSK UNIVERSITY BULLETIN SERIES-GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY												The industrial and agricultural activities of mankind, which includes chemical pollution, building of dams and hydroelectric power stations and their use of the biomass of freshwater ecosystems, have had considerable impacts on freshwater ecosystems, the abundance of aquatic species, and the vital capacity of those species' populations. A variety of aquatic organisms are feasible indicators and they can be used for evaluation water quality through analysis of their population diversity, composition and abundance. The most significant threats for freshwater biodiversity and the integrity of aquatic ecosystems are activities in the watershed's terrestrial realm, disturbances occurring in aquatic and riparian environments and threats that affect freshwater organisms. There are changes of functional structure of biological community due to reducing biodiversity and the dominance of opportunistic species. A lot of changes in characteristics of biological communities can be assessed by using different kinds of evaluations, including the index of biological integrity, saprobity system and geographic information system technology. An effective predictor of great number of disturbances to freshwater ecosystems is the density of human population. Approaches that directly evaluate the level of threat to freshwater biodiversity typically use species composition and abundance data. Methods that indirectly assess the biotic community evaluate the ecological integrity of aquatic ecosystems. For large-scale, resource-limited, time-constrained biodiversity conservation planning, the most appropriate method for assessing the impairment of freshwater systems is relativistic evaluation of biological integrity using geospatial data. For aquatic threat assessments, the most meaningful level of analysis is the drainage basin and its subbasins. The concept of ecoregions covers all freshwater ecosystems. This approach provides biologically meaningful units for further large-scale studies of existing and potential threats to biodiversity. The size of drainage basins can be defined from digital elevation models, which exist as global network in high quality resolution. At the level of drainage basin, using high-resolution remote sensing imagery is often feasible from a financial and workload perspective.																	2313-2159	2409-9864					2017	25	1					71	79		10.15421/111709								WOS:000410864700009

Various studies demonstrate that the implementation of green roof technology can moderate environmental problems, through the reduction of heat flux and solar reflectivity, the minimisation of buildings' energy consumption, the air pollution removal, the storm water runoff reduction, the air cooling and the effective management of the urban heat island effect. In this framework, the aim of this study is to assess the green roof potential and the quantification of its benefits over Thessaloniki, Greece's second largest city. In order to do so, very high spatial resolution satellite image and natural colour orthoimagery were used along with a geographical object-based image analysis approach. Carbon sequestration potential, rainwater retention and energy conservation were estimated based on coefficients adopted after a comprehensive literature review and actual dynamic energy simulations.

Through compilation of a database on CS and community-based monitoring (CBM, a subset of CS) programs, we assess where contributions from CS and CBM are significant and where opportunities for growth exist. We use the Essential Biodiversity Variable framework to describe the range of biodiversity data needed to track progress towards global biodiversity targets, and we assess strengths and gaps in geographical and taxonomic coverage. Our results show that existing CS and CBM data particularly provide large-scale data on species distribution and population abundance, species traits such as phenology, and ecosystem function variables such as primary and secondary productivity. Only birds, Lepidoptera and plants are monitored at scale. Most CS schemes are found in Europe, North America, South Africa, India, and Australia. We then explore what can be learned from successful CS/CBM programs that would facilitate the scaling up of current efforts, how existing strengths in data coverage can be better exploited, and the strategies that could maximise the synergies between CS/CBM and other approaches for monitoring biodiversity, in particular from remote sensing. More and better targeted funding will be needed, if CS/CBM programs are to contribute further to international biodiversity monitoring. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A revisit of NRCS-CN inspired models coupled with RS and GIS for runoff estimation	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												The Natural Resource Conservation Service - Curve Number (NRCS-CN) methodology is a widely used tool for estimating surface runoff, which is of prime importance in hydrological engineering, agricultural planning and management, environmental impact assessment, flood forecasting, and others fields. This article reviews the methodology and associated hydrological models used for runoff estimation along with their advantages and limitations. Furthermore, discussion focuses on the potential applications of Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques for estimating hydrological variables, such as rainfall, soil moisture and CN required for the NRCS-CN methodology, as well as future research and opportunities for improved runoff estimation at the macro scale.																	0262-6667	2150-3435					2017	62	12					1891	1930		10.1080/02626667.2017.1334166								WOS:000409185900001						
B	Yang, WH		Renzetti, S; Dupont, DP		Yang, Wanhong			Geomatics and Water Policy	WATER POLICY AND GOVERNANCE IN CANADA	Global Issues in Water Policy											Geomatics including remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) is the geospatial technology for gathering, management, analysis, and dissemination of spatially referenced information. Water policy is the governance framework including legislation/regulation, standard, planning and management of water resources. Water policy involves complex physical, biological, economic, social, and political processes, and manifests at location, subbasin, watershed, regional, national, and international scales. Water policy has an inherently spatial dimension which offers opportunities for Geomatics support. The applications of Geomatics for supporting water management and policy can be classified into three categories: Firstly, Geomatics supports acquisition, storage, management, visualization, and distribution of water and related datasets. Secondly, Geomatics supports spatial analysis of water resources including GIS and water modelling integration. Lastly, Geomatics supports decision making in water policy including the development of water related spatial decision support systems. While Geomatics has a great potential to support water management and policy in Canada, several strategic issues needs to be addressed. A Geomatics framework needs to be developed for water data gathering, analyzing and visualizing. Technology standards need to be developed for integrating Geomatics with water models. Particularly, Geomatics visualization technologies needs to be further developed to improve accessibility of water information for non-technical users.																			978-3-319-42806-2; 978-3-319-42805-5				2017	17						435	451		10.1007/978-3-319-42806-2_23	10.1007/978-3-319-42806-2							WOS:000402832000024

In recent years, various land use transformations in Bangkok influenced the city's ecological sustainability in all means, i.e., diminishing the city's cultivated land and greenery. This study investigates lack of green spaces due to extreme urban growth in the mega city. To do so, first, land use transitions are modelled through two different images; one from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper for the year 1994, and second from HJ-1A CCD for the year 2012. Next, the Multi-Layer Perceptron Markov Model (MLP-Markov) is applied to predict land use change for the year 2030. The MLP neural network is trained to model land use transitions through creating transition maps. Markov Chain predictive model is applied with sufficient accuracy to process the transition maps for the prediction process. The results indicate that 348km(2) of green areas are transformed into built-up areas for the period 1994-2012,witha considerable loss of greenery (42%). The MLP model predictions show 4% increase in built-up and 6% decrease in greenery for the period 2012-2030. The study highly recommends conservation of green spaces and green corridors in the city. Future research can include analysing green plot ratio for suitable green patches in vulnerable sites. The research output will benefit urban planners to implement long term planning strategies for securing natural environment in mega cities. (C) The Authors.

This study proposes a fast and easy-to-implement algorithm of object-oriented change detection based on iteratively reweighted multivariate statistical analysis with high-resolution remote sensing images and vector data, improving effects of normal multivariate alternative detection by combining object-oriented technology with probability density function of chi-square distribution. This method builds vectors in feature space with spectral, texture, and spatial structure information of objects segmented based on boundaries and categories of features in vector data. By feature optimization and iterative extension to multivariate statistical analysis for change detection, change regions can be extracted. Experiments on Zhaoshu Island area show that the proposed method is highly effective and accurate in detection of change regions.																	0149-0419	1521-060X					2017	40	2-3			SI		87	103		10.1080/01490419.2017.1304472								WOS:000404253100003

Hence, it is crucial to monitor LULC particularly adjacent to protected areas. In this study, we measured LULC change in Rombo, Tanzania, an area with high-potential agro-ecological zones that is dominated by human-elephant conflicts (HECs). We used remote sensing and geographical information system techniques, questionnaires and village meetings to assess spatio-temporal patterns of the LULC changes in the study area. Using Landsat imagery, digital elevation model (DEM) and ground truthing, we classified and monitored changes in LULC from the years 1987 to 2015. We found that within Rombo, settlements were increasing, while agricultural and agroforestry lands were decreasing and respondents' perceptions varied along the altitudinal gradient. Patterns of HEC and LULC were observed to change along the gradient and the later threatened the agricultural land and ecological integrity for elephant habitat, leading to high tension and competition between elephants and people. This research offers baseline information for land use planning to balance wildlife conservation with livelihood development in Rombo and highlights that managing the impacts of LULC changes on HEC and elephant habitat loss is a matter of urgency.																	1747-423X	1747-4248					2017	12	2-3					168	181		10.1080/1747423X.2017.1313324								WOS:000404057800005

Land use and land cover in a transitioning militarized landscape	JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE												The repurposing of military lands is common in many parts of the world and presents a variety of conservation opportunities. This study examines land cover at Big Oaks National Wildlife Refuge, Indiana (U.S.A.) as it transitioned from military proving ground to wildlife refuge from 1985 to 2013. We use remote sensing, semi-structured interviews, and a review of planning and management documents to examine this transition. Limited change in land cover composition and distribution are detected, despite changes in use and management. This landscape similarity relates to similarities in land management practices, and the impact of landscape history on current management practices. The findings suggest that military use and conservation objectives at this site yield similar land covers and are not necessarily in contrast to each other. As military base closures continue, the potential to maintain and expand conservation opportunities on these lands will likely grow in importance.																	1747-423X	1747-4248					2017	12	2-3					182	196		10.1080/1747423X.2017.1313325								WOS:000404057800006

Forests degradation and deforestation aggravate global warming, and the LU/LC information obtained from satellite data is now very essential for global environmental conservation and ecosystem. Especially the typical example of getting the accurate LU/LC information is the reducing emission from forest deforestation and degradation. The LU/LC information is valuable because it can be obtained on regular basis even ac ross the vast areas like natural forests. Different researchers used different methods and tools for LU/LC classification such as Parallelepiped, Minimum Distance, Binary Encoding, Spectral Angle Mapper, Spectral Information Divergence as supervised classifiers. All these methods used for different purposes and with different parameters. This research is formulated to evaluate the performance of the Artificial Neural Network & Support Vector Machine for Land Use and Land Cover (LUILC) classification using different parameters such as (Training Rate, Training Threshold Contribution, Training Momentum) in ANN and (Penalty Parameter, Pyramid Level) in SVM using ENVI 4.7. The Abbottabad test patch is used for LU/L C classification. Five classes Agriculture Land, Settlements, Water Bodies, Forest and Barren Land are used in this research. The ANN & SVM classifiers are applied to the Abbottabad test patch using different parameters and evaluate the best classifier according to their accu racy in confusion matrix. The ANN gives the overall accuracy of 99.35% and SVM gives the overall accuracy of 99.88%. From simulation it showed that SVM gives better result than ANN in terms of accuracy.																	2151-1403		978-1-4673-9073-6				2017							795	798										WOS:000403390300122

They represent one of the most admired plant families grown and are now the most valuable floriculture crop produced in Thailand and many other countries. Unfortunately, some rare orchids are among the most difficult plants for discovery and for finding proper places for species propagation. This problem greatly inhibits the conservation of rare orchids for future human generations. This research proposes a spatial information system for conserving three rare orchid species - Spathoglottis eburnea Gagnep., Pecteilis susannae (L.) Raf. and L. sutepensis Rolfe ex Downie. The 7-band remote sensing photos from Landsat-5 are used for the study data in this research. A genetic algorithm is applied for conservation model development. The model is evaluated by comparing with the orchid discovery points in the past. The experiment results show that the conservation model can predict the suitable locations where the three orchid species can be conserved with a similarity rate of 97%. Moreover, the model can predict other suitable locations where conservationists can discover these rare species and propagate them.																			978-1-5090-5210-3				2017							347	351										WOS:000403396200067

Severity mapping methods have been developed and tested for wildfire, but need further refinement for prescribed fire. We evaluated the accuracy of two severity mapping methods for a low-intensity, patchy prescribed fire in a south-eastern Australian eucalypt forest: (1) the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from RapidEye satellite imagery, and (2) PHOENIX RapidFire, a fire-spread simulation model. We used each method to generate a fire severity map (four-category: unburnt, low, moderate and severe), and then validated the maps against field-based data. We used error matrices and the Kappa statistic to assess mapping accuracy. Overall, the satellite-based map was more accurate (75%; Kappa +/- 95% confidence interval 0.54 +/- 0.06) than the modelled map (67%; Kappa 0.40 +/- 0.06). Both methods overestimated the area of unburnt forest; however, the satellite-based map better represented moderately burnt areas. Satellite- and model-based methods both provide viable approaches for mapping prescribed fire severity, but refinements could further improve map accuracy. Appropriate severity mapping methods are essential given the increasing use of prescribed fire as a forest management tool.

Challenges faced by shorebird species using the inland wetlands of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway: the little curlew example	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Asia is experiencing an alarming rate of inland wetlands loss, posing a risk to the future long-term survival of many species depending on these ecosystems. This review on the status and conservation of the little curlew (Numenius minutus) aims to draw attention to the conservation challenges faced by migratory shorebird species using the inland wetlands of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway (EAAF). Extensive and systematic research survey efforts along the EAAF have focused on species using coastal and tidal areas rather than on species using inland wetlands. Knowledge gaps include functional ecology and physiological responses to quality of food resources, population trends, migratory strategy and the role species play in supporting ecosystems resilience. Studies using remote sensing and geographic information system techniques to track the movements of birds along the flyway and to map habitat condition will prove essential in the future to allow a better understanding of the dynamics occurring at the stopover areas, how birds use resources and what competition pressures exist among species. Ultimately, these studies will contribute to our ability to predict changes and establish management practices for the long-term protection and conservation of the stopover areas for a suite of shorebird species using inland wetlands along the flyway.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2017	68	6					999	1009		10.1071/MF15240								WOS:000402414700001

Identification of ditches and furrows using remote sensing: application to sediment modelling in the Tana watershed, Kenya	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Ridge-tillage is an agricultural practice where crops are planted on elevated ridges, with furrows in-between. Ridge-tillage has been shown to significantly reduce erosion from croplands, but data on the presence of ridge-tillage is sparse and challenging to collect at the landscape scale. Thus, water quality models often do not account for ridge-tillage in a spatially-explicit manner, potentially overlooking the important impacts of this practice. We have developed a novel method that exploits the spectral, radiometric and linearity shape characteristics to identify both drainage ditches and ridge-tillage furrows using remote sensing of 0.5 m satellite data. We applied the method to the Sasumua watershed in Kenya, where we had false positives in only 3% of randomly selected polygons, and we detected the majority of ditches in 59% of randomly selected polygons. We then assessed the potential value of including these data in sediment modelling, showing that representing these practices could reduce sediment export in the study area by roughly 80%. Being able to readily identify the presence of ditches and furrows could enable the development of more accurate water quality models, and help identify priority areas for intervention to improve water quality (and possibly crop yields) through changing agricultural practices or policies.

J	Hackman, KO; Gong, P; Wang, J				Hackman, Kwame Oppong; Gong, Peng; Wang, Jie			New land-cover maps of Ghana for 2015 using Landsat 8 and three popular classifiers for biodiversity assessment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Remote-sensing products provide opportunities to monitor complex phenomena on the Earth from space for good decision-making. An example is land-cover maps, which are useful for monitoring both human-and naturally induced environmental changes to enhance environmental management for the benefit of the society. Yet there are numerous critical areas of the world such as biodiversity hotspots where the inaccessibility of quality satellite images has hindered progress in our understanding and management of the natural environment. The West African biodiversity hotspot is one such area where persistent thick clouds in freely available satellite images has been a great discouragement to the production of local land-cover maps to monitor the ongoing deforestation and rapid environmental change. Ghana is a country in West Africa where no land-cover map (except global ones) has been published for over a decade although large tracts of land have been converted from their natural states to agricultural land. In this article, we present 30 m land-cover maps of the country using Landsat 8 images and three popular classifiers Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and random forest (RF) - for the year 2015. We produced these maps for use in our future biodiversity assessment in the region. An overall accuracy (OA) of 85.5% (kappa = 0.77) was achieved for MLC, with similar but slightly lower accuracies for RF and SVM, which indicates that advanced classification algorithms may not have many advantages when applied to process only multispectral optical data. We observe that shrublands, crop-lands, and orchards are the dominant classes occupying 35.6%, 31.9%, and 18.4% of the country's land area, respectively. This further indicates that >50.0% of the country's land area is under agriculture. Thick forests occupy only 8.0% of the land and are almost entirely confined to forest reserves, highlighting the usefulness of these nature reserves. Our maps will provide input for research advancement, policy formulation, and environmental management at both national and subnational levels.

The aim of this paper is find the suitable method to simulate the runoff in arid area. The Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) is the most popular and widely applied model for direct runoff estimation. In this paper, we will focus on Wen-quan Basin in source regions of Boertala River. It is a typical valley of inland in Central Asia.

Both of them in calibration and validation periods Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency were 0.79, 0.71 and 0.66,038. And relative error were3%, 12% and 17%, 27%. It shows that the simulation accuracy should be further improved and using remote sensing information technology to improve the basic geographic data for the hydrological model has the following advantages: 1) Remote sensing data having a planar characteristic, comprehensive and representative. 2) To get around the bottleneck about lack of data, provide reference to simulation the runoff in similar basin conditions and data-lacking regions.																	1755-1307						2017	57								UNSP 012051	10.1088/1755-1315/57/1/012051								WOS:000400157500051

However, the data resolution, cost, and availability can be limiting. Optimal solution depends on the species characteristics, where the spectral and spatial resolution can compensate each other to some extent, and phenology plays an important role. Available high spatial resolution satellite data are sufficient for recognition of species that are distinct and either large or form uniform patches at size comparable to the data pixel size. For other species, higher spatial resolution is needed, and unmanned aircraft (UAV) provide data of extremely high spatial resolution (cm) at low cost and high flexibility. We assess its potential to map invasive black locust (BL, Robinia pseudoaccacia), testing imagery of different origin (satellite, UAV), spectral (multispectral, red, green, and blue (RGB) + near-infrared (NIR)) and spatial resolution, and various technical approaches to choose the best strategy for the species monitoring balancing between precision of detection and economic feasibility. Using purposely designed low-cost UAV with tailless fixed wing design for two consumer cameras (RGB and modified NIR) ensures robustness and repeatable field performance while maintaining high aerodynamic efficiency, with resulting mapping capacity over 10 km(2) per day. Several challenges exist in UAV application, such as lower spectral resolution, geometrical and radiometric distortions, and significant amount of data (necessity of automatic processing). In our study, we tested different options of UAV data processing and present comparison of resulting orthomosaic accuracies. For repeated measurements, it is extremely important to ensure spatial co-registration of pixels/objects from different phenological phases. Investment in GPS receiver in the UAV and GPS post-processing eliminated laborious collection of ground control points, while maintaining the co-registration of objects across multiple flights. In our study we provide evidence of benefit of the low cost unmanned system for species monitoring with high classification accuracies of target species from UAV orthomosaic outcompeting WorldView-2 satellite data, and describe methodology that can be used for practical management of invasions.

An improved ecosystem service value calculation model was proposed based on empirical parameters. Using Yancheng Nature Reserve in China as an example, we employed remote sensing data to conduct an empirical analysis of the changes in the spatiotemporal pattern, ecological vulnerability, and ecosystem services of typical landscape types over the period from 1987 to 2013. The statistical results derived from landscape pattern indices (LPIs) showed that during the investigation period, three natural wetland landscape types (i.e., Spartina alterniflora, Suaeda glauca, and Phragmites australis) showed gradually increased fragmentation in the study area. The ecological vulnerability scores of the major landscape types (in descending order) were P. australis (0.053), farmland (0.047), S. alterniflora (0.042), S. glauca (0.031), and bare mud flat (0.002). The results derived from the ecosystem service value fluctuation index (ESVFI) showed that from 1987 to 1997, the value of the ecosystem services provided by S. glauca and P. australis wetlands decreased, whereas that of S. alterniflora wetlands increased continuously. From 2002 to 2013, the value of the ecosystem services provided by all three types of natural wetland showed a downward trend. In conclusion, the combined effects of human and natural factors, including the expansion of farmland and the invasion of S. alterniflora, and changes in seawater erosion and deposition led to changes in the landscape patterns, ecological vulnerability, and ecosystem services of the Yancheng Nature Reserve during the investigation period. The results indicate that a "dual adaptive" management system based on natural succession and supplemented by appropriate manual intervention should be implemented, and the management efficiency and flexibility should be improved to meet the common needs of biodiversity conservation and economic development.

The hydrologic soil group (HSG), land use/cover, hydrologic surface condition and antecedent moisture condition jointly determine the CN value. This study aims to update the previous global CN map using the recently available geospatial remote sensing data. Based on the conventional United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and National Engineering Handbook Section 4 (NEH-4) standard lookup tables, the newly derived CN map utilizes the latest Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover and the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) soil data to investigate the current flood potential of the global land surface. The results show that the new CN map outperforms the previous one in detecting China's flood event locations with an improvement in the ratio of the averaged CN value for flood events to the averaged CN value for the whole land area of China. The new CN map reveals the effects of land surface change on hydrological conditions in the 2000s. Based on the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) data and the gaugecombined Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) product, global surface runoff (April 2015-March 2016, 0.1 degrees x0.1 degrees) is estimated with the new CN map. The currently derived global CN dataset can be used in multi-scale hydrological applications, such as rainfall-runoff modeling and flood hazard risk assessment across continents.

These forests are developed along two streams seated in adjacent basins, which flow into the Ecuadorian Pacific between Jaramijo and San Clemente. The results show that in the lower reach of the Portoviejo River, riparian forests had low rates of coverage in the years 1998, 2002, 2009, 2011 and 2013, while in the Chilan ravine, the rates of coverage increased significantly from 1998 to 2014, covering both riverbanks all the way. The growing agricultural and livestock developments are the main reasons why much of the riverine forest on the banks of Portoviejo River has disappeared. In contrast, in the Chil n ravine, there is no ongoing economic activity that may lead to spatial occupation and replacement of the forest. Based on the results found and the ecological importance of these natural areas, strategies for the conservation of riparian forests in the Chil n ravine are discussed and proposed, as well as strategies to restore areas of riparian forests throughout the Portoviejo River that have been replaced by crops and pastures. Among the proposals for restorative efforts, actions aimed at recovering its original trajectory are included, taking as reference small patches of vegetation of the same type that still remain in the study area.																	0188-4999						2017	33	1					21	35										WOS:000396528700002						
J	Salih, AAM; Hamid, AA				Salih, Abdelrahim A. M.; Hamid, Amna Ahmed			Hydrological studies in the White Nile State in Sudan	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES												The present study was aimed to study the hydrological system in the arid areas of White Nile State, Sudan using remote sensing and GIS tools. Information on topography and soils had been extracted using ASTR, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), with 90 m horizontal resolution and Sudan General Soil Map with scale 1: 25,000 using digitized method to form the GIS database. Land use/cover information was derived from remotely sensed data of Land sat Thematic Mapper of the year 2014. The vegetation cover was estimated using the normalized different vegetation index (NDVI). One sub-basin was delineated using a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and the total acreage in different slope classes was estimated. These maps were used as input variables to derive a modified Soil Conservation Service (SCS) runoff curve number. The SCS runoff curve number model was applied to estimate the runoff depth for individual storm as (return period) event and summed up to derive the annual runoff potential for the sub-basin. All morphometric and hydrological characteristics for the elected sub-basin were extracted and illustrated and given in different tables, which include the stream numbers, the shape factor of the basin, the slope condition of the basin, the streams lengths, and the basin area and so on. The total surface water (runoff) in depth and volume potential for harvesting is 1.507 mm (depth) and 309,078.09 vol m(3). The results demonstrate the capability of GIS and its application for water harvesting planning over larger semiarid areas. (C) 2017 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

Genetic Description and Remote Sensing Techniques as Management Tools for Zostera noltii Seagrass Populations along the Atlantic Moroccan Coast	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Seagrass meadows provide an essential ecological service in coastal ecosystems worldwide, although they are sensitive to many human factors, as a serious global regression has been documented. During sampling along the Atlantic Moroccan coast, five coastal lagoons were found characterized by the presence of intertidal monospecific seagrass Zostera noltii meadows (from south to north, Nayla, Oualidia, Sidi Moussa, Moulay Bousselham, and Larache). Two descriptive methods used to characterize Z. noltii populations could be used as management tools for future monitoring implementations: (1) the estimation of surface area covered by Z. noltii meadows using remote sensing techniques and in situ field surveys, and (2) the genetic characterisation of Z. noltii populations using simple sequence repeats (microsatellites) as molecular markers. Results revealed that the Nayla lagoon showed the largest area covered by Z. noltii (26,9,868 m(2)) and the highest coverage rate (5.19%), while presenting the lowest genetic/genotypic diversity values (T = 36, (A) over cap =3.58, G=50; R=0.544; H-e=0.43). On the other hand, northern populations displayed lower rates of seagrass coverage (similar to 1%) and higher values of genetic/genotypic diversity. Further genetic characterization also revealed that Z. noltii populations seem to be highly isolated in three geographically independent regions: northern Morocco (R1, Larache and Moulay Bousselham), central Morocco (R2, Oualidia and Sidi Moussa), and southern Morocco (R3, Nayla), which should be considered independent management units. Both seagrass coverage rate and the genetic description of seagrass populations along the Atlantic Moroccan coast seem to be useful management tools that could be used to evaluate changes in seagrass meadows over time to further establish appropriate conservation strategies.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JAN	2017	33	1					78	87		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-15-00111.1								WOS:000394926100006						
J	Chen, H; Oguchi, T; Wu, P				Chen Hao; Oguchi, Takashi; Wu Pan			Assessment for soil loss by using a scheme of alterative sub-models based on the RUSLE in a Karst Basin of Southwest China	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE												Accurate assessment of soil loss caused by rainfall is essential for natural and agricultural resources management. Soil erosion directly affects the environment and human sustainability. In this work, the empirical and contemporary model of revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) was applied for simulating the soil erosion rate in a karst catchment using remote sensing data and geographical information systems. A scheme of alterative"sub-models was adopted to calculate the rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodibility (K), slope length and steepness (LS), cover management (C) and conservation practice (P) factors in the geographic information system (GIS) environment. A map showing the potential of soil erosion rate was produced by the RUSLE and it indicated the severe soil erosion in the study area. Six classes of erosion rate are distinguished from the map: 1) minimal, 2) low, 3) medium, 4) high, 5) very high, and 6) extremely high. The RUSLE gave a mean annual erosion rate of 30.24 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) from the 1980s to 2000s. The mean annual erosion rate obtained using RUSLE is consistent with the result of previous research based on in situ measurement from 1980 to 2009. The high performance of the RUSLE model indicates the reliability of the sub-models and possibility of applying the RUSLE on quantitative estimation. The result of the RUSLE model is sensitive to the slope steepness, slope length, vegetation factors and digital elevation model (DEM) resolution. The study suggests that attention should be given to the topographic factors and DEM resolution when applying the RUSLE on quantitative estimation of soil loss.																	2095-3119						2017	16	2					377	388		10.1016/S2095-3119(16)61507-1								WOS:000394482800013

In the Chilean hotspot, different studies have attempted to understand variations of LULC change. Nevertheless, a broader understanding of common patterns and variability of LULC over the entire range of the hotspot is lacking. We performed a complete review of the different studies reporting LULC changes and performed a joint analysis of their results using an integrated comprehensive approach. We related the variation of LULC change to latitude, time period and vascular plant richness using generalized linear models. Overall, there were nine studies, which covered 36.5 % of the study area, and reported the loss of 19 % of native forest (782,120 ha) between 1973 and 2011. The highest net forest loss was observed in the 1970-1990 period. This decreased in the 1990-2000 period and rose again in the 2000-2010 period. This result reveals a continuous forest loss in the last 40 years. Conversion of native forest to shrublands is the most important contributor to net native forest loss, accounting for 45 % of the loss. However, in the area of greatest species richness native forests are mainly converted to exotic tree plantations. Chilean forestry model has proved successful in expanding exotic tree plantation, but so far it has not been compatible with native forest conservation and restoration. It is imperative to design a new forestry policy to assure the conservation of one of the most unique biodiversity hotspots worldwide.

In this study, regional forest policy scenarios were compared in terms of predicted habitats suitable for the Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans). To derive both patch- and landscape-scale models to predict species presence in a forest stand, species occurrence data from a systematic field survey covering the whole distribution area of the flying squirrel in Finland and Multi-Source National Forest Inventory data were combined. Then, the Finnish forestry model MELA and the derived occupancy models were applied to predict the quantity of suitable habitats for flying squirrels in three different 50-year policy scenarios. The results confirm that increasing the utilization of felling potential from the level of business-as-usual to the level stated as policy targets in regional forest programs decreases the amount of suitable habitat in the future. However, regional forest programs had a less drastic impact on habitats than maximum sustainable removal, except in two regions. It should be noted that the occupancy models seemed to fail on sites that experts deem to be most suitable for the species. Obviously, there are other factors than forest management affecting presence.																	0282-7581	1651-1891					2017	32	2					185	195		10.1080/02827581.2016.1221991								WOS:000394662600010

Moving beyond the concept of "primary forest" as a metric of forest environment quality	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has been reporting country-level area in primary forests in its Global Forest Resource Assessment since 2005. The FAO definition of a primary forest (naturally regenerated forest of native species where there are no clearly visible indications of human activities and the ecological processes are not significantly disturbed) is generally accepted as authoritative and is being used in policy making. However, problems with this definition undermine our capacity to obtain globally coherent estimates. In addition, the current reporting on primary forests fails to consider the complementarily of non-primary forests toward the maintenance of ecosystem services. These issues undermine the appropriate tracking of changes in primary and non-primary forests, and the assessment of impacts of such changes on ecosystem services. We present the case for an operational reconsideration of the primary forest concept and discuss how alternatives or supplements might be developed.

Tracy			Landscape-scale GPP and carbon density inform patterns and impacts of an invasive tree across wet forests of Hawaii	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Plant invasion typically occurs within a landscape-scale framework of abiotic and biotic conditions, often resulting in emergent feedbacks among environment, ecosystem functions, and the dominance of invasive species. Understanding the mechanisms underlying successful invasions is an important component of conservation and management efforts, but this has been poorly investigated in a spatially explicit manner. Knowing where and why invasion patterns change throughout the landscape enables managers to use context-specific controls on the spread of invasive species. Using high-resolution airborne imaging spectroscopy, we studied plant performance in growth within and across landscapes to examine the dominance and spatial distribution of an invasive tree, Psidium cattleianum (strawberry guava), in heterogeneous environmental conditions of a submontane Hawaiian tropical forest. We assessed invader performance using the GPP ratio index, which is the relative difference in remotely sensed estimates of gross primary productivity between canopies of guava and canopies of the invaded plant community. In addition, we used airborne LiDAR data to evaluate the impacts of guava invasion on the forest aboveground carbon density in different environments. Structural equation modeling revealed that substrate type and elevation above sea level interact and amplify landscape-scale differences in productivity between the invasive species and the host plant community (GPP ratio); differences that ultimately control levels of dominance of guava. We found shifts in patterns of forest carbon storage based on both gradual increase of invader dominance and changes in environmental conditions. Overall, our results demonstrate that the remotely sensed index defined as the GPP ratio provided an innovative spatially explicit approach to track and predict the success of invasive plants based in their canopy productivity, particularly within a landscape-scale framework of varying environmental factors such as soils and elevation. This approach may help managers accurately predict where invaders of forests, scrublands, or grasslands are likely to exhibit high levels of dominance before the environment is fully invaded.

Assessment of Changes in Soil Erosion Risk Using RUSLE in Navrood Watershed, Iran	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Risk assessment of soil erosion, one of the most important land degradation problems worldwide, is very essential for land and water resources management, and development of soil conservation methods. In the present study, the temporal changes of soil erosion risk were assessed from 1987 to 2010, based on the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for the Navrood Watershed, Iran, with an area of 270 km(2). Two Landsat satellite imageries obtained in 1987 and 2010 were used to assess the changes in vegetation cover during this period, and to obtain the Cover factor (C) of RUSLE. Rainfall and soil texture data and a digital elevation model were used to calculate the rest of RUSLE factors, which were taken as constant for the study period. The results showed that the average annual soil loss over the watershed ranged from 0 to 1,056 t ha(-1) y(-1) (Cumulative percentage > 99.9%). The area mapped as very high erosion risk (> 100 t ha(-1) y(-1)) increased from 10% in 1987 to 12% in 2010, and the area of the next risk class (51-100 t ha(-1) y(-1)) increased from 8 to 9%. These changes cover an area of about 800 ha in the watershed, in which erosion risk has been doubled or tripled in the last 23 years. Forest clearing and rangeland overgrazing were identified as the most important reasons for the increase in erosion risk.																	1680-7073					JAN-FEB	2017	19	1					231	244										WOS:000396005400019						
J	Fava, F; Colombo, R				Fava, Francesco; Colombo, Roberto			Remote Sensing-Based Assessment of the 2005-2011 Bamboo Reproductive Event in the Arakan Mountain Range and Its Relation with Wildfires	REMOTE SENSING												Pulse ecological events have major impacts on regional and global biogeochemical cycles, potentially inducing a vast set of cascading ecological effects. This study analyzes the widespread reproductive event of bamboo (Melocanna baccifera) that occurred in the Arakan Mountains (Southeast Asia) from 2005 to 2011, and investigates the possible relationship between massive fuel loading due to bamboo synchronous mortality over large areas and wildfire regime. Multiple remote sensing data products are used to map the areal extent of the bamboo-dominated forest. MODIS NDVI time series are then analyzed to detect the spatiotemporal patterns of the reproductive event. Finally, MODIS Active Fire and Burned Area Products are used to investigate the distribution and extension of wildfires before and after the reproductive event. Bamboo dominates about 62,000 km(2) of forest in Arakan. Over 65% of the region shows evidence of synchronous bamboo flowering, fruiting, and mortality over large areas, with wave-like spatiotemporal dynamics. A significant change in the regime of wildfires is observed, with total burned area doubling in the bamboo-dominated forest area and reaching almost 16,000 km(2). Wildfires also severely affect the remnant patches of the evergreen forest adjacent to the bamboo forest. These results demonstrate a clear interconnection between the 2005-2011 bamboo reproductive event and the wildfires spreading in the region, with potential relevant socio-economic and environmental impacts.																	2072-4292					JAN	2017	9	1							85	10.3390/rs9010085								WOS:000395492600084

Studies have shown that the dynamics of canopy structure are related to available water, climate, and human activities in the form of porosity, leaf area index (LAI), and clumping index (CI). Therefore, it is important to identify the biophysical parameters of savanna ecosystems, and undertake practical actions for savanna conservation and management. The canopy openness presents a challenge for evaluating canopy LAI and other biophysical parameters, as most remotely sensed methods were developed for homogeneous and closed canopies. Clumping index is a key variable that can represent the clumping effect from spatial distribution patterns of components within a canopy. However, it is a difficult task to measure the clumping index of the moderate resolution savanna pixels directly using optical instruments, such as the Tracing Radiation and Architecture of Canopies, LAI-2000 Canopy Analyzer, or digital hemispherical photography. This paper proposed a new method using hemispherical photographs combined with high resolution remote sensing images to estimate the clumping index of savanna canopies. The effects of single tree LAI, crown density, and herbaceous layer on the clumping index of savanna pixels were also evaluated. The proposed method effectively calculated the clumping index of moderate resolution pixels. The clumping indices of two study regions located in Ejina Banner and Weichang were compared with the clumping index product over China's landmass.					peng, jingjing/0000-0001-6512-2066												2072-4292					JAN	2017	9	1							52	10.3390/rs9010052								WOS:000395492600052

Development of spatial database on intact forest landscapes of India	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												There is an increased interest in identifying the status of biodiversity in different spatial and temporal scales. The objective of the current research is to prepare a consistent spatial database of intact forest landscapes of India. The intact forest landscapes are located in the Himalayas, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Western Ghats and Sunderbans. At national level 237 forest landscapes and 5.4% of the total natural forest remained as intact in India. Current intact forest landscapes of India consists of blocks larger than 10 km(2) covering an area of 34,061 km(2). Of the total area under intact forest landscapes, Eastern Himalayas represent 76.7% of the area, followed by Western Himalayas (8.8%), Andaman & Nicobar Islands (6.2%) and Western Ghats (5.7%). The largest intact forest landscape block occupies an area of 3342.9 km(2) (9.8%) is found in western Arunachal Pradesh. Temperate forest zone represents the highest intactness (56.6%), followed by subtropical zone (19.2%), tropical zone (18.6%) and alpine zone (5.6%). Himalayan moist temperate forests represent the highest area (39.1%) of intact forest landscapes followed by subtropical broad-leaved hill forests, wet evergreen forests, and montane wet temperate forests. It is estimated that 4.4% of the area of intact forest landscapes fall inside the existing 47 protected areas. The results of the analysis best suited as input for the process of identification of new protected areas. The study recommends fine-scale mapping of biodiversity within the intact forest landscapes and to prepare efficient conservation plans. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Human encroachment, including land reclamation, drainage, and introduction of invasive species, has direct negative effects on wetlands, mainly through changes in hydrology and vegetation. Additionally, accelerated sea level rise (SLR) can result in flooding of wetlands in low-lying coastal zones. In this study, we present a rapid risk assessment method for coastal wetland loss and degradation. The main stress factors, i.e., urban sprawl, agriculture, coastal erosion, and SLR, have been examined and quantified through remote sensing and geographic information system spatial analysis. A weighted factor-based linear model has been used to evaluate the spatial risk levels of wetland loss. The proposed methodology is applied to the low-lying coastal wetlands of Hangzhou Bay in Shanghai, China. The results show that the regions closer to the sea have relatively higher risk levels on the landward side of the coastline, but relatively low risk levels on the seaward side of the coastline. This work emphasizes the need to sustainably use and protect wetlands in order to reduce disaster risks and contribute to the improvement of human well-being.																	1080-7039	1549-7860					2017	23	1					82	97		10.1080/10807039.2016.1223536								WOS:000393700200007						
J	Wei, CZ; Taubenbock, H; Blaschke, T				Wei, Chunzhu; Taubenboeck, Hannes; Blaschke, Thomas			Measuring urban agglomeration using a city-scale dasymetric population map: A study in the Pearl River Delta, China	HABITAT INTERNATIONAL												The rates of urbanization and increase in urban sprawl that have occurred in China over the past thirty years have been unprecedented. This article presents a new city-scale dasymetric modelling approach that incorporates historical census data for 28 cities in the Pearl River Delta area of southern China. It combines Landsat imagery (from 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015) with a 'limiting variable' estimation algorithm to generate a gridded estimate of population density. These gridded population patches are organized as a city-network to reveal the influence of urban agglomeration on population spreading processes. We then combine population patches and graph-based connectivity metrics to describe the spatial-temporal evolution of each city within the urban agglomeration. Our population disaggregation results yield accuracy improvements of 40%-60% over three traditional population disaggregation methods, to reflect the population distribution characteristics more explicitly and in greater detail. The probability of connectivity metrics from dasymetric population maps in Pearl River Delta (1) outline the role of urban agglomeration in population spread, (2) simulate the evolution of 'polycentric' urban agglomeration, and (3) outline the individual components of the polycentric megaregion. Our outlined approach is a transferable and an improved means of producing city-scale dasymetric population maps. Our case study provides practical guidance on wide applications of the medium resolution remote sensing data in delineating, measuring, and quantifying the evolution of urban agglomeration across different jurisdictional boundaries and time periods.

Tiger re-establishment potential to former Caspian tiger (Panthera tigris virgata) range in Central Asia	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Caspian tigers (Panthera tigris virgata), a now extinct subspecies genetically similar to the Amur tiger (P. t. altaica), Occurred until the mid-1900s from modem day Turkey and Iran east through Central Asia into northwest China. A literature analysis we conducted revealed that Caspian tigers occupied ca. 800,000-900,000 km(2) historically, mostly within isolated patches of tugay- and reed-dominated riparian ecosystems at densities up to 2-3 tigers/100 km(2). Herein we explored options to restore tigers to Central Asia using Amur tiger as an "analog" form. Spatial analyses based on remote sensing data indicated that options for Amur tiger introduction are limited in Central Asia but at least two habitat patches remain potentially suitable for tiger re-establishment, both in Kazakhstan, with a total area of <20,000 km(2). The most promising site the Ili river delta and adjacent southern coast of Balkhash Lake hosts ca. 7000 km(2) of suitable habitat that our tiger-prey population models suggest could support a population of 64-98 tigers within 50 years if 40-55 tigers are translocated and current Ili river flow regimes are maintained. Re-establishment of tigers in Central Asia may yet be tenable if concerns of local communities in the Ili-Balkhash region are carefully addressed, prey population restoration precedes tiger introduction, Ili river water supplies remain stable, and the Amur tiger's phenotype proves adaptable to the arid conditions of the introduction site.

However, the quantificational evaluation of the reforestation program in China is still incomplete, especially in the southwest China, due to the limitation of survey data. In order to assess the effects of reforestation on soil erosion in southwest China, a subtropical monsoon region with acid red soil, a representative watershed (Dianchi, Yunnan, in southwest China), was selected to study the effect of reforestation on soil erosion over nearly five decades. The land surface soil samples and sedimentary core in this watershed were examined in 2012 to evaluate the soil erosion and sediment deposition during the period of deforestation and reforestation. The results from the multi-source indexes (nutrients, radionuclides, metallic and isotope elements) measurement from soil samples and analyses (composite fingerprinting, remote sensing and geographic information system) indicate that reforestation significantly reduced the presence of sand from surrounding basin via the sedimentary records. Natural forests had the greatest soil conservation capacity, followed by economic forests and farmland, according to a composite fingerprinting. The distribution of total phosphorus, total nitrogen (TN), total organic carbon (TOC) and isotope carbon (delta C-13(SOC)) presents a high consistency to the results of the composite fingerprinting. The loss rate of TN and TOC in farmland is much greater than that in forest. Reforestation will thus increase the storage of TN and TOC in the long term, although this storage is lower than that in farmland during a short time due to the application of fertilizers. The logging of economic forests will significantly increase soil erosion in this region because of low grass coverage. Recommendations include limiting the period of logging in economic forests to periods outside the rainy season and intercropping other kinds of indigenous trees or grasses to reduce soil erosion.

Mapping Tree Canopy Cover in Support of Proactive Prairie Grouse Conservation in Western North America	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Invasive woody plant expansion is a primary threat driving fragmentation and loss of sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) and prairie habitats across the central and western United States. Expansion of native woody plants, including conifer (primarily Juniperus spp.) and mesquite (Prosopis spp.), over the past century is primarily attributable to wildfire suppression, historic periods of intensive livestock grazing, and changes in climate. To guide successful conservation programs aimed at reducing top-down stressors, we mapped invasive woody plants at regional scales to evaluate landscape level impacts, target restoration actions, and monitor restoration outcomes. Our overarching goal was to produce seamless regional products across sociopolitical boundaries with resolution fine enough to depict the spatial extent and degree of woody plant invasion relevant to greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) and lesser prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) conservation efforts. We mapped tree canopy cover at 1-m spatial resolution across an 11-state region (508 265 km(2)). Greater than 90% of occupied lesser prairie-chicken habitat was largely treeless for conifers (<1% canopy cover), whereas > 67% was treeless for mesquite. Conifers in the higher canopy cover classes (16-50% and >50% canopy cover) were scarce (<2% and 1% canopy cover), as was mesquite (<5% and 1% canopy cover). Occupied habitat by sage-grouse was more variable but also had a relatively large proportion of treeless areas ((x) over bar = 71, SE = 5%). Low to moderate levels of conifer cover (1-20%) were fewer ((x) over bar = 23, SE = 5%) as were areas in the highest cover class (>50%; (x) over bar = 6, SE = 2%). Mapping indicated that a high proportion of invading woody plants are at a low to intermediate level. Canopy cover maps for conifer and mesquite resulting from this study provide the first and most geographically complete, high-resolution assessment of woody plant cover as a top-down threat to western sage-steppe and prairie ecosystems.

However, they require the availability of spatially diffuse environmental predictors of abundance, which may be challenging, especially in complex and heterogeneous habitats. This is particularly the case for tropical mammals, such as nonhuman primates, that depend on multi-layered and species-rich tree canopy coverage, which is usually measured through a limited sample of ground plots. We developed an approach that calibrates remote-sensing imagery to ground measurements of tree density to derive basal area, in turn used as a predictor of primate density based on published models. We applied generalized linear models (GLM) to relate 9.8-ha ground samples of tree basal area to various metrics extracted from Landsat 8 imagery. We tested the potential of this approach for spatial inference of animal density by comparing the density predictions for an endangered colobus monkey, to previous estimates from field transect counts, measured basal area, and other predictors of abundance. The best GLM had high accuracy and showed no significant difference between predicted and observed values of basal area. Our species distribution model yielded predicted primate densities that matched those based on field measurements. Results show the potential of using open-access and global remote-sensing data to derive an important predictor of-animal abundance in tropical forests and in turn to make spatially explicit inference on animal density. This approach has important, inherent applications as it greatly magnifies the relevance of abundance modeling for informing conservation. This is especially true for threatened species living in heterogeneous habitats where spatial patterns of abundance, in relation to habitat and/or human disturbance factors, are often complex and, management decisions, such as improving forest protection, may need to be focused on priority areas.

J	Johnston, AN; Moskal, LM				Johnston, Aaron N.; Moskal, L. Monika			High-resolution habitat modeling with airborne LiDAR for red tree voles	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Habitat suitability maps are important tools for conservation planning and species investigations, but maps at resolutions that are biologically meaningful and useful for local-level decision-making are lacking for many species that use resources at fine scales. Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) describes 3-dimensional structure of forests and other habitats at high resolution, which can improve habitat models for many species and facilitate investigations otherwise impossible with field data or other remote-sensing techniques. We used an information-theoretic approach and logistic regression to model habitat of red tree voles (Arborimus longicaudus) at multiple spatial scales with predictors derived from airborne LiDAR in southwestern Oregon. We developed a priori models to evaluate habitat associations and identify good models useful for high-resolution mapping of habitat suitability across a large spatial extent. Our best models that compared habitats around nest trees of red tree voles to available sites performed well (i.e., accuracy=0.83) on an independent test data set. We found fair performance in comparisons of habitat around nest trees to unused locations within areas previously identified as red tree vole habitat (i.e., accuracy=0.71). Red tree vole nests were often in the largest trees in the stand and away from forest edges. Both analyses suggested that fine- and broad-scale predictors are important for modeling habitat of red tree voles. Habitat suitability for red tree voles should be predicted effectively by LiDAR acquisitions even with low point densities because maps were robust to reductions in point densities as low as 1point/m(2). We found that LiDAR was effective for modeling habitat of red tree voles and expect it to improve performance of models for other species with similar habitat requirements.

Aboveground biomass of naturally regenerated and replanted semi-tropical shrublands derived from aerial imagery	LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Rapid assessment of plant size and population densities is important for estimating biomass over large areas, but it has often been limited by methods requiring intensive labor and resources. In this study, we demonstrate how shrub biomass can be estimated from fine-grained aerial photographs for a large area (23,000 ha) located in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, Texas, USA. Over the past 30 years, refuge land management has included the replanting of native shrubs to promote the restoration of wildlife habitat and carbon sequestration. To assess shrub regrowth, we developed a method to estimate individual shrub canopy areas from digital aerial imagery that was used to calculate biomass from allometric equations. The accuracy of the automated delineation of individual canopies was 79 % when compared to that of hand-digitized shrub canopies. When applied to photographs across the refuge, we found higher shrub densities for older naturally regenerated sites (174 individuals ha(-1)) compared to those of younger replanted sites (156 individuals ha(-1)). In contrast, naturally regenerated sites had less biomass (3.43 Mg ha(-1)) than replanted sites (4.78 Mg ha(-1)) indicating that shrubland restored for habitat conservation has the potential to sequester more carbon in a shorter period. There was an inverse relationship between aridity and aboveground shrub biomass for replanted sites in the drier west (p < 0.05). We found a difference in predicted biomass among shrub species in replanted sites that was also associated with climate (p < 0.05). We conclude that the canopy of individual shrubs detected from remote sensing can be used to estimate and monitor vegetation biomass over large areas across environmental gradients.																	1860-1871	1860-188X				JAN	2017	13	1					145	156		10.1007/s11355-016-0310-x								WOS:000391940700013						
J	Rose, CB				Rose, C. Brian			Fieldwork at Phrygian Gordion, 2013-2015	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY												This article presents the results of new excavation, remote sensing, and conservation activities at the Phrygian capital of Gordion in central Turkey. The most important discoveries were of Iron Age date and relate to Gordion's fortification system and city plan. Fieldwork focused on the southern side of the Citadel Mound, where excavation yielded a large Early Phrygian (ninth century B.C.E.) glacis or stepped terrace wall more than 2.5 m in height that supported a substantial fortification wall nearly 3 m wide. New fortifications dating to the Middle Phrygian (eighth century B.C.E.) and Late Phrygian (sixth century B.C.E.) periods were also uncovered in the same area, as was a new gateway leading into the citadel. A sondage beneath the Early Phrygian "Terrace Building Complex," or industrial quarter, produced traces of occupation during the Early Bronze Age, as well as evidence for the construction of an enormous terrace during the ninth century B.C.E. A new campaign of remote sensing clarified the street plan in Gordion's two residential districts (the "Lower Town" and "Outer Town"), in addition to revealing the presence of fortification walls, defensive ditches, and a large fort on the western side of the Outer Town. Conservation activities focused on the Terrace Building, the ninth-century B.C.E. pebble mosaic floor from Megaron 2, and the Early Phrygian Gate Complex, still the best-preserved citadel gate in Iron Age Asia Minor.(1)																	0002-9114	1939-828X				JAN	2017	121	1					135	178		10.3764/aja.121.1.0135								WOS:000390980100007

This study aimed to identify and quantify the human threats on the Shuangtai Estuary Ramsar site (SERS) by means of detecting wetland landscape changes using Landsat images from 1988 to 2014. Land-cover changes induced by agricultural reclamation, urban expansion, petroleum industry, aquaculture, and the increases in transportation land were identified using an object-oriented classification method and a decision tree. Human-triggered wetland conversions and landscape metrics-characterized wetland changes were documented in order to assess the protection effectiveness after this wetland was listed as a national nature reserve (1988) and a Ramsar site with international importance (2005). Results indicate that wetlands area at this Ramsar site decreased from 127,526 ha in 1988-117,805 ha in 2005, 113,705 ha in 2014 at an annual averaged loss rate of 531.6 +/- 72 ha/yr. The only two vegetated wetland types, Phragmites australis and Suaeda heteroptera, have lost 4788 ha and 12,856 ha, respectively. Aquaculture ponds increased by 9715 ha, and almost all were transformed from natural wetlands. The landscape metrics used in this study show notable fragmentation trend of wetland as a result of the expansion of transportation lands. Multiple human activities occupied large areas of various wetland types. Compared to agricultural reclamation and urbanization, wetland changes at the study site were affected primarily by the development of aquaculture and petroleum industry. Obvious wetland loss and fragmentation determined by the analysis of Landsat images suggests that the protection effect has been relatively low in spite of the fact that the SERS is a national natural reserve and Ramsar site. As an internationally critical rest habitat for migration waterfowl, ecological degradation of the SERS and severe human threats create great challenges for ecosystem managements. This study also indicates that the protection effectiveness of other costal wetland should also be assessed using remote sensing to objectively track the conservation or restoration of these areas.

The aim of this study is to use contemporary technologies such as EO and GIS in synergy with fragmentation analysis, to quantify the changes in the landscape of the Rajaji National Park (RNP) during the period of 19years (1990-2009). Several statistics such as principal component analysis (PCA) and spatial metrics are used to understand the results. PCA analysis has produced two principal components (PC) and explained 84.1% of the total variance, first component (PC1) accounted for the 57.8% of the total variance while the second component (PC2) has accounted for the 26.3% of the total variance calculated from the core area metrics, distance metrics and shape metrics. Our results suggested that notable changes happened in the RNP landscape, evidencing the requirement of taking appropriate measures to conserve this natural ecosystem.

We collected ground-level hyperspectral data of six exotic invasive plant species in abandoned agricultural fields at the Blandy Experimental Farm in northern Virginia to determine the degree to which species could be identified using visible and near-infrared wavelengths. The spectral profile from 350 to 1025 nm was used in support vector machine analysis to determine separability of these species. We used sensitivity analyses to determine which spectral regions were most influential to identifying species by removing 50 nm regions and comparing species identification to that using the full spectral profile. Ailanthus altissima, Carduus acanthoides, and Cirsium arvense had high ability to be identified (75%, 87.5%, and 75%, respectively). Galium verum had low ability to be identified (44.4%), perhaps due to high spectral contamination from soil. Celastrus orbiculatus and Rhamnus davurica had low ability to be identified (27.3% and 30.8%, respectively); however, they were often misclassified as each other, due to their physical overlap in the field. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the 350-399, 500-549, 700-749, and 900-949 nm regions were most useful for species identification, while 550-599 and 650-699 nm regions were detrimental, perhaps due to greater intraspecific variability than interspecific variability in these regions. These most influential regions for identification were similar to those found in other studies. Thus, it is possible to identify species using ground-level hyperspectral data.

J	Chen, SL; Jiang, H; Jin, JX; Wang, Y				Chen, Shulin; Jiang, Hong; Jin, Jiaxin; Wang, Ying			Changes in net primary production in the Tianmu Mountain Nature Reserve, China, from 1984 to 2014	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Nature reserve establishment can lead to conflict with some stakeholders. Zoning management is useful to mitigate against the conflict between human development and nature reserves, and a nature reserve can be divided into three zones: the core zone, buffer zone, and experimental zone. So far, how to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of zoning management in nature reserves is a problem faced by remote sensing scientists and ecologists. Net primary productivity (NPP) is a key indicator which can be used to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of zoning management in nature reserves. However, to date there has been no research on the effectiveness of zoning management on NPP, and the estimation of NPP in the Tianmu Mountain Nature Reserve also has not been studied. Based on remote sensing data and in situ measurements, the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) model was used to estimate NPP in the Tianmu Mountain Nature Reserve during the period 1984-2014. We used the observed NPP to verify the simulated NPP, and the results show that the simulated NPP was consistent with the observed NPP (R-2 = 0.85, p = 0.0002, RMSE = 52.62 g C m(-2) year(-1), where R-2 represents coefficient of determination, p represents statistical significance, and RMSE represents root mean square error). This means that the CASA model is suitable for NPP estimation in the Tianmu Mountain Nature Reserve. The results also indicate that NPP showed an increasing trend during the period 1984-2014, and the increase over the whole period was 6.66%. The total of the annual averaged NPP was 3.07 x 10(10) g C year(-1), while the annual averaged NPP per unit area was 708 g C m(-2) year(-1). The largest averaged annual NPP per unit appeared in the core zone (720 g C m(-2) year(-1)), followed by the buffer zone (711 g C m(-2) year(-1)), with the experimental zone having the smallest averaged annual NPP per unit (706 g C m(-2) year(-1)). At the p < 0.1 level, there was no region where NPP had decreased significantly in the core zone and buffer zone, and the area of the regions where NPP had decreased significantly in the experimental zone was 8.04 ha. At the p < 0.05 level, there was no area where NPP had decreased significantly in the three zones of the Tianmu Mountain Nature Reserve. The results show that the zoning management on NPP was effective in the Tianmu Mountain Nature Reserve.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2017	38	1					211	234		10.1080/01431161.2016.1264025								WOS:000390126200012

The model was developed using the following procedures: (1) a high-pass spatial filter algorithm was applied to detect linear features, (2) morphological processing was used to remove unwanted linear features, (3) the raster format was vectorized, (4) the vectorized linear features were split per hectare (ha) and each line was then classified according to its compass direction, and (5) the sum of all vector lengths per class of direction per ha was calculated. Finally, the direction class with the greatest length was selected from each ha to predict the physical SWC structures. The model was calibrated and validated on the Ethiopian Highlands. The model correctly mapped 80% of the existing structures. The developed model was then tested at different sites with different topography. The results show that the developed model is feasible for automated mapping of physical SWC structures. Therefore, the model is useful for predicting and mapping physical SWC structures areas across diverse areas.																	1009-637X	1861-9568				JAN	2017	27	1					79	94		10.1007/s11442-017-1365-9								WOS:000388979600005						
J	Rugani, B; Rocchini, D				Rugani, Benedetto; Rocchini, Duccio			Boosting the use of spectral heterogeneity in the impact assessment of agricultural land use on biodiversity	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												No consensus has been yet achieved among Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) practitioners on how to assess the impact on biodiversity due to land uses and land use changes, in particular with regard to agricultural areas. In the domain of nature conservation and landscape ecology, spectral heterogeneity (SH) derived from remotely sensed imagery is considered a viable proxy for species diversity detection. The assessment rationale is based on the 'spectral variation hypothesis': the higher the spectral variability, the higher the ecological heterogeneity and species community diversity, occupying different niches. Our hypothesis is that SH can be effective to improve or complement current Life Cycle Impact Assessment LCIA practice on biodiversity loss evaluation driven by land use. Hence, we aim here to explore this assumption by computing SH at a local scale of crops cultivation in Southern Alps (Trentino province, Italy), and then combining this information with land use over 30 years. We observe and analyse the relationships between land cover maps and habitat heterogeneity at different time and spatial resolutions. This allows us to argue about the robustness of SH to be a potential surrogate of environmental nuances for species variability detection in LCIA. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

China's Grain-for-Green Programme (GFGP) has been widely adopted in the last 15 years and exerted significant impact on land-use and ecosystem services. North-western Yunnan is one of the key areas of GFGP implementation in the upper Yangtze River. Promotion of ecosystem services in this region is of great importance to the ecological sustainability of Yangtze River watershed. In this study, remote sensing and modelling techniques are applied to analyse the impact of GFGP on ecosystem services. Results show that the transformation from non-irrigated farmland to forestland could potentially improve soil conservation by 24.89%. Soil conservation of restored forest was 78.17% of retained forest while net primary production (NPP) already reached 88.65%, which suggested different recovery rates of NPP and soil conservation. Increasing extent of GFGP implementation improved soil conservation but decreased NPP and water yield at sub-watershed scale, which revealed trade-offs between ecosystem services under ecological restoration. Future ecosystem management and GFGP policy making should consider trade-offs of ecosystem services in order to achieve sustainable provision of ecosystem services. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Van Vleet, E; Bray, DB; Duran, E				Van Vleet, Eric; Bray, David Barton; Duran, Elvira			Knowing but not knowing: Systematic conservation planning and community conservation in the Sierra Norte of Oaxaca, Mexico	LAND USE POLICY												Systematic conservation planning (SCP) seeks to propose new reserves through a scientifically rigorous process using databases and research selection algorithims. However, SCP exercises have been criticized for "knowing but not doing", i.e. not implementing the proposed reserve. But there is an additional problem that can be called "knowing but not knowing", knowing things from databases, but not knowing crucial contextual information about community-based social processes that have supported the high forest cover and biodiversity detected. Examined here is how a common property region of the Sierra Norte of Oaxaca, Mexico has maintained high forest cover in the absence of public protected areas, while multiple SCP exercises have advocated for the creation of public protected areas in communal tropical montane cloud forests and pine forests as strategies for biodiversity conservation and resilience to climate change. Methods included archival research, review of community documents, focus group interviews, semi-structured interviews, participant observation, land use transects, and GIS analysis and remote sensing. Conservation in the region originally occurred because of low population densities, steep slopes and a lack of agricultural subsidies, supported by locally adapted agricultural practices. In the 1990s, a transition from passive to active conservation took place with land use zoning plans, community conservation rules, community forestry enterprises and payments for environmental service programs that consolidated a trend towards high, unthreatened forest cover. Today, the study communities have an average of 88.3% forest cover, with 61% of that in informal conservation based on community land use zoning and rules and another 14% governed by forest management plans approved by the Mexican government. We argue that truly systematic conservation plans would seek to understand how communities in the region are already managing forests for conservation. It is pointless and uninformed to advocate for top-down conservation interventions of forests that are already robustly conserved and resilient to climate change due to community action.

However, rapid urbanization in China has led to a tremendous farmland loss and to the degradation of farmland quality. Based on remote sensing and geographic information system technology, this study developed a semiautomatic procedure for designating PFPAs using high-resolution satellite imagery (HRSI), which involved object-based image analysis, farmland composite evaluation, and spatial analysis. It was found that the HRSIs can provide elaborate land-use information, and the PFPA demarcation showed strong correlation with the farmland area and patch distance. For the benefit of spatial planning and management, different demarcation rules should be applied for suburban and exurban areas around a metropolis. Finally, the overall accuracy of HRSI classification was about 80% for the study area, and high-quality farmlands from evaluation results were selected as PFs. About 95% of the PFs were demarcated within the PFPAs. The results of this study will be useful for PFPA planning and the methods outlined could help in the automatic designation of PFPAs from the perspective of the spatial science.																	2045-2322					DEC 21	2016	6								37634	10.1038/srep37634								WOS:000390202400001	28000668					
J	Hu, CM; Feng, L				Hu, Chuanmin; Feng, Lian			Modified MODIS fluorescence line height data product to improve image interpretation for red tide monitoring in the eastern Gulf of Mexico	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Several satellite-based methods have been used to detect and trace Karenia brevis red tide blooms in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Some require data statistics and multiple data products while others use a single data product. Of these, the MODIS normalized fluorescence line height (nFLH) has shown its advantage of detecting blooms in waters rich in colored dissolved organic matter, thus having been used routinely to assess bloom conditions by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC), the official state agency of Florida responsible for red tide monitoring and mitigation. However, elevated sediment concentrations in the water column due to wind storms can also result in high nFLH values, leading to false-positive bloom interpretation. Here, a modified nFLH data product is developed to minimize such impacts through empirical adjustments of the nFLH values using MODIS-derived remote sensing reflectance in the green band at 547 nm. The new product is termed as an algal bloom index (ABI), which has shown improved performance over the original nFLH in both retrospective evaluation statistics and near real-time applications. The ABI product has been made available in near realtime through a Web portal and has been used by the FWC on a routine basis to guide field sampling efforts and prepare for red tide bulletins distributed to many user groups.

Mapping individual tree health using full-waveform airborne laser scans and imaging spectroscopy: A case study for a floodplain eucalypt forest	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Declining forest health can affect crucial ecosystem functions, such as carbon storage in biomass and soils, the regulation of water regimes, the modulation of regional climate and conservation of biodiversity. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) and imaging spectroscopy (IS) are two potentially complementary remote sensing technologies capable of characterizing and monitoring regional forest health. However, the combined use of ALS and IS data to classify the health of individual trees has not yet been assessed. In this study we propose a new approach utilizing ALS and IS combined to characterize the health of individual trees. Firstly, we applied a recently developed bottom-up individual tree delineation algorithm across a structurally complex floodplain eucalypt forest that has experienced episodes of severe dieback over the past six decades. We further calculated ALS and IS indices for delineated tree crowns and used them as predictor variables in machine learning models. We trained and evaluated an object-oriented random forest classifier against field-measured tree crown dieback and transparency ratios, as indicators of eucalypt tree health and crown density, respectively. Our results showed that die back levels of individual trees can be classified using ALS and IS with an overall accuracy of 81% and a kappa score of 0.66, while the classification of tree crown transparency levels had an overall accuracy of 70% and a kappa score of 0.5. Returned pulse width, intensity and density related ALS indices were the most important predictors in the tree health classification, as they accounted for >40% of the variance in the data. At the forest level in terms of die back, 81.5% of correctly delineated trees were classified as healthy, 12.3% as declining and 6.2% as dying or dead. Dieback occurred primarily in areas that were flooded <5% of the time, as quantified by Landsat derived flooding frequency (1986-2011). Our results provide a novel application of ALS and IS to accurately classify the health of individual trees in a structurally complex eucalypt forest, enabling us to prioritize areas for forest health promotion and conservation of biodiversity.

The purpose of this study was to analyze honey production in Mato Grosso biomes of the Amazon, Cerrado (Bushlands) and Pantanal (Swamplands) from 2002 to 2011. Information on the production of honey by each municipality was obtained from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics database (IBGE). The delimitation of the municipalities for each biome was defined according to IBGE. The production of honey was the greatest in the Amazon, with 46.88% of the State production and the participation of 58 municipalities from this biome; Cerrado (Bushlands) produced 42% of the State's honey with the participation of 50 producing municipalities, and Pantanal (Swamplands) produced 10.82% of the honey with 8 municipalities. We conclude that the Mato Grosso biomes showed beekeeping potential, with greater productive capacity in Pantanal (Swamplands) due to its higher productivity rate.																	1518-952X	2176-9109				DEC	2016	39						159	171		10.5380/dma.v39i0.46505								WOS:000404768600009

As major contributors to biomass decomposition, fungi are important to forest bio-geochemical cycling and maintenance of vertebrate animal diversity. Many forest plant species live in a symbiotic relationship with a fungal partner that helps a host plant to acquire nutrients and water. In addition, edible fungi are recreationally as well as economically valuable. However, most fungi live in very cryptic locations (e.g. in soils and interior plant tissues) and are only visible when their ephemeral fruiting bodies are produced, making fungal occurrence difficult to detect and predict. While remote sensing has been used increasingly to identify and scale many forest characteristics (e.g. structure, function, and species diversity) related to myriad ecosystem services, the use of remotely sensed data in modelling the occurrence of fungi is largely unknown. We compared the performance of airborne lidar derived structural variables, including those associated with single tree detection, with variables derived from field inventories to model overall fungal species abundance as well as specific fungal guilds (i.e. a range of edibility from highly edible to very poisonous, and the number of fruiting bodies of saprotrophic and mutualistic ectomycorrhizal species) based on fruiting body sampling in a low range mountain forest (Bavarian Forest National Park). Lidar derived variables performed better than variables derived from field measurements to explain the abundance of all guilds combined, as well as the guilds of soil saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi, and the yield of highly edible fungi. Variables derived from field measurements performed better than lidar derived variables in explaining the yield of very poisonous fungi. Upscaling of yield and abundance of fruiting bodies to the whole study area opens the avenue for managers to identify areas of high interest by mushroom pickers, as opposed to those of potential danger to people and those that co-occur with sensitive species and habitats of conservation relevance. Moreover, the strong, guild-specific relationships found between the occurrence of fungi and lidar derived variables opens new avenues for scaling to large areas the occurrence of members of this cryptic kingdom.

J	Ghosh, MK; Kumar, L; Roy, C				Ghosh, Manoj Kumer; Kumar, Lalit; Roy, Chandan			Mapping Long-Term Changes in Mangrove Species Composition and Distribution in the Sundarbans	FORESTS												The Sundarbans mangrove forest is an important resource for the people of the Ganges Delta. It plays an important role in the local as well as global ecosystem by absorbing carbon dioxide and other pollutants from air and water, offering protection to millions of people in the Ganges Delta against cyclone and water surges, stabilizing the shore line, trapping sediment and nutrients, purifying water, and providing services for human beings, such as fuel wood, medicine, food, and construction materials. However, this mangrove ecosystem is under threat, mainly due to climate change and anthropogenic factors. Anthropogenic and climate change-induced degradation, such as over-exploitation of timber and pollution, sea level rise, coastal erosion, increasing salinity, effects of increasing number of cyclones and higher levels of storm surges function as recurrent threats to mangroves in the Sundarbans. In this situation, regular and detailed information on mangrove species composition, their spatial distribution and the changes taking place over time is very important for a thorough understanding of mangrove biodiversity, and this information can also lead to the adoption of management practices designed for the maximum sustainable yield of the Sundarbans forest resources. We employed a maximum likelihood classifier technique to classify images recorded by the Landsat satellite series and used post classification comparison techniques to detect changes at the species level. The image classification resulted in overall accuracies of 72%, 83%, 79% and 89% for the images of 1977, 1989, 2000 and 2015, respectively. We identified five major mangrove species and detected changes over the 38-year (1977-2015) study period. During this period, both Heritiera fomes and Excoecaria agallocha decreased by 9.9%, while Ceriops decandra, Sonneratia apelatala, and Xylocarpus mekongensis increased by 12.9%, 380.4% and 57.3%, respectively.

Spatial Differentiation of Arable Land and Permanent Grassland to Improve a Land Management Model for Nutrient Balancing	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												Agroecosystems play an important role in providing economic and ecosystem services, which directly impact society. Inappropriate land use and unsustainable agricultural management with associated nutrient cycles can jeopardize important soil functions such as food production, livestock feeding, and conservation of biodiversity. The objective of this study was to integrate remotely sensed land cover information into a regional land management model (LMM) to improve the assessment of spatially explicit nutrient balances for agroecosystems. Remotely sensed data and an optimized parameter set contributed to an improved LMM output, allowing for a better land allocation within the model. The best input parameter combination was based on two different land cover classifications with overall accuracies of 98%, improving the land allocation performance compared with using nonspatially explicit input. We conclude that the combined use of remote sensing data and the LMM has the potential to provide valuable guidance for farm practices. It further helps to generate a spatial description of farm-level nutrient balance, a crucial ability when choosing policy options related to sustainable management of agricultural soils.

China faces especially strong pressure since many people live inside protected areas. It has sought to balance human needs and conservation goals within them by creating mixed zoning schemes loosely based on UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere Programme. These include strictly-protected core zones, buffer zones allowing limited human use, and experimental zones that examine different land-use options. To test the efficacy of this zoning, we employed field surveys and remote sensing to assess the penetration of agricultural and urban land into 109 national nature reserves in China for 2000 and 2010. Human disturbance was lowest in core zones and highest in experimental zones in both 2000 and 2010. Over this period, 82% of the reserves were unchanged or had decreased human disturbance. Nonetheless, overall human disturbance increased by 7%, 4%, and 5% in the core, buffer and experimental zones respectively. Almost all the increase in the core zone was in four wetland reserves, where human actions converted large areas to agriculture. Some 58% of reserves experienced some human disturbance in core zones in 2010, demonstrating a need for more effective zoning. The findings have broader implications for protected area management globally because they highlight the strengths and weaknesses of zoning for balancing human needs and species conservation.

Amplification of the water cycle, including the increasing frequency and severity of droughts and wet extremes, is expected to alter spatial and temporal hydrological patterns in arid wetlands globally, with potential threats to ecosystem services and their functioning. Despite these pressing challenges, the ecohydrological interactions and resilience of arid wetlands to highly variable water regimes over long time periods remain largely unknown. Recent broad-scale drought and floods over Australia provide unique opportunities to improve our understanding of arid wetland ecosystem responses to hydroclimatic extremes. Here we analysed the ecohydrological dynamics of the Coongie Lakes arid wetland in central Australia, one of the world's largest Ramsar-designated wetlands, using more than two decades (1988-2011) of vegetation and floodwater extent retrievals derived from Landsat satellite observations. To explore the impacts of large-scale hydrological fluctuations on the arid wetland, we further coupled Landsat measurements with Total Water Storage Anomaly (TWSA) data obtained from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites. Pronounced seasonal and inter-annual variabilities of flood and vegetation activities were observed over the wetland, with variations in vegetation growth extent highly correlated with flood extent (r = 0.64, p < 0.05) that ranged from nearly zero to 3456 km(2). We reported the hydrological dynamics and associated ecosystem responses to be largely driven by the two phases (El Nino and La Nina) of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) ocean-atmosphere system. Changes in flood and vegetation extent were better explained by GRACE-TWSA (r = 0.8, lag = 0 month) than rainfall (r = 034, lag = 3 months) over the water source area, demonstrating that TWS is a valuable hydrological indicator for complex dryland river systems. The protracted Millennium Drought from 2001 to 2009 resulted in long-term absence of major flood events, which substantially suppressed wetland vegetation growth. However, the 2010-11 La Nina induced flooding events led to an exceptionally large resurgence of vegetation, with a mean vegetation growth extent anomaly exceeding the historical average (1988-2011) by more than 1.5 standard deviations, suggesting a significant resilience of arid wetland ecosystems to climate variability. This study showed the ecological functioning of arid wetlands is particularly sensitive to large-scale hydrological fluctuations and extreme drought conditions, and vulnerable to future altered water regimes due to climate change. The methods developed herein can be applied to arid wetlands located in other dryland river systems across the globe. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, HX; Xiang, YC; Zhang, YG				Wang Hong-Xia; Xiang Yuan-Cai; Zhang Yi-Guo			The Proceedings of IscA That Functions as a Biomagnetic Receptor Protein (MagR)	PROGRESS IN BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOPHYSICS												An important class of mitochondrial function protein is referred to as an iron-sulfur cluster protein (Isc) family, which plays a vital role in the cellular energy metabolism, electron transfer, substrate-binding and activation, iron-sulfur storage, enzymatic reaction and gene regulation. Dysregulation in either the Isc assembly or transport processes would give rise to a deteriorative effect on both the intracellular iron homeostasis and the functionality of Isc-relevant proteins. Particularly, IscA (molecular mass, similar to 11 ku) is identified as a highly conserved member of the iron-sulfur protein hesB subfamily that can directly bind to iron ions and iron-sulfur [2Fe-2S] cluster and hence participates in the biosynthesis of iron sulfur cluster proteins. Thereby, IscA is postulated to display a paramount function in the iron-sulfur cluster assembly and cascade reaction system. Curiously, it is worth mentioning that two seemingly similar but different discoveries on the topic of IscAl published respectively by Dr. Xie and Dr. Zhang's groups in 2015, no matter whether they have attracted extensive public attention, unraveled that IscA 1 possesses a putative magneto-receptor capability and thus IscAl has been renamed as MagR/MAR in their papers. In addition, Xie's group found that IscA could act as a magnetic sensor by means of forming magnetosensor (MagS) complex with Cry. Of crucial importance to notice, the expression of certain magneto-responsive genes in vivo could be regulated by the external magnetic field-stimulated activation of MagR, which would subsequently affect neural activity and the magnetic oriented animal behaviors. Regarding to ;the unique magneto-sensing function of MagR, the concept for "magnetogenetics" is proposed by Dr. Zhang's group in combination of the genetic targeting to MagR/MAR with relevant remote magnetic stimulation. In this mini-review, we give a brief introduction into the discovery of MagR/IscA and its homologues together with their high evolutionary conservation, as well as current proceedings of researches on its physiological functions. Furthermore, we proposed an intracellular biomagnetic signaling-responsive mechanism insofar as to provide an explicit explanation of how MagR/IscAl exerts it intrinsic function in magnetogenetics.																	1000-3282					DEC	2016	43	12					1115	1128		10.16476/j.pibb.2016.0190								WOS:000390832200001						
J	Lechner, AM; Kassulke, O; Unger, C				Lechner, Alex Mark; Kassulke, Owen; Unger, Corinne			Spatial assessment of open cut coal mining progressive rehabilitation to support the monitoring of rehabilitation liabilities	RESOURCES POLICY												Worldwide coal mining has expanded over the past few decades, though growth has recently slowed due to reduced demand, partly due to concerns around CO2 emissions and climate change impacts. Coal mining is also a significant driver of land disturbance in regions where economic coal seams and coal mining methods are applied, in particular open cut extraction. To address these impacts, mined landscapes are rehabilitated with the aim of making them safe, stable, non-polluting and self-sustainable to an agreed post-mining land use such as agriculture or conservation. Progressive rehabilitation is often conducted to keep the footprint of disturbance to a minimum and to ensure that ecological and/or agricultural land use production is restored as soon as possible in preference to waiting until after mine closure. Environmental regulators require methods for tracking the performance of mining companies engaging in progressive rehabilitation to evaluate the success or otherwise of their regulatory frameworks and to ensure companies meet the requirements of their environmental authorities or mining licenses. In this study, we describe a spatial method for assessing mine disturbance and rehabilitation regionally and analyse our results in terms of rehabilitation liability. We first developed a land cover classification framework for mapping mining impacts and rehabilitation that categorises land cover using a mining land cover disturbance typology. We then used the Fitzroy Basin in Australia as a case study, utilising the land cover classification scheme to map 37 open cut-coal mines, using manual interpretation of remote sensing data. By comparing the percentage area of rehabilitation with the total mine area we assessed the variability in progressive rehabilitation for the 37 mines. For example, older mines which have a history of progressive rehabilitation should have large areas and a high proportion of area rehabilitated. Finally, we calculated a range of regional rehabilitation liabilities by applying two publically available rehabilitation cost-calculators to the land cover data. We calculated the rehabilitation liability as ranging from $2.7 to $5.5 billion Australian dollars. The lower and upper bounds of the estimate reflect the uncertainty associated with the range of land use types and potential rehabilitation methods, from simple to more complex rehabilitation methods. We conclude by discussing how the methods could be used to support effective decision making by government agencies regulating and monitoring mining activities.

Integrating TEK into monitoring and management of these areas allows for community participation, as well as for offering novel insights into sustainable resource use. In this study, we developed a 250 m resolution land-cover map of the Western Guyana Shield (Venezuela) based on remote sensing, and used TEK to validate its relevance for indigenous livelihoods and land uses. We first employed a hyper-temporal remotely sensed vegetation index to derive a land classification system. During a 1300 km, eight day fluvial expedition in roadless areas in the Amazonas State (Venezuela), we visited six indigenous communities who provided geo-referenced data on hunting, fishing and farming activities. We overlaid these TEK data onto the land classification map, to link land classes with indigenous use. We characterized land classes using patterns of greenness temporal change and topo-hydrological information, and proposed 12 land-cover types, grouped into five main landscapes: 1) water bodies; 2) open lands/forest edges; 3) evergreen forests; 4) submontane semideciduous forests, and 5) cloud forests. Each land cover class was identified with a pulsating profile describing temporal changes in greenness, hence we labelled our map as "The Forest Pulse". These greenness profiles showed a slightly increasing trend, for the period 2000 to 2009, in the land classes representing grassland and scrubland, and a slightly decreasing trend in the classes representing forests. This finding is consistent with a gain in carbon in grassland as a consequence of climate warming, and also with some loss of vegetation in the forests. Thus, our classification shows potential to assess future effects of climate change on landscape. Several classes were significantly connected with agriculture, fishing, overall hunting, and more specifically the hunting of primates, Mazama americana, Dasyprocta fitliginosa, and Tayassu pecan. Our results showed that TEK-based approaches can serve as a basis for validating the livelihood relevance of landscapes in high-value conservation areas, which can form the basis for furthering the management of natural resources in these regions.

Seasonal spatial dynamics of floodplain macrophyte and periphyton abundance in the Alligator Rivers region (Kakadu) of northern Australia	ECOHYDROLOGY												Isotope studies of freshwater aquatic habitats have shown that epiphytic algae in the form of periphyton provides much of the source material for the biomass of secondary aquatic producers. Consequently, methods that can quantify the seasonal abundance of periphyton are important spatial inputs for wetland management and conservation planning processes for tropical floodplains. In this study, estimation of the seasonal spatial variability in floodplain macrophyte and periphyton abundance was made for the floodplains of the Kakadu region in northern Australia. Statistical modelling, using remotely sensed information, was applied to predict the seasonal distributions of macrophyte structural types, which were then combined with the field measurements of periphyton biomass to produce seasonal distributions of floodplain periphyton biomass per unit area. The seasonal spatial distribution of periphyton was strongly influenced by the seasonal variation in macrophyte abundance. Vertical emergent macrophytes (mainly aquatic grasses), covering 70% of the floodplain in May, had the lowest periphyton abundance. Submerged macrophytes, covering 10-15% of the floodplains, had the greatest periphyton abundance. The submerged macrophytes occupied open water areas, mainly in the deeper backswamp areas on the edges of the floodplains, and these areas maintained high periphyton abundance into the dry season. This study provides explicit spatial representation of the seasonal dynamics of tropical floodplain macrophyte and periphyton abundance and presents an approach that can be applied to map 'hotspots' of floodplain periphyton abundance.

Most of these maps rely on estimates of ecosystem services estimated for individual land cover classes rather than incorporating field data. We developed combined field models (CFM) using regression analysis to estimate ecosystem services based on the observed relationship between environmental and land cover data and field measurements of ecosystem services. Local ecosystem service supply was estimated from vegetation data measured at fifty sites covering the widest range of environmental conditions across a watershed in Mexico. We compared the accuracy of the CFM approach for forage, timber, firewood and carbon storage over a more commonly "look up table" method relying on a uniform estimate of ecosystem service supply by land cover type. The CFM revealed higher accuracy when compared to the "look up table" approach. The resulting CFM models explained a large fraction of the variance (42-89%) using a combination of land cover, remote sensing data, hydrology and distance from developed areas. In addition, mapping residuals from Geographically Weighted Regressions provided an estimate of uncertainty across the CFM model results. This approach provides better estimates of ecosystem service delivery and uncertainty for land managers and decision-makers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Year-round spatial movements and trophic ecology of Trindade Petrels (Pterodroma arminjoniana)	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												Trindade Petrels (Pterodroma arminjoniana) are vulnerable gadfly petrels that breed on the remote Trindade Island, located similar to 1100 km off the Brazilian coast. Little is known about their spatial ecology, and their trophic ecology has only been described for the breeding season. We tagged four Trindade Petrels with global location sensing loggers (GLS) from October 2013 to November 2014 and sampled the blood and feathers (innermost primary and the eighth secondary) of 14 individuals to evaluate their year-round spatial and isotopic ecology. We examined individual distributions, habitat use and suitability, activity, and isotopic values during the breeding, migration, and non-breeding periods. Trindade Petrels used areas in the southwest Atlantic Ocean (between 10 degrees N and 50 degrees S in latitude) during the breeding season. They migrated through pelagic waters of the tropical Atlantic to the northwest Atlantic, where they spent the non-breeding season. Trindade Petrels used mostly tropical to subtropical waters in areas of intermediate to high wind speeds and low marine productivity. Individuals spent more time foraging at night than during the day. During the breeding season, birds in northerly areas had higher carbon-13 values, and birds that used more pelagic areas foraged on prey at a higher trophic level (higher nitrogen-15 values) than those in more southern and coastal areas. Isotopic values during the breeding, migration, and non-breeding periods differed, possibly due to differences among individuals in their at-sea distribution throughout the year. We confirmed the non-breeding distribution of Trindade Petrels, which was previously known only from vessel sightings and stranded birds. Our results also suggest a strong temporal segregation in the at-sea distribution and trophic ecology between two groups of individuals, which might indicate the existence of two separate breeding populations.

Using high-resolution LiDAR data to quantify the three-dimensional structure of vegetation in urban green space	URBAN ECOSYSTEMS												The spatial arrangement and vertical structure of vegetation in urban green spaces are key factors in determining the types of benefits that urban parks provide to people. This includes opportunities for recreation, spiritual fulfilment and biodiversity conservation. However, there has been little consideration of how the fine-scale spatial and vertical structure of vegetation is distributed in urban parks, primarily due to limitations in methods for doing so. We addressed this gap by developing a method using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data to map, at a fine resolution, tree cover, vegetation spatial arrangement, and vegetation vertical structure. We then applied this method to urban parks in Brisbane, Australia. We found that parks varied mainly in their amount of tree cover and its spatial arrangement, but also in vegetation vertical structure. Interestingly, the vertical structure of vegetation was largely independent of its cover and spatial arrangement. This suggests that vertical structure may be being managed independently to tree cover to provide different benefits across urban parks with different levels of tree cover. Finally, we were able to classify parks into three distinct classes that explicitly account for both the spatial and vertical structure of tree cover. Our approach for mapping the three-dimensional vegetation structure of urban green space provides a much more nuanced and functional description of urban parks than has previously been possible. Future research is now needed to quantify the relationships between vegetation structure and the actual benefits people derive from urban green space.

Because of its obvious land-use changes and ecosystem deterioration in recent decades, a sustainable development management and environmental protection project should be urgently proposed. Therefore, the remote-sensing images of Landsat are adopted to analyze the land use evolution and to evaluate its ecological security during the past 35 years in Silver Beach of this paper. The results show: in the period of 1979a-2013a, the areas of constructive land and artificial wetland are considerably increased and mainly transformed from cultivated land and forest land. The areas of cultivated land and forest land are substantially reduced accordingly, but the areas of grassland, water area and intertidal zone have no great extent of variation. Its land use intensities are consistently increased, but its land use diversities are abundant before 2000a and then significant decreased. Overall, the land use evolution presents slow in development speed, strengthen in development intensity, down in ecological richness and fragment in spatial patterns. In terms of ecological security, although there has short-term rising of ecological service value and security in 2006a, the whole structure, stability and ecological service function in Silver Beach are declined, and its vulnerabilities are accordingly increased. As a matter of fact, these results are achieved by shortly to improve the utilization rate of the artificial wetland and the intertidal zone resources with the cost of ecosystem structure and stability destruction. The impact factors of leading to above results are not only climatic factors as air temperature, typhoon, tide, but also even more important human activity factors as urbanization, sea reclamation, fishing, tourism and planning management in the studied time period. In consequence, the research findings from this study should be able to help understand the interacting mechanism among above multiple factors and to quantify respective contribution to land use evolution and its ecological security, which would provide an importantly scientific instruction for the future development management protection in Silver Beach.																	1386-7857	1573-7543				DEC	2016	19	4			SI		1907	1924		10.1007/s10586-016-0659-5								WOS:000388972000016

Based on a review of 11 monitoring programs in Europe and North America and on related literature, we identify the design choices or attributes of a program that balance monitoring costs and usefulness for stakeholders. A useful program monitors habitats, vascular plants, and possibly faunal groups (ecosystem service providers, charismatic species) using a stratified random sample of the agricultural landscape, including marginal and intensive regions. The size of landscape samples varies with the grain of the agricultural landscape; for example, samples are smaller in Europe and larger in North America. Raw data are collected in a rolling survey, which distributes sampling over several years. Sufficient practical experience is now available to implement broad monitoring schemes on both continents. Technological developments in remote sensing, metagenomics, and social media may offer new opportunities for affordable farmland biodiversity monitoring and help to lower the overall costs of monitoring programs.

Diving physiology of seabirds and marine mammals: Relevance, challenges and some solutions for field studies	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY												To fully understand how diving seabirds and marine mammals balance the potentially conflicting demands of holding their breath while living their lives underwater (and maintaining physiological homeostasis during exercise, feeding, growth, and reproduction), physiological studies must be conducted with animals in their natural environments. The purpose of this article is to review the importance of making physiological measurements on diving animals in field settings, while acknowledging the challenges and highlighting some solutions. The most extreme divers are great candidates for study, especially in a comparative and mechanistic context. However, physiological data are also required of a wide range of species for problems relating to other disciplines, in particular ecology and conservation biology. Physiological data help with understanding and predicting the outcomes of environmental change, and the direct impacts of anthropogenic activities. Methodological approaches that have facilitated the development of field-based diving physiology include the isolated diving hole protocol and the translocation paradigm, and while there are many techniques for remote observation, animal-borne biotelemetry, or "biologging", has been critical. We discuss issues related to the attachment of instruments, the retrieval of data and sensing of physiological variables, while also considering negative impacts of tagging. This is illustrated with examples from a variety of species, and an in-depth look at one of the best studied and most extreme divers, the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri). With a variety of approaches and high demand for data on the physiology of diving seabirds and marine mammals, the future of field studies is bright. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Development of deforestation and land cover database for Bhutan (1930-2014)	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Bhutan is a mountainous country located in the Himalayan biodiversity hotspot. This study has quantified the total area under land cover types, estimated the rate of forest cover change, analyzed the changes across forest types, and modeled forest cover change hotpots in Bhutan. The topographical maps and satellite remote sensing images were analyzed to get the spatial patterns of forest and associated land cover changes over the past eight decades (1930-1977-1987-1995-2005-2014). Forest is the largest land cover in Bhutan and constitutes 68.3% of the total geographical area in 2014. Subtropical broad leaved hill forest is predominant type occupies 34.1% of forest area in Bhutan, followed by montane dry temperate (20.9%), montane wet temperate (18.9%), Himalayan moist temperate (10%), and tropical moist sal (8.1%) in 2014. The major forest cover loss is observed in subtropical broad leaved hill forest (64.5 km(2)) and moist sal forest (9.9 km(2)) from 1977 to 2014. The deforested areas have mainly been converted into agriculture and contributed for 60.9% of forest loss from 1930 to 2014. In spite of major decline of forest cover in time interval of 1930-1977, there is no net rate of deforestation is recorded in Bhutan since 1995. Forest cover change analysis has been carried out to evaluate the conservation effectiveness in "Protected Areas" of Bhutan. Hotspots that have undergone high transformation in forest cover for afforestation and deforestation were highlighted in the study for conservation prioritisation. Forest conservation policies in Bhutan are highly effective in controlling deforestation as compared to neighboring Asian countries and such service would help in mitigating climate change.

A remote sensing approach using airborne LiDAR on the Mediterranean coast	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												We examined the relationship between coastal habitats (sensu European Union Habitats Directive) and local dune morphology along a Mediterranean coastal dune system by integrating field collected vegetation data and remotely sensed imagery. Specifically, we described the morphological profile of each EC habitat based on the morphological variables that are most likely to affect their occurrence, including elevation, slope, curvature, northness, eastness and sea distance. In addition, we assessed the role and strength of each morphological variable in determining the occurrence of EC habitats. We used 394 random vegetation plots representative of six EC habitats (Habitat 1210: "Annual vegetation of drift lines"; Habitat 2110: "Embryonic shifting dunes"; Habitat 2120: "Shifting dunes along the shoreline with Ammophila arenaria"; Habitat 2210 and 2230: "Crucianellion maritimae fixed beach dunes" and "Malcolmietalia dune grasslands"; Habitat 2250: "Coastal dunes with Juniperus spp."; Habitat 2260: "Cisto-Lavanduletalia dune sclerophyllous scrubs") found along the Tyrrhenian coast of central Italy. We derived each morphological variable from a DTM (Digital Terrain Model) obtained from 2-m resolution LiDAR (Light Detection And Range) images. The mean value of each variable was calculated at different spatial scales using buffer areas of increasing radius (2 m, 4 m, 8 m) around each vegetation plot. Mean morphological values for each EC habitat were compared using Kruskal-Wallis rank test. The role and strength of the relationship between habitat type and the morphological variables were assessed using Generalized Linear Models. EC habitats occur differentially across dune morphology, and the role and strength of each morphological variable define habitat specificity. Dune elevation and sea distance were determined to be the key factors in shaping EC habitat occurrence along this section of the Mediterranean coast. Identification of the close relationship between habitat type and morphological variables deriving from airborne LiDAR imagery points to the high potential of such remote sensing tool for analyzing and monitoring the integrity of coastal dune ecosystems. As airborne LiDAR enables the rapid collection of extremely accurate topographic data over large areas, it also offers useful information for the management of these threatened and fragile ecosystems.

Assessment of Land Cover Change Hotspots in Gulf of Kachchh, India Using Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Data and GIS	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Remote sensing is an indispensable tool for assessing and monitoring land use/land cover changes and supports in planning appropriate conservation measures. This study has analysed the status and distribution of different land use/land cover from 1977 to 2015 and identified the land use/land cover change hotspots in Gulf of Kachchh region, India. The total mangrove area has increased from 140.5 km(2) to 700.2 km(2) from 1977 to 2015. Among all the different time periods the highest rate of mangrove expansion was found between 2008 to 2011. The results indicate that during the past four decades, mangrove, salt pans and built-up land have been increased by 79.9 %, 84 % and 93.8 % respectively. About 21.4 km(2) of mangroves was converted to salt pans and built-up land from 1977 to 2015. Annual rate of afforestation was estimated as 7.01, 12.58, 16.03 and 4.73 for 1999-2006, 2006-2008, 2008-2011 and 2011-2015. Hotspot analysis has identified 33 positive and 11 negative change land cover hotspots in Gulf of Kachchh. Strict management policies are required to prevent further loss of mangroves and conservation of ecologically unique ecosystem of Gulf of Kachchh.

Remote sensing (RS) provides a wide-range of satellite-based environmental variables that can be fed into species distribution models (SDMs) to investigate species-environment relations and forecast responses to change. We address the spatiotemporal dynamics of species' habitat suitability at the landscape level by combining multi-temporal RS data with SDMs for analysing inter-annual habitat suitability dynamics. We implemented this framework with a vulnerable plant species (Veronica micrantha), by combining SDMs with a time-series of RS-based metrics of vegetation functioning related to primary productivity, seasonality, phenology and actual evapotranspiration. Besides RS variables, predictors related to landscape structure, soils and wildfires were ranked and combined through multi-model inference (MMI). To assess recent dynamics, a habitat suitability time-series was generated through model hindcasting. MMI highlighted the strong predictive ability of RS variables related to primary productivity and water availability for explaining the test-species distribution, along with soil, wildfire regime and landscape composition. The habitat suitability time-series revealed the effects of short-term land cover changes and inter-annual variability in climatic conditions. Multi-temporal SDMs further improved predictions, benefiting from RS time-series. Overall, results emphasize the integration of landscape attributes related to function, composition and spatial configuration for improving the explanation of ecological patterns. Moreover, coupling SDMs with RS functional metrics may provide early-warnings of future environmental changes potentially impacting habitat suitability. Applications discussed include the improvement of biodiversity monitoring and conservation strategies.

Wildlife habitat selection on landscapes with industrial disturbance	ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION												Technological advancements in remote sensing and telemetry provide opportunities for assessing the effects of expanding extractive industries on animal populations. Here, we illustrate the applicability of resource selection functions (RSFs) for modelling wildlife habitat selection on industrially-disturbed landscapes. We used grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) from a threatened population in Canada and surface mining as a case study. RSF predictions based on GPS radiocollared bears (n(during) (mining) = 7; n(post mining) = 9) showed that males and solitary females selected areas primarily outside mineral surface leases (MSLs) during active mining, and conversely inside MSLs after mine closure. However, females with cubs selected areas within compared to outside MSLs irrespective of mining activity. Individual variability was pronounced, although some environmental and human-related variables were consistent across reproductive classes. For males and solitary females, regional-scale RSFs yielded comparable results to site-specific models, whereas for females with cubs, modelling the two scales produced divergent results. While mine reclamation may afford opportunities for bear persistence, managing public access will likely decrease the risk of human-caused bear mortality. RSFs are powerful tools that merit widespread use in quantitative and visual investigations of wildlife habitat selection on industrially-modified landscapes, using Geographic Information System layers that precisely characterize site-specific conditions.

However, our understanding of the discrepancies in levels of forest protection on private lands as obligated by the law versus what occurs in practice remains very poor. We assessed patterns of forest cover and legal compliance with the Forest Code in the 1.25 Mkm(2) Brazilian state of Para, which has the highest deforestation rate in the Amazon. We evaluate the LR deficit and surplus patterns for different sized properties and across 144 municipalities, and found that the total LR surplus (12.6 Mha) was more than five times the total area of deficit (2.3 Mha). Yet, from the total surplus, only 11% can be legally deforested while the remaining 89% is already protected by law but can be used (sold or rented) to compensate for areas that are under deficit. Medium and large-scale properties make up most of the total LR deficit area, while agrarian reform settlements had comparatively large amounts of both compensation-only surplus and deforestable surplus. Most of the municipalities (77%) in the state could compensate their total deficit with surplus areas of LR in the same municipality, while the remainder can be compensate their deficit in one or more neighbouring municipalities, indicating compensation can always take place close to the source of the deficit. Maximising the environmental benefits of achieving Forest Code compliance requires measures that go beyond the existing legal framework, including interventions to avoid further deforestation in places where it is still legal, compensate in close proximity to areas with legal reserve deficit and promote local restoration on degraded lands.

Assessment and monitoring of deforestation and land-use changes (1976-2014) in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India using remote sensing and GIS	CURRENT SCIENCE												Andaman and Nicobar Islands are part of Indo-Burma and Sundaland global biodiversity hotspots. This study provides spatial information on forest types, deforestation and associated land-use changes in Andaman and Nicobar Islands during 1976 to 2014. Satellite remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) techniques have been used to analyse forest cover changes, rate of deforestation and to map patterns of forest cover distribution in Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Classified maps prepared for 1976, 1989, 1993, 2000, 2006 and 2014 indicate that the forest cover accounts for an area of 7086.1 (85.9%), 6969.2 (84.5%), 6941.1 (84.1%), 6934.6 (84.1%), 6617.8 (80.2%) and 6407.3 sq. km (77.7%) respectively. It was found that the area occupied by evergreen forests is very high, consisting of 3065.1 sq. km (32.2%) followed by semi-evergreen (1531.6 sq. km), moist deciduous (1133.4 sq. km) and mangrove forest (677.2 sq. km) in 2014. There is large-scale deforestation in Andaman and Nicobar Islands which has been estimated as 678.8 sq. km during the last four decades. The loss of forest cover is high in moist deciduous forests which has been estimated as 312.2 sq. km in Andaman Islands; whereas in Nicobar Islands, the highest loss was found in evergreen forests (244.6 sq. km). The rate of deforestation in Andaman and Nicobar Islands was high during 2000-2006 (0.78) indicating major influence of the tsunami of 26 December 2004. The annual rate of deforestation from 2006 to 2014 was 0.40. The geospatial analysis of areas of forest cover change provides baseline information for restoration and conservation planning.

PLOS ONE												Tropical forests with a low human population and absence of large-scale deforestation provide unique opportunities to study successful conservation strategies, which should be based on adequate monitoring tools. This study explored the conservation status of a large predator, the jaguar, considered an indicator of the maintenance of how well ecological processes are maintained. We implemented an original integrative approach, exploring successive ecosystem status proxies, from habitats and responses to threats of predators and their prey, to canopy structure and forest biomass. Niche modeling allowed identification of more suitable habitats, significantly related to canopy height and forest biomass. Capture/recapture methods showed that jaguar density was higher in habitats identified as more suitable by the niche model. Surveys of ungulates, large rodents and birds also showed higher density where jaguars were more abundant. Although jaguar density does not allow early detection of overall vertebrate community collapse, a decrease in the abundance of large terrestrial birds was noted as good first evidence of disturbance. The most promising tool comes from easily acquired LiDAR data and radar images: a decrease in canopy roughness was closely associated with the disturbance of forests and associated decreasing vertebrate biomass. This mixed approach, focusing on an apex predator, ecological modeling and remote-sensing information, not only helps detect early population declines in large mammals, but is also useful to discuss the relevance of large predators as indicators and the efficiency of conservation measures. It can also be easily extrapolated and adapted in a timely manner, since important open-source data are increasingly available and relevant for large-scale and real-time monitoring of biodiversity.																	1932-6203					NOV 9	2016	11	11							e0165362	10.1371/journal.pone.0165362								WOS:000387724300040	27828993

The objective of this study was to propose an object-based classification method for mapping offshore habitats and to compare results to traditional photo-interpreted maps. Benthic maps were created from WorldView-2 satellite imagery using an Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) method and a visual photo interpretation method. A logistic regression analysis identified depth and distance from shore as significant parameters for discriminating spectrally similar seagrass and colonized hard bottom features. Seagrass, colonized hard bottom and unconsolidated sediment (sand) were mapped with 78% overall accuracy using the OBIA method compared to 71% overall accuracy using the photo-interpretation method. This study suggests an alternative for mapping deeper, offshore habitats capable of producing higher thematic and spatial resolution maps compared to those created with the traditional photo interpretation method.

Hence, understanding their distribution and abundance is important in order to assess the impact on native ecosystems. It is particularly important to be able to track the spread of invasive species across landscapes; a task best achieved using remotely sensed imagery. The availability of high resolution data, combined with efficient classification methods, can potentially improve early detection of invasive alien species thereby enhancing their management. This study aims to classifywoody species with a focus on Melia azedarach (Meliaceae) trees in a moderately invaded coastal belt valley on the east coast of South Africa using WorldView-2 (WV-2) satellite imagery, and to compare the commonly used pixel-based classification with object-oriented approaches. The results show that object-oriented approaches are more suitable for classifying woody species, as well as other land cover classes when using high-resolution WV-2 imagery. The overall accuracy was 90% by object oriented classification, while the pixel-based classification gave an overall accuracy of 78%. For Melia, a producer accuracy of 92% and user accuracy of 91% was obtained by object-oriented classification and a producer accuracy of 85% and user accuracy of 83% was obtained by pixel-based classification. Hence the combined use of new generation sensor imagery and the employment of object-oriented image classification techniques provided more accurate information on Melia invasion in the study area. This is an encouraging result given the high degree of intermingling of Melia with other plants at the study site. In particular, the vegetation maps produced from this study would aid in gathering accurate knowledge about the distribution and spreading status of Melia, a major invasive species over large areas of South Africa and elsewhere in the world.

J	Bacani, VM				Bacani, Vitor Matheus			GEOPROCESSING APPLIED TO RISK ASSESSMENT OF FOREST FIRES IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF BODOQUENA, MATO GROSSO DO SUL	REVISTA ARVORE												Forest fires are a permanent threat in urban-forest interface areas and cause considerable environmental damage, especially in protected areas. An efficient way to assist decision-making to prevent an increase in forest fires is risk assessment using geographical information systems (GIS). The objective of this study was to evaluate the risk of forest fires in the municipality of Bodoquena, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, using remote sensing data and spatial analysis techniques implemented in a GIS. The procedures of the methodology are based on spatial analysis techniques to prepare maps of the likelihood of fire based on calculations of the Euclidean distance, the Kernel statistical method and fuzzy transformation and to combine these maps via the increasing diffuse overlay method. The results showed a high risk of forest fires on the margins of the urban area, rural settlements and main roads that cross the municipality, as well as the surrounding areas. It is concluded that the municipality of Bodoquena has a high risk of forest fires in areas with high biodiversity, especially the areas surrounding the Serra da Bodoquena National Park and Mato Grosso do Sul Pantanal.																	0100-6762					NOV-DEC	2016	40	6					1003	1011		10.1590/0100-67622016000600005								WOS:000394167100005

We mapped a total of 16 natural and human land use classes using both a Random Forest algorithm and a multivariate Gaussian model while considering scenarios with all natural forest classes grouped into a single intact or degraded category. Overall, classification accuracy increased for the multivariate Gaussian model with the partitioning of intact and degraded forest into separate forest cover classes but slightly decreased based on the Random Forest classifier. Natural forest cover was estimated to be 80.7% of total area in Tanintharyi. The most prevalent forest types are upland evergreen forest (42.3% of area) and lowland evergreen forest (21.6%). However, while just 27.1% of upland evergreen forest was classified as degraded (on the basis of canopy cover <80%), 66.0% of mangrove forest and 47.5% of the region's biologically-rich lowland evergreen forest were classified as degraded. This information on the current status of Tanintharyi's unique forest ecosystems and patterns of human land use is critical to effective conservation strategies and land-use planning.																	2072-4292					NOV	2016	8	11							882	10.3390/rs8110882								WOS:000388798400003						
J	Kim, J; Grunwald, S				Kim, Jongsung; Grunwald, Sabine			Assessment of Carbon Stocks in the Topsoil Using Random Forest and Remote Sensing Images	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Wetland soils are able to exhibit both consumption and production of greenhouse gases, and they play an important role in the regulation of the global carbon (C) cycle. Still, it is challenging to accurately evaluate the actual amount of C stored in wetlands. The incorporation of remote sensing data into digital soil models has great potential to assess C stocks in wetland soils. Our objectives were (i) to develop C stock prediction models utilizing remote sensing images and environmental ancillary data, (ii) to identify the prime environmental predictor variables that explain the spatial distribution of soil C, and (iii) to assess the amount of C stored in the top 20-cm soils of a prominent nutrient-enriched wetland. We collected a total of 108 soil cores at two soil depths (0-10 cm and 10-20 cm) in the Water Conservation Area 2A, FL. We developed random forest models to predict soil C stocks using field observation data, environmental ancillary data, and spectral data derived from remote sensing images, including Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (spatial resolution: 10 m), Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (30 m), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (250 m). The random forest models showed high performance to predict C stocks, and variable importance revealed that hydrology was the major environmental factor explaining the spatial distribution of soil C stocks in Water Conservation Area 2A. Our results showed that this area stores about 4.2 Tg (4.2 Mt) of C in the top 20-cm soils.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2016	45	6					1910	1918		10.2134/jeq2016.03.0076								WOS:000388944600013	27898790

In 2013-2014, studies were conducted in the upper Biebrza River basin to develop a remote sensing method for alkaline fen classification - a protected Natura 2000 habitat (code 7230) - using remote sensing technologies. High resolution airborne true colour (RGB) and color infrared (CIR) orthophotomaps, the laser scanning point cloud and thermal day and night images were obtained in August 2013 in the Biebrza River basin. At the same time, botanical studies were conducted in this area using conventional phytosociological methods. The random forest classification method was used to distinguish patches (phytocoenoses) of alkaline fens in the study area. The developed method of wetland identification has an accuracy of 91.5%. The night land surface temperature (LST) appears to have the greatest indicator potential. The obtained inventory results were compared with the results of the traditional habitat 7230 mapping method, carried out in 2011-2013 by another team of authors, under the Management Plan (MP, 2014). The obtained results suggest that the developed method has a wide application in nature conservation. Remote sensing methods are alternatives to traditional methods and can be used to identify alkaline fens on a larger scale. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Rapinel, S; Hubert-Moy, L; Clement, B; Maltby, E				Rapinel, Sebastien; Hubert-Moy, Laurence; Clement, Bernard; Maltby, Edward			Mapping wetland functions using Earth observation data and multi-criteria analysis	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Wetland functional assessment is commonly conducted based on field observations, and thus, is generally limited to small areas. However, there is often a need for wetland managers to obtain information on wetland functional performance over larger areas. For this purpose, we are proposing a new field-based functional assessment procedure in which wetland functions are evaluated and classified into hydrogeomorphic units according to a multi-criteria analysis approach. Wetland-related geographic information system layers derived from Earth observation data (LiDAR, multi-spectral and radar data) are used in this study for a large-scale functional evaluation. These include maps of a hydrogeomorphic units, ditches, vegetation, annual flood duration, biomass, meadows management, and wetland boundaries. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, a 132 km(2) international long-term ecological research site located in the west of France was assessed. Four wetland functions were evaluated: flood peak attenuation, low water attenuation, denitrification, and habitat. A spatial distribution map of the individual wetland functions was generated, and the intensity levels of the functions were highlighted. Antagonisms between functions within individual hydrogeomorphic units were also identified. Mapping of hydrological, biogeochemical, and ecological wetland functions over large areas can provide an efficient tool for policy makers and other stakeholders including water authorities, nature conservation agencies, and farmers. Specifically, this tool has the potential to provide a mapping of ecosystem services, conservation management priorities, and possible improvements in water resources management.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				NOV	2016	188	11							641	10.1007/s10661-016-5644-1								WOS:000388202300042	27783349

The survey covered an area of 32 km(2) of Olduvai Gorge, and through the use of aerial photos and ground control points from Global Navigation Satellite Systems, an orthomosaic and Digital Surface Model, with a higher than 5 cm/pixel ground resolution, were produced. The Digital Surface Model was then denoised to calculate a Digital Elevation Model, and a high-resolution imaging model of Olduvai Gorge was generated. A preliminary morphometric characterization using Geographic Information Systems shows the potential of this approach when analysing multiple topographic variables in large areas of paleoanthropological relevance, including production of a new map template for Olduvai Gorge and new data for the investigation of sedimentary and tectonic processes. These results constitute one of the first attempts to obtain high quality imagery from large geographic areas amenable to Early Stone Age research, and introduce new workflows for the creation of Digital Elevation Models. Overall, the digital dataset produced is intended to support archaeological and geological investigation in this area, and provide new monitoring tools for the conservation of cultural heritage.

Remote-Sensed Mapping of Sargassum spp. Distribution around Rottnest Island, Western Australia, Using High-Spatial Resolution WorldView-2 Satellite Data	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Satellite remote sensing is one of the most efficient techniques for marine habitat studies in shallow coastal waters, especially in clear waters where field observations can be easily carried out. However, such in situ observations have certain limitations: they are time consuming, have a limited ability to capture spatial variability, and require an interdisciplinary approach between marine biologists and remote-sensing specialists. The main objective of this study was to survey and map Sargassum beds around Rottnest Island, Western Australia, through a combination of high spatial resolution WorldView-2 imagery, using a validated depth invariant index model for water-column correction, and in-field observations. The combination of field survey data and four classification methods resulted in highly accurate classification outcomes that showed the distribution patterns of Sargassum spp. around Rottnest Island during the austral spring season (October 2013). Overall, the minimum distance and Mahalanobis classifiers yielded the highest overall accuracy rates of 98.32% (kappa coefficient, kappa = 0.96) and 98.30% (kappa = 0.96), respectively. The K-means classification method gave the lowest accuracy percentage of 42.50% (kappa = 0.22). Thus, the primary results of this study provide useful baseline information that is necessary for marine-conservation strategic planning and the sustainable utilization of brown macroalgae resources around the Western Australian coast.

The following conceptually derives the definition of these products specifically for NEXRAD weather surveillance radars in the case of biological scatterers. Several cases are presented that illustrate characteristic values and variability of polarimetric quantities for birds and insects, and highlight site-specific differences within the NEXRAD network.

J	Ganasri, BP; Ramesh, H				Ganasri, B. P.; Ramesh, H.			Assessment of soil erosion by RUSLE model using remote sensing and GIS - A case study of Nethravathi Basin	GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS												Soil erosion is a serious problem arising from agricultural intensification, land degradation and other anthropogenic activities. Assessment of soil erosion is useful in planning and conservation works in a watershed or basin. Modelling can provide a quantitative and consistent approach to estimate soil erosion and sediment yield under a wide range of conditions. In the present study, the soil loss model, Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) integrated with GIS has been used to estimate soil loss in the Nethravathi Basin located in the southwestern part of India. The Nethravathi Basin is a tropical coastal humid area having a drainage area of 3128 km(2) up to the gauging station. The parameters of RUSLE model were estimated using remote sensing data and the erosion probability zones were determined using GIS. The estimated rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, topographic and crop management factors range from 2948.16 to 4711.4 MJ/mm.ha(-1)hr(-1)/year, 0.10 to 0.44 t ha(-1).MJ(-1).mm(-1), 0 to 92,774 and 0 to 0.63 respectively. The results indicate that the estimated total annual potential soil loss of about 473,339 t/yr is comparable with the measured sediment of 441,870 t/yr during the water year 2002-2003. The predicted soil erosion rate due to increase in agricultural area is about 14,673.5 t/yr. The probability zone map has been derived by the weighted overlay index method indicate that the major portion of the study area comes under low probability zone and only a small portion comes under high and very high probability zone. The results can certainly aid in implementation of soil management and conservation practices to reduce the soil erosion in the Nethravathi Basin.

We focused on a principal road in Northwest Argentina to test for the effect of seasonality and landscape features on the composition of road-killed wildlife. We conducted regularly scheduled road trips during the dry and wet seasons. We recorded the presence or absence of a vegetation curtain or hedge along the road. We measured land use by remote sensing in a 500 m buffer along the road. We compared the abundance of animals killed between seasons (dry and wet) for different taxonomic groups (mammals, birds and reptiles) and for different origins (domestic and native). We built linear mixed models to test the effect of landscape features on the abundance of killed animals. Two hundred and ninety-three individuals were killed, belonging to 35 species; 75.8 % were native and 24.2 % domestic species. The majority of animals killed were mid-sized mammals. More animals were killed during the dry season. The most important factors to explain the wildlife road-killing were the season and the proportion of agricultural landscape. The composition of the killed animals changed with the season. The proportion of agricultural landscape incremented the number of killed birds and mammals during both seasons, without affecting reptiles. The ratio of wild to domestic animals killed was dependent on the season. This study sets a precedent as the first in road ecology in Northwest Argentina and should be taken into account for road planning and regulation.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												A climate change mitigation mechanism for emissions reduction from reduced deforestation and forest degradation, plus forest conservation, sustainable management of forest, and enhancement of carbon stocks (REDD+), has received an international political support in the climate change negotiations. The mechanism will require, among others, an unprecedented technical capacity for monitoring, reporting and verification of carbon emissions from the forest sector. A functional monitoring, reporting and verification requires inventories of forest area, carbon stock and changes, both for the construction of forest reference emissions level and compiling the report on the actual emissions, which are essentially lacking in developing countries, particularly in Africa. The purpose of this essay is to contribute to a better understanding of the state and prospects of forest monitoring and reporting in the context of REDD+ in Africa. We argue that monitoring and reporting capacities in Africa fall short of the stringent requirements of the methodological guidance for monitoring, reporting and verification for REDD+, and this may weaken the prospects for successfully implementing REDD+ in the continent. We presented the challenges and prospects in the national forest inventory, remote sensing and reporting infrastructures. A North-South, South-South collaboration as well as governments own investments in monitoring, reporting and verification system could help Africa leapfrog in monitoring and reporting. These could be delivered through negotiations for the transfer of technology, technical capacities, and experiences that exist among developed countries that traditionally compile forest carbon reports in the context of the Kyoto protocol.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				NOV	2016	58	5					922	930		10.1007/s00267-016-0762-7								WOS:000385174700013	27605226

However, field data on habitat structure is typically limited in extent. Remote sensing has the potential to overcome these limitations of field-based studies. We aimed to assess abiotic and biotic characteristics of territories used by the declining wood warbler (Phylloscopus sibilatrix), a forest-interior migratory passerine, at two spatial scales by evaluating a priori expectations of habitat selection patterns. First, territories established by males before pairing, referred to as pre-breeding territories, were compared to pseudo-absence control areas located in the wider forested landscape (first spatial scale, N-territories = 66, N-controls = 66). Second, breeding territories of paired wood warblers were compared to true-absence control areas located immediately close-by in the forest (second spatial scale, N-territories = 78, N-controls = 78). Habitat variables predominantly described forest structure and were mainly based on first and last pulse lidar (light detection and ranging) data. Occurrence of pre-breeding territories was related to vegetation height, vertical diversity and stratification, canopy cover, inclination and solar radiation. Occurrence of breeding territories was associated to vegetation height, vertical diversity and inclination. Territory selection at the two spatial scales addressed was governed by similar factors. With respect to conservation, habitat suitability for wood warblers could be retained by maintaining a shifting mosaic of stand ages and structures at large spatial scales. Moreover, leaf-off lidar variables have the potential to contribute to understanding the ecological niche of species in predominantly deciduous forests.

Quantifying spatiotemporal drivers of environmental heterogeneity in Kruger National Park, South Africa	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Environmental heterogeneity is considered an important mechanism of biodiversity. How environmental heterogeneity is characterised by the compositional, structural and functional variation of biotic and abiotic components is a central research theme in conservation. We explore how environmental heterogeneity relates to the underlying physical landscape template and how that relationship changes over space and time. We examine how, in some areas, environmental heterogeneity may also be driven by dynamic ecological processes, and how this relates to patterns of plant species richness. We use local geographically weighted regression to spatially partition environmental heterogeneity, measured as Landsat spectral variance, into the portion explained by stable physical landscape properties (R-2) and the portion unexplained (1-R-2) which we term landscape complexity. We explore how this relationship varies spatially and temporally as a function of dynamic ecological processes such as rainfall and season in Kruger National Park, as well as plant species richness at landscape scales. The significance and direction of relationships varied over space and time and as a function of rainfall and season. R-2 values generally decreased in higher rainfall summer months and revealed patterns describing the importance of known stable factors relative to unknown dynamic factors. Landscape complexity (1-R-2) explained over 70 % of variation in species richness. Rainfall and seasonality are important drivers of environmental heterogeneity. The spatial arrangement and magnitude of model agreement helped disentangle the relative influence of the physical landscape template on environmental heterogeneity. Given the high correlation with species richness, landscape complexity provides complementary guidance to biodiversity research and monitoring prioritization.

The cessation of these activities launches natural regeneration and demographic expansion of formerly fragmented and isolated forests. By tracking these changes over decades, we were able to identify the environmental factors that promote or hamper natural regeneration of forestlands disturbed for centuries. Here, we tracked the demographic expansion of Juniperus turbinata ssp. canariensis over a study period spanning six decades based on aerial pictures. We applied Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) analyses to identify hotspots and coldspots of regeneration and we further quantified the role of ecological and anthropogenic factors in driving natural regeneration by applying a generalized lineal model. Aerial photos showed a clear demographic forest expansion during the approximately 60 years spanned by this study. LISA revealed that this regeneration was not homogeneous across the landscape; rather it was highly aggregated around an increasing number of hotspots of natural regeneration during the study period. The initial density of juniper individuals was the most important variable underpinning the demographic expansion followed by aspect, elevation, and distance to anthropic areas. According to our results, island juniper woodlands regenerate steadily in areas affected by moderate levels of anthropogenic disturbances. Our results provide highly valuable information to implement forest management plans. On-going and future conservation plans to recover the thermophilous Macaronesian forest will particularly benefit from this type of study. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The approach was developed to provide the basis for the management plan of a cluster of Natura 2000 special conservation areas in the Central Apennine mountains, Italy (with a total area of 79,500 ha, including 22,130 ha of grasslands). It includes a novel methodology for estimating sustainable stocking rates of different plant communities, at a detailed spatial scale over large areas, based on the integration of: (i) a classification of grassland types, based on physical habitat stratification and vegetation sampling; (ii) a forage-value assessment of each grassland type, obtained from field sampling of botanical composition and corrected with remote-sensing information on pasture microtopography; (iii) an estimate of primary productivity at a detailed spatial scale, obtained from the remote-sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calibrated with biomass field data. Additionally, to obtain a bioclimatic characterization of the grasslands and to determine the optimal grazing season for each grassland type, intra-annual phenological signatures were obtained from the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Given the inherent limitations in the sustainable stocking rates concept, and the particular susceptibility of dry grasslands to changes in grazing regimes, we tested two biological indicators, the Auchenorrhyncha quality index (AQI) and the Arthropod-based biological soil quality index (QBS-ar). These indicators take into account above- and below-ground arthropod diversity, respectively, and are applied here for the first time to the specific purpose of monitoring grazing load effects on ecological quality and biodiversity of Natura 2000 dry grasslands. We conclude that: (i) it is possible to effectively integrate biomass estimates, obtained from publicly available satellite data, with a relatively simple field sampling of botanical composition, to achieve a detailed spatialization of sustainable stocking rates; (ii) within the same Natura 2000 habitat type there can be a large spatial heterogeneity in both sustainable stocking rates and optimal stocking season: thus, grazing should be kept under careful human control to maintain the habitats in the desired conservation status; (iii) while plant species richness was not correlated to grazing intensity, both AQI and QBS-ar had a significant negative correlation to grazing levels and can thus be useful for monitoring the actual "sustainability" of livestock loads on different aspects of grassland ecosystems.

J	Braunisch, V; Patthey, P; Arlettaz, R				Braunisch, Veronika; Patthey, Patrick; Arlettaz, Raphael			Where to Combat Shrub Encroachment in Alpine Timberline Ecosystems: Combining Remotely-Sensed Vegetation Information with Species Habitat Modelling	PLOS ONE												In many cultural landscapes, the abandonment of traditional grazing leads to encroachment of pastures by woody plants, which reduces habitat heterogeneity and impacts biodiversity typical of semi-open habitats. We developed a framework of mutually interacting spatial models to locate areas where shrub encroachment in Alpine treeline ecosystems deteriorates vulnerable species' habitat, using black grouse Tetrao tetrix (L.) in the Swiss Alps as a study model. Combining field observations and remote-sensing information we 1) identified and located the six predominant treeline vegetation types; 2) modelled current black grouse breeding habitat as a function thereof so as to derive optimal habitat profiles; 3) simulated from these profiles the theoretical spatial extension of breeding habitat when assuming optimal vegetation conditions throughout; and used the discrepancy between (2) and (3) to 4) locate major aggregations of homogeneous shrub vegetation in otherwise suitable breeding habitat as priority sites for habitat restoration. All six vegetation types (alpine pasture, coniferous forest, Alnus viridis (Chaix), Rhododendron-dominated, Juniperus-dominated and mixed heathland) were predicted with high accuracy (AUC > 0.9). Breeding black grouse preferred a heterogeneous mosaic of vegetation types, with none exceeding 50% cover. While 15% of the timberline belt currently offered suitable breeding habitat, twice that fraction (29%) would potentially be suitable when assuming optimal shrub and ground vegetation conditions throughout the study area. Yet, only 10% of this difference was attributed to habitat deterioration by shrub-encroachment of dense heathland (all types 5.2%) and Alnus viridis (4.8%). The presented method provides both a general, large-scale assessment of areas covered by dense shrub vegetation as well as specific target values and priority areas for habitat restoration related to a selected target organism. This facilitates optimizing the spatial allocation of management resources in geographic regions where shrub encroachment represents a major biodiversity conservation issue.																	1932-6203					OCT 11	2016	11	10							e0164318	10.1371/journal.pone.0164318								WOS:000385504400026	27727325

Climate change impacts on regenerating shrubland productivity	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Over the past century, intensive agricultural activity in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, TX, USA, resulted in loss of more than 95% shrub cover. Restoration efforts in these shrublands have resulted in successful reestablishment of native shrubs communities important for carbon sequestration and related wildlife habitat conservation. To examine future climate change effects on restored shrublands, we used the Physiological Principles in Predicting Growth (3-PG) to predict impacts on shrub growth compared to current production. Simulations were performed with 30 m(2) grid cells using monthly incident solar radiation, temperature, precipitation, available soil water holding capacity, and soil fertility within a national wildlife refuge located in the valley. The model was calibrated and confirmed by comparing remote sensing derived aboveground biomass to simulation under current climate conditions with overall good correlation (r(2) = 0.78). The model parameter values were derived from experimental and literatures appropriate for shrub species commonly found in the study area. We assessed climate change effects on simulated shrub biomass by using monthly temperature and precipitation projections for three emissions scenarios for 2050. Predicted aboveground biomass for the current climate (30.78 Mg/ha) was higher compared to that of B1 (29.77 Mg/ha), A1B (27.54 Mg/ha), and A2 (28.01 Mg/ha) emission scenarios. We found that productivity in this shrubland was controlled by VPD and soil fertility. We conclude that restoration efforts within the study area have shown potential for increased carbon sequestration in shrub vegetation under current climate, but future climate change is likely to reduce its carbon uptake efficiency.

J	de Paula, MD; Groeneveld, J; Huth, A				de Paula, Mateus Dantas; Groeneveld, Juergen; Huth, Andreas			The extent of edge effects in fragmented landscapes: Insights from satellite measurements of tree cover	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Due to deforestation, intact tropical forest areas are increasingly transformed into a mixture of remaining forest patches and human modified areas. These forest fragments suffer from edge effects, which cause changes in ecological and ecosystem processes, undermining habitat quality and the offer of ecosystem services. Even though detailed and long term studies were developed on the topic of edge effects at local scale, understanding edge effect characteristics in fragmented forests on larger scales and finding indicators for its impact is crucial for predicting habitat loss and developing management options. Here we evaluate the spatial and temporal dimensions of edge effects in large areas using remote sensing. First we executed a neighborhood pixel analysis in 11 LANDSAT Tree Cover (LTC) scenes (180 x 185 km each, 8 in the tropics and 3 in temperate forested areas) using tree cover as an indicator of habitat quality and in relation to edge distance. Second, we executed a temporal analysis of LTC in a smaller area in the Brazilian Amazon forest where one larger forest fragment (25,890 ha) became completely fragmented in 5 years. Our results show that for all 11 scenes pixel neighborhood variation of LTC is much higher in the vicinity of forest edges, becoming lower towards the forest interior. This analysis suggests a maximum distance for edge effects and can indicate the location of unaffected core areas. However, LTC patterns in relation to fragment edge distance vary according to the analyzed region, and maximum edge distance may differ according to local conditions. Our temporal analysis illustrates the change in tree cover patterns after 5 years of fragmentation, becoming on average lower close to the edge (between 50 and 100 m). Although it is still unclear which are the main causes of LTC edge variability within and between regions, LANDSAT Tree Cover could be used as an accessible and efficient discriminator of edge and interior forest habitats in fragmented landscapes, and become invaluable for deriving qualitative spatial and temporal information of ecological and ecosystem processes.

In this article, we analyze the spatial distribution of multiple-ES indicators at three locations on the pioneer fronts of the Brazilian Amazon. We identify trade-offs and synergies between six ES indicators for soil, vegetation and biodiversity characterization. We also propose spatial representations of multiple-ES indicators (vegetation carbon stocks, rates of water infiltration into soil, soil chemical quality, soil carbon stocks, biodiversity and richness in Sphingidae). Finally, we discuss three different methods to map them depending on the goals of the maps, arguing that maps lean on objective-oriented approaches. The study is based on remote sensing and sampling data from 135 sampling points. We created multiple-ES indicators maps based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a score of ES richness, and discrimination of land cover units. PCA is an appropriate tool for showing high correlations between indicators, nevertheless has notable limitations for visual communication. The scoring method may help mapping ES hotspots, however it fails to consider relationships among them. The land-cover-based method has the advantage of being simple and easy to interpret, still it may not consider important indicators not related to land-cover changes. We discuss the interests and limitations of these different ways to map multiple-ES indicators, regarding the final goals of the maps. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Singh, KP; Kushwaha, CP				Singh, K. P.; Kushwaha, C. P.			Deciduousness in tropical trees and its potential as indicator of climate change: A review	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												In tropical forests, deciduousness is an outcome of integrated effect of drought, tree characteristics and soil moisture conditions and thus it is a reliable indicator of seasonal drought experienced by different tree species. Variations in the deciduousness are associated with several ecophysiological characteristics, such as varying allocation pattern of metabolic products, resource capture and conservation, water relations and stem water storages, annual carbon sequestration, timing of reproductive event initiation, extent of separation of vegetative and reproductive events and leaf strategies, and it helps in maintenance of water balance and protection of tree organs during the seasonal drought. Tropical forests support mosaics of tree functional types showing marked differences in the duration of deciduousness (from leaf exchanging to >8 months deciduous), as a result of varying degree of water stress experienced by physiognomy, distribution and wood anatomy of tropical trees. Wide variations in deciduousness in the same species growing at different sites suggest the high sensitivity of tropical trees to small changes in growing habitat. In the present review we have explored the ecological significance of deciduousness in tropical trees with emphasis on: (a) inter- and intraspecies plasticity in deciduousness, (b) various capacity adaptations related with the duration of deciduousness, (c) relationship between tree stem water status and deciduousness, and (d) probable effect of impending climate change on tropical trees. An attempt has also been made to establish deciduousness as climate change indicator in the dry tropics. There is need to develop capabilities to detect and predict the impact of climate change on deciduousness through long-term phenological network in tropics. Remote sensing techniques can generate valuable ecological information such as leaf level drought response and phenological patterns. Deciduousness has the potential to emerge as an important focus for ecological research to address critical questions in global modeling, monitoring, and climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Assessing impacts to primary productivity at the park edge in Murchison Falls Conservation Area, Uganda	ECOSPHERE												Human activities around parks can alter vegetation patterns within them, resulting in edge effects that degrade their ability to sustain ecological processes and support biodiversity. We quantified vegetation patterns and edge effects over a large geographic extent in Murchison Falls Conservation Area, Uganda, using freely available remotely sensed data. Over a 13-yr period, we quantified seasonal patterns in productivity using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), comparing the park exterior, a boundary zone <= 10 km from the border inside the park, and the park interior. To identify the extent of edge effects, we further fit mixed models by vegetation type within 1-km bands within the boundary zone. Productivity was higher in the park interior than exterior in both wet and dry seasons, and in the wet season, it was also lower in the boundary zone than the interior. NDVI variability differed between seasons; it declined from exterior to interior in the wet season, but was highest in the boundary zone and similar between interior and exterior during the dry season. Within the boundary zone, edge effects varied by land cover type and extended 4-6 km into MFCA. Abrupt differences in vegetation patterns between the park and adjacent unprotected areas indicated a "hard edge" in this system. While hard edges are readily apparent, the subtle changes in productivity that extend into and degrade park systems are harder to detect. We demonstrated a low-cost and novel approach to detect such effects using readily available satellite imagery, which indicated human influence affecting 29-40% of the park. As human populations grow, parks will become further isolated, and measuring and managing edge effects may be crucial to achieving conservation objectives.																	2150-8925					OCT	2016	7	10								10.1002/ecs2.1486								WOS:000387216300025

Using Google Earth Surface Metrics to Predict Plant Species Richness in a Complex Landscape	REMOTE SENSING												Google Earth provides a freely available, global mosaic of high-resolution imagery from different sensors that has become popular in environmental and ecological studies. However, such imagery lacks the near-infrared band often used in studying vegetation, thus its potential for estimating vegetation properties remains unclear. In this study, we assess the potential of Google Earth imagery to describe and predict vegetation attributes. Further, we compare it to the potential of SPOT imagery, which has additional spectral information. We measured basal area, vegetation height, crown cover, density of individuals, and species richness in 60 plots in the oak forests of a complex volcanic landscape in central Mexico. We modelled each vegetation attribute as a function of surface metrics derived from Google Earth and SPOT images, and selected the best-supported linear models from each source. Total species richness was the best-described and predicted variable: the best Google Earth-based model explained nearly as much variation in species richness as its SPOT counterpart (R-2 = 0.44 and 0.51, respectively). However, Google Earth metrics emerged as poor predictors of all remaining vegetation attributes, whilst SPOT metrics showed potential for predicting vegetation height. We conclude that Google Earth imagery can be used to estimate species richness in complex landscapes. As it is freely available, Google Earth can broaden the use of remote sensing by researchers and managers in low-income tropical countries where most biodiversity hotspots are found.

J	Bustamante, J; Aragones, D; Afan, I				Bustamante, Javier; Aragones, David; Afan, Isabel			Effect of Protection Level in the Hydroperiod of Water Bodies on Donana's Aeolian Sands	REMOTE SENSING												Mediterranean temporary ponds on Donana's aeolian sands form an extensive system of small dynamic water bodies, dependent on precipitation and groundwater, of considerable importance for biodiversity conservation. Different areas of the aeolian sands have received different levels of environmental protection since 1969, and this has influenced the degree of conservation and the flooding dynamic of these temporary surface waters. We use the Landsat series of satellite images from 1985 to 2014 to study the temporal dynamic of small temporary water bodies on the aeolian sands in relation to the protection level and to distance to water abstraction pressures from agriculture and residential areas. The results show that even with small and ephemeral water bodies optical remote sensing time-series are an effective way to study their flooding temporal dynamics. The protected areas of the aeolian sands hold a better preserved system of temporary ponds, with a flooding dynamic that fluctuates with precipitation. The unprotected area shows an increase in mean hydroperiod duration, and surface flooded, and a decline in hydroperiod variability. This seems to be due to the creation of irrigation ponds and the artificialization of the flooding regime of the natural temporary ponds, that either receive excess irrigation water or dry-up due to the lowering of the groundwater table level. Although a decline in hydroperiod duration of temporary ponds is seen as negative to the system, an increase in hydroperiod of surface waters due to artificialization, or a decline in variability cannot be considered as positive compensatory effects.

Land-use change affects water recycling in Brazil's last agricultural frontier	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Historically, conservation-oriented research and policy in Brazil have focused on Amazon deforestation, but a majority of Brazil's deforestation and agricultural expansion has occurred in the neighboring Cerrado biome, a biodiversity hotspot comprised of dry forests, woodland savannas, and grasslands. Resilience of rainfed agriculture in both biomes likely depends on water recycling in undisturbed Cerrado vegetation; yet little is known about how changes in land-use and land-cover affect regional climate feedbacks in the Cerrado. We used remote sensing techniques to map land-use change across the Cerrado from 2003 to 2013. During this period, cropland agriculture more than doubled in area from 1.2 to 2.5 million ha, with 74% of new croplands sourced from previously intact Cerrado vegetation. We find that these changes have decreased the amount of water recycled to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration ( ET) each year. In 2013 alone, cropland areas recycled 14 km(3) less ( -3%) water than if the land cover had been native Cerrado vegetation. ET from single-cropping systems ( e. g., soybeans) is less than from natural vegetation in all years, except in the months of January and February, the height of the growing season. In double-cropping systems ( e. g., soybeans followed by corn), ET is similar to or greater than natural vegetation throughout a majority of the wet season ( December-May). As intensification and extensification of agricultural production continue in the region, the impacts on the water cycle and opportunities for mitigation warrant consideration. For example, if an environmental goal is to minimize impacts on the water cycle, double cropping ( intensification) might be emphasized over extensification to maintain a landscape that behaves more akin to the natural system.

Geographic information systems (GIS) and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) have been increasingly used to improve the management of vulnerable ecosystems to prevent further degradation and increase the sustainability of land use. This study presents a methodology to assess land suitability using remote sensing (RS) to obtain wall-to-wall data for the calculations, GIS to analyze the data, and MCDA to rank alternative land uses. The criteria and subcriteria affecting the suitability of land for different uses were identified and weighted using an analytic hierarchy process. Variables used as subcriteria were assessed using satellite data and other sources of information such as existing maps and field surveys. Numerical values for the subcriteria were classified, and each class was given a priority rating according to expert judgments. Based on the ratings and weights of the subcriteria, a priority map was created for each land use using the weighted linear combination method. The priority maps for different land uses were overlaid to obtain a preliminary land use map, which often indicated several simultaneous land uses for the same location. The preliminary map was further edited by removing unrealistic, mutually exclusive land-use combinations. The study tested and demonstrated the potential of integrating RS, GIS and MCDA techniques for solving complicated land allocation problems in forested regions using a scientifically sound and practical approach for efficient and sustainable allocation of forest-land for different uses.																	1007-662X	1993-0607				OCT	2016	27	5					1127	1135		10.1007/s11676-016-0242-1								WOS:000386357500017						
J	Cucci, C; Delaney, JK; Picollo, M				Cucci, Costanza; Delaney, John K.; Picollo, Marcello			Reflectance Hyperspectral Imaging for Investigation of Works of Art: Old Master Paintings and Illuminated Manuscripts	ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH												Diffuse reflectance hyperspectral imaging, or reflectance imaging spectroscopy, is a sophisticated technique that enables the capture of hundreds of images in contiguous narrow spectral bands (bandwidth < 10 nm), typically in the visible (Vis, 400-750 nm) and the near-infrared (NIR, 750-2500 ni-n) regions. This sequence of images provides a data set that is called an image-cube or file-cube. Two dimensions of the image-cube are the spatial dimensions of the scene, and the third dimension is the wavelength. In this way, each spatial pixel in the image has an associated reflectance spectrum. This "big data" image-cube allows for the mining of artists' materials and mapping their distribution across the surface of a work of art. Reflectance hyperspectral imaging, introduced in the 1980s by Goetz and coworkers, led to a revolution in the field of remote sensing of the earth and near planets (Goetz, F. H.; Vane, G.; Solomon, B. N.; Rock, N. Imaging Spectrometry for Earth Remote Sensing. Science, 1985, 228, 1147-1152). In the subsequent decades, thanks to rapid advances in solid-state sensor technology, reflectance hyperspectral imaging, once only available to large government laboratories, was extended to new fields of application, such as monitoring agri-foods, pharmaceutical products, the environment, and cultural heritage. In the 2000s, the potential of this noninvasive technology for the study of artworks became evident and, consequently, the methodology is becoming more widely used in the art conservation science field. Typically hyperspectral reflectance image-cubes contain millions of spectra. Many of these spectra are similar, making the reduction of the data set size an important first step. Thus, image-processing tools based on multivariate techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), automated classification methods, or expert knowledge systems, that search for known spectral features are often applied. These algorithms seek to reduce the large number of high-quality spectra to a common subset, which allow identifying and mapping artists' materials and alteration products. Hence, reflectance hyperspectral imaging is finding its place as the starting point to find sites on polychrome surfaces for spot analytical,techniques, such as X-ray fluorescence, Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Reflectance hyperspectral imaging can also provide image products that are a mainstay in the art conservation field, such as, color-accurate images, broadband near-infrared images, and false-color products. This Account reports on the research activity carried out by two research groups, one at the "Nello Carrara" Institute of Applied Physics of the Italian National Research Council (IFAC CNR) in Florence and the other at the National Gallery of Art (NGA) in Washington, D.C. Both groups have conducted parallel research, with frequent interchanges, to develop multispectral and hyperspectral imaging systems to study works of art. In the past decade, they have designed and experimented with some of the earliest spectral imaging prototypes for museum applications. In this Account, a brief presentation of the hyperspectral sensor systems is given with case studies showing how reflectance hyperspectral imaging is answering key questions in cultural heritage.

Regards to water resources limitations in these regions, prioritization of management strategies is essential to ecosystem conservation and restoration, particularly during the breeding season of waterbirds. The present study sought to develop a spatial conservation prioritization approach based on remote sensing and geographical information system to identify areas of a wetland which require special protective measures during waterbirds' breeding season. After the extraction of spatial information from Landsat 8 time series data, maximum entropy and weighted linear combination (WLC) methods were used to identify areas with higher conservation priority. Firstly, waterbirds' habitat suitability map during their nesting time in Hamun Wetland was constructed. Then, Habitat suitability changes until the end of the nestling period were evaluated and areas providing suitable conditions for longer periods were identified. Moreover, areas with suitable conditions in the beginning of breeding season but unsuitable conditions ( caused by the drying of the wetland) in the nestling period were also determined. Considering limited water availability in the study area, carefully designed management strategies are required to conserve waterbird habitats in such parts of the wetland which are at higher risk of drying. The results of this paper highlighted areas with high conservation priority in a wetland with water limitation.

In many applications the user only requires a map of one particular class of interest, e.g. a specific vegetation type or an invasive species. One-class classifiers are appealing alternatives to common supervised classifiers because they can be trained with labeled training data of the class of interest only. However, training an accurate one-class classification (OCC) model is challenging, particularly when facing a large image, a small class and few training samples. To tackle these problems we propose an iterative OCC approach. The presented approach uses a biased Support Vector Machine as core classifier. In an iterative pre-classification step a large part of the pixels not belonging to the class of interest is classified. The remaining data is classified by a final classifier with a novel model and threshold selection approach. The specific objective of our study is the classification of raised bogs in a study site in southeast Germany, using multi-seasonal RapidEye data and a small number of training sample. Results demonstrate that the iterative OCC outperforms other state of the art one-class classifiers and approaches for model selection. The study highlights the potential of the proposed approach for an efficient and improved mapping of small classes such as raised bogs. Overall the proposed approach constitutes a feasible approach and useful modification of a regular one-class classifier. (C) 2016 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Marine ecosystems are indeed largely composed by microbial planktonic communities whose niches are affected by highly dynamical physico-chemical conditions, and whose observation requires advanced methods for morphological and molecular classification. Optical remote sensing offers an appealing complement to these in-situ techniques. Global scale coverage at high spatiotemporal resolution is however achieved at the cost of restrained information on the local assemblage. Here, we use a coupled physical and ecological model ocean simulation to explore one possible metrics for comparing measures performed on such different scales. We show that a large part of the local diversity of the virtual plankton ecosystem - corresponding to what accessible by genomic methods - can be inferred from crude, but spatially extended, information - as conveyed by remote sensing. Shannon diversity of the local community is indeed highly correlated to a 'seascape' index, which quantifies the surrounding spatial heterogeneity of the most abundant functional group. The error implied in drastically reducing the resolution of the plankton community is shown to be smaller in frontal regions as well as in regions of intermediate turbulent energy. On the spatial scale of hundreds of kms, patterns of virtual plankton diversity are thus largely sustained by mixing communities that occupy adjacent niches. We provide a proof of principle that in the open ocean information on spatial variability of communities can compensate for limited local knowledge, suggesting the possibility of integrating in-situ and satellite observations to monitor biodiversity distribution at the global scale.

This study uses CLASIite algorithms and social surveys to identify drivers, measure, analyze and map deforestation, and forest degradation that occurred in Toledo's ecosystems and Protected Areas as a result of the increased anthropogenic activity reported in 2010-2012. The social surveys indicated that land and institutional policy, distance to markets and lack of alternative livelihoods are the main drivers of deforestation and forest degradation. Of importance are the strong significant differences that exist between communities that were less than 2 km from a protected area (CL2K) and communities that were more than 2 km from a protected area (CM2K) regarding property rights (Cramer's V = 0.562, p < 0.001), selective logging (Cramer's V = 0.499, p < 0.001) and soil quality (Cramer's V = 0.434, p < 0.001). The results of the deforestation and forest degradation analysis indicate that in 2009-2011 and 2011-2012 the annual rates of deforestation were 0.75% (2480 ha) and 1.17% (3834 ha) respectively and the annual rates of forest degradation in 2009-2011 and 2011-2012 were 0.09% (307 ha) and 0.33% (1110 ha) respectively. In 2009-2011 only 9.34% of forest loss occurred inside protected areas in comparison to 2011-2012 where 23.97% of forest loss occurred inside protected areas. In 2011-2012 out of the 1110 ha of degradation 30.38% occurred in Lowland broad-leaved wet forest and 19.39% occurred in Sub-montane broad-leaved wet forest. The maps and statistics generated in this study pinpoint in which ecosystem types and protected areas major forest change and forest disturbance occurred. By utilizing the data generated by this study, Belize's forest management organizations will be able to efficiently allocate resources to forested areas that are being threatened; thus, more effectively mitigate deforestation and forest degradation of important forest ecosystems.

Toward quantification of the impact of 21st-century deforestation on the extinction risk of terrestrial vertebrates	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Conservation actions need to be prioritized, often taking into account species' extinction risk. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List provides an accepted, objective framework for the assessment of extinction risk. Assessments based on data collected in the field are the best option, but the field data to base these on are often limited. Information collected through remote sensing can be used in place of field data to inform assessments. Forests are perhaps the best-studied land-cover type for use of remote-sensing data. Using an open-access 30-m resolution map of tree cover and its change between 2000 and 2012, we assessed the extent of forest cover and loss within the distributions of 11,186 forest-dependent amphibians, birds, and mammals worldwide. For 16 species, forest loss resulted in an elevated extinction risk under red-list criterion A, owing to inferred rapid population declines. This number increased to 23 when data-deficient species (i.e., those with insufficient information for evaluation) were included. Under red-list criterion B2, 484 species (855 when data-deficient species were included) were considered at elevated extinction risk, owing to restricted areas of occupancy resulting from little forest cover remaining within their ranges. The proportion of species of conservation concern would increase by 32.8% for amphibians, 15.1% for birds, and 24.7% for mammals if our suggested uplistings are accepted. Central America, the Northern Andes, Madagascar, the Eastern Arc forests in Africa, and the islands of Southeast Asia are hotspots for these species. Our results illustrate the utility of satellite imagery for global extinction-risk assessment and measurement of progress toward international environmental agreement targets. Hacia la Cuantificacion del Impacto de la Deforestacion del Siglo XXI sobre el Riesgo de Extincion de los Vertebrados Terrestres Las acciones de conservacion necesitan ser priorizadas, considerando con frecuencia el riesgo de extincion de las especies. La Lista Roja de la Union Internacional para la Conservacion de la Naturaleza (UICN) proporciona un marco de trabajo objetivo y aceptado para la valoracion del riesgo de extincion. Las valoraciones basadas en los datos colectados en el campo son la mejor opcion, pero los datos de campo sobre los cuales basar las valoraciones con frecuencia son limitados. Los datos colectados por medio de la teledeteccion pueden usarse en lugar de los datos de campo para informar a las valoraciones. Los bosques tal vez sean el tipo de cubierta de suelo mejor estudiado para el uso de datos de teledeteccion. Con un mapa de acceso abierto y resolucion de 30-m de la cobertura de arboles y su cambio entre 2000 y 2012, valoramos la extension de la cobertura de bosque y la perdida dentro de las distribuciones de 11, 186 especies de anfibios, aves y mamiferos dependientes del bosque a nivel mundial. Para 16 especies, la perdida del bosque resulto en un riesgo de extincion elevado, bajo el criterio A de la lista roja, debido a las declinaciones rapidas de poblacion inferidas. Este numero incremento a 23 cuando las especies con deficiencia de datos (es decir, aquellas con informacion insuficiente para su evaluacion) fueron incluidas. Bajo el criterio B2 de la lista roja, 484 especies (855 cuando se incluyeron las especies con deficiencia de datos) se consideraron con riesgo alto de extincion, debido a las areas restringidas de ocupacion como resultado de la pequena cobertura del bosque que permanece dentro de su distribucion. La proporcion de especies de interes para la conservacion incrementaria en 32.8 % para los anfibios, 15.1 % para las aves y 24.7 % para los mamiferos si nuestros cambios de categoria sugeridos son aceptados. America Central, los Andes del norte, Madagascar, los bosques del Arco Oriental de africa y las islas del sureste asiatico son puntos clave para estas especies. Nuestros resultados ilustran la utilidad de las imagenes satelitales para la valoracion global de la extincion de riesgo y para la medicion del progreso hacia los objetivos de los acuerdos ambientales internacionales.

J	Braun, AC; Koch, B				Braun, Andreas Christian; Koch, Barbara			Estimating impacts of plantation forestry on plant biodiversity in southern Chile-a spatially explicit modelling approach	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Monitoring the impacts of land-use practices is of particular importance with regard to biodiversity hotspots in developing countries. Here, conserving the high level of unique biodiversity is challenged by limited possibilities for data collection on site. Especially for such scenarios, assisting biodiversity assessments by remote sensing has proven useful. Remote sensing techniques can be applied to interpolate between biodiversity assessments taken in situ. Through this approach, estimates of biodiversity for entire landscapes can be produced, relating land-use intensity to biodiversity conditions. Such maps are a valuable basis for developing biodiversity conservation plans. Several approaches have been published so far to interpolate local biodiversity assessments in remote sensing data. In the following, a new approach is proposed. Instead of inferring biodiversity using environmental variables or the variability of spectral values, a hypothesis-based approach is applied. Empirical knowledge about biodiversity in relation to land-use is formalized and applied as ascription rules for image data. The method is exemplified for a large study site (over 67,000 km(2)) in central Chile, where forest industry heavily impacts plant diversity. The proposed approach yields a coefficient of correlation of 0.73 and produces a convincing estimate of regional biodiversity. The framework is broad enough to be applied to other study sites.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				OCT	2016	188	10							564	10.1007/s10661-016-5547-1								WOS:000384330800022	27629554

Waking the Sleeping Giant: Agricultural intensification, extensification or stagnation in Mali's Guinea Savannah	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS												The World Bank argued that West Africa's Guinea Savannah zone forms part of "Africa's Sleeping Giant,"where increases in agricultural production could be an engine of economic growth, through expansion of cultivated land in sparsely populated areas. The district of Bougouni, in southern Mali, falls within this zone. We used multiple data sources including a panel survey, remote sensing-based land cover classification, population data, and farmer focus group discussions, to investigate whether the area is following a commonly-described pathway of agricultural intensification due to increasing land scarcity. We then used our understanding of historical change to explore plausible future pathways. Bougouni forms part of the expansion zone of the CMDT, which since the mid-1980s has provided support for intensive agricultural systems of cotton-maize rotations with animal traction and use of mineral fertilizer. In the period of the panel survey (1994-2012), cropped land at household level was correlated with household size: households with less than one full team of draft oxen cultivated 0.50 ha/family member, while households with two or more teams cultivated 0.82 ha/family member (R-2 > 0.8). At the village level, cropped land increases varied with the amount of remaining available land and the importance of off-farm income. We see some intensification in maize and cotton, and corresponding improvements in food self-sufficiency. However, despite increasing fertilizer use, average maize and cotton yields remain around 1600 and 900 kg/ha respectively, well below national averages. Other crops are still grown in outfields relying on long fallows with limited nutrient inputs. Thus rather than either intensification or extensification the agricultural situation may be best described as stagnation. This may be due to limited incentives to invest in agriculture when compared to opportunities such as gold mining or small businesses, which (in 2012) contribute at least 25% of household income to ten out of 29 households. In future, cropland expansion will likely continue, which could lead to increased conflict between farmers and transhumant herders, and could lead to increased inequality at village level. Factors mitigating the tendency to land expansion include opportunities for off-farm income and migration, or market opportunities and capacity to produce high-value crops such as mango, cashew, or vegetables. This could preserve some remaining savannah area for grazing use and conservation purposes. Understanding household livelihood systems as part of a network of complex social and ecological factors allows the identification and exploration of multiple viable pathways towards desirable futures.

In tropical areas, hosting large biomass and biodiversity resources which are often threatened by unsustainable anthropogenic pressures, frequent forest resources monitoring is needed. Lidar is a powerful tool to estimate aboveground biomass at fine resolution; however its application in tropical forests has been limited, with high variability in the accuracy of results. Lidar pulses scan the forest vertical profile, and can provide structure information which is also linked to biodiversity. In the last decade the remote sensing of biodiversity has received great attention, but few studies focused on the use of lidar for assessing tree species richness in tropical forests. This research aims at estimating aboveground,biomass and tree species richness using discrete return airborne lidar in Ghana forests. We tested an advanced statistical technique, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), which does not require assumptions on data distribution or on the relationships between variables, being suitable for studying ecological variables. We compared the MARS regression results with those obtained by multilinear regression and found that both algorithms were effective, but MARS provided higher accuracy either for biomass (R-2 = 0.72) and species richness (R-2 = 0.64). We also noted strong correlation between biodiversity and biomass field values. Even if the forest areas under analysis are limited in extent and represent peculiar ecosystems, the preliminary indications produced by our study suggest that instrument such as lidar, specifically useful for pinpointing forest structure, can also be exploited as a support for tree species richness assessment.

Sudhakar			Geospatial Analysis of Reed Bamboo (Ochlandra travancorica) Invasion in Western Ghats, India	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Spatial and temporal trends of invasion by Ochlandra travancorica, a native reed bamboo species were studied. The study was carried out in Agasthyamalai Biosphere reserve, Western Ghats, India. Multi-temporal satellite images from 1973 to 2012 were utilized to map the areas of occurrence of the species. The largest areal extent of the species was calculated to be 111.65 km(2) in the recent time, at which the invasion process reached its saturation phase. The species was found to be a generalist, with no preferred inclination towards any particular topographic or climatic zone. Evergreen forests were established to be its closest associate with largest area followed by semi evergreen and moist deciduous forests within buffer distances of 100, 200 and 500 m. A threatening 20.8 % of evergreen forests were revealed to have been converted to pure reed bamboos. Overlay analysis showed the oldest and the newest surviving patches of pure reed bamboos in the landscape of Agasthyamalai. The study realizes the significance of remote sensing and GIS in mapping and monitoring of invasive species. We suggest periodical monitoring of reed bamboo areas to check its growth, spread and establishment in order to ensure conservation of Western Ghats.																	0255-660X	0974-3006				OCT	2016	44	5					699	711		10.1007/s12524-015-0534-5								WOS:000382664900004

Flash floods pose significant threats to socio-economic development in the region. This study assessed flash floods risk in the greater Nuweiba area in support of mitigation planning. Our approach evaluated topographic, hydrological, and geological factors holistically to rank areas of high, median, and low flash floods risk along the Wadi Watir. Data from field surveys, Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) imagery, and Shuttle Radar Terrain Model (SRTM) were analyzed through digital image processing and spatial analysis to characterize lithology, soil types, land cover, and hydrological morphometrics. The morphometric parameters were used to evaluate the most sensitive sub-basins for flooding and create the flash flood susceptibility map. Soil Conservation Service (SCS) Rainfall-Runoff model was used to estimate hydrological responses at ungauged catchments, including runoff depth, lag time, and peak discharge. We spatially integrated all the risk factors and created a flash floods risk map as the practical geospatial assessment of flash flood risk in the greater Nuweiba area. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Management of Protected Areas and Its Effect on an Ecosystem Function: Removal of Prosopis flexuosa Seeds by Mammals in Argentinian Drylands	PLOS ONE												The ecological function of animal seed dispersal depends on species interactions and can be affected by drivers such as the management interventions applied to protected areas. This study was conducted in two protected areas in the Monte Desert: a fenced reserve with grazing exclusion and absence of large native mammals (the Man and Biosphere Nacunan Reserve; FR) and an unfenced reserve with low densities of large native and domestic animals (Ischigualasto Park; UFR). The study focuses on Prosopis flexuosa seed removal by different functional mammal groups: "seed predators", "scatter-hoarders", and "opportunistic frugivores". Under both interventions, the relative contribution to seed removal by different functional mammal groups was assessed, as well as how these groups respond to habitat heterogeneity (i.e. vegetation structure) at different spatial scales. Camera traps were used to identify mammal species removing P. flexuosa seeds and to quantify seed removal; remote sensing data helped analyze habitat heterogeneity. In the FR, the major fruit removers were a seed predator (Graomys griseoflavus) and a scatter-hoarder (Microcavia asutralis). In the UFR, the main seed removers were the opportunistic frugivores (Lycalopex griseus and Dolichotis patagonum), who removed more seeds than the seed predator in the FR. The FR shows higher habitat homogeneity than the UFR, and functional groups respond differently to habitat heterogeneity at different spatial scales. In the FR, because large herbivores are locally extinct (e.g. Lama guanicoe) and domestic herbivores are excluded, important functions of large herbivores are missing, such as the maintenance of habitat heterogeneity, which provides habitats for medium-sized opportunistic frugivores with consequent improvement of quality and quantity of seed dispersal services. In the UFR, with low densities of large herbivores, probably one important ecosystem function this group performs is to increase habitat heterogeneity, allowing for the activity of medium-sized mammals who, behaving as opportunistic frugivores, did the most significant seed removal.

J	Oliveras, I; Malhi, Y				Oliveras, Immaculada; Malhi, Yadvinder			Many shades of green: the dynamic tropical forest-savannah transition zones	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												The forest-savannah transition is the most widespread ecotone in tropical areas, separating two of the most productive terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we review current understanding of the factors that shape this transition, and how it may change under various drivers of local or global change. At broadest scales, the location of the transition is shaped by water availability, mediated strongly at local scales by fire regimes, herbivory pressure and spatial variation in soil properties. The frequently dynamic nature of this transition suggests that forest and savannah can exist as alternative stable states, maintained and separated by fire-grass feedbacks and tree shade fire suppression feedback. However, this theory is still contested and the relative contributions of the main biotic and abiotic drivers and their interactions are yet not fully understood. These drivers interplay with a wide range of ecological processes and attributes at the global, continental, regional and local scales. The evolutionary history of the biotic and abiotic drivers and processes plays an important role in the current distributions of these transitions as well as in their species composition and ecosystem functioning. This ecotone can be sensitive to shifts in climate and other driving factors, but is also potentially stabilized by negative feedback processes. There is abundant evidence that these transitions are shifting under contemporary global and local changes, but the direction of shift varies according to region. However, it still remains uncertain how these transitions will respond to rapid and multi-faceted ongoing current changes, and how increasing human influence will interact with these shifts.

Until recently, no study has been done to quantify or estimate the colony sizes of these inhabitants in spite of the grave danger posed to this avifauna by human activities and potential habitat loss to postspeleogenetic processes. This paper evaluates the transferability of a hybrid optimization image analysis-based method developed to detect and count cave roosting birds. The method utilizes high-resolution terrestrial laser scanning intensity image. First, segmentation parameters were optimized by integrating objective function and the statistical Taguchi methods. Thereafter, the optimized parameters were used as input into the segmentation and classification processes using two images selected from Simud Hitam (lower cave) and Simud Putih (upper cave) of the Gomantong cave. The result shows that the method is capable of detecting birds (and bats) from the image for accurate population censusing. A total number of 9998 swiftlet birds were counted from the first image while 1132 comprising of both bats and birds were obtained from the second image. Furthermore, the transferability evaluation yielded overall accuracies of 0.93 and 0.94 (area under receiver operating characteristic curve) for the first and second image, respectively, with p value of <0.0001 at 95% confidence level. The findings indicate that the method is not only efficient for the detection and counting cave birds for which it was developed for but also useful for counting bats; thus, it can be adopted in any cave.

J	Larsen, A; May, JH; Moss, P; Hacker, J				Larsen, Annegret; May, Jan-Hendrik; Moss, Patrick; Hacker, Jorg			Could alluvial knickpoint retreat rather than fire drive the loss of alluvial wet monsoon forest, tropical northern Australia?	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Drainage rejuvenation through headward migration of alluvial knickpoints is common in ephemeral semi-arid streams, but has not yet been described for tropical rivers. In the Australian monsoon tropics (AMT), wet monsoon forests have an important ecological function, and are present along many alluvial valleys and springs within a eucalypt-savanna dominated landscape. Using a combination of LiDAR, remote sensing and field evidence, we observe the ongoing destruction of wet monsoon forest through hydro-geomorphic feedbacks, along with the headward retreat of an alluvial knickpoint at Wangi Creek in Litchfield National Park, Northern Territory. Due to the highly transmissive shallow aquifer along the lower Wangi Creek, this knickpoint retreat leads to a downstream drop in in-channel water level, which in turn drives a decrease in the local groundwater table. The lowered groundwater level causes the shallow anabranches and formerly water saturated peaty floodplain soil to desiccate, which results in a reduction of vegetation density. The resulting dry surface conditions allow annual to bi-annual high frequency low-intensity fires to affect the monsoon forest, while wet rainforest upstream of the knickpoint remains intact. In this paper, we argue that such hydro-geomorphic feedbacks may cause the initial destabilization of the forest, which then provides the necessary conditions for the impact of fire. This scenario thus challenges the prevalent view that fire is a first-order control on the spatial extent of wet monsoonal rainforest in the study area, and provides a new and testable hypothesis for further studies in the AMT.

Eco-water resource levels indicate conservation ability for the eco-water layer and influence of this on precipitation transformation and runoff regulation. The remote sensing quantitative inversion retrieved the MEC (Modulus of eco-water Conservation) of the Upper Minjiang River Basin study area in 1994 and 2001, and combined with climate data between 1990 and 2005, the influence of conservation water on the eco-water layer on runoff was then analyzed. Results revealed significant efficacy for flood control and water supply during the drought from the hydrologic cycle of eco-water. Thus protection and restoration of the eco-water layer for flood and drought prevention are crucial.																	1794-6190					SEP	2016	20	3					E1	E6		10.15446/esrj.v20n2.55177								WOS:000393023200005

The connection of forest fragments through ecological corridors is an important step in biodiversity conservation. Certain areas are more resilient, and in those areas, natural forest regeneration, for example, can be encouraged. The aim of this study was to identify areas of greater resilience in order to support the connection of Atlantic Forest fragments with ecological corridors. Forest fragments in the municipality of Paraiba do Sul, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, were mapped using the supervised maximum likelihood classification of an Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Landsat-8 sensor image. Next, we analyzed the influence of terrain attributes (aspect, incident solar radiation, slope, and curvature profile) on natural regeneration. The areas with the greatest potential to achieve natural regeneration and to form ecological corridors were indicated through fuzzy membership functions. Within Paraiba do Sul, 31% of the territory is covered by vegetation in different stages of regeneration. Recordings were made of 1,251 forest fragments in a middle or advanced stage of regeneration. These fragments are usually situated in the southeast, south, and southwest aspects, in areas that receive the least amount of global solar radiation (Wh.m(-2)) per year, and on slopes with an angle of inclination greater than 20%. The adjustment of fuzzy functions identified 17,327.5 ha with a tendency to recover, and which are therefore strategic areas in the development of ecological corridors.																	0100-6762					SEP-OCT	2016	40	5					803	813		10.1590/0100-67622016000500004								WOS:000391439500004

Mapping Suitable Lewis's Woodpecker Nesting Habitat in a Post-Fire Landscape	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												As remote sensing mapping products representing important habitat components increase in availability, detail, and accuracy, new opportunities arise to map predicted habitat for forest species of conservation concern. One such species is the Lewis's woodpecker which is a species of conservation interest in multiple states and throughout its range in British Columbia, Canada with habitat loss and degradation proposed as contributing factors in the species decline. The purpose of this study was to model and map Lewis's woodpecker nesting habitat using primary (directly derived) and secondary (modeled using ground calibration data) remote sensing products, as well as contribute to the knowledge of nesting ecology for the species in a source habitat type. We found promise in the utility of lidar and Landsat time series modeled snag and shrub products in conjunction with additional lidar structure and topographic metrics for predicting nesting habitat for the Lewis's woodpecker across a post-fire landscape. Our selected model had a percent correctly classified rate of 83.3% and contained additional variables (variability in canopy cover and topographic slope) to those included in the Fish and Wildlife Service habitat suitability model (HSM) for the species (canopy cover, shrub cover, and density of large snags). We were able to apply the remote sensing products to map realized habitat relationships for this species of conservation concern in an identified source habitat type, providing a potential resource for local scale conservation and management efforts and adding to the regional knowledge of habitat selection for the Lewis's woodpecker.																	0029-344X	2161-9859				SEP	2016	90	4					421	432		10.3955/046.090.0404								WOS:000390559700004

Monitoring was done for 14 years in 14,076 ha of the basin of Rio do Peixe, which was selected for being the most degraded one in the state of Salo Paulo, Brazil, circumscribing 176 farms, basically explored with pastures and coffee. Out of these farms, 82 showed some kind of erosion, besides 12 stretches of municipal roads that contributed to the erosion processes in the agricultural areas. The conservationist soil and water management practices established in 86 of the farms at the basin allow positive changes on the landscape and on the income from agricultural activity, which were shown in the aerial photos and by the water quality indicators. The adopted monitoring and agri-environmental rehabilitation methodologies are viable and may contribute to managing and monitoring microbasins.																	0100-204X	1678-3921				SEP	2016	51	9					1099	1109		10.1590/S0100-204X2016000900009								WOS:000388061600012

An atmospheric correction was applied to the images, which was followed by the assessment of the following aspects: spectral response to different targets in the uncorrected and corrected images; accuracy of the orthorectified image; and accuracy of the supervised classification. The atmospheric correction allowed a better evaluation of the spectral response of the targets. The geometrical evaluation according to the Map Accuracy Standards, classified the orthorectified image in class C at the 1:20,000 scale.

For this, PAs can be characterized according to their species, ecosystems and threats, but such information is often difficult to access and usually not comparable across regions. There are currently over 200,000 PAs in the world, and assessing these systematically according to their ecological values remains a huge challenge. However, linking remote sensing with ecological modelling can help to overcome some limitations of conservation studies, such as the sampling bias of biodiversity inventories. The aim of this paper is to introduce eHabitat+, a habitat modelling service supporting the European Commission's Digital Observatory for Protected Areas, and specifically to discuss a component that systematically stratifies PAs into different habitat functional types based on remote sensing data. eHabitat+ uses an optimized procedure of automatic image segmentation based on several environmental variables to identify the main biophysical gradients in each PA. This allows a systematic production of key indicators on PAs that can be compared globally. Results from a few case studies are illustrated to show the benefits and limitations of this open-source tool.

Using genetic fingerprinting, we contrasted extant connectivity in island-dwelling Peary caribou in northern Canada with continental-migratory caribou. We next examined if sea-ice contractions in the last decades modulated population connectivity and explored the possible impact of future climate change on long-term connectivity among island caribou. We found a strong correlation between genetic and geodesic distances for both continental and Peary caribou, even after accounting for the possible effect of sea surface. Sea ice has thus been an effective corridor for Peary caribou, promoting inter-island connectivity and population mixing. Using a time series of remote sensing sea-ice data, we show that landscape resistance in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago has increased by approximately 15% since 1979 and may further increase by 20-77% by 2086 under a high-emission scenario (RCP8.5). Under the persistent increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, reduced connectivity may isolate island-dwelling caribou with potentially significant consequences for population viability.

Assessing the Distribution and Changes of Instream Woody Habitat in South-Eastern Australian Rivers	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Managers and communities are now artificially reintroducing instream woody habitat (IWH) to rivers following historic large-scale removal. Riverscape-scale datasets that quantify existing habitat conditions are fundamental to setting the priorities and allocating resources for such programs. Unfortunately, such datasets are rare, primarily because existing assessment approaches are limited in their accuracy (remote sensing) or are costly and labour intensive (field assessments). This study used both field assessments and aerial data to improve the accuracy of remotely sensed measures of IWH and estimate current IWH volumes and subsequent condition (compared with reference levels) across approximately 28000km of stream in the south-eastern Australian state of Victoria. We found that aerial measures, when used in conjunction with measures of stream size and riparian overhang, produced significantly better estimates of IWH loads than using aerial data alone. The statewide assessment indicated that streams currently have IWH volumes, on average, 41% lower than reference levels that represented an average reduction of 0.0207m(3)m(-2). The degree of IWH condition was highly variable across regions (20-95% reductions from reference levels), a likely reflection of regional variation in land use practices and past river work activities. This scale of IWH reduction may pose major negative impacts on the ecological integrity of these streams. Whilst the approach used during this study has temporal and spatial limitations, it was designed as a generalised, rapid and relatively inexpensive method to measure stream condition and assist with priority setting at state and regional levels.

J	Allen, Y				Allen, Y.			Landscape Scale Assessment of Floodplain Inundation Frequency Using Landsat Imagery	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												In large river ecosystems, the timing, extent, duration and frequency of floodplain inundation greatly affect the quality of fish and wildlife habitat and the supply of important ecosystem goods and services. Seasonal high flows provide connectivity from the river to the floodplain, and seasonal inundation of the floodplain governs ecosystem structure and function. River regulation and other forms of hydrologic alteration have altered the connectivity of many rivers with their adjacent floodplain - impacting the function of wetlands on the floodplain and in turn, impacting the mainstem river function. Conservation and management of remaining floodplain resources can be improved through a better understanding of the spatial extent and frequency of inundation at scales that are relevant to the species and/or ecological processes of interest. Spatial data products describing dynamic aspects floodplain inundation are, however, not widely available. This study used Landsat imagery to generate multiple observations of inundation extent under varying hydrologic conditions to estimate inundation frequency. Inundation extent was estimated for 50 Landsat scenes and 1334 total images within the Gulf Coastal Plains and Ozarks Landscape Conservation Cooperative (GCPO LCC), a conservation science partnership working in a 730000-km(2) region in the south central USA. These data were composited into a landscape mosaic to depict relative inundation frequency over the entire GCPO LCC. An analytical methodology is presented for linking the observed inundation extent and frequency with long-term gage measurements so that the outcomes may be useful in defining meaningful critical thresholds for a variety of floodplain dependent organisms as well as important ecological processes.

This study was aimed at identifying the potential land-use drivers in the Jedeb catchment of the Abbay basin by combining statistical analysis, field investigation and remote sensing. To do so, a land-use change model was calibrated and evaluated using the SITE (SImulation of Terrestrial Environment) modelling framework. SITE is cellular automata based multi-criteria decision analysis framework for simulating land-use conversion based on socio-economic and environmental factors. Past land-use trajectories (1986-2009) were evaluated using a reference Landsat-derived map (agreement of 84%). Results show that major land-use change drivers in the study area were population, slope, livestock and distances from various infrastructures (roads, markets and water). It was also found that farmers seem to increasingly prefer plantations of trees such as Eucalyptus by replacing croplands perhaps mainly due to declining crop yield, soil fertility and climate variability. Potential future trajectory of land-use change was also predicted under a business-as-usual scenario (2009-2025). Results show that agricultural land will continue to expand from 69.5% in 2009 to 77.5% in 2025 in the catchment albeit at a declining rate when compared with the period from 1986 to 2009. Plantation forest will also increase at a much higher rate, mainly at the expense of natural vegetation, agricultural land and grasslands. This study provides critical information to land-use planners and policy makers for a more effective and proactive management in this highland catchment.				van der Zaag, Pieter/B-8247-2008	van der Zaag, Pieter/0000-0002-1215-2656; Mul, Marloes/0000-0001-9469-3909; Priess, Joerg/0000-0002-0384-9240												2076-3298					SEP	2016	3	3							21	10.3390/environments3030021								WOS:000385566200007

Forest change is mapped using Landsat satellite images from 1977, 1990, 1999, and 2011. The landscape studied has lost 1478 km(2) of dense forest cover between 1977 and 2011, with a maximum loss of 1002 km(2) of dense forest between 1977 and 1990. The number of protected forest areas has increased, concomitant with an increase in restrictions on forest access and use outside protected areas. Interviews with residents of 20 randomly selected villages indicate that in the absence of alternatives, rather than reducing their dependence on forests, communities appear to shift their use to other, less protected patches of forest. Pressure shifts seem to be taking place as a consequence of increasing protection, from within protected areas to forests outside, leading to the creation of protected but isolated forest islands within a matrix of overall deforestation, and increased conflict between local residents and forest managers. A broader landscape vision for forest management needs to be developed, that involves local communities with forest protection and enables their decision-making on forest management outside strict protected areas.

Mapping of land cover in northern California with simulated hyperspectral satellite imagery	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Land-cover maps are important science products needed for natural resource and ecosystem service management, biodiversity conservation planning, and assessing human-induced and natural drivers of land change. Analysis of hyperspectral, or imaging spectrometer, imagery has shown an impressive capacity to map a wide range of natural and anthropogenic land cover. Applications have been mostly with single-date imagery from relatively small spatial extents. Future hyperspectral satellites will provide imagery at greater spatial and temporal scales, and there is a need to assess techniques for mapping land cover with these data. Here we used simulated multi-temporal HyspIRI satellite imagery over a 30,000 km(2) area in the San Francisco Bay Area, California to assess its capabilities for mapping classes defined by the international Land Cover Classification System (LCCS). We employed a mapping methodology and analysis framework that is applicable to regional and global scales. We used the Random Forests classifier with three sets of predictor variables (reflectance, MNF, hyperspectral metrics), two temporal resolutions (summer, spring-summer-fall), two sample scales (pixel, polygon) and two levels of classification complexity (12, 20 classes). Hyperspectral metrics provided a 16.4-21.8% and 3.1-6.7% increase in overall accuracy relative to MNF and reflectance bands, respectively, depending on pixel or polygon scales of analysis. Multi-temporal metrics improved overall accuracy by 0.9-3.1% over summer metrics, yet increases were only significant at the pixel scale of analysis. Overall accuracy at pixel scales was 72.2% (Kappa 0.70) with three seasons of metrics. Anthropogenic and homogenous natural vegetation classes had relatively high confidence and producer and user accuracies were over 70%; in comparison, woodland and forest classes had considerable confusion. We next focused on plant functional types with relatively pure spectra by removing open-canopy shrublands, woodlands and mixed forests from the classification. This 12-class map had significantly improved accuracy of 85.1% (Kappa 0.83) and most classes had over 70% producer and user accuracies. Finally, we summarized important metrics from the multi-temporal Random Forests to infer the underlying chemical and structural properties that best discriminated our land-cover classes across seasons.

Identifying stand ages at the landscape level is critical to improve conservation policies. We combined a high-resolution satellite image (WorldView-2) with time-series Landsat images. We extracted stand ages (the time elapsed since the most recent slash and burn) from a change-detection analysis with Landsat time-series images and superimposed the derived stand ages on the segments classified by object-based image analysis using WorldView-2. We regarded stand ages as a response variable, and object-based metrics as independent variables, to develop regression models that explain stand ages. Subsequently, we classified the vegetation of the target area into six age units and one rubber plantation unit (1-3 yr, 3-5 yr, 5-7 yr, 7-30 yr, 30-50 yr, >50 yr and 'rubber plantation') using regression models and linear discriminant analyses. Validation demonstrated an accuracy of 84.3%. Our approach is particularly effective in classifying highly dynamic pioneer vegetation younger than 7 years into 2-yr intervals, suggesting that rapid changes in vegetation canopies can be detected with high accuracy. The combination of a spectral time-series analysis and object-based metrics based on high-resolution imagery enabled the classification of dynamic vegetation under intensive shifting cultivation and yielded an informative land cover map based on stand ages.

J	Dube, T; Mutanga, O				Dube, Timothy; Mutanga, Onisimo			The impact of integrating WorldView-2 sensor and environmental variables in estimating plantation forest species aboveground biomass and carbon stocks in uMgeni Catchment, South Africa	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Reliable and accurate mapping and extraction of key forest indicators of ecosystem development and health, such as aboveground biomass (AGB) and aboveground carbon stocks (AGCS) is critical in understanding forests contribution to the local, regional and global carbon cycle. This information is critical in assessing forest contribution towards ecosystem functioning and services, as well as their conservation status. This work aimed at assessing the applicability of the high resolution 8-band WorldView-2 multi spectral dataset together with environmental variables in quantifying AGB and aboveground carbon stocks for three forest plantation species i.e. Eucalyptus dunii (ED), Eucalyptus grandis (EG) and Pinus taeda (PT) in uMgeni Catchment, South Africa. Specifically, the strength of the Worldview-2 sensor in terms of its improved imaging agilities is examined as an independent dataset and in conjunction with selected environmental variables. The results have demonstrated that the integration of high resolution 8-band Worldview-2 multispectral data with environmental variables provide improved AGB and AGCS estimates, when compared to the use of spectral data as an independent dataset. The use of integrated data sets yielded a high R-2 value of 0.88 and RMSEs of 10.05 t ha(-1) and 5.03 t C ha(-1) for E. dunii AGB and carbon stocks; whereas the use of spectral data as an independent dataset yielded slightly weaker results, producing an R-2 value of 0.73 and an RMSE of 18.57 t ha(-1) and 09.29 t C ha(-1). Similarly, high accurate results (R-2 value of 0.73 and RMSE values of 27.30 t ha(-1) and 13.65 t C ha(-1)) were observed from the estimation of inter-species AGB and carbon stocks. Overall, the findings of this work have shown that the integration of new generation multispectral datasets with environmental variables provide a robust tool set required for the accurate and reliable retrieval of forest aboveground biomass and carbon stocks in densely forested terrestrial ecosystems.

Drainage network extraction and morphometric analysis using remote sensing and GIS mapping techniques (Lesser Zab River Basin, Iraq and Iran)	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The Lesser Zab River, in the northeast of Iraq and northwest of Iran, is the largest tributary inside Iraq supplying water to the Tigris River. The majority of the basin lies inside Iraq. The important goals of this study are to estimate the erodibility and flash flood hazard of the Lesser Zab River Basin (LZRB). The present research highlights sub-basins that should be prioritized for conservation and flood risk schemes. The morphometric analysis reveals that the most important sub-basins are Sb1 and Sb2, in terms of water contribution to the main river. They are characterized by higher stream order, larger area, high elevation, low drainage density, low drainage texture, and low relative relief. Because of the relatively high relief in the upper part of the LZRB, the sub-basins are characterized by low drainage density, which indicates more surface runoff compared to the main basin in the lower part. The very fine drainage texture in the upper part of the LZRB reflects low infiltration and higher runoff relative to the lower part. The sub-basins in the upper part of the LZRB, which have a low bifurcation ratio, produce flood hydrographs with marked discharge peaks, while the subbasins in the lower part, which have high ratios, produce low peaks over a long time period. Various morphometric parameters have been used for each sub-basin to calculate compound parameters for the final ranking of the subbasins. Based on utilization of morphometric parameters for the erodibility hazard assessment, sub-basins were divided into seven prioritization classes: critical, very high to critical, high to very high, medium to high, low to medium, very low to low, and lowest. Furthermore, the resultant hazard map indicates that 18 sub-basins have moderate to low risk of flash flooding and 29 sub-basins have low possibility of flash flooding.

In the present study, spatial Markov chains were applied to explore the impacts of the regional context on soil erosion in the Xiangxi River watershed, and Thematic Mapper remote sensing data from 1999 and 2007 were employed. The results indicated that the observed changes in soil erosion were closely related to the soil erosion levels of the surrounding areas. When neighboring regions were not considered, the probability that moderate erosion transformed into slight and severe erosion was 0.8330 and 0.0049, respectively. However, when neighboring regions that displayed intensive erosion were considered, the probabilities were 0.2454 and 0.7513, respectively. Moreover, the different levels of soil erosion in neighboring regions played different roles in soil erosion. If the erosion levels in the neighboring region were lower, the probability of a high erosion class transferring to a lower level was relatively high. In contrast, if erosion levels in the neighboring region were higher, the probability was lower. The results of the present study provide important information for the planning and implementation of soil conservation measures in the study area.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				SEP	2016	74	5					1051	1059		10.2166/wst.2016.283								WOS:000384094000003	27642824

Drones that see through waves - preliminary results from airborne fluid lensing for centimetre-scale aquatic conservation	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS					6th IUCN World Parks Congress	NOV, 2014	Sydney, AUSTRALIA	IUCN				1. The use of fluid lensing technology on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, or drones) is presented as a novel means for 3D imaging of aquatic ecosystems from above the water's surface at the centimetre scale. Preliminary results are presented from airborne fluid lensing campaigns conducted over the coral reefs of Ofu Island, American Samoa (2013) and the stromatolite reefs of Shark Bay, Western Australia (2014), covering a combined area of 15 km(2). These reef ecosystems were revealed with centimetre-scale 2D resolution, and an accompanying 3D bathymetry model was derived using fluid lensing, Structure from Motion and UAV position data. Data products were validated from in situ survey methods including underwater calibration targets, depth measurements and millimetre-scale high-dynamic-range gigapixel photogrammetry. 2. Fluid lensing is an experimental technology that uses water-transmitting wavelengths to passively image underwater objects at high-resolution by exploiting time-varying optical lensing events caused by surface waves. Fluid lensing data are captured from low-altitude, cost-effective electric UAVs to achieve multispectral imagery and bathymetry models at the centimetre scale over regional areas. As a passive system, fluid lensing is presently limited by signal-to-noise ratio and water column inherent optical properties to similar to 10 m depth over visible wavelengths in clear waters. 3. The datasets derived from fluid lensing present the first centimetre-scale images of a reef acquired from above the ocean surface, without wave distortion. The 3D multispectral data distinguish coral, fish and invertebrates in American Samoa, and reveal previously undocumented, morphologically distinct, stromatolite structures in Shark Bay. These findings suggest fluid lensing and multirotor electric drones represent a promising advance in the remote sensing of aquatic environments at the centimetre scale, or 'reef scale' relevant to the conservation of reef ecosystems. Pending further development and validation of fluid lensing methods, these technologies present a solution for large-scale 3D surveys of shallow aquatic habitats with centimetre-scale spatial resolution and hourly temporal sampling.

Multispectral satellite mapping of crop residue cover and tillage intensity in, Iowa	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Quantifying crop residue cover is crucial for identifying tillage intensity and evaluating effectiveness of conservation management practices across large geographic areas. Current assessment protocols are labor intensive, time consuming, and costly. Our objective was to assess crop residue cover and soil tillage intensity in a watershed in central Iowa for three years (2009 to 2011) using multispectral satellite images. The watershed is dominated by corn (Zen mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.), which are grown on glacial-till derived soils across 85% of the land area. For each year, crop residue cover was measured for a few fields using the line-point transect method or visually estimating surface cover through roadside surveys. Conservation tillage fields had >= 30% residue cover, while more intensively tilled fields had <30% residue cover. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Systeme Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) High Resolution Geometrical (HRG), Indian ResourceSat Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS), and Deimos satellite images were also acquired and analyzed to determine surface cover. SPOT and Landsat images provided similar classification accuracy ranging from 64% to 92%, while AWiFS and Deimos classifications had accuracies ranging from 61% to 73%. Clouds and the revisit interval for each satellite affected the timing of satellite images with respect to field operations, which also influenced classification accuracy. Overall soil tillage intensity varied little from year-to-year. Soil tillage intensity was also mapped as a function of slope, which could be useful for targeting additional conservation practices throughout the watershed. We conclude that satellite imagery is well suited for classifying crop residue cover. Furthermore, two recently launched satellites, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, have comparable multispectral sensors and together these satellites should provide frequent opportunities to acquire suitable imagery for assessing crop residue cover and soil tillage intensity over large geographic areas.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				SEP-OCT	2016	71	5					385	395		10.2489/jswc.71.5.385								WOS:000383316400006

Mapping long-term land use and land cover change in the central Himalayan region using a tree-based ensemble classification approach	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Forest cover and its change analysis along with nexus between other land cover types are often seen as insufficient data quality for operational applications in the Himalayan region. Despite extensive documentation reporting rapid demographic, socio-economic and environmental changes in this region, we lack comprehensive detailed assessments of spatial distribution of land use/land cover (LULC) change over an extended period of time. In this study, we overcame this limitation by producing annual maps of change among forests and other LULC classes in the Kumaon division in the state of Uttarakhand, India. This is the first attempt to develop a database for this region using public domain Landsat images and replicable mapping techniques. To deal with high spatial and temporal variability as well as complex multi-signature classes, this study uses a tree-based ensemble classification approach. The central premise of the approach is to exploit multi-seasonal information using characteristic temporal signatures in several spectral regions along with various environmental variables to identify twenty (20) LULC classes spanning three decades, focussing on distinguishing geographically dominant forest types. The maps were combined into seven LULC classes with reference to global databases. Random forest (RF) classifier was used to create seasonal maps, and knowledge-based decision level fusion was used to produce annual composite maps. Overall accuracies were equal to 82% (kappa = 0.75), 87% (kappa = 0.81), 87% (kappa = 0.82), and 88% (kappa = 0.83) for 1990,1999, 2009 and 2014, respectively, while detailed maps had moderately high (similar to 70%) overall accuracies. As forests in the Himalayan region represent the most widespread vegetation structure, development of such time series analysis in this region can be potentially used for national and regional resource management efforts. This study, therefore, gives an insight on the potential of using a tree-based ensemble classification approach to provide a baseline database, which can aid in developing practical field inventories and forest conservation policies.

J	Yang, P; Liu, XH; Xu, B				Yang, Ping; Liu, Xuehua; Xu, Bing			Spatiotemporal pattern of bird habitats in the Poyang Lake based on Landsat images	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China and possesses unique wetland and plentiful biological resources. Because of the dual influence of the Five Rivers and Yangtze River, the water level of Poyang Lake changes seasonally, which has important influence on the local ecosystem. A better knowledge of the spatiotemporal pattern of water body and bird habitats is important for bird diversity conservation and wetland management. In this study, we collected six Landsat images in both winter and summer seasons from 1995 to 2009. These images were processed in both ERDAS Imagine 9.1 and ArcGIS 9.3 by image registration, geometric rectification and classification based on image characteristics and field survey data. The bird habitats in Poyang Lake wetland were classified into six types as shoal water, middle-depth water, deep water, grassland, sand land and mudflat. The results showed: (1) In winter seasons, grassland, mudflat and shoal water were the three main bird habitats in winter (totally around 70 %); water body area increased 13.6 % from 1995 to 1999 and then decreased 11.8 % from 1999 to 2007, and the mudflat decreased all the time from 1995 to 2007. (2) In summer seasons, water area occupied more than 60 % of the whole area; due to high water level, most plants were submerged and not suitable for bird feeding; shoal water area and grasslands were the two main bird habitats in summer. Compared with changes in summer seasons, all bird habitats changed obviously in winter seasons. Based on our research, we suggests that it is important to monitor the change in water level, area of water body, area of grassland and mudflat in future research by incorporating related precipitation data, water station record, multispectral and multi-temporal remote sensing images in the Poyang Lake since these habitats are key for migrating birds.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				SEP	2016	75	17							1230	10.1007/s12665-016-5941-6								WOS:000382658700021

Rapid conservation assessment for endangered species using habitat connectivity models	ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION												To avoid extinction of rare species in regions of active environmental change, strategic approaches are needed to manage remaining habitat. When observations of dispersal or metapopulation information are not available, habitat connectivity simulations may offer a valuable alternative source of information to assess threats and evaluate conservation options. For the Critically Endangered San Martin titi monkey (Callicebus oenanthe) in north central Peru, an updated distribution model was generated and land cover in the heavily deforested northern range of the species was mapped. The value of remaining forest fragments was characterized and threats from future land use change were assessed using complementary connectivity models. It is estimated that the species range is less than 14 000 km(2). Remote sensing analysis reveals that at least 34% of lowland forest in the northern range has been lost, while nearly 95% of remaining habitat fragments are likely too small to support viable populations and less than 8% of this habitat lies within conservation areas. Areas with the highest modelled connectivity comprise only10% of the remaining forest in the northern range and small patches may contribute disproportionately to movement; these lands represent opportunities for conservation and reforestation to prevent potentially significant impacts from future mining and urban development. This study prioritized remaining suitable habitat patches using modelled connectivity and local knowledge to gain insight into the status of an understudied species. This approach offers a relatively rapid method to identify potential land use conflicts, and to further focus research and locally appropriate conservation.

As marine ecosystems degrade, so do the well-being and livelihoods of humans that depend directly on the ecosystem goods and services they provide. Marine protected areas have been proposed to protect biodiversity, restore damaged ecosystems, sustain fisheries, and rebuild overexploited stocks. The effectiveness of marine protected areas depends in part on their effectiveness as connected networks, linked over large areas by ecological processes such as larval dispersal. Here, we applied a biophysical model driven by ocean currents derived from satellite altimetry to evaluate connectivity between Western Indian Ocean reefs. We applied graph-theoretic analysis, including clustering and a betweenness centrality metric. Our results show high interconnectivity within several regions (Mozambique Channel, Mascarene archipelago) and lower connectivity across the WIO region. We compared the results with the current MPA network, and proposed sites/reefs that should be considered priority sites for MPA implementation: Pebane, Cosmoledo, Majunga, Masoarivo, Platte Island, Farquhar, Agalega and Geyser bank. Our results are timely, considering the oil and gas exploration that is ongoing in the region. We discuss implications for transboundary marine policies and regional cooperation in the Western Indian Ocean, and advocate the creation of a regional-scale organization to structure interactions among the different actors.

J	Diao, CY; Wang, L				Diao, Chunyuan; Wang, Le			Incorporating plant phenological trajectory in exotic saltcedar detection with monthly time series of Landsat imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Over the past century, non-native saltcedar (Tamarix spp.) has expanded into most of riparian zones of the southwestern United States and posed significant threats to the native biotic communities. Repeated monitoring of saltcedar distribution over region-wide geographic areas is urgently essential for conservation agencies to develop cost-effective control strategies. Current studies have mostly concentrated on the mapping of saltcedar distribution with a single remote sensing image acquired during its leaf senescence. Given the phenological variation within saltcedar and the spectral confusion between saltcedar and natives, our ability to detect saltcedar with a single-date image is still limited. The objective of this study was to develop new intra-annual phenology-based strategies to detect exotic saltcedar with monthly time series of Landsat imagery. Several temporal phenology-based detection strategies (i.e., phenological bands, phenological NDVI, and phenological metrics) that could track the intra-annual phenological trajectory of plants were devised. With the proposed detection strategies, crucial months and phenological stages in saltcedar detection were investigated. Results indicated that the proposed strategy of phenological bands could accommodate the phenological variation within saltcedar and improve the classification accuracy significantly. Several phenological stages (e.g., flowering and leaf senescence) were deemed as important in discriminating saltcedar from other riparian plants at the Landsat scale. The proposed strategy was found to be relatively robust to the lack of a single Landsat image. It is concluded that monthly time series of Landsat imagery are promising in facilitating the long-term mapping of saltcedar distribution over extended areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

A rapid, whole-of-system assessment strategy is needed to evaluate such threats, better linking innovative remote sensing with essential on-ground evaluations. Using the Shoreline Video Assessment Method, we surveyed around 190 km of the mostly mangrove-fringed (78%) coastline of Kien Giang Province, Vietnam. The aim was to identify anthropogenic drivers of degradation, establishing baseline for specific rehabilitation and protection strategies. Fish traps occupy at least 87% of shoreline mangroves, around which there were abundant human activities-like fishing, crabbing, farming, plus collecting firewood and foliage. Such livelihoods were associated with remnant, fringing mangrove that were largely degraded and threatened by erosion retreat, herbivory, and excessive cutting. Our assessment quantified associated threats to shoreline stability, along with previous rehabilitation intervention measures. The method offers key opportunities for effective conservation and management of vulnerable shoreline habitats. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The temporal and spatial scales at which migrations occur and our inability to directly observe these nocturnal movements makes monitoring and characterizing this critical period in migratory animals' life cycles difficult. Remote sensing, therefore, has played an important role in our understanding of large-scale nocturnal bird migrations. Weather surveillance radar networks in Europe and North America have great potential for long-term low-cost monitoring of bird migration at scales that have previously been impossible to achieve. Such long-term monitoring, however, poses a number of challenges for the ornithological and ecological communities: how does one take advantage of this vast data resource, integrate information across multiple sensors and large spatial and temporal scales, and visually represent the data for interpretation and dissemination, considering the dynamic nature of migration? We assembled an interdisciplinary team of ecologists, meteorologists, computer scientists, and graphic designers to develop two different flow visualizations, which are interactive and open source, in order to create novel representations of broad-front nocturnal bird migration to address a primary impediment to long-term, large-scale nocturnal migration monitoring. We have applied these visualization techniques to mass bird migration events recorded by two different weather surveillance radar networks covering regions in Europe and North America. These applications show the flexibility and portability of such an approach. The visualizations provide an intuitive representation of the scale and dynamics of these complex systems, are easily accessible for a broad interest group, and are biologically insightful. Additionally, they facilitate fundamental ecological research, conservation, mitigation of human-wildlife conflicts, improvement of meteorological products, and public outreach, education, and engagement.

Remotely Sensed Data Informs Red List Evaluations and Conservation Priorities in Southeast Asia	PLOS ONE												The IUCN Red List has assessed the global distributions of the majority of the world's amphibians, birds and mammals. Yet these assessments lack explicit reference to widely available, remotely-sensed data that can sensibly inform a species' risk of extinction. Our first goal is to add additional quantitative data to the existing standardised process that IUCN employs. Secondly, we ask: do our results suggest species of concern-those at considerably greater risk than hitherto appreciated? Thirdly, these assessments are not only important on a species-by-species basis. By combining distributions of species of concern, we map conservation priorities. We ask to what degree these areas are currently protected and how might knowledge from remote sensing modify the priorities? Finally, we develop a quick and simple method to identify and modify the priority setting in a landscape where natural habitats are disappearing rapidly and so where conventional species' assessments might be too slow to respond. Tropical, mainland Southeast Asia is under exceptional threat, yet relatively poorly known. Here, additional quantitative measures may be particularly helpful. This region contains over 122, 183, and 214 endemic mammals, birds, and amphibians, respectively, of which the IUCN considers 37, 21, and 37 threatened. When corrected for the amount of remaining natural habitats within the known elevation preferences of species, the average sizes of species ranges shrink to < 40% of their published ranges. Some 79 mammal, 49 bird, and 184 amphibian ranges are < 20,000km(2)-an area at which IUCN considers most other species to be threatened. Moreover, these species are not better protected by the existing network of protected areas than are species that IUCN accepts as threatened. Simply, there appear to be considerably more species at risk than hitherto appreciated. Furthermore, incorporating remote sensing data showing where habitat loss is prevalent changes the locations of conservation priorities.

This study applied a model that was developed at the pixel scale using water soil erosion indicators (land use, vegetation coverage and slope) to assess the soil erosion intensity in the Loess Plateau, China. Landsat TM/ETM+ images in 2000, 2005 and 2010 were used to produce land use maps based on the object-oriented classification method. The MODIS product MOD13Q1 was adopted to derive the vegetation coverage maps. The slope gradient maps were calculated based on data from the digital elevation model. The area of water soil-eroded land was classified into six grades by integrating slope gradients, land use and vegetation coverage. Results show that the Grain-To-Green Project in the Loess Plateau worked based on the land use changes from 2000 to 2010 and enhanced vegetation restoration and ecological conservation. These projects effectively prevented soil erosion. During this period, lands with moderate, severe, more severe and extremely severe soil erosion intensities significantly decreased and changed into less severe levels, respectively. Lands with slight and light soil erosion intensities increased. However, the total soil-eroded area in the Loess Plateau was reduced. The contributions of the seven provinces to the total soil-eroded area in the Loess Plateau and the composition of the soil erosion intensity level in each province are different. Lands with severe, more severe and extremely severe soil erosion intensities are mainly distributed in Qinghai, Ningxia, Gansu and Inner Mongolia. These areas, although relatively small, must be prioritised and preferentially treated.																	1674-3822					AUG	2016	8	4					325	333		10.3724/SP.J.1226.2016.00325								WOS:000391631800005

Yet, not only a unified analytical solution is still elusive in providing the scattering cross sections but also other important aspects, such as the phase of the scattering amplitude function, energy conservation, and reciprocity relation, have been scantly touched in the literature. The treatment of a dielectric inhomogeneous cylinder of finite length brings forth new challenges. Taking on such challenges is the focus of this paper. The main plan of attack is to extend the virtual partition method, which is a T-matrix-based semi-analytical model, that we have previously proposed to treat scattering from a homogeneous dielectric cylinder of finite length, to the inhomogeneous cases. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated numerically, including: 1) high-fidelity prediction of the copolarized and cross-polarized cross sections for arbitrary bistatic scattering configuration; 2) high-fidelity predictions of the phase of the scattering amplitude function; 3) verification of energy conservation; and 4) verification of the reciprocity theorem.

Assessment of soil erosion is a prominent tool in planning and conservation of soil and water resource ecosystems. The Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) was applied to Nyabarongo River Catchment that drains about 8413.75 km(2) (33%) of the total Rwanda coverage and a small part of the Southern Uganda (about 64.50 km(2)) using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing technologies. The estimated total annual actual soil loss was approximately estimated at 409 million tons with a mean erosion rate of 490 t.ha(-1).y(-1) (i.e., 32.67 mm.y(-1)). The cropland that occupied 74.85% of the total catchment presented a mean erosion rate of 618 t.ha(-1).y(-1) (i.e., 41.20 mm.y(-1)) and was responsible for 95.8% of total annual soil loss. Emergency soil erosion control is required with a priority accorded to cropland area of 173,244 ha, which is extremely exposed to actual soil erosion rate of 2222 t.ha(-1).y(-1) (i.e., 148.13 mm.y(-1)) and contributed to 96.2% of the total extreme soil loss in the catchment. According to this study, terracing cultivation method could reduce the current erosion rate in cropland areas by about 78%. Therefore, the present study suggests the catchment management by constructing check dams, terracing, agroforestry and reforestation of highly exposed areas as suitable measures for erosion and water pollution control within the Nyabarongo River Catchment and in other regions facing the same problems.																	1660-4601					AUG	2016	13	8							835	10.3390/ijerph13080835								WOS:000382462900090

This reserve comprises a set of temporary lakes, often saline, where water level fluctuates seasonally. Water inflows come mainly from direct precipitation and runoff of small lake watersheds. Most of these lakes lack surface outlets and behave as endorheic systems, where water withdrawal is mainly due to evaporation, causing salt accumulation in the lake beds. Remote sensing was used to estimate the temporal variation of the flooded area in these lakes and their associated hydrological patterns related to the seasonality of precipitation and evapotranspiration. Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite images for the reference period 2013-2015 were jointly used with ground-truth datasets. Several inverse modeling methods, such as two-band and multispectral indices, single-band threshold, classification methods, artificial neural network, support vector machine and genetic programming, were applied to retrieve information on the variation of the flooded areas. Results were compared to ground-truth data, and the classification errors were evaluated by means of the kappa coefficient. Comparative analyses demonstrated that the genetic programming approach yielded the best results, with a kappa value of 0.98 and a total error of omission-commission of 2%. The dependence of the variations in the water-covered area on precipitation and evaporation was also investigated. The results show the potential of the tested techniques to monitor the hydrological patterns of temporary lakes in semiarid areas, which might be useful for management strategy-linked lake conservation and specifically to accomplish the goals of both the European Water Framework Directive and the Habitats Directive.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of mangrove conservation efforts in two adjacent protected areas in China that were under the management policies of the Ramsar Convention (Mai Po Marshes Nature Reserve (MPMNR), Hong Kong) and China's National Nature Reserve System (Futian Mangrove National Nature Reserve (FMNNR), Shenzhen). To achieve this goal, eleven Landsat images were chosen and classified, areal extent and landscape metrics were then calculated. The results showed that: from 1973-2015, the areal extent of mangroves in both reserves increased, but the net change for the MPMNR (281.43 hm(2)) was much higher than those of the FMNNR (101.97 hm(2)). In general, the area-weighted centroid of the mangroves in FMNNR moved seaward by approximately 120 m, whereas in the MPMNR, the centroid moved seaward even farther (410 m). Although both reserves saw increased integrality and connectivity of the mangrove patches, the patches in the MPMNR always had higher integrality than those in the FMNNR. We concluded that the mangroves in the MPMNR were more effectively protected than those in the FMNNR. This study may provide assistance to the formulation of generally accepted criteria for remote sensing-based evaluation of conservation effectiveness, and may facilitate the development of appropriate mangrove forest conservation and management strategies in other counties.					, Mingming/0000-0002-4548-899X												2072-4292					AUG	2016	8	8							627	10.3390/rs8080627								WOS:000382458700014

U. europaeus is widely distributed in the south-central area of Chile, which is considered a world hotspot for biodiversity conservation. In addition to its negative effects on the biodiversity of natural ecosystems, U. europaeus is one of the most severe pests for agriculture and forestry. Despite its importance as an invasive species, U. europaeus has been little studied. Although information exists on the potential distribution of the species, the interaction of the invasion process with the spatial dynamic of the landscape and the landscape-scale factors that control the presence or absence of the species is still lacking. We studied the spatial and temporal dynamics of the landscape and how these relate to U. europaeus invasion in south-central Chile. We used supervised classification of satellite images to determine the spatial distribution of the species and other land covers for the years 1986 and 2003, analysing the transitions between the different land covers. We used logistic regression for modelling the increase, decrease and permanence of U. europaeus invasion considering landscape variables. Results showed that the species covers only around 1 % of the study area and showed a 42 % reduction in area for the studied period. However, U. europaeus was the cover type which presented the greatest dynamism in the landscape. We found a strong relationship between changes in land cover and the invasion process, especially connected with forest plantations of exotic species, which promotes the displacement of U. europaeus. The model of gorse cover increase presented the best performance, and the most important predictors were distance to seed source and landscape complexity index. Our model predicted high spread potential of U. europaeus in areas of high conservation value. We conclude that proper management for this invasive species must take into account the spatial dynamics of the landscape within the invaded area in order to address containment, control or mitigation of the invasion.

Delineation of watersheds and their prioritization within large river basins requires host of terrain parameters to be studied and analysed. Chopan watershed in Central India has been studied for sub-watershed delineation and prioritization based on drainage morphometry, land use/land cover and sediment yield index analysis using remote sensing and GIS techniques. The watershed was demarcated into five sub-watersheds on the basis of drainage flow directions, contour value, slope, elevation. Geocoded satellite data of 1989 and 2001 on 1:50 000 scale were visually interpreted to prepare land use/land cover and drainage maps which were later digitized using Arcview/ArcGIS. Linear and shape aspects of the sub-watersheds were computed and used for prioritization. The results show widespread variation in drainage characteristics, land cover changes and sediment yield rates across sub-watersheds. On the basis of morphometric, land use/land cover change and sediment yield index, sub-watersheds were grouped into low, medium and high priority. A correlation of results show that SW1 and SW5 are common sub-watersheds falling under high and low priority based on morphometric, land use change analysis and SYI. The priority list of sub-watersheds will be crucial for decision making and implementation of land and water resource conservation projects.																	0016-7622	0974-6889				AUG	2016	88	2					185	196		10.1007/s12594-016-0477-7								WOS:000381756700006

Coupled urbanization and agricultural ecosystem services in Guanzhong-Tianshui Economic Zone	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Ecosystems offer material and environmental support for human habitation and development in those areas of the earth where people choose to live. However, urbanization is an inexorable trend of human social development and threatens the health of those ecosystems inhabited by humans. This study calculates the values of NPP (net primary productivity), carbon sequestration, water interception, soil conservation, and agricultural production in the Guanzhong-Tianshui Economic Zone. At the same time, we combined DMSP/OLS (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Line Scanner) night lights remote sensing data and statistical data to analyze the level of urbanization. Quantitative analysis was performed on the interactions between the ecosystem service functions and urbanization based on the calculations of their coupled coordination degrees. The results were the following: (1) The values of NPP, carbon sequestration, and agricultural production showed a trend of increase. However, water interception decreased before increasing, while soil conservation showed the reverse trend; (2) Urbanization levels in the Guanzhong-Tianshui Economic Zone for the last 10 years have proceeded at a fast pace with comprehensive promotion; and (3) Coupled and coupled coordination degrees between urbanization and ecosystem services show increasing trends. This research can provide a theoretical basis for the region's rapid economic development in the balance.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2016	23	15					15407	15417		10.1007/s11356-016-6726-x								WOS:000380369900067	27117147

The accurate CT model on CTCFs showed that minimum temperature of coldest month (TMW) was the overwhelmingly potent factor among the six climate variables. The areas of TMW <-4.05 were suitable habitats of CTCF, and the areas of -1.35 < TMW were non-habitats, where temperate conifer and broad-leaved mixed forests (TCBLFs) were distribute in lower elevation, bordering on the CTCF. Dominant species of Abies, Picea, and Larix in the CTCFs, are more tolerant to winter coldness than Tsuga and broad-leaved trees including deciduous broad-leaved Acer and Betula, evergreen broad-leaved Cyclobalanopsis and Lithocarpus in TCBLFs. Winter coldness may actually limit the cool-side distributions of TCBLFs in the areas between -1.35A degrees C and -4.05A degrees C, and the warm-side distributions of CTCFs may be controlled by competition to the species of TCBLFs. Under future climate scenarios, the vulnerable area, where current potential (suitable + marginal) habitats (80,749 km2) shift to non-habitats, was predicted to decrease to 55.91% (45,053 km2) of the current area. Inferring from the current vegetation distribution pattern, TCBLFs will replace declining CTCFs. Vulnerable areas predicted by models are important in determining priority of ecosystem conservation.																	1672-6316	1993-0321				AUG	2016	13	8					1411	1422		10.1007/s11629-016-3846-1								WOS:000380234600007

In this paper, the conservation effectiveness for 28 WPAs in Northeast China from 2000 to 2012 was quantitatively evaluated using landsat thematic mapper image data and a maximum entropy model (Maxent). The spatial distribution of conservation effectiveness and the influence of human activities on conservation effectiveness were determined by combining a landscape development intensity (LDI) index and spatial analysis in a geographical information system. The results showed that the natural wetland area of all WPAs in Northeast China declined by 11.5 % and the conservation effectiveness of most of these WPAs decreased between 2000 and 2012. A significant negative correlation between the LDI index and conservation effectiveness (r = -0.824, p < 0.01) suggested that human activities were responsible for the low conservation effectiveness of WPAs. The WPAs with the high conservation effectiveness were mainly located in the Da-Xing'an and Xiao-Xing'an Mountains, where anthropogenic activities were limited. The reduction in the conservation effectiveness of WPAs in the Songnen and Sanjiang Plains, which showed the most degradation, was due to conversion of wetlands to croplands. This research offers an efficient and effective method to evaluate the conservation effectiveness of WPAs. The results of this study will inform future ecological conservation and management of WPAs in China.																	0923-4861	1572-9834				AUG	2016	24	4					381	398		10.1007/s11273-015-9462-y								WOS:000379352300001

Leveraging limited information to understand ecological relationships of endangered Florida salt marsh vole	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY												We were able to substantially increase our knowledge of what is likely the least understood endangered terrestrial mammal in the United States, the Florida salt marsh vole (FSMV; Microtus pennsylvanicus dukecampbelli). We developed a predictive landscape model that estimated 264 ha of potential habitat for FSMVs. Evaluating our model, we found voles at 8 of the 36 sites sampled, yielding a model accuracy of 22% for a subspecies that previously was known from only 3 locations. Within areas of potential habitat, FSMVs selected patches of marsh vegetation > 0.49 ha with at least some (>= 16.75% and <= 43.61%) smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) cover. Suggestive of a meta-population dynamic, FSMV activity decreased outside of patches of smooth cordgrass and saltgrass (Distichlis spicata) identified by the predictive landscape model. Our hierarchical approach to studying FSMVs allowed us to leverage a limited amount of data to ultimately produce important ecological information about an endangered species. This approach easily may be adapted to other mammals with similar information needs.																	0022-2372	1545-1542				JUL 25	2016	97	4					1249	1255		10.1093/jmammal/gyw084								WOS:000383262100022

Monitoring, especially in river basins has become common in environmental studies among students. The Physical Diagnosis conservationist has proven effective in this process, as is intended to diagnose quantitatively and qualitatively the degree of environmental degradation of the determined area. In this work, the objective was to analyze the environmental degradation of the Lages River basin area in Aragominas, located in the northern area of the state of Tocantins, by means of Physical conservation diagnosis application, techniques resulting from the Geo processing and Remote Sensing from the SIG tools. We analyzed the vegetation coverage during the period of 1991 to 2011 and other physical characterization parameters of river basins, with which were generated maps basis for the Physical Diagnosis conservation application in the basin. After analyzing the data, there was a moderate physical degradation of 39.96 risk units for the entire basin and sections B and C, and 43.29 for the section A, with increased risk of degradation. We conclude that the increase in agricultural activities is the main causes of physical degradation in the river basin, replacing the original vegetation for grazing cattle purpose.																	1679-9860					JUL-DEC	2016		27					34	55										WOS:000392711500003

This study assesses the current cropland extent and the related soil erosion risk in Rwanda, a country that experienced the most rapid population growth and cropland expansion in Africa over the last decade. The land cover land use (LCLU) map of Rwanda in 2015 was developed using Landsat-8 imagery. Based on the obtained LCLU map and the spatial datasets of precipitation, soil properties and elevation, the soil erosion rate of Rwanda was assessed at 30-m spatial resolution, using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model. According to the results, the mean soil erosion rate was 250 t.ha(-1).a(-1) over the entire country, with a total soil loss rate of approximately 595 million tons per year. The mean soil erosion rate over cropland, which occupied 56% of the national land area, was estimated at 421 t.ha(-1).a(-1) and was responsible for about 95% of the national soil loss. About 24% of the croplands in Rwanda had a soil erosion rate larger than 300 t.ha(-1).a(-1), indicating their unsuitability for cultivation. With a mean soil erosion rate of 1642 t.ha(-1).a(-1), these unsuitable croplands were responsible for 90% of the national soil loss. Most of the unsuitable croplands are distributed in the Congo Nile Ridge, Volcanic Range mountain areas in the west and the Buberuka highlands in the north, regions characterized by steep slopes (>30%) and strong rainfall. Soil conservation practices, such as the terracing cultivation method, are paramount to preserve the soil. According to our assessment, terracing alone could reduce the mean cropland soil erosion rate and the national soil loss by 79% and 75%, respectively. After terracing, only a small proportion of 7.6% of the current croplands would still be exposed to extreme soil erosion with a rate >300 t.ha(-1).a(-1). These irremediable cropland areas should be returned to mountain forest to foster environmental sustainability or further sustainable alternative erosion control techniques may be applied, such as applying Vetiver Eco-engineering Technology due to its economical soil erosion control and stabilization of steep slopes and the construction of erosion control dams to absorb and break down excess runoff from unusually intense storms in various parts of the watersheds.																	2071-1050					JUL	2016	8	7							609	10.3390/su8070609								WOS:000380760400020

In this study, we use Landsat data to explore the relationship between vegetation structure and forest management institutions, in order to assess the efficacy of local institutions in management of forests outside protected areas. These forests form part of an important tiger corridor in Eastern Maharashtra, India. We assessed forest condition using 450 randomly placed 10 m radius circular plots in forest patches of villages with and without local institutions, to understand the impact of these institutions on forest vegetation. Tree density and species richness were significantly different between villages with and without local forest institutions, but there was no difference in tree biomass. We also found a significant difference in the relationship between tree density and NDVI between villages with and without local forest institutions. However, the relationship between species richness and NDVI did not differ significantly. The methods proposed by this study evaluate the status of forest management in a forest corridor using remotely sensed data and could be effectively used to identify the extent of vegetation health and management status.

Landscape-level movement patterns by lions in western Serengeti: comparing the influence of inter-specific competitors, habitat attributes and prey availability	MOVEMENT ECOLOGY												Background: Where apex predators move on the landscape influences ecosystem structure and function and is therefore key to effective landscape-level management and species-specific conservation. However the factors underlying predator distribution patterns within functional ecosystems are poorly understood. Predator movement should be sensitive to the spatial patterns of inter-specific competitors, spatial variation in prey density, and landscape attributes that increase individual prey vulnerability. We investigated the relative role of these fundamental factors on seasonal resource utilization by a globally endangered apex carnivore, the African lion (Panthera leo) in Tanzania's Serengeti National Park. Lion space use was represented by novel landscape-level, modified utilization distributions (termed "localized density distributions") created from telemetry relocations of individual lions from multiple neighbouring prides. Spatial patterns of inter-specific competitors were similarly determined from telemetry re-locations of spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta), this system's primary competitor for lions; prey distribution was derived from 18 months of detailed census data; and remote sensing data was used to represent relevant habitat attributes. Results: Lion space use was consistently influenced by landscape attributes that increase individual prey vulnerability to predation. Wet season activity, when available prey were scarce, was concentrated near embankments, which provide ambush opportunities, and dry season activity, when available prey were abundant, near remaining water sources where prey occurrence is predictable. Lion space use patterns were positively associated with areas of high prey biomass, but only in the prey abundant dry season. Finally, at the broad scale of this analysis, lion and hyena space use was positively correlated in the comparatively prey-rich dry season and unrelated in the wet season, suggesting lion movement was unconstrained by the spatial patterns of their main inter-specific competitors. Conclusions: The availability of potential prey and vulnerability of that prey to predation both motivate lion movement decisions, with their relative importance apparently mediated by overall prey abundance. With practical and theoretical implications, these results suggest that while top carnivores are consistently cognizant of how landscape features influence individual prey vulnerability, they also adopt a flexible approach to range use by adjusting spatial behaviour according to fluctuations in local prey abundance.																	2051-3933					JUL 1	2016	4								UNSP 17	10.1186/s40462-016-0082-9								WOS:000381934300001	27375849

Estimation of aboveground net primary productivity in secondary tropical dry forests using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) model	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Although tropical dry forests (TDFs) cover roughly 42% of all tropical ecosystems, extensive deforestation and habitat fragmentation pose important limitations for their conservation and restoration worldwide. In order to develop conservation policies for this endangered ecosystem, it is necessary to quantify their provision of ecosystems services such as carbon sequestration and primary production. In this paper we explore the potential of the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) for estimating aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) in a secondary TDF located at the Santa Rosa National Park (SRNP), Costa Rica. We calculated ANPP using the CASA model (ANPP(CASA)) in three successional stages (early, intermediate, and late). Each stage has a stand age of 21 years, 32 years, and 50+ years, respectively, estimated as the age since land abandonment. Our results showed that the ANPP(CASA) for early, intermediate, and late successional stages were 3.22 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), 8.90 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), and 7.59 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, which are comparable with rates of carbon uptake in other TDFs. Our results indicate that key variables that influence ANPP in our dry forest site were stand age and precipitation seasonality. Incident photosynthetically active radiation and temperature were not dominant in the ANPP(CASA). The results of this study highlight the potential of the use of remote sensing techniques and the importance of incorporating successional stage in accurate regional TDF ANPP estimation.

Seascapes as a new vernacular for pelagic ocean monitoring, management and conservation	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												For terrestrial and marine benthic ecologists, landscape ecology provides a framework to address issues of complexity, patchiness, and scale-providing theory and context for ecosystem based management in a changing climate. Marine pelagic ecosystems are likewise changing in response to warming, changing chemistry, and resource exploitation. However, unlike spatial landscapes that migrate slowly with time, pelagic seascapes are embedded in a turbulent, advective ocean. Adaptations from landscape ecology to marine pelagic ecosystem management must consider the nature and scale of biophysical interactions associated with organisms ranging from microbes to whales, a hierarchical organization shaped by physical processes, and our limited capacity to observe and monitor these phenomena across global oceans. High frequency, multiscale, and synoptic characterization of the 4-D variability of seascapes are now available through improved classification methods, a maturing array of satellite remote sensing products, advances in autonomous sampling of multiple levels of biological complexity, and emergence of observational networks. Merging of oceanographic and ecological paradigms will be necessary to observe, manage, and conserve species embedded in a dynamic seascape mosaic, where the boundaries, extent, and location of features change with time.

Of particular interest is the greater sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), an obligate whose populations have declined so severely due, in part, to increases in cheatgrass and fires that it was considered for inclusion as an endangered species. Remote sensing technologies and satellite archives help scientists monitor terrestrial vegetation globally, including cheatgrass in the Northern Great Basin. Along with geospatial analysis and advanced spatial modeling, these data and technologies can identify areas susceptible to increased cheatgrass cover and compare these with greater sage grouse priority areas for conservation (PAC). Future climate models forecast a warmer and wetter climate for the Northern Great Basin, which likely will force changing cheatgrass dynamics. Therefore, we examine potential climate-caused changes to cheatgrass. Our results indicate that future cheatgrass percent cover will remain stable over more than 80% of the study area when compared with recent estimates, and higher overall cheatgrass cover will occur with slightly more spatial variability. The land area projected to increase or decrease in cheatgrass cover equals 18% and 1%, respectively, making an increase in fire disturbances in greater sage grouse habitat likely. Relative susceptibility measures, created by integrating cheatgrass percent cover and temporal standard deviation datasets, show that potential increases in future cheatgrass cover match future projections. This discovery indicates that some greater sage grouse PACs for conservation could be at heightened risk of fire disturbance. Multiple factors will affect future cheatgrass cover including changes in precipitation timing and totals and increases in freeze-thaw cycles. Understanding these effects can help direct land management, guide scientific research, and influence policy. (C) 2016 The Society for Range Management. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, quantitative evidence is lacking for the drivers of land use change resulting from the TGR during and after construction. We used the Pengxi River basin, located upstream of the Three Gorges dam, to evaluate the effects of large-scale hydrological engineering on land use. Landsat remote sensing images from 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010 covering the main construction period of the TGR were obtained. The largest changes were the conversion of land to water bodies and built-up areas, corresponding to reservoir impoundment and population resettlement during TGR construction. These changes were more intensive downstream of the TGR and closer to the river. Compared with 2000-2005, the expansion in water bodies during 2005-2010 moved from lower to higher elevations. The distribution of built-up land during the two periods was similar, mainly because the planned resettlement zones were fixed and spatially concentrated. Geographical and environmental factors, such as elevation, slope, location, soil type and precipitation, still controlled land use patterns. Land use pattern in 2020 under two scenarios was simulated using a multi-criteria evaluation cellular automata-Markov model. Scenario 2 was more realistic and helpful for management decisions. The scenarios highlighted the indirect influences of TGR construction on land use change after 2010. Indirect driving forces were mainly reflected through related policies or plans, especially from the perspective of water conservation in the newly built reservoir.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2016	75	13							1048	10.1007/s12665-016-5758-3								WOS:000379222800002

Coupling Satellite Data with Species Distribution and Connectivity Models as a Tool for Environmental Management and Planning in Matrix-Sensitive Species	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Climate change and anthropogenic habitat fragmentation are considered major threats for global biodiversity. As a direct consequence, connectivity is increasingly disrupted in many species, which might have serious consequences that could ultimately lead to the extinction of populations. Although a large number of reserves and conservation sites are designated and protected by law, potential habitats acting as inter-population connectivity corridors are, however, mostly ignored in the common practice of environmental planning. In most cases, this is mainly caused by a lack of quantitative measures of functional connectivity available for the planning process. In this study, we highlight the use of fine-scale potential connectivity models (PCMs) derived from multispectral satellite data for the quantification of spatially explicit habitat corridors for matrix-sensitive species of conservation concern. This framework couples a species distribution model with a connectivity model in a two-step framework, where suitability maps from step 1 are transformed into maps of landscape resistance in step 2 filtered by fragmentation thresholds. We illustrate the approach using the sand lizard (Lacerta agilis L.) in the metropolitan area of Cologne, Germany, as a case study. Our model proved to be well suited to identify connected as well as completely isolated populations within the study area. Furthermore, due to its fine resolution, the PCM was also able to detect small linear structures known to be important for sand lizards' inter-population connectivity such as railroad embankments. We discuss the applicability and possible implementation of PCMs to overcome shortcomings in the common practice of environmental impact assessments.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				JUL	2016	58	1					130	143		10.1007/s00267-016-0698-y								WOS:000379159600010	27094442

It is highly important to assess, monitor and forecast forest cover and other land-use changes for the protection and conservation of mountainous environment. The present study deals with the assessment of forest cover and other land-use changes in the mountain ranges of Dir Kohistan in northern Pakistan, using high resolution multi-temporal SPOT-5 satellite images. The SPOT-5 satellite images of years 2004, 2007, 2010 and 2013 were acquired and classified into land-cover units. In addition, forest cover and land-use change detection map was developed using the classified maps of 2004 and 2013. The classified maps were verified through random field samples and Google Earth imagery (Quick birds and SPOT-5). The results showed that during the period 2004 to 2013 the area of forest land decreased by 6.4%, however, area of range land and agriculture land have increased by 22.1% and 2.9%, respectively. Similarly, barren land increased by 1.1%, whereas, area of snow cover/glacier is significantly decreased by 21.3%. The findings from the study will be useful for forestry and landscape planning and can be utilized by the local, provincial and national forest departments; and REDD+ policy makers in Pakistan.																	1672-6316	1993-0321				JUL	2016	13	7					1229	1237		10.1007/s11629-015-3456-3								WOS:000379268900008

Choice of baseline climate data impacts projected species' responses to climate change	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Climate data created from historic climate observations are integral to most assessments of potential climate change impacts, and frequently comprise the baseline period used to infer species-climate relationships. They are often also central to downscaling coarse resolution climate simulations from General Circulation Models (GCMs) to project future climate scenarios at ecologically relevant spatial scales. Uncertainty in these baseline data can be large, particularly where weather observations are sparse and climate dynamics are complex (e.g. over mountainous or coastal regions). Yet, importantly, this uncertainty is almost universally overlooked when assessing potential responses of species to climate change. Here, we assessed the importance of historic baseline climate uncertainty for projections of species' responses to future climate change. We built species distribution models (SDMs) for 895 African bird species of conservation concern, using six different climate baselines. We projected these models to two future periods (2040-2069, 2070-2099), using downscaled climate projections, and calculated species turnover and changes in species-specific climate suitability. We found that the choice of baseline climate data constituted an important source of uncertainty in projections of both species turnover and species-specific climate suitability, often comparable with, or more important than, uncertainty arising from the choice of GCM. Importantly, the relative contribution of these factors to projection uncertainty varied spatially. Moreover, when projecting SDMs to sites of biodiversity importance (Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas), these uncertainties altered site-level impacts, which could affect conservation prioritization. Our results highlight that projections of species' responses to climate change are sensitive to uncertainty in the baseline climatology. We recommend that this should be considered routinely in such analyses.																	1354-1013	1365-2486				JUL	2016	22	7					2392	2404		10.1111/gcb.13273								WOS:000378722000009	26950769

Assessing Den Selection and Den Characteristics of Grizzly Bears	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Hibernation has evolved as an adaptive strategy to avoid harsh environmental conditions associated with a lack of resources, and the choice of hibernacula can affect the fitness of individuals. Most habitat selection studies, including investigations of overwintering sites, are based on data collected from land inventories or remote sensing databases used in a geographic information system (GIS). Although rarely used, forest stand ecological data gathered at fine spatial scales may enhance our understanding of selection processes. Our objectives were to enhance previous GIS-based investigations of den use by grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) with field-based investigations and determine whether males and females selected dens in response to food availability, within-stand characteristics related to concealment cover, or factors affecting the structural stability of dens. We studied den selection for 10 male and 21 female grizzly bears at the home-range scale and within the den vicinity using data collected at 42 den sites, 168 adjacent sites, and 345 random locations within the Rocky Mountains and boreal forest of Alberta, Canada between 2001 and 2012. Within their autumn home range, male and female grizzly bears selected sites with greater concealment cover, greater canopy cover, and more abundant sweet-vetch (Hedysarum spp.) compared to availability. Poor model performance when comparing den sites to adjacent sites within the den vicinity suggests that male and female grizzly bears select sites at scales larger than 0.1 km. We found no difference in the dimensions and characteristics of dens excavated by males and females, nor in the structural stability of dens dug under a mature tree or in open areas, and no selection for a specific type of mineral soil or percentage of boulders and cobbles. Our results corroborate previous resource selection functions using remote sensing and land inventory data but show that home-range scale analyses can fail to assess selection of potentially influential, ecologically important within-stand characteristics such as food abundance and lateral cover. Within-stand data are typically unavailable through current habitat maps and field data can enhance our understanding of fine-scale selection. To minimize human-bear interactions and disturbances at dens, we recommend integrating field-based investigations to high-priority denning areas identified from resource selection functions, and to further improve conservation efforts, we recommend taking into account within-stand data to describe behaviors occurring during the active and inactive periods.

Food resource availability in the species' usual or surrogate habitats may reinforce or decrease its use of certain areas. Our objective was to to determine the influence of natural and anthropogenic variables on spatial distribution of eastern chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii). We first determined the home range of a wild chimpanzee community (hereafter Sebitoli Chimpanzee Community [SCC]) based on global positioning system (GPS) point locations (n = 2,586 direct observations and feces locations) collected between 2009 and 2013 in Sebitoli, Kibale National Park, Uganda. We described SCC home range using grid cells (2,959 cells of 100 m x 100 m) referencing environmental, spatial, and topographical variables (n = 15). We then determined diet and food species abundance within their territory (n = 63 vegetation plots and 18 months phenological survey) and predicted distribution of the 10 most foraged fruit species within SCC home range, using environmental, spatial, and topographical variables (n = 10) by applying a maximum entropy model (maxent). We then predicted chimpanzee presence as a function of environmental, spatial, and topographical variables (n = 15) using the maxent model and assessed its truthfulness with the kernel model, based only on GPS point locations. Chimpanzees in Sebitoli were mostly observed in a core area of 5.42 km(2) within the 25-km(2) home range. They did not avoid forest edges in contact with human populations, especially males who used larger core areas than females. Factors with the greatest positive impact on the chimpanzee distribution model (maxent area under the curve [AUC] = 0.907) were related to 3 different food resources: 1) proximity to forest edges considered as attractive because of presence of crops cultivated by local farmers; 2) proximity to a tarmac road that crosses the SCC home range with shoulders covered by attractive terrestrial herbaceous vegetation; and 3) presence of wild forest fruiting resources. The results obtained with the maxent predictive model, applied on a fine scale, were consistent with the kernel model, based on real observations. Therefore, such an approach may be recommended for surveys or action plans interested in sustainable management of wildlife in an anthropogenic environment and may be a useful tool to better understand parameters of a prefered zone for an endangered species.

A case study at Portofino MPA	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Baseline data on the distribution, condition and extent of coralligenous and cave bioconcretions is one of the main requirements of the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) necessary to assess the achievement of a Good Environmental Status (GES) by 2020. In this study the potential of remote sensing and distribution modelling techniques to map, measure descriptors and choose indicators were tested, that could provide standard methods for the assessment of the health status and assist in monitoring activities. It is demonstrated how, by combining different methodologies, it is possible to map the distribution of the bioconcretions with acceptable accuracy and to discriminate the main habitat types and fades. In addition, zonal statistical analysis revealed that fishing activities primarily coincide with areas of high coverage of the bioconcretions. Results demonstrate that the presented methodology is a valuable simple tool to assess several MSFD descriptors and indicators, and could strengthen management efficiency when making informed, ecologically relevant decisions.

Spatio-temporal changes of a mangrove-saltmarsh ecotone in the northeastern coast of Florida, USA	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												General circulation models predict warming trends and changes in temperature and precipitation patterns that have the potential to alter the structure and function of coastal habitats. The purpose of this study was to quantify the expansion and contraction of mangroves and saltmarsh habitats and assess the impact of climate on these landscape changes. The study was conducted in a mangrove/saltmarsh ecotone in Flagler County, FL, near the northern range limit of mangroves along the Atlantic coast of North America. We used time series of historical aerial photography and high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery from 1942 to 2013 to quantify changes in the extent of mangrove and saltmarsh vegetation and compared these changes to climate variables of temperature and precipitation, temperature-seasonality, as well as historical sea-level data. Results showed increases in mangrove extent of 89% between 1942 and 1952, and a continuous increase from 1995 to 2013. Largest decrease in saltmarsh extent occurred between 1942 and 1952 (-136%) and between 2008 and 2013 (-81%). We found significant effects of precipitation, temperature, seasonality, and time on mangrove and saltmarsh areal extent. The statistical effect of sea-level was rather small, but we speculate that it might have ecological impacts on these two coastal ecosystems. Results also showed a cyclical dynamism as well as a reversal in habitat dominance, which may be the result of complex interactions between plant habitats and several environmental drivers of change such as species interactions, and hydrological changes induced by sea-level rise, in addition to temperature and precipitation effects. Our results on mangrove/saltmarsh expansion and contraction may contribute to the improvement of management and conservation strategies for coastal ecosystems being impacted by climate change.

Integrating technologies for scalable ecology and conservation	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Integration of multiple technologies greatly increases the spatial and temporal scales over which ecological patterns and processes can be studied, and threats to protected ecosystems can be identified and mitigated. A range of technology options relevant to ecologists and conservation practitioners are described, including ways they can be linked to increase the dimensionality of data collection efforts. Remote sensing, ground-based, and data fusion technologies are broadly discussed in the context of ecological research and conservation efforts. Examples of technology integration across all of these domains are provided for large-scale protected area management and investigation of ecological dynamics. Most technologies are low-cost or open-source, and when deployed can reach economies of scale that reduce per-area costs dramatically. The large-scale, long-term data collection efforts presented here can generate new spatio-temporal understanding of threats faced by natural ecosystems and endangered species, leading to more effective conservation strategies.

LANDSCAPE MAPPING: GAINING "SENSE OF PLACE" FOR CONSERVATION IN THE MANASLU CONSERVATION AREA, NEPAL	JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY												Satellite mapping contributes significantly to ecological studies of landscape composition and structure but needs to better engage local populations in more culturally sensitive assessments of diversity patterns. This study examines how participatory mapping can contribute to land-cover analyses derived from satellite data of landscapes in the Manaslu Conservation Area (MCA), Nepal. Landscapes were mapped by local residents, first on paper and again on a geo-registered Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scene, for April 7, 2010. Local landscape knowledge from men and women was transferred from participatory maps to the classified satellite image to create an integrated landscape map for the MCA. Participatory maps added the significance of "place" to the evaluation of landscape diversity (n = 276 named places for women and 315 for men). The classification of the TM image resulted in seven land cover types with only 10% of the land classified as forests, which are highly fragmented. The final map combined local landscape knowledge (n = 43 places mapped on the TM image and n = 21 from the transect walks) with the empirical classification of land cover types, increasing the spatial understanding of MCA as a "place" of material use and cultural meaning. This integrative map, as process and outcome, promoted collaborative learning about local places and local peoples' perspectives on their landscape, which can contribute to more adaptive landscape planning and conservation of forest and livelihood resources.																	0278-0771	2162-4496				JUL	2016	36	2					326	347										WOS:000377540300006						
J	Kordi, MN; O'Leary, M				Kordi, Moataz N.; O'Leary, Michael			A spatial approach to improve coastal bioregion management of the north western Australia	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Coral reefs are a major coastal feature of the Kimberley bioregion in north-western Australia; however, very little is known about the habitats and substrates of the reefs in this coast. Previous studies have been conducted on a broad scale, but no geomorphological, surface substrate and habitat maps of the reefs have been produced. Such maps would provide researchers and coastal zone managers with significant information and estimations of reef growth and productivity. The primary aim of this study was to obtain detailed information on reefs in the Kimberley bioregion. This study used remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), as well as multiple other data sources, to map reef geomorphic zones and the associated key habitats and substrate types of shallow nearshore reefs. Despite the macrotidal regimes and the turbid waters of the study area, remote sensing was effectively used to identify the dominant habitats and substrate types of eight reef platforms. This study provides long-term quantitative assessments of the main habitats and substrates of these reefs and offers a better understanding of reefs in the Kimberly bioregion. It is also a source of valuable information for the marine park and coastal managers investigating the coral reefs that have been targeted for conservation, but have not yet been the subject of regional analysis.

Recent dam constructions on the Yangtze River and its tributaries for agriculture and hydroelectric power exert strong effects on the hydrological regimes of this lake. However, few studies have investigated how the land-use changes through time affect the habitat suitability for wintering Anseriformes-the largest community in this region. Thus, it is necessary to timely monitor changes in the habitat quality and understand the potential factors that alter it. In this study, three periods (1995, 2005 and 2014) of typical environmental indicators that have direct impacts on foraging and resting for the Anserformes, including proximity to water (density of lakes, rivers and ponds), human disturbances (density of residences and various road networks), preferred land cover types and food availability (NDVI), are integrated to develop a habitat suitability index model for habitat mapping. The results indicate that long-term lake shrinkage in low-water periods led to greatly expanded wetlands in these years, which provided more suitable habitat for migratory waterfowl. The amount of highly suitable habitat in 2014 was nearly twice as much as in 1995. Recent survey data from 1997 to 2013 also revealed an increase in the population size, and confirmed the improvement of habitat suitability in the Poyang Lake region. Spatial analysis revealed that land use changes contributed most to the improved habitat coverage between 1995 and 2014. However, the relative significances of these transformations for highly suitable and moderately suitable habitats are strikingly different. Increases in wetland and paddy field area are the main reasons for explaining these improvements, respectively. The framework model proposed in this study will help governments to evaluate habitat conservation and restoration for protecting waterbirds in a spatially explicit way. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Agardh is one of the most diverse genera of marine macroalgae, and commonly inhabits shallow tropical and sub-tropical waters. This study aimed at investigating the effect of seasonality and the associated water-quality changes on the distribution, canopy cover, mean thallus length and biomass of Sargassum beds around Point Peron, Shoalwater Islands Marine Park, southwest Australia. Samples of Sargassum and seawater were collected every 3 mo from the summer of 2012 to the summer of 2014, from 4 different reef zones. A combination of in situ observations and WorldView-2 satellite remote-sensing images were used to map the spatial distribution of Sargassum beds and other associated benthic habitats. The results demonstrated strong seasonal variation in the physicochemical water parameters, canopy cover, mean thallus length, and biomass of Sargassum, which were significantly (p < 0.05) influenced by nutrient concentrations (PO43-, NO3-, NH4+) and rainfall. However, no significant variation in any studied parameter was observed among the 4 reef zones. The highest Sargassum biomass peaks occurred between late spring and early summer (from September to January). The results provide essential information to guide effective conservation and management, as well as sustainable utilisation of this renewable coastal marine resource.

Environmental correlates of nearshore habitat distribution by the Critically Endangered M(a)over-barui dolphin	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Effective management of space-use conflicts with anthropogenic activities is contingent upon reliable knowledge of a species' ecology. The M (a) over bar ui dolphin Cephalorhynchus hectori maui is endemic to New Zealand and is listed as Critically Endangered, mainly as a result of fisheries bycatch. Despite conservation efforts, the population was estimated at 55 animals in 2011. Here we investigate environmental correlates of M (a) over bar ui dolphin nearshore distribution, using 119 encounters with M (a) over bar ui dolphin groups during boat-based, coastal surveys across 4 summers (2010, 2011, 2013, 2015). We describe the nearshore distribution using a kernel density analysis with differential smoothing on the x- and y-axes to account for the nearshore preference of the dolphins and the survey design. In all years, dolphins were encountered consistently in a restricted area (4 year area of overlap: 87.3 km(2)). We modelled habitat preference with boosted regression trees, using presence/absence of dolphins relative to static and dynamic environmental predictors. An index of coastal turbidity was created based on a near-linear relationship between Secchi disk measurements and log-transformed remotely sensed chl a concentration. Sea surface temperature (SST; 22.6% contribution), turbidity (22.2%), distance to major watersheds (17%), depth (14.5%), distance to minor watersheds (13.3%) and distance to the coast (10.4%) partly explained M (a) over bar ui dolphin distribution. We detected a match between predicted areas of high nearshore habitat suitability around North Island and historical sightings (76.2% overlap), thus highlighting potential areas of M (a) over bar ui dolphin recovery.

J	Tanverakul, SA; Lee, J				Tanverakul, Stephanie A.; Lee, Juneseok			Decadal review of residential water demand analysis from a practical perspective	WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY												Residential water demand has been extensively studied over more than four decades, but as yet there is no consensus on the best or most appropriate model from a practical perspective. Conservation and sustainability programs with new metering incentives have increased the necessity for an easy to use forecasting model for water resource management based on a better understanding of the factors driving residential water demand. Analytical techniques have increased in complexity, advancing with new tools for computing and data collection such as GIS and remote sensing. This paper presents a decadal review of how the residential water demand analysis have evolved over time with changes in price policies, conservation attitudes, technological improvements, and other factors explaining water demand. This paper will help provide the knowledge base for the future studies and recommendations are made for addressing/bridging the gap between drinking water industry and research community.																	1751-231X					JUN	2016	11	2					433	447		10.2166/wpt.2016.050								WOS:000390124400019

Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology is a promising tool in bird habitat characterization because it can directly acquire fine-scale 3-D information over large areas; however, most of past avian ecological studies using LiDAR were conducted in North America and Europe, and there have been no studies in Asia. The robustness of LiDAR data across different habitat types remain problematic. In this study, we set 13 plots having different canopy area percentages in a large-scale urban park in Japan, and examined the usefulness of airborne LiDAR data in modeling richness and diversity of forest bird species and the abundance of Paridae species that play an important role in the urban food web. Bird surveys were conducted eight times at each plot during the birds' breeding season, and the results were estimated using generalized linear models. In consequence, all of the response variables were explained by one or a few LiDAR variables, and the 1 x 1 x 1-m voxel-based variables were especially robust estimators. When targeting only densely-forested plots having more than 60% canopy area, the LiDAR data efficiency declined in estimation of the richness and diversity of whole forest bird species, whereas a laser penetration rate was efficient for estimating the Paridae species abundance. These results implied that the LiDAR data are useful in habitat characterization of forest birds, and even when targeting only dense forests, some LiDAR variables are effective for habitat estimation of birds preferring specific forest structures. In the future, application of LiDAR across a variety of ecosystems will greatly serve to develop adaptive conservation and management planning for urban forests. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

J	Hamilton, SE; Casey, D				Hamilton, Stuart E.; Casey, Daniel			Creation of a high spatio-temporal resolution global database of continuous mangrove forest cover for the 21st century (CGMFC-21)	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim To provide high-resolution local, regional, national and global estimates of annual mangrove forest area from 2000 through to 2012 with the goal of driving mangrove research questions pertaining to biodiversity, carbon stocks, climate change, functionality, food security, livelihoods, fisheries support and conservation that have been impeded until now by a lack of suitable data. Location Global, covering 99% of all mangrove forests. Methods We synthesized the Global Forest Change database, the Terrestrial Ecosystems of the World database and the Mangrove Forests of the World database to extract mangrove forest cover at high spatial and temporal resolutions. We then used the new database to monitor mangrove cover at the global, national and protected area scales. Results Countries showing relatively high amounts of mangrove loss include Myanmar, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia and Guatemala. Indonesia remains by far the largest mangrove-holding nation, containing between 26% and 29% of the global mangrove inventory with a deforestation rate of between 0.26% and 0.66% per year. We have made our new database, CGMFC-21, freely available. Main conclusions Global mangrove deforestation continues but at a much reduced rate of between 0.16% and 0.39% per year. Southeast Asia is a region of concern with mangrove deforestation rates between 3.58% and 8.08%, this in a region containing half of the entire global mangrove forest inventory. The global mangrove deforestation pattern from 2000 to 2012 is one of decreasing rates of deforestation, with many nations essentially stable, with the exception of the largest mangrove-holding region of Southeast Asia. We provide a standardized spatial dataset that monitors mangrove deforestation globally at high spatio-temporal resolutions. These data can be used to drive the mangrove research agenda, particularly as it pertains to monitoring of mangrove carbon stocks and the establishment of baseline local mangrove forest inventories required for payment for ecosystem service initiatives.

Mangrove forests store high densities of carbon across the tropical urban landscape of Singapore	URBAN ECOSYSTEMS												Tropical forested ecosystems provide multiple ecosystem services to rural and urban landscapes, with carbon storage gaining particular attention. Deforestation due to rural-urban transitions may lead to a reduction in carbon storage ability. Coastal mangrove forests are particularly at risk from deforestation due to their location in the rapidly urbanizing coastal zone, and the city state of Singapore is an extreme example, losing as much as 90 % of its original mangrove cover due to land reclamation and reservoir construction. Knowledge of mangrove ecosystem services may allow better conservation, restoration and incorporation of remaining mangrove patches into the urban landscape. Focusing on the regulating ecosystem service of carbon storage, mangrove carbon stocks have been estimated for Singapore using a combination of field and remote sensing techniques. Biomass carbon showed substantial spatial variation, with old, contiguous mangrove patches containing a higher density of biomass carbon than fragmented, river-fringing or restored mangroves. In total, national biomass carbon equated to 116,117.1 megagrams of carbon (Mg C), and a coarse estimate of the total carbon stock (including soil carbon) suggests that Singapore's mangroves may store 450,571.7 Mg C. While lower than other regional estimates focused on natural, oceanic mangroves, this is a significant carbon stock for a disturbed, urban mangrove system, and may be equivalent to the average annual carbon emissions of 621,000 residents. This analysis, alongside a review of other urban forest studies, highlights the importance of forested ecosystems such as mangroves in providing a carbon storage ecosystem service to urban areas.

J.; Ochoa-Quintero, Jose M.; Leimgruber, Peter			Using Remote Sensing and Random Forest to Assess the Conservation Status of Critical Cerrado Habitats in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil	LAND												Brazil's Cerrado is a highly diverse ecosystem and it provides critical habitat for many species. Cerrado habitats have suffered significant degradation and decline over the past decades due to expansion of cash crops and livestock farming across South America. Approximately 1,800,000 km(2) of the Cerrado remain in Brazil, but detailed maps and conservation assessments of the Cerrado are lacking. We developed a land cover classification for the Cerrado, focusing on the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, which may also be used to map critical habitat for endangered species. We used a Random Forest algorithm to perform a supervised classification on a set of Landsat 8 images. To determine habitat fragmentation for the Cerrado, we used Fragstats. A habitat connectivity analysis was performed using Linkage Mapper. Our final classification had an overall accuracy of 88%. Our classification produced higher accuracies (72%) in predicting Cerrado than existing government maps. We found that remaining Cerrado habitats were severely fragmented. Four potential corridors were identified in the southwest of Mato Grosso do Sul, where large Cerrado patches are located. Only two large patches remain in Mato Grosso do Sul: one within the Kadiweu Indian Reserve, and one near the southeastern edge of the Pantanal-dominated landscape. These results are alarming for rare species requiring larger tracts of habitat such as the giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus).

Using a winter 2006 waterbird survey, we examined the relationships among metrics of bird community diversity and abundance and landscape characteristics of 51 wetland sub-lakes derived by an object-based classification of Landsat satellite data. Relative importance of predictors and their sets was assessed using information-theoretic model selection and the Akaike Information Criterion. Ordinary least squares regression models were diagnosed and corrected for spatial autocorrelation using spatial autoregressive lag and error models. The strongest and most consistent landscape predictors included Normalized Difference Vegetation Index for mudflat (negative effect) and emergent grassland (positive effect), total sub-lake area (positive effect), and proportion of submerged vegetation (negative effect). Significant spatial autocorrelation in linear regression was associated with local clustering of response and predictor variables, and should be further explored for selection of wetland sampling units and management of protected areas. Overall, results corroborate the utility of remote sensing to elucidate potential indicators of waterbird diversity that complement logistically challenging ground observations and offer new hypotheses on factors underlying community distributions.																	2072-4292					JUN	2016	8	6							462	10.3390/rs8060462								WOS:000379985300022

With its 10 m to 20 m spatial resolution, Sentinel-2 is a promising sensor for the detection of a variety of landscape features of ecological relevance. However, many components of the ecological network are still smaller than the 10 m pixel, i.e., they are sub-pixel targets that stretch the sensor's resolution to its limit. This paper proposes a framework to empirically estimate the minimum object size for an accurate detection of a set of structuring landscape foreground/background pairs. The developed method combines a spectral separability analysis and an empirical point spread function estimation for Sentinel-2. The same approach was also applied to Landsat-8 and SPOT-5 (Take 5), which can be considered as similar in terms of spectral definition and spatial resolution, respectively. Results show that Sentinel-2 performs consistently on both aspects. A large number of indices have been tested along with the individual spectral bands and target discrimination was possible in all but one case. Overall, results for Sentinel-2 highlight the critical importance of a good compromise between the spatial and spectral resolution. For instance, the Sentinel-2 roads detection limit was of 3 m and small water bodies are separable with a diameter larger than 11 m. In addition, the analysis of spectral mixtures draws attention to the uneven sensitivity of a variety of spectral indices. The proposed framework could be implemented to assess the fitness for purpose of future sensors within a large range of applications.

Due to a wide latitudinal distribution, Brazilian mangroves can be found within a large range of environmental conditions. However, little attention has been given to the description of environmental variables driving the distribution of mangrove species in Brazil. In this study, we present a novel and unprecedented description of environmental conditions for all mangroves along the Brazilian coast focusing on species limits. We apply a descriptive statistics and data-driven approach using Self-Organizing Maps and we combine data from terrestrial and marine environmental geodatabases in a Geographical Information System. We evaluate 25 environmental variables (21 bioclimatic variables, three sea surface temperature derivates, and salinity). The results reveal three groups of correlated variables: (i) air temperature derivates and sea surface temperature derivates; (ii) air temperature, potential evapotranspiration and precipitation derivates; and (iii) precipitation derivates, aridity and salinity. Our results unveil new locations of extreme values of temperature and precipitation. We conclude that Rhizophora harrisonii and Rhizophora racemosa are more limited by precipitation and aridity and that they do not necessarily follow a latitudinal gradient. Our data also reveal that the lowest air temperatures of the coldest month are not necessarily found at the southernmost limits of mangroves in Brazil; instead they are localized at the Mesoregion of Vale do Itajai. However, the minimum sea surface temperature drops gradually with higher latitudes in the Brazilian southern hemisphere and is probably a better indicator for the decrease of species at the latitudinal limits of mangroves than the air temperature and precipitation.

Individual Tree Species Classification From Airborne Multisensor Imagery Using Robust PCA	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING					IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 26-31, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE				Remote sensing of individual tree species has many applications in resource management, biodiversity assessment, and conservation. Airborne remote sensing using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and hyperspectral sensors has been used extensively to extract biophysical traits of vegetation and to detect species. However, its application for individual tree mapping remains limited due to the technical challenges of precise coalignment of images acquired from different sensors and accurately delineating individual tree crowns (ITCs). In this study, we developed a generic workflow to map tree species at ITC level from hyperspectral imagery and LiDAR data using a combination of well established and recently developed techniques. The workflow uses a nonparametric image registration approach to coalign images, a multiclass normalized graph cut method for ITC delineation, robust principal component analysis for feature extraction, and support vector machine for species classification. This workflow allows us to automatically map tree species at both pixel- and ITC-level. Experimental tests of the technique were conducted using ground data collected from a fully mapped temperate woodland in the UK. The overall accuracy of pixel-level classification was 91%, while that of ITC-level classification was 61%. The test results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, and in particular the use of robust principal component analysis to prune the hyperspectral dataset and reveal subtle difference among species.

The CN method was applied to calculate the runoff in the catchment basin of the Yamula Dam which is located on the Kizilirmak River in the semi-arid climate of the Central Anatolia Region of Turkey. The analysis of the relation between the land use change and the change of the curve number (change of the runoff values) in the catchment basin can be calculated through geographic information system (GIS) techniques by using the data obtained from satellite images. Using GIS analysis with Python language, SCS-CN technique was applied to study area efficiently. The estimated CN values indicate an uptrend in proportion to the increase in the water level and agricultural lands in the catchment basin. This change is relevant to the land use/land cover (LULC) and the land inclination and in connection with the morphological structure of the soil.

METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION					5th Anniversary Symposium of Methods in Ecology and Evolution	2015	CANADA					1. Essential Biodiversity Variable, Natural Capital, Biodiversity Indicator and Ecosystem Service are four concepts that underpin the most popular frameworks currently considered for helping to coordinate and structure biodiversitymonitoring efforts worldwide. Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS) has considerable potential to inform these initiatives. To date, however, discussions on the role of SRS in supporting these frameworks have mostly evolved independently; tend to be led by different groups; sometimes target slightly different scales; and are likely to reach different audiences. Because of this, there is some confusion among environmental managers and policymakers as to what the potential of SRS is or whether there is prospect in considering and promoting the use of satellite data for biodiversity conservation. 2. Here, we provide a brief overview of the role of SRS to date in informing these frameworks. Through a case study focused on the Sahara Desert ecosystem, we also demonstrate the current potential for SRS-based methodologies to support conservation in data-deficient areas and discuss the relative applicability of SRS-based metrics to each of these frameworks. 3. The relevance and use of SRS across the four frameworks are clearly variable, due to differences and ambiguity in definitions, and due to differences in monitoring priorities. Our case study illustrates the particularly high potential for SRS approaches to provide key information relevant to the Biodiversity Indicators framework in desert ecosystems; it also identifies SRS-based metrics relevant to all frameworks. 4. Altogether, this work highlights how more dialogue is required within the biodiversity-monitoring community for SRS to reach its full potential in conservation. In particular, agreement on what is needed in priority, given the realm of what is possible, will be of paramount importance to developing SRS-based products that are used by policymakers and international conventions.

Water Resources Assessment and Management in Drylands	WATER												Drylands regions of the world face difficult issues in maintaining water resources to meet current demands which will intensify in the future with population increases, infrastructure development, increased agricultural water demands, and climate change impacts on the hydrologic system. New water resources evaluation and management methods will be needed to assure that water resources in drylands are optimally managed in a sustainable manner. Development of water management and conservation methods is a multi-disciplinary endeavor. Scientists and engineers must collaborate and cooperate with water managers, planners, and politicians to successfully adopt new strategies to manage water not only for humans, but to maintain all aspects of the environment. This particularly applies to drylands regions where resources are already limited and conflicts over water are occurring. Every aspect of the hydrologic cycle needs to be assessed to be able to quantify the available water resources, to monitor natural and anthropogenic changes, and to develop flexible policies and management strategies that can change as conditions dictate. Optimal, sustainable water management is achieved by cooperation and not conflict, thereby necessitating the need for high quality scientific research and input into the process.																	2073-4441					JUN	2016	8	6							239	10.3390/w8060239								WOS:000378851300023

A case study in Ghana	IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY												Degradation, a reduction of the ecosystem's capacity to supply goods and services, is widespread in tropical forests and mainly caused by human disturbance. To maintain the full range of forest ecosystem services and support the development of effective conservation policies, we must understand the overall impact of degradation on different forest resources. This research investigates the response to disturbance of forest structure using several indicators: soil carbon content, arboreal richness and biodiversity, functional composition (guild and wood density), and productivity. We drew upon large field and remote sensing datasets from different forest types in Ghana, characterized by varied protection status, to investigate impacts of selective logging, and of illegal land use and resources extraction, which are the main disturbance causes in West Africa. Results indicate that functional composition and the overall number of species are less affected by degradation, while forest structure, soil carbon content and species abundance are seriously impacted, with resources distribution reflecting the protection level of the areas. Remote sensing analysis showed an increase in productivity in the last three decades, with higher resiliency to change in drier forest types, and stronger productivity correlation with solar radiation in the short dry season. The study region is affected by growing anthropogenic pressure on natural resources and by an increased climate variability: possible interactions of disturbance with climate are also discussed, together with the urgency to reduce degradation in order to preserve the full range of ecosystem functions.

A.; Hegde, Rajendra			Estimating soil fertility status in physically degraded land using GIS and remote sensing techniques in Chamarajanagar district, Karnataka, India	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES												Soil physical degradation is a major environmental problem throughout the world due to its negative impact on biomass and economic production. This study presented new ways of combining rapid soil analysis using GIS and remote sensing imagery to provide a precision mapping of soil physical condition indicators in the study area and producing fertility status using Geostatistical approach. Study has been carried out to map the areas with physical degradation using remotely sensed data from Indian Remote Sensing LISS III sensor. It was observed that the data enabled better delineation of small units of eroded areas. Satellite data have been used for qualitative assessment of areas, being subject to soil erosion. Soil erosion was found to be none or slight to very sever using visual interpretation of IRS data along with field survey method where soil erosion was found to be moderate to high using the RUSLE method. The eroded areas of degraded lands will be used as an input for planning reclamation and conservation programs in Chamarajanagar district of Karnataka. Soil compaction is a form of physical degradation resulting in densification and distortion of the soil where biological activity, porosity and permeability are reduced, strength is increased and soil structure partly destroyed. Compaction can reduce water infiltration capacity and increase erosion risk by accelerating run-off. The compaction process can be initiated by wheels, tracks, rollers or by the passage of animals. Some soils are naturally compacted, strongly cemented or have a thin topsoil layer on rock subsoil. Soils can vary from being sufficiently strong to resist all likely applied loads to being so weak that they are compacted by even light loads.

Modeling land use changes is one way to aid the management of cities. Using remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) software platforms, land use data for the years 1989, 1996, 2004, and 2010 for the area inside the Jinan third ring road were interpreted. An urban green space network was developed, as a core strategy to ensure landscape ecological security, and subjected to ecological sensitivity analysis. The green space network and the result of the ecological sensitivity analysis were integrated into the exclusion/attraction layer of an existing cellular automaton model: slope, land use, exclusion/attraction, urban extent, transportation, and hillshade (SLEUTH). A development scenario for land use change was constructed that integrates these landscape ecological security development (LESD) strategies and reveals trends in urban growth for the different development scenarios between 2011 and 2040. The results of the LESD scenario were compared with those from two other development scenarios: the historical trend development (HTD) and the transit-oriented development (TOD). The study revealed three significant findings. First, change in the urban area in the study will be dominated by urban edge growth and transit-oriented development, while spontaneous growth and cluster growth were not obvious. Second, the growth rate of built-up land in the urban area in all three scenarios exhibits emerging trends. The growth rate, according to the LESD scenario, is significantly lower than those for the HTD and TOD scenarios, and encroachment into natural ecological space (such as woodlands, water, and agricultural land) is less than those in the other two scenarios. This result indicates that the LESD scenario can protect natural ecological spaces effectively and can significantly reduce the ecological security risk. This aligns with the integration of smart growth and smart conservation. Third, integrating LESD into the SLEUTH model results in the ability to evaluate urban development policies and can help characterize development strategies for urban landscape ecological security. The results of this study provide reference data and a basis for decision making for the future management of urban growth, urban planning, and land use planning.

In the studied area, 129 depressions (abandoned and working mines) were identified within 53 small basins over an area of more than 24 km(2). The excavated areas arrest surface runoff, leading to degradation of downstream channels.																	1025-9112	1616-1068				JUN	2016	35	2					156	167		10.1007/s10230-015-0342-8								WOS:000376409600005

A Review of Advances in the Identification and Characterization of Groundwater Dependent Ecosystems Using Geospatial Technologies	GEOSCIENCES												Groundwater Dependent Ecosystem (GDE) protection is increasingly being recognized as essential for the sustainable management and allocation of water resources. GDE services are crucial for human well-being and for a variety of flora and fauna. However, the conservation of GDEs is only possible if knowledge about their location and extent is available. Several studies have focused on the identification of GDEs at specific locations using ground-based measurements. However, recent progress in remote sensing technologies and their integration with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has provided alternative ways to map GDEs at a much larger spatial extent. This paper presents a review of the geospatial methods that have been used to map and delineate GDEs at spatial different extents. Additionally, a summary of the satellite sensors useful for identification of GDEs and the integration of remote sensing data with ground-based measurements in the process of mapping GDEs is presented.																	2076-3263					JUN	2016	6	2							UNSP 17	10.3390/geosciences6020017								WOS:000410144300001						
J	Eskandari, I; Navid, H; Rangzan, K				Eskandari, Iraj; Navid, Hosain; Rangzan, Kazem			Evaluating spectral indices for determining conservation and conventional tillage systems in a vetch-wheat rotation	INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH												Conservation tillage (CT) systems, which consist of reduced and no-tillage systems, retain considerable quantities of crop residues on the soil surface. These crop residues perform as a barrier to wind and water to decrease soil erosion and evaporation. The use of remote sensing technology provides fast, objective and effective tool for estimating and measuring any agricultural event. The challenge is to differentiate the tillage systems by the crop residue cover on the soil surface. Spectrally derived normalized difference tillage index (NDTI), Shortwave infrared normalized difference residue index (SINDRI), cellulose absorption index (CAI) and Lignin-cellulose absorption index (LCA) were examined to distinguish their value as remote sensing methods for identifying crop residue cover in conventional and conservation tillage systems. Tillage treatments included conventional tillage (MD: Mouldboard plow + Disk harrow), reduced tillage (CD: Chisel plow + Disk harrow), minimum till (MT: Stubble cultivator), and no-tillage (NT1 and NT2: with standing stubble and standing stubble plus threshing residue, respectively). CAI had a linear relationship with crop residue cover, which the comparative intensity of cellulose and lignin absorption features near 2100 nm can be measure by it. Coefficients of determination (r(2)) for crop residue cover as a function of CAI and LCA were 0.89 and 0.79 respectively. Absorption specifications near 2.1 and 2.3 mu m in the reflectance spectra of crop residues in minimum and no- tillage systems were related to cellulose and lignin. These specifications were not evident in the spectra of conventional tillage system. In this study the best index to use was CAI, which showed complete separation tillage systems, followed by LCA and NDTI. Four tillage intensity classes, corresponding to intensive (< 6% residue cover), reduced (10-20% cover) minimum (25-40%) and no-tillage (> 60% cover) tillage, were recognized in this study.

J	Gelagay, HS; Minale, AS				Gelagay, Habtamu Sewnet; Minale, Amare Sewnet			Soil loss estimation using GIS and Remote sensing techniques: A case of Koga watershed, Northwestern Ethiopia	INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH												Soil loss by runoff is a severe and continuous ecological problem in Koga watershed. Deforestation, improper cultivation and uncontrolled grazing have resulted in accelerated soil erosion. Information on soil loss is essential to support agricultural productivity and natural resource management. Thus, this study was aimed to estimate and map the mean annual soil loss by using GIS and Remote sensing techniques. The soil loss was estimated by using Revised Universal Soil Equation (RUSLE) model. Topographic map of 1:50,000 scale, Aster Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of 20 m spatial resolution, digital soil map of 1:250,000 scale, thirteen years rainfall records of four stations, and land sat imagery (TM) with spatial resolution of 30 m was used to derive RUSLE's soil loss variables. The RUSLE parameters were analyzed and integrated using raster calculator in the geo-processing tools in ArcGIS 10.1 environment to estimate and map the annual soil loss of the study area. The result revealed that the annual soil loss of the watershed extends from none in the lower and middle part of the watershed to 265 t ha(-1) year(-1) in the steeper slope part of the watershed with a mean annual soil loss of 47 t ha(-1) year(-1). The total annual soil loss in the watershed was 255283 t, of these, 181801 (71%) tones cover about 6691 (24%) hectare of land. Most of these soil erosion affected areas are spatially situated in the upper steepest slope part (inlet) of the watershed. These are areas where Nitosols and Alisols with higher soil erodibility character (0.25) values are dominant. Hence, Slope gradient and length followed by soil erodibility factors were found to be the main factors of soil erosion. Thus, sustainable soil and water conservation practices should be adopted in steepest upper part of the study area by respecting and recognizing watershed logic, people and watershed potentials.

Conservation priorities of forest ecosystems: Evaluation of deforestation and degradation hotspots using geospatial techniques	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Spatially explicit planning is required to set focused conservation priorities and assessing future ecological implications. Spatial ecological modeling and hotspot analysis prioritizes the forest ecosystems and supports the conservation of species level biodiversity. In the present study, the hotspots of deforestation and forest fires were obtained using historical deforestation trends (1975-1985-1995-2005-2014) and fire history (2009-2014) in Andhra Pradesh, India. The priority areas were identified as deforestation and degradation hotspots using combined measures of threat from deforestation, fire hotspots and current level of forest fragmentation. The state of Andhra Pradesh represents an area of 25985 km(2) (16.2% of total geographical area) under forest cover in 2014. The net deforested area was estimated as 2390 km(2) (8.4%) from 1975 to 2014. We have calculated the region of influence in percentages and found deforestation hotspots covering an average of 40.2% forest, followed by 35.9% under high fragmentation and 19.2% under fire hotspots. Ecosystem level analysis has been carried out for all the forest types i.e., semi evergreen, moist deciduous, dry deciduous, dry evergreen, thorn and mangroves, indicating ecosystem vulnerability. According to the results of prioritization, about 10.5% of existing forest had severe ecosystem collapse and categorized as deforestation and degradation hotspot-I. Analysis of protected areas shows Nagarjunasagar Srisailam Tiger Reserve, Sri Peninsula Narasimha sanctuary, Papikonda sanctuary and Sri Venkateshwara sanctuary are representing deforestation and degradation hotspot-I. Deforestation and degradation hotspots identified in the study is an excellent surrogate for understanding anthropogenic disturbances and can be effectively useful in forest management to proceed for applicable restoration measures.

FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Old-growth boreal forests display high within-stand structural variation, with large variation in tree sizes and age structure, a heterogeneous horizontal spatial pattern with gaps of different sizes and multi layered canopies. Old managed forests, on the other hand, are characterized by more homogeneous structural patterns. In many parts of Europe, no true 'virgin forests' remains. Still, in many places forests previously influenced by selective logging have been abandoned, and is now developing towards a more natural forest structure. Such near-natural forest areas can be of special importance for forest biodiversity and related ecosystem services, and it is therefore important to map and monitor such forests. Recently, airborne laser scanning (ALE) has been applied to provide ecologically relevant information on forest structure. The advantage of ALS is that it can characterize three-dimensional forest structure in fine detail across broad areas, replacing more labour-intensive field-based measurements. In this study, we use ALS to compare the structural characteristics of 89 near-natural and 280 managed old forest stands in a 17,000 ha boreal forest study site in southeastern Norway. For the study area, both maps of logging history separating old near-natural and old managed forests, and high-resolution ALS data was available. Our aim was to investigate if ALS data could be used to separate vertical and horizontal forest structure in old near natural versus old managed forests. We also wanted to compare different methods for classification, and to describe the potential for use of ALS in classification of forest naturalness for future mapping and monitoring purposes. We found that ALS data had a strong potential in separating stands of old near-natural forests from old managed stands. The most important metrics for classification were those reflecting canopy height, canopy density, variation in canopy height, number of trees per area and gap patterns. This fits well with ecological knowledge of relevant structural differences between forests of different degree of naturalness. Both vertical and horizontal metrics provided useful input to the classification, but the horizontal metrics performed slightly better on accuracy and were easier to interpret. Although the method has a good potential for wider use in boreal forest landscapes, the need for local reference data for calibration as well as the importance of ALS pulse density for precision of classification should be further investigated. Large-scale spatial information on remaining source areas of natural and near-natural forests will be essential in order to manage forests in a way that safeguards biodiversity and ecosystem services. We suggest that classification of forest naturalness based on ALS data can be a helpful tool in future forest mapping and monitoring. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Burgoyne, C; Kelso, C; Ahmed, F				Burgoyne, Christopher; Kelso, Clare; Ahmed, Fethi			Human activity and vegetation change around Mkuze Game Reserve, South Africa	SOUTH AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL												In the last century, the establishment of protected areas has become an important part of managing South Africa's wilderness and wildlife. The notion of untouched protected areas has become contested in a time when developing nations are seeking to improve quality of life for their citizens. With the promulgation of modern environmental legislation, resource sharing with local rural communities has become an important policy guideline for protected area management authorities. Census archives and remotely sensed data were used in order to investigate anthropogenic land-cover change around Mkuze Game Reserve between 1979 and 2008. Results showed that natural land cover decreased consistently as populations increased, despite variations in rainfall and population movement. Natural land cover inside Mkuze Game Reserve remained relatively stable. Bush was found to be increasingly degraded around more densely populated areas, while grassland was degrading in districts more concentrated with agricultural activity. A potential problem for future natural resource-dependent livelihoods in the area was the replacement of wetlands with sugarcane agriculture. If current trends continue, natural land-cover loss will continue. Evidence suggests that local socio-environmental systems are changing signifying important implications for the management of human activity and biodiversity around the borders of protected areas in South Africa.																	0373-6245	2151-2418				MAY 3	2016	98	2					217	234		10.1080/03736245.2015.1028978								WOS:000373878500002

Landsat ETM plus and SRTM Data Provide Near Real-Time Monitoring of Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) Habitats in Africa	REMOTE SENSING												All four chimpanzee sub-species populations are declining due to multiple factors including human-caused habitat loss. Effective conservation efforts are therefore needed to ensure their long-term survival. Habitat suitability models serve as useful tools for conservation planning by depicting relative environmental suitability in geographic space over time. Previous studies mapping chimpanzee habitat suitability have been limited to small regions or coarse spatial and temporal resolutions. Here, we used Random Forests regression to downscale a coarse resolution habitat suitability calibration dataset to estimate habitat suitability over the entire chimpanzee range at 30-m resolution. Our model predicted habitat suitability well with an r(2) of 0.82 (+/-0.002) based on 50-fold cross validation where 75% of the data was used for model calibration and 25% for model testing; however, there was considerable variation in the predictive capability among the four sub-species modeled individually. We tested the influence of several variables derived from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) that included metrics of forest canopy and structure for four three-year time periods between 2000 and 2012. Elevation, Landsat ETM+ band 5 and Landsat derived canopy cover were the strongest predictors; highly suitable areas were associated with dense tree canopy cover for all but the Nigeria-Cameroon and Central Chimpanzee sub-species. Because the models were sensitive to such temporally based predictors, our results are the first to highlight the value of integrating continuously updated variables derived from satellite remote sensing into temporally dynamic habitat suitability models to support near real-time monitoring of habitat status and decision support systems.																	2072-4292					MAY	2016	8	5							427	10.3390/rs8050427								WOS:000378406400071

In this context, remote sensing can be a valuable tool for conservation management by monitoring vegetation dynamics, projecting the persistence of vegetation trends and identifying areas of interest for upcoming restoration measures. In this study, we use MODIS satellite time series (2001-2013) and the Hurst exponent to classify the study area (Guizhou and Guangxi Provinces) according to the persistence of future vegetation trends (positive, anti-persistent positive, negative, anti-persistent negative, stable or uncertain). The persistence of trends is interrelated with terrain conditions (elevation and slope angle) and results in an index providing information on the restoration prospects and associated uncertainty of different terrain classes found in the study area. The results show that 69% of the observed trends are persistent beyond 2013, with 57% being stable, 10% positive, 5% anti-persistent positive, 3% negative, 1% anti-persistent negative and 24% uncertain. Most negative development is found in areas of high anthropogenic influence (low elevation and slope), as compared to areas of rough terrain. We further show that the uncertainty increases with the elevation and slope angle, and areas characterized by both high elevation and slope angle need special attention to prevent degradation. Whereas areas with a low elevation and slope angle appear to be less susceptible and relevant for restoration efforts (also having a high uncertainty), we identify large areas of medium elevation and slope where positive future trends are likely to happen if adequate measures are utilized. The proposed framework of this analysis has been proven to work well for assessing restoration prospects in the study area, and due to the generic design, the method is expected to be applicable for other areas of complex landscapes in the world to explore future trends of vegetation.

Mapping for coral reef conservation: comparing the value of participatory and remote sensing approaches	ECOSPHERE												Detailed habitat maps are critical for conservation planning, yet for many coastal habitats only coarse-resolution maps are available. As the logistic and technological constraints of habitat mapping become increasingly tractable, habitat map comparisons are warranted. Here we compare two mapping approaches: local environmental knowledge (LEK) obtained from interviews; and remote sensing analysis (RS) of high spatial resolution satellite imagery (2.0 m pixel) using object-based image analysis. For a coral reef ecosystem, we compare the accuracy of these two approaches for mapping shallow seafloor habitats and contrast their characterization of habitat area and seascape connectivity. We also explore several implications for conservation planning. When evaluated using independent ground verification data, LEK-derived maps achieved a lower overall accuracy than RS-derived maps (LEK: 66%; RS: 76%). A comparison of mapped habitats found low overall agreement between LEK and RS maps. The RS map identified 5.4 times more habitat edges (the border between adjacent habitat classes) and 3.7-6.4 times greater seascape connectivity. Since the spatial arrangement of habitats affects many species (e.g., movement, predation risk), such discrepancies in landscape metrics are important to consider in conservation planning. Our results help identify strengths and weakness of both mapping approaches for conservation planning. Because RS provided a more accurate estimate of habitat distributions, it would be better for conservation planning for species sensitive to fine-spatial scale seascape patterns (e.g., habitat edges), whereas LEK is more cost effective and appropriate for mapping coarse habitat patterns. Goals for maps used in conservation should be identified early in their development.																	2150-8925					MAY	2016	7	5							e01325	10.1002/ecs2.1325								WOS:000377215200030

We examined its distributional pattern across French Guiana using a large number of environmental descriptors at 3 scales of analysis: landscape, forest type, and microhabitat. We used a hierarchical model with temporary emigration and imperfect detection for data collected by standard distance sampling methods at 35 study sites. At the landscape scale, Black Curassow density decreased with hunting pressure and increased with steeper slopes in both hunted and unhunted areas. Topography appeared to be a good proxy for Black Curassow ecological requirements and probably reflected habitat quality. At the forest scale, population density was negatively correlated with the abundance of palms and Mimosoideae and positively correlated with the abundance of Lauraceae. Botanical families did not directly influence Black Curassow distribution, but rather determined spatial patterns by being markers of a particular forest type. At the microhabitat scale, Black Curassows used hilltops more frequently than other parts of the local topographical gradient. Our multiscale analysis shows that this species' distribution can be explained by biotic or abiotic conditions, regardless of the scale. For conservation, we recommend maintaining connectivity between Black Curassow populations separated by hunted areas. Our predicted densities could be used to adapt hunting quotas across French Guiana's forests. We show that combining field and remote sensing data helps to understand the ecological processes responsible for Black Curassow habitat relationships.

Thus, it is necessary to analyze the responses of ecosystem services to changes in land use over time. Polders, a typical floodplain landscape in the Chaohu Lake Basin, were selected as the study area to evaluate how ecosystem services respond to changes in both land use and patch size over time. Multiple approaches, including remote sensing, geographical information system and correspondence analysis, were used. The results showed that the total ecosystem services were increased from 9.97 x 10(8) to 1.02 x 10(9) Yuan for all polders. Based on a correspondence analysis, recreation and culture, water supply and waste treatment are the ecosystem services that depend on water bodies, whereas six other types of ecosystem services (biodiversity protection, climate regulation, food production, raw material, soil formation and protection and gas regulation) depend on soil. Therefore, there are trade-offs between the ecosystem services provided by farmlands and those provided by water bodies, between supporting and provisioning services and cultural services in the polders, and between provisioning services and most regulating services. Furthermore, trade-offs and synergies were detected among regulating services. In this study, the relationships between patch sizes and ecosystem services were significantly changed during the 1985-2007 period, particularly from 2000 to 2007. The area variation of special land use can drive changes in these relationships. Notably, correspondence analysis can be used as a method to analyze synergies and trade-offs among multiple ecosystem services.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAY	2016	75	10							856	10.1007/s12665-016-5683-5								WOS:000376589500009

Circumpolar Arctic vegetation: a hierarchic review and roadmap toward an internationally consistent approach to survey, archive and classify tundra plot data	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Satellite-derived remote-sensing products are providing a modern circumpolar perspective of Arctic vegetation and its changes, but this new view is dependent on a long heritage of ground-based observations in the Arctic. Several products of the Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna are key to our current understanding. We review aspects of the PanArctic Flora, the Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map, the Arctic Biodiversity Assessment, and the Arctic Vegetation Archive (AVA) as they relate to efforts to describe and map the vegetation, plant biomass, and biodiversity of the Arctic at circumpolar, regional, landscape and plot scales. Cornerstones for all these tools are ground-based plant-species and plant-community surveys. The AVA is in progress and will store plot-based vegetation observations in a public-accessible database for vegetation classification, modeling, diversity studies, and other applications. We present the current status of the Alaska Arctic Vegetation Archive (AVA-AK), as a regional example for the panarctic archive, and with a roadmap for a coordinated international approach to survey, archive and classify Arctic vegetation. We note the need for more consistent standards of plot-based observations, and make several recommendations to improve the linkage between plot-based observations biodiversity studies and satellite-based observations of Arctic vegetation.

They provide shelter and nursery to wide variety of species such as fish and birds. Around 73 species of mangroves were recognized around the world. In Qatar, there is only one mangrove species Avicennia marina that is predominant along the northeastern coast. Assessing the health of these valuable ecosystems is vital for protection, management, and conservation of those resources. In this study, an integrated approach of chemical and remote sensing analysis was implemented to investigate the current status of the mangrove trees in Al-Khor, Qatar. Fifteen different A. marina trees from different locations in the mangrove forest were examined for their chlorophyll and nitrogen content levels. Soil analysis was also conducted to understand the effect of moisture on nitrogen availability. Results shows that currently, mangroves are in a good status in terms of nitrogen availability and chlorophyll levels which are related and both are key factors for photosynthesis. Remote sensing techniques were used for chlorophyll prediction. The results showed that these methods have the potential to be used for chlorophyll prediction and estimation.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY	2016	188	5							268	10.1007/s10661-016-5269-4								WOS:000376017400009	27048493

Spatio-temporal runoff estimation using TRMM satellite data and NRSC-CN method of a watershed of Upper Subarnarekha River basin, India	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Geographical Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) have acquired great significance in the recent years for estimation of runoff from watersheds and agricultural fields. This study has made use of the well-established tool, Natural Resources Conservation Service Curve Number (NRCS-CN) method to observe runoff over the study area in conjunction with GIS and RS. Pixel-wise runoff depth of the catchment was estimated by incorporating Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM) data, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) multi-satellite precipitation analysis data for the years 2001-2011, and Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM)+ Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) information within the simple rainfall-runoff model. NRSC-CN was modified for Indian condition and the Hydrologic Engineering Center's Geospatial Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-Geo-HMS) extension was utilized for evaluating the Curve Number (CN). Rainfall-Runoff model was executed to compute pixel-wise runoff, utilizing the model builder interface of ARC GIS 10. It was observed that there had been an increase in the average runoff depth ranging from 2.25 to 2.48 mm in different micro-watersheds of the study area. There was also an increase in total runoff depth from 61.24 to 68.47 m following an increase in mean CN value from 55 in the year 2001 to 57 in the year 2011. This indicated a lesser increase in lower runoff level range and a greater increase in higher runoff level range. In terms of runoff within the watershed, a higher percentage of its micro-watersheds showed lower runoff range compared to the micro-watersheds with higher runoff range. A direct correlation was observed between reduction in agriculture with increased runoff, increase in open land, and decrease in vegetation.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				MAY	2016	9	5							374	10.1007/s12517-016-2376-z								WOS:000375767000045

Tropical nature reserves are losing their buffer zones, but leakage is not to blame	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Tropical forests provide important ecosystem services to humanity, yet are threatened by habitat loss resulting from deforestation and land-use change. Although reserves are considered the cornerstones of conservation efforts in the tropics, their efficacy remains equivocal. One question that remains unresolved is whether leakage - the unanticipated displacement of deforestation from inside reserves into the unrestricted zones just beyond a reserve's administrative boundary - is common around tropical forest reserves, or whether the zones are acting as buffers between the protected area and the outside world. To resolve this question, we used the Landsat-derived Global Forest Change dataset to estimate deforestation rates between 2000 and 2012 inside and outside of 60 nature reserves spread across the tropics. Deforestation rates inside reserves (within 5 km of the administrative boundary) were generally lower than those immediately outside the reserves (i.e. in buffer zones 0-10 km from the boundary), suggesting that reserves are effective at protecting forests. We hypothesised that leakage would result in greater deforestation rates in reserve buffer zones than in the broader reserve landscapes, but such a pattern was observed in only five African sites, suggesting that leakage does not often occur on the edge of established reserves. However, roughly 80% of reserves experienced deforestation rates that increased gradually from their interiors to the outer periphery of their buffer zones. Thus, while leakage may not be a pervasive phenomenon around tropical reserves worldwide, tropical reserves are often losing their buffer zones, resulting in increased isolation that could have ramifications for ecosystem services provisioning and tropical conservation strategies.

Conservation of the Ethiopian church forests: Threats, opportunities and implications for their management	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In the central and northern highlands of Ethiopia, native forest and forest biodiversity is almost confined to sacred groves associated with churches. Local communities rely on these 'church forests' for essential ecosystem services including shade and fresh water but little is known about their region-wide distribution and conservation value. We(1) performed the first large-scale spatially-explicit assessment of church forests, combining remote-sensing and field data, to assess the number of forests, their size, shape, isolation and woody plant species composition, (2) determined their plant communities and related these to environmental variables and potential natural vegetation, (3) identified the main challenges to biodiversity conservation in view of plant population dynamics and anthropogenic disturbances, and (4) present guidelines for management and policy. The 394 forests identified in satellite images were on average similar to 2 ha in size and generally separated by similar to 2 km from the nearest neighboring forest. Shape complexity, not size, decreased from the northern to the central highlands. Overall, 148 indigenous tree, shrub and liana species were recorded across the 78 surveyed forests. Patch a-diversity increased with mean annual precipitation, but typically only 25 woody species occurred per patch. The combined results showed that >50% of tree species present in tropical northeast Africa were still present in the 78 studied church forests, even though individual forests were small and relatively species-poor. Tree species composition of church forests varied with elevation and precipitation, and resembled the potential natural vegetation. With a wide distribution over the landscape, these church forests have high conservation value. However, long-term conservation of biodiversity of individual patches and evolutionary potential of species may be threatened by isolation, small sizes of tree species populations and disturbance, especially when considering climate change. Forest management interventions are essential and should be supported by environmental education and other forms of public engagement. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the last years, aerial and satellite imagery have been increasingly used to monitor the spatial extent of changes in LU/LC, deriving relevant biophysical parameters (i.e. primary productivity, climate and habitat structure) that have clear implications in determining spatial and temporal patterns of biodiversity, landscape composition and ecosystem services. An innovative hierarchical modelling framework was developed in order to address the influence of nested attributes of LU/LC on community-based ecological indicators. Founded in the principles of the spatially explicit stochastic dynamic methodology (StDM), the proposed methodological advances are supported by the added value of integrating bottom-up interactions between multi-scaled drivers. The dynamics of biophysical multi-attributes of fine-scale subsystem properties are incorporated to inform dynamic patterns at upper hierarchical levels. Since the most relevant trends associated with LU/LC changes are explicitly modelled within the StDM framework, the ecological indicators' response can be predicted under different social-economic scenarios and site-specific management actions. A demonstrative application is described to illustrate the framework methodological steps, supporting the theoretic principles previously presented. We outline the proposed multi-model framework as a promising tool to integrate relevant biophysical information to support ecosystem management and decision-making.

Especially the unrestrained urban growth caused excessive pressure on the existing infrastructure, which affects buildings, public transportation, road networks, water quality, waste collection and public health. Green roofs are emerging building technologies that can help communities mitigate some of the above mentioned problems. Various studies have demonstrated that the implementation of green roof technology can moderate some of these environmental problems, through the reduction of heat flux and solar reflectivity, the minimisation of heat losses through the building's envelope, the air pollution removal, the storm water runoff reduction, the air cooling as well as the effective management of the urban heat island effect. In this line of thought, the aim of this study is to assess the green roof potential and the quantification of its benefits over Thessaloniki, Greece's second largest city. To delineate the available green roof areas, very high spatial resolution satellite image and natural colour orthoimagery were used along with a geographical object-based image analysis approach. Potential green roof extent was extracted with a mean error of 8.78 m(2), and discriminated from staircases, penthouse setbacks and terracotta tiles. Subsequently GIS were used to extrapolate the results from the building to the city scale. Carbon sequestration potential, rainwater retention and energy conservation were estimated based on coefficients adopted after a comprehensive literature review and actual dynamic energy simulations. The green roof potential in Thessaloniki approximated 17% of the gross built areas of the city, which means that there is a strong potential for green roof retrofit. Depending on the vegetation type installed in an extensive green roof, C stocks in Thessaloniki can increase by 2.5 times, while the dynamic energy simulations suggested that in certain city blocks reduced heating and cooling consumptions up to 5% and 16% respectively could be achieved. In regard to rainwater retention, implementation of green roofs in Thessaloniki is estimated to contribute in rainwater retention by almost 45%, allowing more than half of the rainwater precipitation to be reserved at the 50% of the city blocks.

Remote sensing has much potential for biodiversity mapping, and high spatial resolution imaging spectroscopy (IS) allows for direct prediction of tree species diversity based on spectral reflectance. The objective of this study was to test an approach for mapping tree species alpha diversity that takes advantage of an unsupervised object-based clustering. Tree species diversity of a tropical montane forest in the Taita Hills, Kenya, was mapped based on spectral variation of high spatial resolution IS data. Airborne IS data and species data from 31 field plots were collected in the study area. Species diversity measures were obtained from the IS data by clustering spectrally similar image segments representing tree crowns. In order to do this, the image was segmented to objects that represented tree crowns. Three measures of species diversity were calculated based on the field data and on the clustering results, and the relationships were statistically analyzed. According to the results, the approach succeeded well in revealing tree species diversity patterns. Especially, tree species richness was well predicted (RMSE = 3 species; r(2) = 0.50) directly based on the clustering results. The optimal number of clusters was found to be close to the estimated number of tree species in the forest. Minimum tree size was an important determinant of the relationships, because only part of the trees are visible to the airborne sensor in the multi-layered closed canopy forest. In general, the object-based approach proved to be a viable alternative to a pixel-based clustering. The approach takes advantage of the capability of IS to detect spectral differences among tree crowns, but without the need for spectral training data, which is expensive to collect. With further development, the approach could be applied also for estimating beta diversity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ayanlade, A				Ayanlade, Ayansina			Landuse change within Okomu and Gilli-Gilli Forest Reserves, south-western Nigeria: its climatic and societal implications	TROPICAL ECOLOGY												The study evaluated the climatic and societal implications of vegetation degradation in Okomu and Gilli-Gilli Forest Reserves (OGFRs) of Nigeria. Both remote sensing and non-remote sensing data and methodologies were used. Landsat data between 1984 and 2011 were used as quantitative data while social survey was carried out for qualitative data collection and assessment. Both remote sensing classification and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) methods were used in this study. The results show that deforestation resulting from farmland encroachment has increased in Okomu Forest Reserves (OFR) but was relatively low in Gilli-Gilli Forest Reserves (GFR). In 1984, about 17 % of the reserves were deforested, and this increased to 37 % in 2011 in OFR. These values reveal a massive deforestation. Forest disturbance within the GFR is much less than OFR possibly because high rate of illegal oil palm development in OFR. The result shows no significant impacts of vegetation degradation on local climate, but people in the communities around the reserves reported several climatic extreme events as a result of vegetation removal. However, the study could not reveal direct significant impact of vegetation degradation on local climate but there were rather indirect impacts from climate events. The results from social survey show that over 80 % of local people perceived high rate of heavy erosion and flooding mostly from year 2000 to 2011. It is obvious from the social survey that unrestrained felling of forest in the region has also rendered the soil vulnerable to erosion and flooding since forests tend to reduce the impact of erosion and floods. There is a need for proper enforcement of forest conservation laws in order to reduce the rate of deforestation, not only in OFR and OGR but also in all forest reserves in the country.																	0564-3295					MAY	2016	57	2					193	203										WOS:000370210700007

Spatial extent and conservation status of Banj oak (Quercus leucotrichophora A. Camus) forests in Uttarakhand, Western Himalaya	TROPICAL ECOLOGY												We assessed the conservation status of Quercus leucotrichophora (banj oak) forests and identified priority areas for its conservation in Uttarakhand state, India. The methods include mapping by using satellite remote sensing, and phytosociological analysis of dense, open and degraded banj oak forests in different elevational zones in the state. Mapping of banj oak forests was done using IRS P6 AWiFS satellite data in conjunction with altitude information and field knowledge. Canopy density information was generated based on Normalised Vegetation Difference Index (NDVI). Structure, composition and species diversity were quantified within 510 stratified random sample plots distributed in various elevation gradients. The study revealed that banj oak forests constitute 5.24 % (1284 km(2)) of total forest cover in the state (45.80 %). Of this, 775 km(2) area falls within reserve forests while 509 km(2) falls in village and private forests. Middle elevation range (1800 - 2200 m asl) represented maximum area (951.7 km(2)) under banj oak. Area under dense, open and degraded banj oak forests was estimated at 560.3, 510.62 and 213.68 km(2), respectively. The greatest banj oak tree density was found in dense forests (479 +/- 22.35 individual ha(-1)) between 1500 - 1800 m asl. and lowest in degraded banj oak forests (46 +/- 19.86 individual ha(-1)) above 2200 m asl. Mean sapling (585 51 individual ha(-1)) and seedling (368 +/- 37 individual ha(-1)) density across various forests showed that regeneration is adequate with respect to the mean tree density (337 +/- 13.6 individual ha(-1)) in western Himalaya. Most of the intact banj oak forests in the state occurred between 1800 - 2200 m elevations.																	0564-3295					MAY	2016	57	2					255	262										WOS:000370210700012

Addressing the information gap of coral reef resilience, we produce a map-based Remote Sensed Resilience Index (RSRI) from data describing the spatial distribution of stressors, and properties of reef habitats on the Farasan Banks, Saudi Arabia. We contrast the distribution of this index among fourteen reef types, categorized on a scale of maturity that includes juvenile (poorly aggraded), mature (partially aggraded), and senile (fully aggraded) reefs. Sites with high reef resilience can be found in most detached reef types; however they are most common in mature reefs. We aim to stimulate debate on the coupling that exists between geomorphology and conservation biology, and consider how such information can be used to inform management decisions.

M.; van Gils, Jan A.; van der Heide, Tjisse			Drought, Mutualism Breakdown, and Landscape-Scale Degradation of Seagrass Beds	CURRENT BIOLOGY												In many marine ecosystems, biodiversity critically depends on foundation species such as corals and seagrasses that engage in mutualistic interactions [1-3]. Concerns grow that environmental disruption of marine mutualisms exacerbates ecosystem degradation, with breakdown of the obligate coral mutualism ("coral bleaching") being an iconic example [2, 4, 5]. However, as these mutualisms are mostly facultative rather than obligate, it remains unclear whether mutualism breakdown is a common risk in marine ecosystems, and thus a potential accelerator of ecosystem degradation. Here, we provide evidence that. drought triggered landscape-scale seagrass degradation and show the consequent failure of a facultative mutualistic feedback between seagrass and sulfide-consuming lucinid bivalves that in turn appeared to exacerbate the observed collapse. Local climate and remote sensing analyses revealed seagrass collapse after a summer with intense low-tide drought stress. Potential analysis a novel approach to detect feedback-mediated state shifts-revealed two attractors (healthy and degraded states) during the collapse, suggesting that the drought disrupted internal feedbacks to cause abrupt, patch-wise degradation. Field measurements comparing degraded patches that were healthy before the collapse with patches that remained healthy demonstrated that bivalves declined dramatically in degrading patches with associated high sediment sulfide concentrations, confirming the breakdown of the mutualistic seagrass-lucinid feedback. Our findings indicate that drought triggered mutualism breakdown, resulting in toxic sulfide concentrations that aggravated seagrass degradation. We conclude that external disturbances can cause sudden breakdown of facultative marine mutualistic feedbacks. As this may amplify ecosystem degradation, we suggest including mutualisms in marine conservation and restoration approaches.

J	Previant, WJ; Nagel, LM				Previant, Wilfred J.; Nagel, Linda M.			Vernal Pool Inventory and Classification at Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, Michigan, USA	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Vernal pools occur in the glaciated forests of northeastern North America and provide critical breeding and foraging habitat for amphibian and mammal species. Protection for these ephemeral wetlands is not federally mandated, placing them at risk for habitat fragmentation and making them more vulnerable to impacts of climate change. Unlike the northeastern United States, limited information about vernal pools exists for the Great Lakes region, and there is a lack of information about techniques to identify and classify vernal pools using remote sensing and field surveys. At Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, Michigan, USA, our objectives were to locate vernal pools using true-color, spring leaf-off aerial photography at the 1:12,000 scale, classify vernal pools using modified geomorphological classification systems, and determine landscape associations with soil series and cover type GIS datasets. From the 214 water features identified and categorized via aerial photography, two (water with canopy, water without canopy) of the 12 categories accounted for 91.5% of the pools. The park's 51 vernal pools had a density of 0.19 km(-2) and an average surface pool area of 1078.2 m(2) (+/- 387.6). Using basin morphology and geomorphology, vernal pools were divided into the following five classes: classic, complex, kettle-kame, dune-swale, and minor ponds. Vernal pools were associated with three soil series that were characterized by slopes less than 5%, poorly to very poorly drained soils, and a clay content less than 10%. Nearly three-quarters of the vernal pools occurred in the hemlock-hardwood cover type. The conservation and protection of these discrete and small ephemeral wetlands should be considered within a landscape context, as subsets of vernal pools have specific geomorphology, soil series, and cover type associations.																	0885-8608	2162-4399				APR	2016	36	2					124	136		10.3375/043.036.0203								WOS:000377477000002

Sudhakar			Long term changes in forest cover and land use of Similipal Biosphere Reserve of India using satellite remote sensing data	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												The spatial changes in forest cover of Similipal biosphere reserve, Odisha, India over eight decades (1930-2012) has been quantified by using multi-temporal data from different sources. Over the period, the forest cover reduced by 970.8 km(2) (23.6% of the total forest), and most significantly during the period, 1930-1975. Human-induced activities like conversion of forest land for agriculture, construction of dams and mining activities have been identified as major drivers of deforestation. Spatial analysis indicates that 399 grids (1 grid = 1 x 1 km) have undergone large-scale changes in forest cover (>75 ha) during 1930-1975, while only 3 grids have shown >75 ha loss during 1975-1990. Annual net rate of deforestation was 0.58 during 1930-1975, which has been reduced substantially during 1975-1990 (0.04). Annual gross rate of deforestation in 2006-2012 is indeed low (0.01) as compared to the national and global average. This study highlights the impact and effectiveness of conservation practices in minimizing the rate of deforestation and protecting the Similipal Biosphere Reserve.																	0253-4126	0973-774X				APR	2016	125	3					559	569										WOS:000375930100008						
J	Platt, RV; Ogra, MV; Badola, R; Hussain, SA				Platt, Rutherford V.; Ogra, Monica V.; Badola, Ruchi; Hussain, Syed Ainul			Conservation-induced resettlement as a driver of land cover change in India: An object-based trend analysis	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Located in the foothills of the Indian Himalaya, Rajaji National Park was established to protect and enhance the habitat of the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) and tiger (Panthera tigris). In 2002 the Van Gujjars, indigenous forest pastoralists, were voluntarily resettled from the Chilla Range (an administrative unit of Rajaji National Park) to Gaindikhata, a nearby area where they were granted land for agriculture. In this study we used a variety of remote sensing approaches to identify changes in land cover associated with the resettlement. The methods comprise two main approaches. First, we used object-based image analysis (OBIA) to identify the pre-resettlement land cover classes of use areas (representing agricultural expansion and adjacent areas of grazing, and collection of fuelwood and fodder) and recovery areas (representing areas where settlements were removed, and the adjacent areas of resource use). Secondly, we used trend analysis to assess the gradual and abrupt changes in vegetation that took place in use and recovery areas. To conduct the trend analysis we used BFAST (Breaks For Additive Season and Trend), which separates seasonal variation from long-term trends, and identifies breaks that can be linked back to disturbances or land cover changes. We found that the OBIA classification yielded high average class accuracies, and we were able to make class distinctions that would have been difficult to make using a traditional pixel-based approach. Pre-resettlement, the recovery areas were classified as mixed forest and riparian vegetation. In contrast, the use areas were classified primarily as grass dominated, brush dominated, and plantation forest, and were located relatively far away from riparian areas. Following the resettlement, the trend analysis showed a sudden change in the seasonal variation of NDVI in areas converted to agriculture. Areas neighboring the new agricultural land experienced sudden decreases in NDVI, suggestive of disturbances, at a higher rate than the same land cover types elsewhere. At the same time, these neighboring areas experienced a gradual overall increase in NDVI which could be caused by an expansion of leafy invasive shrubs such as Lantana camara in areas heavily used for biomass collection. The recovery areas also experienced a gradual increase in NDVI as well as sudden breaks to this trend, but we lacked evidence to connect these changes to the resettlement. Our findings support the claim that the resettlement has shifted pressure from more ecologically valuable to less ecologically valuable land cover types, and suggest that to some degree resource use pressure has increased outside the park. The study employs a novel synthesis of OBIA and trend analysis that could be applied to land change studies more broadly. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
