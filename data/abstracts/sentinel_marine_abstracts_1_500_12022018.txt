Aquifer Discharge Drives Microbial Community Change in Karst Estuaries	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Karst estuaries are unique systems governed by freshwater inputs that flow directly to the sea through karst conduits and/or matrices. Because they are found at the interface between terrestrial and marine environments, they can act as sentinels to climate change and as indicators of aquifer health. The physical and geochemical gradients formed in karst estuaries are a direct result of the interactions between inland hydrological conditions and sea level. To examine the influence these gradients have on microbial communities in the water column and sediment of a karst estuary, we studied the spring-fed Double Keyhole Karst Estuary in west central Florida for a 2-year period. Four sites were monitored within this system starting at the Double Keyhole Spring Conduit extending 2 km west through the estuary toward the Gulf of Mexico. Water column and sediment samples were collected quarterly at all sites from September 2011 through September 2013. Archaeal, bacterial, and microbial eukaryote communities were analyzed using quantitative PCR and length-heterogeneity PCR. The biological communities were analyzed in the context of hydrological, physical, and geochemical parameters in order to determine which factor(s) governed the observed changes of microbial abundance and richness. The major finding of this study was that microbial community change in this karst estuary was primarily driven by the volume of aquifer discharge and associated physical gradients, and less by the geochemical fluctuations within the system.																	1559-2723	1559-2731				MAR	2018	41	2					430	443		10.1007/s12237-017-0281-7								WOS:000423581200008

They belong to the Technology Critical Elements (TCEs) for which use is forecast to increase, implying growing emissions into the environment in the following years. In particular, with the intensive use of platinum (Pt) in car catalytic converters, the anthropogenic geochemical cycle of this element has surpassed the natural cycle. Yet, environmental Pt levels are still in the sub picomolar range, making its analytical detection a challenge. Few studies cover the behavior of Pt in marine waters in terms of speciation, reactivity and possible transfer to the biota. In this study, oysters (Crassostrea gigas) from an unpolluted estuary were exposed to the stable isotope Pt-194 in seawater at a range of concentrations during 35 days. Seawater was renewed daily and spiked to three nominal Pt concentrations (50, 100, and 10,000 ng . L-1) for two replicate series. In addition, control conditions were monitored. Five oysters from each tank were dissected after 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 days of Pt exposure, and analyzed by ICP-MS. Accuracy of this analytical method applied to biological matrix was checked by an inter-method comparison with a voltammetrical technique. A concentration-dependent accumulation of Pt in oysters increasing with exposure time occurred. After 28 days, oyster Pt accumulation from low and intermediate exposure conditions reached a plateau. This was not the case of the highest exposure condition for which oyster tissues showed increasing concentrations until the last day of the experiment. A linear correlation exists between seawater concentrations and Pt content in oysters for low and intermediate exposure concentrations i.e. closer to environmental concentrations. By showing high Pt accumulation potential, oysters may serve as sentinels, ensuring biomonitoring of Pt concentrations in marine coastal waters. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we present the OpenSARShip, a dataset dedicated to Sentinel-1 ship interpretation. The OpenSARShip, providing 11 346 SAR ship chips integrated with automatic identification system messages, owes five essential properties: specificality, large scale, diversity, reliability, and public availability. These properties make sure that the OpenSARShip achieves its objectives. The first is to provide researchers a benchmark dataset to develop applicable and adaptive ship interpretation algorithms and push the performance ceilings of data analysis. The other is to provide a dataset for performing application-oriented quality assessment for Sentinel-1 imagery, which can boost their applications in a targeting way. The construction and the organization of the OpenSARShip are discussed, which show the inside of the dataset and ensure the essential properties. The elaborate geometric and scattering analyses, the benchmark for classification, and the imagery applicability assessment by using the OpenSARShip all demonstrate the applicability and potential of the dataset.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				JAN	2018	11	1					195	208		10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2755672								WOS:000422950700017

Concentrations notably higher than those reported in literature for other Mediterranean Muricidae have been recorded. The results also indicated a different impact in different sites, according to distribution and typology of human activities, whilst recorded seasonal variations might relate with rapid metabolic response. Such preliminary results suggest S. haemastoma may be considered a promising sentinel species for inorganic contamination in marine environment, especially in terms of short-medium-term exposure.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JAN	2018	190	1							7	10.1007/s10661-017-6380-x								WOS:000422680800014

Species dominating the upper trophic level are vulnerable to these effects due to bioaccumulation. In Bass Strait, the Australian fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) is an important top order predator and sentinel species for ecosystem health. An alopecia syndrome is seen at high prevalence in juvenile, female Australian fur seals at Lady Julia Percy Island, Victoria, Australia. Previous investigations suggest causality could be due to an endocrine-like toxicant. The alopecia syndrome has significance for thermoregulation and is a likely risk factor for mortality. Fur collected from case (alopecic) and control (unaffected) seals sampled at Lady Julia Percy Island were analysed for POPs. To investigate the utility of fur for monitoring POPs concentrations in pinnipeds, a comparison of POPs concentrations in the fur and blubber of Australian fur seals stranded along the Victorian coast was undertaken. The concentration of selected POPs including polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and perfluorooctane sulfonate/perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOS/PFOA) were determined in fur using either High Resolution Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry or Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. Results indicate detectable, and in some individuals, elevated levels of dl-PCBs, PCDD/Fs and PBDEs in juvenile fur seals sampled on Lady Julia Percy Island, with significantly higher levels of dl-PCBs in case compared to control seals. Elevated levels of dl-PCBs and PCDD/Fs were found in blubber samples collected from stranded fur seals with significant correlations between blubber and fur concentrations seen, particularly for dl-PCBs. This study discusses the significance of POPs concentrations in relation to the causality of an alopecia syndrome in the Australian fur seal, and assesses the utility of fur as a non-invasive biomarker to monitor POPs exposure in this sentinel species.

J	Di Beneditto, APM; Siciliano, S				Madeira Di Beneditto, Ana Paula; Siciliano, Salvatore			Marine debris boost in juvenile Magellanic penguins stranded in south-eastern Brazil in less than a decade: Insights into feeding habits and habitat use	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												The Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) is a marine sentinel for the southern Atlantic Ocean that is a proxy of environmental quality. The presence of marine debris (macro-debris) in the stomach contents of emaciated juvenile penguins stranded from 21 degrees S to 23 degrees S was compared at different times (2000 and 2008), and the debris ingestion pathway was determined. The frequency of marine debris in the stomachs doubled in less than a decade, and flexible plastics remained the main ingested item over time (68-70%). The pelagic octopus, Argonauta nodosa, which inhabits the sea surface, was the most important prey species recovered in the stomach contents. The poor physical condition of the penguins that reach the northern migration limit (study area) reduces the diving capacity of the animals and increases their vulnerability to debris ingestion. Considering their preferred prey and physical condition, we conclude that the penguins likely ingested the marine debris in surface waters.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				DEC 15	2017	125	1-2					330	333		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.09.044								WOS:000418727000048	28958439

Evaluation of the potential genotoxic activity in seawater of Asin Bay, Gulf of Gulluk, Mugla, Aegean coast of Turkey	GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL												This research examined the genotoxic activity in the seawater of Asin Bay (Gulf of Gulluk) located in Mugla, Turkey, Aegean coast of Turkey. Genotoxic activities of 66 raw samples, taken from 17 different stations in the spring and summer seasons of the year 2013, were determined by using in vitro mutagenicity assay SOS chromotest with Escherichia coli PQ37 strain bacteria activities. In the applied procedure, beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) activity, alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity, and different solvent controls were taken into account to generate reliable results in terms of the corrected induction factors (CIF) used as a quantitative measure of genotoxic activity level. The SOS chromotest procedure was simply and rapidly performed as an early assay to explore for whether a potential genotoxic activity was presence in the in the seawater of Asin Bay (Gulf of Gulluk) with no special measuring devices except a microplate reader. The implemented assay was successfully completed within only 24 h including the revival of the bacteria. The results showed that 11 samples (% 17 of total) were close to the threshold value of 1.5. The findings of this study clearly revealed that the seawater of Asin Bay (Gulf of Gulluk) had no potential genotoxic risks in terms of the organisms in marine ecosystem, since all of the calculated CIF values were determined to be below the threshold level. It was concluded that according to the SOS chromotest results, the levels of potential genotoxic agents were found to be under the limits for the offshore fishery.																	1790-7632					DEC	2017	19	4					658	665										WOS:000422866200011						
J	Kalia, AC; Frei, M; Lege, T				Kalia, A. C.; Frei, M.; Lege, T.			A Copernicus downstream-service for the nationwide monitoring of surface displacements in Germany	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Advanced interferometric SAR processing techniques (Persistent Scatterer Interferometry, Small Baseline Subset) are able to detect and monitor various surface displacements caused by e.g. gravitative mass movement, subrosion, groundwater extraction, fluid injection, natural gas extraction. These processes can e.g. cause damage to buildings and infrastructure, affect ecosystems and agriculture or affect the economic use of the geological underground by influencing the hydrogeological setting. Despite the maturity and operational readiness of the PSI technology it is rarely used in operational workflows of the German user community (e.g. from responsible authorities). In order to support the operational use of this technique a "Ground Motion Service Germany" has been designed by the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) in collaboration with the user community, land surveying agencies, SME and research institutions. A major outcome of this collaboration is the user request regarding a PSI-WAP (Persistent Scatterer Interferometry Wide-Area-Product) dataset of the entire nation (approx. 360,000 km(2)) based on Sentinel-1 data. For this reason the PSI mapping coverage is increased by mosaicking PSI data products from adjacent SAR data stacks. Several case studies has been performed to demonstrate the design of the service. Within this paper one case study regarding the PSI-WAP technique and the calibration/validation scheme is presented. The pilot study is focusing on the built up of an officially approved PSI-WAP dataset. The study area covers an area of >30,000 km(2) and is located in the Northwest German Basin. This is the first time a PSI-WAP analysis is performed in this area. Several natural processes (e.g. compaction of marine sediments, peat growth/shrinkage) and anthropogenic activities (e.g. natural gas extraction, rock salt mining) are causing surface displacements in the study area. The PSI-WAP analysis is based on six adjacent ERS-1/-2 data stacks covering the timespan from 1992 until 2001. Each data stack consists of 49 to 73 acquisitions. A comparison of the PSI results with thematic data (e.g. cumulated volume of extracted natural gas and location of natural gas fields) indicates that a part of the detected land subsidence is caused by natural gas extraction. To summarize, this paper shows i) the design of the "Ground Motion Service Germany" and ii) a pilot study to exemplarily demonstrate a PSI-WAP, the calibration/validation scheme and value-added-products.

Exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers and perfluoroalkyl substances in a remote population of Alaska Natives	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Background: Many Alaska Native communities rely on a traditional marine diet that contains persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The indoor environment is also a source of POPs. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and perfluoroallcyl substances (PFASs) are present both in the traditional diet and the home indoor environment. Objectives: We assessed exposure to PBDEs and PFASs among residents of two remote Alaska Native villages on St. Lawrence Island. Ninespine stickleback (Pungitious pungitious) and Alaska blackfish (Dallia pectoralis) were used to detect accumulation of these compounds in the local environment. Methods: Concentrations of PBDEs and PFASs were measured in dust collected from 49 households on St. Lawrence Island, as well as in blood serum from 85 island residents. Resident ninespine stickleback and Alaska blackfish were used as sentinels to detect accumulation of PBDEs and PFASs in the food web. Results: Serum concentrations of perfiuorononanoic acid (PFNA) and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA) were elevated, despite low concentrations of PFASs in dust samples. Concentrations of PBDEs in dust and serum were similar to those from the contiguous United States. Statistical associations between dust and serum concentrations are apparent for a small number of PBDEs, suggesting a possible route of exposure. Predominant compounds were similar between human sera and stickleback; however, blackfish accumulated PFASs not found in either stickleback or human sera. Conclusion: Household dust contributes to PBDE exposure, but not PFAS exposure. Elevated concentrations of long chain PFASs in serum are likely due to exposure from traditional foods. The presence of both PFASs and PBDEs in sentinel fish species suggests atmospheric deposition and bioaccumulation, as well as local environmental contamination.

In this study, the full-length cDNA of cypla1 was cloned from Sebastiscus marmoratus (SM-CYP1A1). Then the dose-response and time-course induction of hepatic CYP1A1 mRNA by the crude oil water-soluble fraction (WSF) were determined. Subsequently, SM-CYP1A1 mRNA was applied to investigate the biological effect of petroleum hydrocarbon pollution in Quanzhou Bay, China. The transcription levels of hepatic CYP1A1 were significantly elevated in fish caged in the polluted sites for 2 weeks compared with those of the reference site, which were correlated with the concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbon and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) in the surface seawaters. The results suggest that S. marmoratus is a potential sentinel organism to monitor marine pollutants and the hepatic CYP1A1 mRNA can serve as a sensitive biomarker to organic xenobiotics in aquatic environments.

Database documentation of marine mammal stranding and mortality: current status review and future prospects	DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS												Databases are systematic tools to archive and manage information related to marine mammal stranding and mortality events. Stranding response networks, governmental authorities and non-governmental organizations have established regional or national stranding networks and have developed unique standard stranding response and necropsy protocols to document and track stranded marine mammal demographics, signalment and health data. The objectives of this study were to (1) describe and review the current status of marine mammal stranding and mortality databases worldwide, including the year established, types of database and their goals; and (2) summarize the geographic range included in the database, the number of cases recorded, accessibility, filter and display methods. Peer-reviewed literature was searched, focussing on published databases of live and dead marine mammal strandings and mortality and information released from stranding response organizations (i.e. online updates, journal articles and annual stranding reports). Databases that were not published in the primary literature or recognized by government agencies were excluded. Based on these criteria, 10 marine mammal stranding and mortality databases were identified, and strandings and necropsy data found in these databases were evaluated. We discuss the results, limitations and future prospects of database development. Future prospects include the development and application of virtopsy, a new necropsy investigation tool. A centralized web-accessed database of all available postmortem multimedia from stranded marine mammals may eventually support marine conservation and policy decisions, which will allow the use of marine animals as sentinels of ecosystem health, working towards a 'One Ocean-One Health' ideal.																	0177-5103	1616-1580				NOV 21	2017	126	3					247	256		10.3354/dao03179								WOS:000415794500007	29160222

Exploring the presence of pollutants at sea: Monitoring heavy metals and pesticides in loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) from the western Mediterranean	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Marine turtles are considered good sentinel species for environmental assessment because of their long lifespan, feeding ecology, habitat use and migratory nature. In the present study, we assessed presence of cadmium, lead and mercury, together with organic pollutants, both in fat and muscle tissue of 25 stranded loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) stranded along the Valencian Community coast (East Spain) (43.7 +/- 13.5 cm). Mean concentrations of Cd, Pb and Hg were 0.04 mu g/g w.w., 0.09 mu g/g w.w. and 0.03 mu g/g w.w. in fat and 0.05 mu g/g, 0.08 mu g/g and 0.04 mu g/g in muscle, respectively. These measures indicate a relatively low mean heavy metal concentration, which may be explained by juvenile size and developmental stage of the turtles analysed. A preliminary non targeted analysis (using time-of-flight (TOF) technology), made for the first time in marine turtles, allowed to detect 39 different pesticides, most of them previously undetected in this species. Most of the organic substances detected are used in agricultural activities, and the use of 15 of them (38.5%) is not approved in the European Union. Our sample did not show any trend on pollutant contents in relation to turtle size or stranding location, probably because of the high diversity of pollutants found. However, the potential for a positive latitudinal gradient should be explored in future studies due to riverine inputs and high agricultural and industrial activities in the area. Despite the high diversity of pollutants found here, comparative studies of pollutants in other matrices at sea are needed to ascertain whether the loggerhead turtle is a good sentinel of chemical pollution in the western Mediterranean.

This is especially true for the Russian Arctic where recently increased optical and SAR satellite imagery (Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel 1/2) and digital elevation models (TanDEM-X, ArcticDEM) are becoming available. These datasets offer new possibilities to create high-quality glacier inventories. Here, we present a new glacier inventory derived from a fusion of multi-source satellite data for Novaya Zemlya in the Russian Arctic. We mainly used Landsat 8 OLI data to automatically map glaciers with the band ratio method. Missing debris-covered glacier parts and misclassified lakes were manually corrected. Whereas perennial snow fields were a major obstacle in glacier identification, seasonal snow was identified and removed using Landsat 5 TM scenes from the year 1998. Drainage basins were derived semi-automatically using the ArcticDEM (gap-filled by the ASTER GDEM V2) and manually corrected using fringes from ALOS PALSAR. The new glacier inventory gives a glacierized area of 22,379 +/- 246.2 km(2) with 1474 glacier entities >0.05 km(2). The region is dominated by large glaciers, as 909 glaciers <0.5 km(2) (62% by number) cover only 156 +/- 1.7 km(2) or 0.7% of the area, whereas 49 glaciers >100 km(2) (3.3% by number) cover 18,724 +/- 205.9 km(2) or 84%. In total, 41 glaciers are marine terminating covering an area of 16,063.7 +/- 118.8 km(2). The mean elevation is 596 m for all glaciers in the study region (528 m in the northern part, 641 in the southern part). South-east (north-west) facing glaciers cover >35% (20%) of the area. For the smaller glaciers in the southern part we calculated an area loss of 3.4% (-52.5 +/- 3.1 km(2)) from 2001 to 2016.

Implications of biological factors on accumulation of persistent organic pollutants in Antarctic notothenioid fish	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												In the present study, the possible associations between selected persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and biological factors were assessed in different tissues of two Antarctic notothenioid fish: Notothenia rossii (NOR) and Trematomus newnesi (TRN) collected at Potter Cove, King George Island/Isla 25 de Mayo, South Shetland Islands. Specifically, association patterns between biological factors (body size, lipid content, body condition) and POP concentrations (polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and metabolites, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), chlordanes (CHLs) and methoxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (MeO-PBDEs)), were explored by using two approaches: multivariate analyses (principal component analysis: PCA) and intraspecific correlations. Integrating results suggest that biological factors such as size, KI and tissue type seemed to be associated to selective accumulation of POPs for immature specimens of N. rossii, and KI and tissue type for mature specimens of T. newnesi. Each particular factor should be considered when choosing N. rossii or T. newnesi as sentinels for POPs pollution in Antarctic marine environments. Further, both nototheniids showed a selective accumulation pattern in their gonads of penta-chlorinated biphenyls (penta-CBs; 55.5 and 29 ng g(-1) lw for N. rossii and T. newnesi, respectively) and organochlorine pesticides such as DDTs (199 and 13.3 ng g(-1) lw, for N. rossii and T. newnesi respectively), and of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in gills (97.2 and 22.1 for ng g(-1) lw, for N. rossii and T. newnesi, respectively), highlighting the importance of these tissues in monitoring studies of pollution in fish. The current study expands the knowledge concerning the biological factors to be investigated when specific pollutants are monitored and supports the importance of tissue type for the selective accumulation of POPs in Antarctic fish. Additionally, a contribution to the scarce data on concentration of MeO-PBDEs in Antarctic marine organisms, particularly in the highly diverse perciform suborder Notothenioidei is provided.																	0147-6513	1090-2414				NOV	2017	145						630	639		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.08.009								WOS:000411917100078	28806565

This tissue represents the main route for mercury (Hg) elimination in seabirds and contains predominantly methylmercury (MeHg). In this work, we developed a robust analytical technique for precise and accurate simultaneous quantification of MeHg, inorganic Hg (iHg) and consequently total Hg (THg), in feathers by gas-chromatography (GC)-ICPMS analyses using species-specific isotope dilution technique. An optimisation of the extraction method was carried out by testing different extraction systems, reagents and spiking procedures using an internal reference feather sample. The procedure was validated for MeHg and THg concentrations with a human hair certified reference material. Microwave nitric acid extraction with spike addition before the extraction provided the best recovery and was chosen as the most appropriate species simultaneous extraction method (SSE). An additional assessment was performed by comparison of our developed extraction method and a MeHg specific extraction technique (MSE) classically used for Hg speciation studies on feathers. The developed method Was applied to feather samples from a large number of seabirds from the Southern Ocean (penguins, albatrosses, petrels and skuas) to investigate the variability of Hg speciation across a large range of Hg exposure conditions and concentrations. In all cases, MeHg accounted for > 90% of THg, thus verifying the predominance of organic Hg over iHg in feathers.

Transcriptomic response of the Antarctic pteropod Limacina helicina antarctica to ocean acidification	BMC GENOMICS												Background: Ocean acidification (OA), a change in ocean chemistry due to the absorption of atmospheric CO2 into surface oceans, challenges biogenic calcification in many marine organisms. Ocean acidification is expected to rapidly progress in polar seas, with regions of the Southern Ocean expected to experience severe OA within decades. Biologically, the consequences of OA challenge calcification processes and impose an energetic cost. Results: In order to better characterize the response of a polar calcifier to conditions of OA, we assessed differential gene expression in the Antarctic pteropod, Limacina helicina antarctica. Experimental levels of pCO(2) were chosen to create both contemporary pH conditions, and to mimic future pH expected in OA scenarios. Significant changes in the transcriptome were observed when juvenile L.h. antarctica were acclimated for 21 days to low-pH (7.71), mid-pH (7.9) or high-pH (8.13) conditions. Differential gene expression analysis of individuals maintained in the low-pH treatment identified down-regulation of genes involved in cytoskeletal structure, lipid transport, and metabolism. High pH exposure led to increased expression and enrichment for genes involved in shell formation, calcium ion binding, and DNA binding. Significant differential gene expression was observed in four major cellular and physiological processes: shell formation, the cellular stress response, metabolism, and neural function. Across these functional groups, exposure to conditions that mimic ocean acidification led to rapid suppression of gene expression. Conclusions: Results of this study demonstrated that the transcriptome of the juvenile pteropod, L.h. antarctica, was dynamic and changed in response to different levels of pCO(2). In a global change context, exposure of L.h. antarctica to the low pH, high pCO(2) OA conditions resulted in a suppression of transcripts for genes involved in key physiological processes: calcification, metabolism, and the cellular stress response. The transcriptomic response at both acute and longer-term acclimation time frames indicated that contemporary L.h. antarctica may not have the physiological plasticity necessary for adaptation to OA conditions expected in future decades. Lastly, the differential gene expression results further support the role of shelled pteropods such as L.h. antarctica as sentinel organisms for the impacts of ocean acidification.																	1471-2164					OCT 23	2017	18								812	10.1186/s12864-017-4161-0								WOS:000413467900006	29061120

Use of biomarkers to assess the pollution effects assumes that the effects of pollutants on the biomarkers exceed the natural background variability; yet this assumption has rarely been tested. We exposed mussels at different reproductive stages and nutritive states to two concentrations of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (fluoranthene, 3 and 60 mu g L-1) for three weeks. Expression levels of the molecular biomarkers related to the detoxification and general stress response [cytochrome P450 oxidase (CYP450), glutathione S-transferases (GST-alpha; GST-S1; GST-S2), the multixenobiotic resistance protein P-glycoprotein (PgP), metallothioneins (MT10 and MT20), heat shock proteins (HSP22, HSP70-2; HSP70-3; HSP70-4), as well as mRNA expression of two reproduction-related genes, vitellogenin (Vitel) and vitelline coat lysin M7 (VCLM7)] were measured. The mussels' nutrition and reproductive state affected the baseline mRNA levels of molecular biomarkers and modulated the transcriptional responses of biomarker genes to the pollutant exposure. Thus, mussel physiological state could act as a confounding factor in the evaluation of the response of pollution through molecular biomarkers. The biomarker baseline levels must be determined across a range of physiological states to enable the use of biomarkers in monitoring programs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Gray whale distribution relative to benthic invertebrate biomass and abundance: Northeastern Chukchi Sea 2009-2012	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The shallow continental shelf waters of the Bering and Chukchi seas are the northernmost foraging grounds of North Pacific gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus). Benthic amphipods are considered the primary prey of gray whales in these waters, although no comprehensive quantitative analysis has been performed to support this assumption. Gray whale relative abundance, distribution, and behavior in the northeastern Chukchi Sea (69 degrees-72 degrees N, 155 degrees-169 degrees W) were documented during aerial surveys in June-October 2009-2012. Concurrently, vessel based benthic infaunal sampling was conducted in the area in July-August 2009-10, September 2011, and August 2012. Gray whales were seen in the study area each month that surveys were conducted, with the majority of whales feeding. Statistical analyses confirm that the highest densities of feeding gray whales were associated with high benthic amphipod abundance, primarily within 70 km of shore from Point Barrow to Icy Cape, in water < 50 m deep. Conversely, gray whales were not seen in 40-km x 40-km cells containing benthic sampling stations with 85 m(-2) or fewer amphipods. Continuing broad-scale aerial surveys in the Chlikchi Sea and prey sampling near feeding gray whales will be an important means to monitor and document ongoing and predicted ecosystem changes.																	0967-0645	1879-0100				OCT	2017	144				SI		156	174		10.1016/j.dsr2.2016.12.007								WOS:000413800300013

De novo transcriptome assembly and RNA-Seq expression analysis in blood from beluga Whales of Bristol Bay, AK	MARINE GENOMICS												Assessing the health of marine mammal sentinel species is crucial to understanding the impacts of environmental perturbations on marine ecosystems and human health. In Arctic regions, beluga whales, Deiphinapterus leucas, are upper level predators that may serve as a sentinel species, potentially forecasting impacts on human health. While gene expression profiling from blood transcriptomes has widely been used to assess health status and environmental exposures in human and veterinary medicine, its use in wildlife has been limited due to the lack of available genomes and baseline data. To this end we constructed the first beluga whale blood transcriptome de novo from samples collected during annual health assessments of the healthy Bristol Bay, AK stock during 2012-2014 to establish baseline information on the content and variation of the beluga whale blood transcriptome. The Trinity transcriptome assembly from beluga was comprised of 91,325 transcripts that represented a wide array of cellular functions and processes and was extremely similar in content to the blood transcriptome of another cetacean, the bottlenose dolphin. Expression of hemoglobin transcripts was much lower in beluga (25.6% of TPM, transcripts per million) than has been observed in many other mammals. A T12A amino acid substitution in the HBB sequence of beluga whales, but not bottlenose dolphins, was identified and may play a role in low temperature adaptation. The beluga blood transcriptome was extremely stable between sex and year, with no apparent clustering of samples by principle components analysis and < 4% of genes differentially expressed (EBseq, FDR < 0.05). While the impacts of season, sexual maturity, disease, and geography on the beluga blood transcriptome must be established, the presence of transcripts involved in stress, detoxification, and immune functions indicate that blood gene expression analyses may provide information on health status and exposure. This study provides a wealth of transcriptomic data on beluga whales and provides a sizeable pool of preliminary data for comparison with other studies in beluga whale.																	1874-7787	1876-7478				OCT	2017	35						77	92		10.1016/j.margen.2017.08.001								WOS:000412957700013	28802692

Monitoring nitrogen pollution in seasonally-pulsed coastal waters requires judicious choice of indicator species	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												We compared the sensitivity of algae and hermit crabs to seasonal shifts in the dominance of continuous sewage discharge vs. pulsed inputs of terrestrial material to a subtropical bay. During periods of low rainfall, when sewage was proportionately more important than diffuse loads from adjacent catchments, algae and crabs provided comparable information on the spatial distribution of N pollution. Conversely, during the wet season, when diffuse nitrogen loads from the catchment were of greater importance, the isotope signal of algae de coupled from that of crabs, indexing a greater magnitude of change and a more pronounced spatial gradient. Overall, algae better indexed the short-term impacts of anthropogenic nitrogen pollution whereas the signals provided by crabs provided a longer-term integrated measure of N inputs. Our results demonstrate the value of including multiple taxa with variable traits when monitoring the spatial and temporal extent of nitrogen inputs to coastal waters.

An ecotoxicological approach to evaluate the effects of tourism impacts in the Marine Protected Area of La Maddalena (Sardinia, Italy)	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												In the Marine Protected Area of La Maddalena Archipelago, environmental protection rules and safeguard measures for nautical activities have helped in reducing anthropogenic pressure; however, tourism related activities remain particularly significant in summer. With the aim of evaluating their impacts, the biomarker approach using transplanted Mytilus galloprovincialis as sentinel organisms coupled with POCIS deployment was applied. Mussels, translocated to four marine areas differently impacted by tourism activities, were sampled before, during and after the tourist season. Moreover, endocrine disruptors in passive samplers POCIS and the cellular toxicity of whole POCIS extracts on mussel haemocytes were evaluated to integrate ecotoxicological information. Lysosomal biomarkers, condition index and mortality rate, as well as metals in tissues suggested an alteration of the health status of mussels transplanted to the most impacted sites. The cellular toxicity of POCIS extracts was pointed out, notwithstanding the concentrations of the examined compounds were always below the detection limits.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				SEP 15	2017	122	1-2					306	315		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.06.062								WOS:000408076900045	28666593

J	Lahvis, GP				Lahvis, Garet Paul			What California sea lions exposed to domoic acid might teach us about autism: lessons for predictive and preventive medicine	EPMA JOURNAL												Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) shares many biological and behavioral similarities with the deleterious effects of domoic acid (DA) exposure. DA is produced by marine algae and most commonly by species of Pseudo-nitzschia. Humans and marine mammals can be exposed to DA when they consume whole fish or shellfish. The mammalian fetus is highly sensitive to the deleterious effects of DA exposure. Both ASD and exposures to toxic levels of DA feature repetitive behaviors, challenges with social interaction, and seizures. They can also share a commonality in brain anatomy and function, particularly the balance between excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms. The current article is relevant to predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine for three reasons. First, shellfish consumption may be a risk factor for ASD and the regulatory limit for DA should be adjusted to prevent this possibility. Human contributions to increased algal production of DA in coastal waters should be identified and reduced. Second, evaluations of sentinel species wild and free-roaming in the environment, though typically outside the purview of biomedical research, should be much more fully employed to gain insights to risk factors for human disease. To better identify and prevent disease, biomedical researchers should study wild populations. Third, studies of DA exposure highlight the possibility that glutamate additives to processed foods may also have deleterious impacts on human brain development and behavior.																	1878-5085					SEP	2017	8	3					229	235		10.1007/s13167-017-0118-2								WOS:000411395600004	29021833

This spatial resolution should be at least decametric. Aquatic color data processing associated with these environments requires specific atmospheric corrections (AC) suitable for the spectral characteristics of high spatial resolution sensors (HRS) as well as the high range of atmospheric and marine optical properties. The objective of the present study is to develop and demonstrate the potential of a ground-based AC approach adaptable to any HRS for regional monitoring and security of littoral systems. The in Situ-based Atmospheric CORrection (SACOR) algorithm is based on simulations provided by a Successive Order of Scattering code (SOS), which is constrained by a simple regional aerosol particle model (RAM). This RAM is defined from the mixture of a standard tropospheric and maritime aerosol type. The RAM is derived from the following two processes. The first process involved the analysis of a 6-year data set composed of aerosol optical and microphysical properties acquired through the ground-based PHOTONS/AERONET network located at Arcachon (France). The second process was related to aerosol climatology using the NOAA hybrid single-particle Lagrangian integrated trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. Results show that aerosols have a bimodal particle size distribution regardless of the season and are mainly represented by a mixed coastal continental type. Furthermore, the results indicate that aerosols originate from both the Atlantic Ocean (53.6%) and Continental Europe (46.4%). Based on these results, absorbing biomass burning, urban-industrial and desert dust particles have not been considered although they represent on average 19% of the occurrences. This represents the main current limitation of the RAM. An assessment of the performances of SACOR is then performed by inter-comparing the water-leaving reflectance (rho(w)) retrievals with three different AC methods (ACOLITE, MACCS and 6SV using three different standard aerosol types) using match-ups (N = 8) composed of Landsat-8/Operational Land Imager (OLI) scenes and field radiometric measurements. Results indicate consistency with the SWIR-based ACOLITE method, which shows the best performance, except in the green channel where SACOR matches well with the in-situ data (relative error of 7%). In conclusion, the study demonstrates the high potential of the SACOR approach for the retrieval of rho(w). In the future, the method could be improved by using an adaptive aerosol model, which may select the most relevant local aerosol model following the origin of the atmospheric air mass, and could be applied to the latest HRS (Sentinel-2/MSI, SPOT6-7, Pleiades 1A-1B).

J	Kang, M; Ji, KF; Leng, XG; Lin, Z				Kang, Miao; Ji, Kefeng; Leng, Xiangguang; Lin, Zhao			Contextual Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network with Multilayer Fusion for SAR Ship Detection	REMOTE SENSING												Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) ship detection has been playing an increasingly essential role in marine monitoring in recent years. The lack of detailed information about ships in wide swath SAR imagery poses difficulty for traditional methods in exploring effective features for ship discrimination. Being capable of feature representation, deep neural networks have achieved dramatic progress in object detection recently. However, most of them suffer from the missing detection of small-sized targets, which means that few of them are able to be employed directly in SAR ship detection tasks. This paper discloses an elaborately designed deep hierarchical network, namely a contextual region-based convolutional neural network with multilayer fusion, for SAR ship detection, which is composed of a region proposal network (RPN) with high network resolution and an object detection network with contextual features. Instead of using low-resolution feature maps from a single layer for proposal generation in a RPN, the proposed method employs an intermediate layer combined with a downscaled shallow layer and an up-sampled deep layer to produce region proposals. In the object detection network, the region proposals are projected onto multiple layers with region of interest (ROI) pooling to extract the corresponding ROI features and contextual features around the ROI. After normalization and rescaling, they are subsequently concatenated into an integrated feature vector for final outputs. The proposed framework fuses the deep semantic and shallow high-resolution features, improving the detection performance for small-sized ships. The additional contextual features provide complementary information for classification and help to rule out false alarms. Experiments based on the Sentinel-1 dataset, which contains twenty-seven SAR images with 7986 labeled ships, verify that the proposed method achieves an excellent performance in SAR ship detection.																	2072-4292					AUG	2017	9	8							860	10.3390/rs9080860								WOS:000408605600098

Due to insufficient endogenous photoacoustic (PA) contrast, the development of exogenous agents is critical in targeting cancerous tumors. The current study demonstrates the feasibility of marine-oriented material, astaxanthin, as a biocompatible PA contrast agent. Both silicon tubing phantoms and ex vivo bladder tissues are tested at various concentrations (up to 5 mg/ml) of astaxanthin to quantitatively explore variations in PA responses. A Q-switched Nd : YAG laser (lambda = 532 nm) in conjunction with a 5 MHz ultrasound transducer is employed to generate and acquire PA signals from the samples. The phantom results presented that the PA signal amplitudes increase linearly with the astaxanthin concentrations (threshold detection = 0.31 mg/ml). The tissue injected with astaxanthin yields up to 16-fold higher PA signals, compared with that with saline. Due to distribution of the injected astaxanthin, PAI can image the margin of astaxanthin boles as well as quantify their volume in 3D reconstruction. Further investigations on selective tumor targeting are required to validate astaxanthin as a potential biocompatible contrast agent for PAI-assisted bladder cancer detection.

Polychlorinated Biphenyl-Related Alterations of the Expression of Essential Genes in Harbour Seals (Phoca vitulina) from Coastal Sites in Canada and the United States	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												As long-lived marine mammals found throughout the temperate coastal waters of the North Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) have become an invaluable sentinel of food-web contamination. Their relatively high trophic position predisposes harbour seals to the accumulation of harmful levels of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). We obtained skin/blubber biopsy samples from live-captured young harbour seals from various sites in the northeastern Pacific (British Columbia, Canada, and Washington State, USA) as well as the northwestern Atlantic (Newfoundland and Quebec, Canada). We developed harbour seal-specific primers to investigate the potential impact of POP exposure on the expression of eight important genes. We found correlations between the blubber mRNA levels of three of our eight target genes and the dominant persistent organic pollutant in seals [polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)] including estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1: r(2) = 0.12, p = 0.038), thyroid hormone receptor alpha (Thra: r(2) = 0.16; p = 0.028), and glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1: r(2) = 0.12; p = 0.049). Age, sex, weight, and length were not confounding factors on the expression of genes. Although the population-level consequences are unclear, our results suggest that PCBs are associated with alterations of the expression of genes responsible for aspects of metabolism, growth and development, and immune function. Collectively, these results provide additional support for the use of harbour seals as indicators of coastal food-web contamination.																	0090-4341	1432-0703				AUG	2017	73	2			SI		310	321		10.1007/s00244-016-0362-9								WOS:000406952300014	28528409

Their ingestion has been documented in several species worldwide, but the impact of specific anthropogenic activities remains largely unexplored. In this study, MPs were characterized in different benthic fish sampled after 2.5 years of huge engineering operations for the parbuckling project on the Costa Concordia wreck at Giglio Island. Fish collected in proximity of the wreck showed a high ingestion of microplastics compared to both fish from a control area and values reported worldwide. Also the elevated percentage of nylon, polypropylene lines and the presence of polystyrene are quite unusual for marine organisms sampled in natural field conditions, thus supporting the possible relationship of ingested microplastics with maritime operations during wreck removal. On the other hand, the use of transplanted mussels revealed a lower frequency of ingested MPs, and did not discriminate differences between the wreck and the control area. Some variations were observed in terms of typology and size of particles between surface and bottom-caged mussels highlighting the influence of a different distribution of MPs along the water column. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that MPs pollution in the area of Costa Concordia was more evident on benthonic environment than on seawater column, providing novel insights on the possibility of using appropriate sentinel organisms for monitoring specific anthropogenic sources of MPs pollution in the marine environment.

Health and Environmental Risk Assessment Project for bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus from the southeastern USA. II. Environmental aspects	DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS												Bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus are the most common apex predators found in coastal and estuarine ecosystems along the southeastern coast of the USA, where these animals are exposed to multiple chemical pollutants and microbial agents. In this review, we summarize the results of investigations of environmental exposures evaluated in 360 free-ranging dolphins between 2003 and 2015. Bottlenose dolphins inhabiting the Indian River Lagoon, Florida (IRL, n = 246), and coastal waters of Charleston, South Carolina (CHS, n = 114), were captured, given comprehensive health examinations, and released as part of a multidisciplinary and multi-institutional study of individual and population health. High concentrations of persistent organic pollutants including legacy contaminants (DDT and other pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyl compounds) as well as 'emerging' contaminants (polybrominated diphenyl ethers, perfluorinated compounds) were detected in dolphins from CHS, with lower concentrations in the IRL. Conversely, the concentrations of mercury in the blood and skin of IRL dolphins were among the highest reported worldwide and approximately 5 times as high as those found in CHS dolphins. A high prevalence of resistance to antibiotics commonly used in humans and animals was detected in bacteria isolated from fecal, blowhole, and/or gastric samples at both sites, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) at CHS. Collectively, these studies illustrate the importance of long-term surveillance of estuarine populations of bottlenose dolphins and reaffirm their important role as sentinels for marine ecosystems and public health.																	0177-5103	1616-1580				JUL 24	2017	125	2					155	166		10.3354/dao03143								WOS:000407439500007	28737160

We examined 27 digestive tracts and identified 35 prey items. The sampled turtles were all juveniles (CCL = 53.7 +/- 1.2 cm, range 40.5-67.0 cm). The prey items were grouped into six categories: algae, cnidarians, mollusks, arthropods, chordates and garbage/anthropogenic debris. The items with the highest Frequency of Occurrence values (% FO) were: Caulerpa filiformis (77.8%), Loligo gahi (eggs) (51.9%) and Rhodymenia corallina (44.4%). By weight (% W), the most important items, were L. gahi (eggs) (33.3%), Stomolophus sp. (7.3%) and Aphos porosus (6.5%). According to the Preponderance Index (%IP), the preponderant item was L. gahi (eggs) with 6.1% and 61.2% during winter-spring and summer-autumn, respectively. According to the Resultant Weight index (Rw) of wet items, the most important items were: C. filiformis (13.1%), L. gahi (eggs) (10.5%), R. corallina (7.4%), plastic (7.5%), Gigartina chamissoi (5.1%). Garbage/anthropogenic debris was common in the digestive tracts analyzed. Plastic items had a frequency of occurrence of 44.4%. A greater diversity of food items was observed during summer and autumn. This study shows that juvenile C. mydas forage on a variety of resources. We recommend that conservation plans, land use planning and future management plans in the Sechura Bay include green turtles as a sentinel species for monitoring biodiversity of marine resources and the degree of pollution in the Bay.

Mainy species have been identified as being threatened by collision, entanglement or ingestion of debris, generally plastics, which constitute the predominant part of the recorded marine debris. Assessing sensitive areas, where exposure to debris are high, is thus crucial, in particular for sea turtles which have been proposed as sentinels of debris levels for the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and for the Unep-MedPol convention. Our objective here was to assess sea turtle exposure to marine debris in the 3 metropolitan French fronts. Using aerial surveys performed in the Channel, the Atlantic and the Mediterranean regions in winter and summer 2011-2012, we evaluated exposure areas and magnitude in terms of spatial overlap, encounter probability and density of surrounding debris at various spatial scales. Major overlapping areas appeared in the Atlantic and Mediterranean fronts, concerning mostly the leatherback and the loggerhead turtles respectively. The probability for individuals to be in contact with debris (around 90% of individuals within a radius of 2 km) and the density of debris surrounding individuals (up to 16 items with a radius of 2 km, 88 items within a radius of 10 km) were very high, whatever the considered spatial scale, especially in the Mediterranean region and during the summer season. The comparison of the observed mean debris density with random distribution suggested that turtles selected debris areas. This may occur if both debris and turtles drift to the same areas due to currents, if turtles meet debris accidentally by selecting high food concentration areas, and/or if turtles actively seek debris out, confounding them with their preys. Various factors such as species-specific foraging strategies or oceanic features which condition the passive diffusion of debris, and sea turtles in part, may explain spatio-temporal variations in sensitive areas. Further research on exposure to debris is urgently needed. Empirical data on sea turtles and debris distributions, such as those collected aerially, are essential to better identify the location and the factors determining risks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Mytilus galloprovincialis, widely used as sentinel organisms in biomonitoring studies, were caged at the "Augusta-Melilli-Priolo" industrial site (eastern Sicily, Italy), chosen as one of the largest petrochemical areas in Europe, and Brucoli, chosen as reference site. Chemical analyses of sediments at the polluted site revealed high levels of PAHs and mercury, exceeding the national and international guideline limits. In mussels from the polluted site, severe morphological alterations were observed in gills, mainly involved in nutrient uptake and gas exchange. Changes in serotonergic and cholinergic systems, investigated through immunohistochemical, metabolomics and enzymatic approaches, were highlighted in gills, as well as onset of hypoxic adaptive responses with up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor transcript. Overall, the application of a multi-biomarker panel results effective in assessing the biological effects of petrochemical contamination on the health of aquatic organisms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Bacteriophages as indicators of faecal pollution and enteric virus removal	LETTERS IN APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY												Bacteriophages are an attractive alternative to faecal indicator bacteria (FIB), particularly as surrogates of enteric virus fate and transport, due to their closer morphological and biological properties. Based on a review of published data, we summarize densities of coliphages (F+ and somatic), Bacteroides spp. and enterococci bacteriophages (phages) in individual human waste, raw wastewater, ambient fresh and marine waters and removal through wastewater treatment processes utilizing traditional treatments. We also provide comparisons with FIB and enteric viruses whenever possible. Lastly, we examine fate and transport characteristics in the aquatic environment and provide an overview of the environmental factors affecting their survival. In summary, concentrations of bacteriophages in various sources were consistently lower than FIB, but more reflective of infectious enteric virus levels. Overall, our investigation indicates that bacteriophages may be adequate viral surrogates, especially in built systems, such as wastewater treatment plants. Significance and Impact of the StudyBacteriophage are alternative fecal indicators that may be better surrogates for viral pathogens than fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). This report offers a summary of the existing literature concerning the utility of bacteriophage as indicators of viral presence (fecal sources and surface waters) and persistence (in built infrastructure and aquatic environments). Our findings indicate that bacteriophage levels in all matrices examined are consistently lower than FIB, but similar to viral pathogens. Furthermore, in built infrastructure (e.g. wastewater treatment systems) bacteriophage closely mimic viral pathogen persistence suggesting they may be adequate sentinels of enteric virus removal.

Recruitment was estimated using a cohort strength model for survey indices of abundance at pre-exploitation ages, and spatio-temporal covariation in recruitment was then examined. Patterns of recruitment synchrony were generally consistent with management boundaries. However, there were some exceptions that suggest structure at the sub stock level and mixing across adjacent stock boundaries. In particular, we observed weak correlations between the eastern and western 3Ps RV (Research Survey) recruitment indices. We also observed strong correlations between the eastern 3Ps RV and the fall and spring 3NO RV recruitment indices, as well as fairly strong correlations between the southern 3L, central 3KL, and 3Ps sentinel GN and LT recruitment indices. Correlations between the summer 3M RV recruitment indices and all other survey recruitment indices included in our analysis were generally very weak, as was expected. We demonstrate that survey recruitment indices can be used to identify either areas of potential sub-stock structure or mixing or areas where recruitment drivers may be operating across or differentially within stock management boundaries. Hence, our results should improve the design of future stock structure research, and provide useful new information for fisheries management. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

These species could serve as potential sentinels for the presence of xenobiotics in marine ecosystems. In this study, liver carboxylesterase (CbE) activity was determined for 20 species of chondrichthyans. Carboxylesterase activity, a known esterase involved in the metabolism of pesticides, lipids and certain drugs, was measured using two substrates: 4-nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA) and alpha-naphthyl acetate (alpha NA). Rajiformes (rays and skates) showed higher CbE activity than sharks, and the order Chimaeriformes showed the lowest values. In vitro sensitivity to CbE inhibitors was assessed in the shark Scyliorhinus canicula. The substrate alpha NA was found to be the most adequate as it displayed the highest activity and was more sensitive to the organophosphate dichlorvos in the liver (IC50 = 2.37 mu M) and plasma (IC50 = 0.051 mu M). The high interspecific variation of CbE activity and its sensitivity to inhibition by fenofibrate suggest that this enzyme could contribute to species-specific differences in drug detoxification.

Microbial Community Response to Terrestrially Derived Dissolved Organic Matter in the Coastal Arctic	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Warming at nearly twice the global rate, higher than average air temperatures are the new 'normal' for Arctic ecosystems. This rise in temperature has triggered hydrological and geochemical changes that increasingly release carbon-rich water into the coastal ocean via increased riverine discharge, coastal erosion, and the thawing of the semipermanent permafrost ubiquitous in the region. To determine the biogeochemical impacts of terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter (tDOM) on marine ecosystems we compared the nutrient stocks and bacterial communities present under ice-covered and ice-free conditions, assessed the lability of Arctic tDOM to coastal microbial communities from the Chukchi Sea, and identified bacterial taxa that respond to rapid increases in tDOM. Once thought to be predominantly refractory, we found that similar to 7% of dissolved organic carbon and similar to 38% of dissolved organic nitrogen from tDOM was bioavailable to receiving marine microbial communities on short 4 - 6 day time scales. The addition of tDOM shifted bacterial community structure toward more copiotrophic taxa and away from more oligotrophic taxa. Although no single order was found to respond universally (positively or negatively) to the tDOM addition, this study identified 20 indicator species as possible sentinels for increased tDOM. These data suggest the true ecological impact of tDOM will be widespread across many bacterial taxa and that shifts in coastal microbial community composition should be anticipated.

J	Alikas, K; Kratzer, S				Alikas, Krista; Kratzer, Susanne			Improved retrieval of Secchi depth for optically-complex waters using remote sensing data	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Water transparency is one of the ecological indicators for describing water quality and the underwater light field which determines its productivity. In the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) as well as in the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) water transparency is used for ecological status classification of inland, coastal and open sea waters and it is regarded as an indicator for eutrophication in Baltic Sea management (HELCOM, 2007). We developed and compared different empirical and semi-analytical algorithms for lakes and coastal Nordic waters to retrieve Secchi depth (Z(SD)) from remote sensing data (MERIS, 300 m resolution).The algorithms were developed in water bodies with high coloured dissolved organic matter absorption (a(CNOM)(442) ranging 1.7-4.0 m(-1)), Chl a concentration (0.5-73 mg m(-3)) and total suspended matter (0.7-37.5 g m(-3)) and validated against an independent data set over inland and coastal waters (0.6 m < Z(SD) < 14.8 m). The results indicate that for empirical algorithms, using longer wavelengths in the visible spectrum as a reference band decreases the RMSE and increases the coefficient of determination (R-2). The accuracy increased (R-2 = 0.75, RMSE = 1.33 m, n = 134) when Z(SD) was retrieved via an empirical relationship between Z(SD) and K-d (490). The best agreement with in situ data was attained when Z(SD) was calculated via both the diffuse and the beam attenuation coefficient (R-2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.77 m, n = 89). The results demonstrate that transparency can be retrieved with high accuracy over various optical water types by the means of ocean color remote sensing, improving both the spatial and temporal coverage. The satellite derived Z(SD) product could be therefore used as an additional source of information for WFD and MSFD reporting purposes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Euthecosomatous pteropods (holoplanktonic gastropods) represent an excellent sentinel for indicating exposure to anthropogenic OA because of the sensitivity of their aragonite shells to the OA conditions less favorable for calcification. However, an integration of observations, experiments and modelling efforts is needed to make accurate predictions of how these organisms will respond to future changes to their environment. Our understanding of the underlying organismal biology and life history is far from complete and must be improved if we are to comprehend fully the responses of these organisms to the multitude of stressors in their environment beyond OA. This review considers the present state of research and understanding of euthecosomatous pteropod biology and ecology of these organisms and considers promising new laboratory methods, advances in instrumentation (such as molecular, trace elements, stable isotopes, palaeobiology alongside autonomous sampling platforms, CT scanning and high-quality video recording) and novel field-based approaches (i.e. studies of upwelling and CO2 vent regions) that may allow us to improve our predictive capacity of their vulnerability and/or resilience. In addition to playing a critical ecological and biogeochemical role, pteropods can offer a significant value as an early-indicator of anthropogenic OA. This role as a sentinel species should be developed further to consolidate their potential use within marine environmental management policy making.

Distribution and risk assessment of trace metals in Leptodius exarata, surface water and sediments from Douglas Creek in the Qua Iboe Estuary	JOURNAL OF TAIBAH UNIVERSITY FOR SCIENCE												Five trace metals in Leptodius exarata, epipellic sediments and surface water from an intertidal ecosystem in the Niger Delta (Nigeria) were studied to evaluate their spatial distributions, degrees of contamination, and associated ecological and health risks. The results show that the Cd (cadmium), Cr (chromium), Ni (nickel), Pb (lead) and Zn (zinc) concentrations in sediment range from 0.550-1.142, 9.57-15.95, 9.15-13.96, 2.00-8.90 and 91.5-121.6 mg kg(-1) dw, respectively, while the L. exarata tissue metal content varies from 0.162-0.931, 3.81-8.62, 4.45-17.15, 1.90-7.35, and 125.55-269.75 mg kg-1 dw, respectively. The bioconcentration factor ranking for trace metals was found to follow the Zn > Ni > Pb > Cr > Cd sequence. The high biota to sediment accumulation factor (B SAF) found for L. exarata reveals a sentinel metal bioindicator. Sediments from most sites were found to be uncontaminated to moderately contaminated (geoaccumulation, I-geo > 0), with Cd and Zn associated with anthropogenic intrusions. Low mean-ERM (effect range-median) and mean-PEL (probable effect level) quotients of sediments were found, indicating low-moderate degrees of contamination with 30% and 21% probabilities of toxicity. The multi-metal potential ecological risk index (R-1) for the intertidal ecosystem denotes low-moderate risk. Health risks associated with crab (L. exarata) consumption are more significant for children than for adults. (C) 2016 The Authors.

New ocean, new needs: Application of pteropod shell dissolution as a biological indicator for marine resource management	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Pteropods, planktonic marine snails with a cosmopolitan distribution, are highly sensitive to changing ocean chemistry. Graphical abstract shows pteropod responses to be related to aragonite saturation state, with progressing decrease in Omega(ar) causing deteriorating biological conditions. Under high saturation state (Omega(ar) > 1.1; zone 0), pteropods are healthy with no presence of stress or shell dissolution. With decreasing Oar (zone 1), pteropod stress is demonstrated through increased dissolution and reduced calcification. At Omega(ar) < 0.8 (zones 2 and 3), severe dissolution and absence of calcification prevail: the impairment is followed by significant damages. Pteropods responses to OA are closely correlated to shell dissolution that is characterized by clearly delineated thresholds. Yet the practical utility of these species as indicators of the status of marine ecosystem integrity has been overlooked. Here, we set out the scientific and policy rationales for the use of pteropods as a biological indicator appropriate for low-cost assessment of the effect of anthropogenic ocean acidification (OA) on marine ecosystems. While no single species or group of species can adequately capture all aspects of ecosystem change, pteropods are sensitive, specific, quantifiable indicators of OA's effects on marine biota. In an indicator screening methodology, shell dissolution scored highly compared to other indicators of marine ecological integrity. As the socioeconomic challenges of changing ocean chemistry continue to grow in coming decades, the availability of such straightforward and sensitive metrics of impact will become indispensable. Pteropods can be a valuable addition to suites of indicators intended to support OA water quality assessment, ecosystem based management, policy development, and regulatory applications.

Impact of nitrogen and phosphorus on phytoplankton production and bacterial community structure in two stratified Antarctic lakes: a bioassay approach	POLAR BIOLOGY												Arctic, Antarctic, and alpine ecosystems are recognized as sensors and sentinels of global change. As a consequence of their high sensitivity to minor climatic perturbations, permanently ice-covered lakes located in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV), Antarctica, represent end members in the global network of inland bodies of water. Episodic climatic events in the form of increased summer glacial melt result in inputs of organic sediment and nutrients from glacial streams to these closed basins. Phytoplankton communities residing in the oligotrophic water columns are highly responsive to pulses in nutrient availability; however, there is a lack of understanding on whether specific phytoplankton groups are more competitive during a summer flood event and how shifts in the phytoplankton community may influence heterotrophic bacteria. A bioassay approach in 3-l bottles was used to investigate the influence of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus availability on planktonic communities from the oligotrophic upper waters of two chemically distinct MDV lakes (Lakes Bonney and Fryxell) which differ in their external inputs and water column N/P stoichiometry. While microbial community responses varied between lakes and were nutrient-dependent, stimulation of phytoplankton biomass and productivity across all treatments was strongly linked with increased abundance of a single phytoplankton phylum (Chlorophyta). Despite stimulation of phytoplankton growth, primary and bacterial productivity was generally uncoupled; however, shifts in bacterial community diversity were observed in bioassays amended with either P or NP. We suggest that climate-associated increases in phytoplankton production and concomitant shifts in diversity will influence MDV bacterial community structure by altering the availability and composition of autochthonous carbon for heterotrophic production.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				MAY	2017	40	5					1007	1022		10.1007/s00300-016-2025-8								WOS:000402123800005

Persistent Organic Pollutant and Hormone Levels in Harbor Porpoise with B Cell Lymphoma	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												B-cell lymphoma, a common morphologic variant of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, has been associated with persistent pollutants in humans, but this association is not well-characterized in top-level predators sharing marine resources with humans. We characterized and compared blubber contaminants and hormones of a pregnant harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) with B-cell lymphoma, with those in two presumed healthy fishery by-caught porpoises with no lymphoma: a pregnant adult and female juvenile. Common historic use compounds, including polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and pesticides, were evaluated in blubber samples from three porpoises. In addition, blubber cortisol and progesterone levels (ng/g) were determined in all three animals. Total pollutant concentrations were highest in the juvenile porpoise, followed by the lymphoma porpoise and the nonlymphoma adult. Blubber cortisol concentrations were 191% greater in the pregnant with lymphoma porpoise compared with the pregnant no lymphoma porpoise, and 89% greater in the juvenile female compared with the pregnant no lymphoma porpoise. Although both adults were pregnant, progesterone levels were substantially greater (90%) in the healthy compared with the lymphoma adult. Health monitoring of top-level marine predators, such as porpoise, provides a sentinel measure of contaminants that serve as indicators of potential environmental exposure to humans.

Multi-residue analysis of 36 priority and emerging pollutants in marine echinoderms (Holothuria tubulosa) and marine sediments by solid-liquid extraction followed by dispersive solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis	TALANTA												Marine echinoderms are filter-feeding invertebrates widely distributed along the coasts, and which are therefore extensively exposed to anthropogenic xenobiotics. They can serve as good sentinels for monitoring a large variety of contaminants in marine ecosystems. In this context, a multi-residue analytical method has been validated and applied to Holothuria tubulosa specimens and marine sediments for the determination of 36 organic compounds, which belong to some of the most problematic groups of emerging and priority pollutants (perfluoroalkyl compounds, estrogens, parabens, benzophenones, plasticizers, surfactants, brominated flame retardants and alkylphenols). Lyophilization of samples prior to solvent extraction and clean-up of extracts with C18, followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, is proposed. A Box-Behnken design was used for optimization of the most influential variables affecting the extraction and clean-up steps. For validation, matrix-matched calibration and recovery assay were applied. Linearity (% r(2)) higher than 99%, recoveries between 80% and 114% (except in LAS and NP1EO), RSD (precision) lower than 15% and limits of quantification between 0.03 and 12.5 ng g(-1) dry weight (d.w.) were achieved. The method was applied to nine samples of Holothuria collected along the coast of Granada (Spain), and to marine sediments around the animals. The results demonstrated high bioaccumulation of certain pollutants. A total of 25 out of the 36 studied compounds were quantified, being surfactants, alkylphenols, perfluoroalkyl compounds, triclocarban and parabens the most frequently detected. Nonylphenol was found in the highest concentration (340 and 323 ng g(-1) d.w. in sediment and Holothuria samples, respectively).

J	Torres, P; da Cunha, RT; Rodrigues, AD				Torres, Paulo; da Cunha, Regina Tristao; Rodrigues, Armindo dos Santos			Mid-Atlantic elasmobranchs: Suitable metal scouts?	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Heavy metals are a hazard to marine fauna and human health. In this study we assess stable isotopes and metal content in Prionace glauca and Isurus oxyrinchus and analyse these results within and among other species and across regions and geographical areas. Also, we evaluate their suitability, together with Raja clavata and Galeorhinus galeus, as Mid-Atlantic bioindicators. Prionace glauca and I. oxyrinchus shared the same trophic level in a pelagic food web and did not present significant differences between genders or metals, except for As. Arsenic and Hg accumulated while Cd and Pb were not detected. One I. oxyrinchus presented Hg values above regulatory limits. A high Hg exposure was associated with I.. oxyrinchus since its maximum weekly intake was exceeded. Elasmobranchs can be used as metal sentinels, each presenting different key features which defines a good marine bioindicator, allowing long-term monitoring at different temporal and spatial scales.

Non-native molluscan colonizers on deliberately placed shipwrecks in the Florida Keys, with description of a new species of potentially invasive worm-snail (Gastropoda: Vermetidae)	PEERJ												Artificial reefs created by deliberately sinking ships off the coast of the Florida Keys island chain are providing new habitat for marine invertebrates. This newly developing fouling community includes the previously reported invasive orange tube coral Tubastraea coccinea and the non-native giant foam oyster Hyotissa hyotis. New SCUBA-based surveys involving five shipwrecks spanning the upper, middle, and lower Florida Keys, show T. coccinea now also established in the lower Keys and H. hyotis likewise extending to new sites. Two additional mollusks found on the artificial reefs, the amathinid gastropod Cyclothyca pacei and gryphaeid oyster Hyotissa mcgintyi, the latter also common in the natural reef areas, are discussed as potentially non-native. A new species of sessile, suspension-feeding, worm-snail, Thylacodes vandyensis Bieler, Rawlings & Collins n. sp. (Vermetidae), is described from the wreck of the USNS Vandenberg off Key West and discussed as potentially invasive. This new species is compared morphologically and by DNA barcode markers to other known members of the genus, and may be a recent arrival from the Pacific Ocean. Thylacodes vandyensis is polychromatic, with individuals varying in both overall head-foot coloration and mantle margin color pattern. Females brood stalked egg capsules attached to their shell within the confines of their mantle cavity, and give rise to crawl-away juveniles. Such direct-developing species have the demonstrated capacity for colonizing habitats isolated far from their native ranges and establishing rapidly growing founder populations. Vermetid gastropods are common components of the marine fouling community in warm temperate and tropical waters and, as such, have been tagged as potentially invasive or with a high potential to be invasive in the Pacific Ocean. As vermetids can influence coral growth/composition in the Pacific and have been reported serving as intermediate hosts for blood flukes of loggerhead turtles, such new arrivals in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary are of concern. Growing evidence indicates that artificial reefs can act as permanent way-stations for arriving non-natives, providing nurseries within which populations may grow in an environment with reduced competition compared to native habitats. Consequently, artificial reefs can act as sentinels for the appearance of new species. Ongoing monitoring of the developing molluscan fauna on the artificial reefs of the Florida Keys is necessary to recognize new invasions and identify potential eradication targets, thereby assuring the health of the nearby natural barrier reef.																	2167-8359					APR 5	2017	5								e3158	10.7717/peerj.3158								WOS:000398662500004	28392984					
J	Lettenmaier, T; von Jouanne, A; Brekken, T				Lettenmaier, Terry; von Jouanne, Annette; Brekken, Ted			A new maximum power point tracking algorithm for ocean wave energy converters	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MARINE ENERGY												This paper describes a new maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm developed to control a wave energy converter (WEC) in random seas. This algorithm, named the cycling MPPT algorithm, is compared to a perturb and observe algorithm described in numerous literature. Both algorithms were initially tested during 2012 ocean tests of the half-scale prototype Wave Energy Technology - New Zealand (WET-NZ) WEC off the Oregon coast. During these sea trials the perturb and observe algorithm failed to provide effective control of the WET-NZ, while the cycling algorithm was observed to give effective control. More complete investigations were later carried out using MATLAB-Simulink simulations of an autonomous WEC (AWEC) being developed at Oregon State University. The results of the AWEC simulations also showed the cycling algorithm provided better control than the perturb and observe algorithm. The operation of the cycling algorithm was fully characterized during the AWEC simulations and these results are presented. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Temperate rocky subtidal reef community reveals human impacts across the entire food web	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Food webs as representations of who eats whom are at the core of community ecology. Incorporation of tools from network theory enables assessment of how complex systems respond to natural and human-induced stressors, revealing how harvesting may degrade the properties and resilience of food webs. We present a comprehensive, coastal marine food web that includes 147 taxa cooccurring on shallow subtidal reefs along the highly productive and exploited Humboldt Current System of central Chile. This food web has connectance of 0.06, link density of 1204 and mean chain length of 4.3. The fractions of intermediate (76%), omnivorous (49%) and cannibalistic (8%) nodes are slightly lower than those observed in other marine food webs. Of the 147 nodes, 34 are harvested. Links to harvested nodes represented 50 to 100% of all trophic links of non-harvested nodes, illustrating the great impact that fishery pressure can have on the food web. The food web was compartmentalized into 5 sub-webs with high representation of harvested taxa. This structure changes if the fishery node is removed. Similarity analyses identified groups of harvested species with non-harvested nodes, suggesting that these tropho-equivalents could be sentinel species for the community-wide impacts of coastal fisheries. We conclude that fishing effects can be transmitted throughout the food web, with no compartments completely unaffected by harvesting. It is urgent to establish monitoring programs for community-wide effects of fisheries and assess whether resilience of these highly productive subtidal food webs has al ready been compromised, thereby identifying essential nodes that require stronger fisheries regulation.

J	Altena, B; Kaab, A				Altena, Bas; Kaab, Andreas			Elevation Change and Improved Velocity Retrieval Using Orthorectified Optical Satellite Data from Different Orbits	REMOTE SENSING												Optical satellite products are available at different processing levels. Of these products, terrain corrected (i.e., orthorectified) products are the ones mostly used for glacier displacement estimation. For terrain correction, a digital elevation model (DEM) is used that typically stems from various data sources with variable qualities, from dispersed time instances, or with different spatial resolutions. Consequently, terrain representation used for orthorectifying satellite images is often in disagreement with reality at image acquisition. Normally, the lateral orthoprojection offsets resulting from vertical DEM errors are taken into account in the geolocation error budget of the corrected images, or may even be neglected. The largest offsets of this type are often found over glaciers, as these may show strong elevation changes over time and thus large elevation errors in the reference DEM with respect to image acquisition. The detection and correction of such orthorectification offsets is further complicated by ice flow which adds a second offset component to the displacement vectors between orthorectified data. Vice versa, measurement of glacier flow is complicated by the inherent superposition of ice movement vectors and orthorectification offset vectors. In this study, we try to estimate these orthorectification offsets in the presence of terrain movement and translate them to elevation biases in the reference surface. We demonstrate our method using three different sites which include very dynamic glaciers. For the Oriental Glacier, an outlet of the Southern Patagonian icefield, Landsat 7 and 8 data from different orbits enabled the identification of trends related to elevation change. For the Aletsch Glacier, Swiss Alps, we assess the terrain offsets of both Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2A: a superior DEM appears to be used for Landsat in comparison to Sentinel-2, however a systematic bias is observed in the snow covered areas. Lastly, we demonstrate our methodology in a pipeline structure; displacement estimates for the Helheim-glacier, in Greenland, are mapped and corrected for orthorectification offsets between data from different orbits, which enables a twice as dense a temporal resolution of velocity data, as compared to the standard method of measuring velocities from repeat-orbit data only. In addition, we introduce and implement a novel matching method which uses image triplets. By formulating the three image displacements as a convolution, a geometric constraint can be exploited. Such a constraint enhances the reliability of the displacement estimations. Furthermore the implementation is simple and computationally swift.

Comparing the foraging strategies of a seabird predator when recovering from a drastic climatic event	MARINE BIOLOGY												Seabirds due to their status as sentinels of the marine environment can indicate qualitative changes at various levels of the food web. Furthermore, changes in marine productivity have been correlated with fluctuations in large-scale atmospheric conditions driven by global indices, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. During the winter of 2009/2010, the second lowest NAO index in history was recorded leading to detrimental conditions that influenced productivity levels in the northeast Atlantic. The response of the Cory's Shearwater Calonectris borealis, during the period of ameliorating climatic conditions from this drastic event, was monitored in two islands with contrasting productivity patterns: Berlenga, located on the rich upwelling area of the Portuguese shelf; and Cima Islet (Porto Santo Island), located in a poor oceanic environment in the Madeira Archipelago. We collected a multi-year GPS-tracking data set (2011-2015) from adult breeders during the chick-rearing season to examine their at-sea foraging distribution. During a year of low productivity, kernel estimations demonstrated that Cima Islet birds expanded their home ranges and core foraging areas all over the northeast Atlantic, whereas Berlenga birds maintained their distribution close to the breeding colony. Once oceanographic conditions ameliorated from 2012 to 2015, birds decreased significantly their foraging effort, and oceanic breeders concentrated their activity closer to the breeding colony. Analysis of habitat use by means of Maximum Entropy Modelling confirmed distance-to-colony as the most important predictor in the distribution of Cory's Shearwater. Environmental variables describing sea surface temperature, bathymetry, and chlorophyll a were more influential in Porto Santo, indicating higher sensitivity of the oceanic population to marine productivity proxies. Our study confirms that the Cory's Shearwater possesses enormous flexibility in its foraging tactics and that neither oceanic nor neritic populations disperse randomly from their breeding colonies to the open ocean even under conditions of environmental stochasticity. Instead, populations breeding in contrasting environments vary in their responses according to their strategies and to the changing levels of marine productivity in the surroundings of their colonies.

Nanoparticle insult to living organisms may occur in a sequential way, first by chemical interactions of the material with the target membrane, then by progressive internalisation and interaction with cellular structures and organelles. These events trigger a signal transduction, through which cells modulate molecular pathway in order to respond and survive to the external elicitation. Therefore, the analysis of the global changes of the molecular machinery, possibly induced in an organism upon exposure to a given nanomaterial, may provide unique clues for proper and exhaustive risk assessment. Here, we tested the impact of core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs coated by a positively charged polymer on two aquatic species, the polyp Hydra vulgaris and the coral S. pistillata, representative of freshwater and sea habitats, respectively. By using reliable approaches based on animal behaviour and physiology together with a whole transcriptomic profiling, we determined several toxicity endpoints. Despite the difference in the efficiency of uptake, both species were severely affected by QD treatment, resulting in dramatic morphological damages and tissue bleaching. Global transcriptional changes were also detected in both organisms, but presenting different temporal dynamics, suggesting both common and divergent functional responses in the two sentinel organisms. Due to the striking conservation of structure and genomic organisation among animals throughout evolution, our expression profiling offers new clues to identify novel molecular markers and pathways for comparative transcriptomics of nanotoxicity.

Comparative analysis of selected semi-persistent and emerging pollutants in wild-caught fish and aquaculture associated fish using Bogue (Boops boops) as sentinel species	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The marine environment acts as a sink for diverse anthropogenic pollutants, although the environmental contamination may be non-uniformly distributed. In recent decades, the aquaculture sector has experienced a steady growth postulating as a good alternative for seafood production. However, a social debate exits about the differential level of pollutants in wild and farmed species. This study was designed to evaluate the level of pollutants in a sentinel species: Bogue (Boops boops) associated and non-associated to fish-farm cages. A total of 82 chemical substances were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, including persistent (polychlotobiphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCP5)), semi-persistent (bromodiphenyl ethers (BDEs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)), and emerging pollutants (such as organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) and UV-filters). In general, aquaculture-associated bogues showed lower levels of semi-persistent and emerging pollutants than wild-caught fish, especially when sums were considered. Thus, sum of BDEs was significantly lower in the aquaculture group (p = 0.01). A similar trend was also observed for benzo(a)anthracene, the UV-filter 2-ethylhexyl-p-methoxycinnamate and some OPFRs. In the case of persistent pollutants, the sum of dioxin-like PCBs and sum of DDTs were lower in the group of wild-caught bogues (p = 0.034 and p = 0.003, respectively) than in aquaculture-associated bogues, as previously described for some aquaculture species. Fish feed appear as an important factor in the uptake of such substances suggesting a diet intervention to reduce their levels in the aquaculture products. Another interesting result is that for almost all chemical substances analyzed, bogues captured near sewage outfalls showed the highest levels of pollutants, pointing out the need of stringent measures for wastewater treatment units discharging in coastal areas. On the light of these results, further research in specific farmed and wild fish species in relation to their dietary value and pollutant's levels seems to be mandatory.

J	Rojo-Nieto, E; Fernandez-Maldonado, C				Rojo-Nieto, Elisa; Fernandez-Maldonado, Carolina			Assessing trace elements in striped dolphins from the Strait of Gibraltar: Clues to link the bioaccumulation in the westernmost Mediterranean Sea area and nearest Atlantic Ocean	CHEMOSPHERE												Dolphins are considered sentinel species in the marine environment. The Strait of Gibraltar is the only passage between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, being the transitional region which connects these two basins and one of the most important routes of cetacean migration worldwide. In this work, eight trace elements (TE) were studied in 45 samples of liver, kidney and muscle, from 15 specimens stranded in this study area. The preliminary results show, among others, the patterns of distribution of the TE in the target organs studied, the influence of sex, length and developmental stage in these 'FE concentrations and the Se/Hg ratio. Subsequently, the results of TE concentrations in liver have being compared to previous data on S. coeruleoalba from the westernmost Mediterranean Sea and the nearest Atlantic Ocean. For some elements (e.g. for As), concentrations are similar to those obtained from Atlantic samples, despite in other cases (e.g. for Cd) results are lined up with those observed in Mediterranean studies. In addition, in the case of some TE (e.g. Se and Zn) the results are in the middle of those reported for both basins, reinforcing the idea of the Strait of Gibraltar being a transitional zone. Present study is the first research regarding this issue in this outstanding region, aiming to give insights of how this matchless area can help to link 'FE concentrations observed in these Atlantic and Mediterranean threatened species.

In order to evaluate the environmental health of these regions, we used the demersal fish dab (Limanda limanda) as a sentinel species. The current study used well-established biomarkers for PAH exposure and oxidative stress, measuring EROD activity, the acute antioxidant response as well as oxidation of proteins detected as protein carbonyl levels. Results show the strongest biomarker results in an area with extensive oil drilling, where dab displayed high levels of EROD activities. This was also seen in dab captured in the Baltic Sea where elevated levels of oxidized glutathione and a trend towards higher EROD activity were observed. The obtained results did, however, not indicate a coherent biomarker response. The study was conducted off shore where many areas have presumably low levels of pollutants, and we could detect minor effects using the biomarker approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Bioassays (oyster larval anomalies, Corophium arenarium toxicity assay and DR Calux) for sediment and biomarkers: ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, lysosomal membrane stability (LMS), DNA strand breaks using the Comet assay, DNA adducts, micronucleus (MN), PAH metabolites, imposex, intersex and fish external pathologies were analysed in four marine sentinel species (Platichthys flesus, Limanda limanda, Mytilus sp. and Nucella lapilus). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and heavy metals were analysed in biota and sediment. Results for sediment and four species in 2008-2009 made it possible to quantify the impact of contaminants using thresholds (Environmental Assessment Criteria/EAC(2008): 70% and EAC(2009): 60%) and effects (EAC(2008): 50% and EAC(2009): 40%) in the Seine estuary.

Synthetic Aperture Radar Ship Detection Using Haar-Like Features	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												The detection of ships at sea is a complex task made more so by adverse weather conditions, lack of night visibility, and large areas of concern. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery with large swaths can provide the needed coverage at a reduced resolution. The development of ship detection methods that can effectively detect ships despite the reduced image resolution is an important area of research. A novel ship detection method is introduced that makes use of a standard constant false alarm rate (FAR) prescreening step followed by a cascade classifier ship discriminator. Ships are identified using Haar-like features using adaptive boosting training on the classifier with an accuracy of 89.38% and FAR of 1.47 x 10(-8) across a large swath Sentinel-1 and RADARSAT-2 newly created SAR data set.																	1545-598X	1558-0571				FEB	2017	14	2					154	158		10.1109/LGRS.2016.2631638								WOS:000395429800004

Metals as chemical tracers to discriminate ecological populations of threatened Franciscana dolphins (Pontoporia blainvillei) from Argentina	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Franciscana dolphins are the most impacted small cetacean in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean, classified as Vulnerable A3d by IUCN. Essential (Fe, Mo, Mn, Cr, Ni, Co) and non-essential (Ag, Pb, Sn) trace elements (TEs) were measured in liver, kidney, and brain samples of by-catch Franciscana dolphins that were living in estuarine (n = 21) and marine (n = 21) habitats (1) to assess whether TEs posed a threat and (2) to evaluate the suitability of TEs for discriminating ecological populations of this species in Argentinean waters. Essential TEs showed little variation in tissues from both groups in agreement with levels reported for other cetaceans and suggesting that these concentrations correspond to normal physiological levels. Non-essential TEs were higher in estuarine juveniles and adults dolphins than in marine specimens. These results suggest anthropogenic sources associated with estuarine area and that Franciscana dolphins are good sentinels of the impact of the environment. The difference in the concentrations of TEs beetwen ecological populations appeared to be related to distinct exposures in both geographical areas, and it is suggested that Ag and Sn concentrations in adults are good chemical tracers of anthropogenic input of TEs. These results provide additional information for improved management and regulatory policy.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2017	24	4					3940	3950		10.1007/s11356-016-7970-9								WOS:000397004600064	27909926

The subsequent lowering of the saturation state of CaCO3 may make the secretion of skeletons more problematic for marine calcifiers. As organisms that precipitate thin aragonite shells, thecosome pteropods have been identified as being particularly vulnerable to climate change effects. Coupled with their global distribution, this makes them ideal for use as sentinel organisms. Recent studies have highlighted shell dissolution as a potential indicator of ocean acidification; however, this metric is not applicable for monitoring pH changes in supersaturated basins. In this study, the novel approach of high resolution computed tomography (CT) scanning was used to produce quantitative 3-dimensional renderings pteropod shells to assess the potential of using this method to monitor small changes in shell biometrics that may be driven by climate change drivers. An ontogenetic analysis of the shells of Cavolinia inflexa and Styliola subula collected from the Mediterranean was used to identify suitable monitoring metrics. Modern samples were then compared to historical samples of the same species, collected during the Mediterranean leg of the Thor (1910) and Dana (1921) cruises to assess whether any empirical differences could be detected. Shell densities were calculated and scanning electron microscopy was used to compare the aragonite crystal morphology. pH for the collection years was hind-cast using temperature and salinity time series with atmospheric CO2 concentrations from ice core data. Historical samples of S. subula were thicker than S. subula shells of the same size from 2012 and C. inflexa shells collected in 1910 were significantly denser than those from 2012. These results provide a baseline for future work to develop monitoring techniques for climate change in the oceans using the novel approach of high-resolution CT scanning.

Harbor porpoises Phocoena phocoena have a coastal distribution, and stranded animals function as sentinels for population and ecosystem health. The goal of this retrospective study was to join datasets from the western Atlantic and eastern Pacific coasts of Canada to investigate causes of morbidity and mortality in this species. A total of 241 necropsy records were reviewed including 147 (61%) from the Pacific region and 94 (39%) from the Atlantic region from 1988 to 2011. A cause of death could be determined with confidence in 118 (49%) of these cases. Of these 118 cases, the leading cause of mortality for both regions, together and separately, was infectious disease. In the Pacific region, this was followed by traumatic and anthropogenic causes, whereas in the Atlantic region, it was followed by emaciation/starvation, mortality of dependent calves, and anthropogenic causes. Pathogens of potential zoonotic significance or indicative of environmental contamination, e.g. Salmonella sp. and Cryptococcus gattii, were identified. Numerous parasitic species were observed within the lungs, liver, stomach, middle ear, and subcutaneous tissues, although they were usually interpreted as incidental findings. Anthropogenic causes may be underrepresented as they are notoriously difficult to diagnose with certainty, thereby making up a proportion of the `unknown causes of death' (51%) category. Improved standardization of data collection and documentation is required to better understand harbor porpoise and ecosystem health.																	0177-5103	1616-1580				JAN 24	2017	122	3					171	183		10.3354/dao03080								WOS:000395422600001	28117296

The species is exposed to different threats and is considered an environmental sentinel that indicates variation among, and the severity of hazards to marine ecosystems. This study aimed to describe both anthropogenic impacts, and infectious and parasitic diseases in C. mydas - including cases along the Brazilian coast - and implications for conservation. Bycatch is reported as the main threat to the conservation of this species, followed by debris ingestion, collisions with boats, dredging, and chronic environmental contamination. All of these impacts may directly or indirectly cause death, by facilitating contact with pathological agents and by increasing vulnerability to secondary diseases. The pathological agents associated with lesions include viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and helminths. Fibropapillomatosis is an example of a chronic disease characterized by cutaneous and visceral tumors that affects mostly juvenile C. mydas worldwide and is associated with the Chelonid herpesvirus 5. The bacterias Vibrio alginolyticus, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Pseudomonas fluorescens are found in the aquatic environment and among C. mydas lesions in various organs. Trematode adults and eggs of the family Spirorchiidae are also frequent in systemic cardiovascular diseases of C. mydas. The direct impacts of anthropogenic activities and diseases are synergistic and may affect the specie's health and conservation. Therefore, the monitoring and systematic diagnosing of diseases and causes of death - including necropsy, histopathology, and molecular exams - are necessary to assess a population's health, to support appropriate decisions of coastal management and to target future research topics that optimize C. mydas conservation.

Mammals such as squirrels can be valuable biological sentinels for environmental pollution and the intention of this pilot project was to test a new, rapid technique that allows direct detection of mercury (Hg) in hair samples. Our aim was to establish, for the first time, if red squirrels in Europe show any indication of mercury pollution; and to compare levels from red squirrels in two rural UK (Arran and Brownsea Island) and one Polish city population (Warsaw). The latter is exposed to higher levels of Hg from coal-fired power plants. Total mercury levels ranged from 11.1 to 801.95 m g/kg. Contrary to our expectations, females from the Island of Arran had significantly higher Hg values than either males or females from the two other sites. Although the Isle of Arran was the only site where the difference between females and males was significant, our findings for both Poland and the UK suggest that mercury does not only accumulate in marine food chains and the arctic ecosystem, but is present in urban ecosystems and terrestrial woodlands. Data on trends to determine if Hg values are accumulating in arboreal mammals are completely lacking, and point to a need for a monitoring strategy of mercury levels and associated, potential health impacts in endangered species.																	0394-1914	1825-5272					2017	28	2								10.4404/hystrix-28.2-12335								WOS:000411832300005

Nanomaterials are known to be taken up by hemocytes of marine invertebrates including Mytilus galloprovincialis. Indeed, assessments of hemocyte-related parameters are a valuable tool in the determination of potentials for nanoparticle (NP) toxicity. The present study assessed the effects from two size types of silver nanoparticles (AgNP: <50 nm and <100 nm) on the frequency of hemocytes subpopulations as immunomodulation biomarkers exposed in a mollusk host. Studies were performed using exposures prior to and after inhibition of potential NP uptake pathways (i.e. clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis) and over different durations of exposure (3, 6 and 12 h). Differential hemocyte counts (DHC) revealed significant variations in frequency of different immune cells in mussels exposed for 3 hr to either AgNP size. However, as exposure duration progressed cell levels were subsequently differentially altered depending on particle size (i.e. no significant effects after 3 h with larger AgNP). AgNP effects were also delayed/varied after blockade of either clathrin-or caveolae-mediated endocytosis. The results also noted significant negative correlations between changes in levels hyalinocytes and acidophils or in levels basophils and acidophils as a result of AgNP exposure. From these results, we concluded AgNP effects on mussels were size and duration of exposure dependent. This study highlighted how not only was NP size important, but that differing internalization mechanisms could be key factors impacting on the potential for NP in the environment to induce immunomodulation in a model/test sentinel host like M. galloprovincialis.

MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH												The distribution of 130 nominal species of the genus Halecium, based on published records, has been mapped for the first time in a comprehensive set of marine ecoregions, to analyse their distribution. Most Halecium species are found at mid-and high latitudes, with some overlaps in distribution ranges across regions. The species richness of Halecium is strongly related to the latitudinal gradient, with maximal diversity at polar and temperate latitudes. Previous detailed studies in the Mediterranean Sea show that large Halecium species of coldwater affinity have regressed or disappeared in recent years, probably due to global warming. Worldwide, however, the overall species richness of Halecium has not changed along the latitudinal gradient over recent decades, with some changes in species composition at temperate-tropical latitudes in both hemispheres, even though the majority of the species that have not been recorded for more than 50 years are of coldwater affinity. The genus can be considered an indicator for biological responses to climate changes for the Mediterranean Sea, but the available distribution data do not allow extending this possibility to the rest of the world. A focused evaluation on the distribution of Halecium species with the addition of new field data might reinforce the picture stemming from the present analysis.

Therese; Vaiciute, Diana			Retrieval of suspended particulate matter from turbidity - model development, validation, and application to MERIS data over the Baltic Sea	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Suspended particulate matter (SPM) causes most of the scattering in natural waters and thus has a strong influence on the underwater light field, and consequently on the whole ecosystem. Turbidity is related to the concentration of SPM which usually is measured gravimetrically, a rather time-consuming method. Measuring turbidity is quick and easy, and therefore also more cost-effective. When derived from remote sensing data the method becomes even more cost-effective because of the good spatial resolution of satellite data and the synoptic capability of the method. Turbidity is also listed in the European Union's Marine Strategy Framework Directive as a supporting monitoring parameter, especially in the coastal zone. In this study, we aim to provide a new Baltic Sea algorithm to retrieve SPM concentration from in situ turbidity and investigate how this can be applied to satellite data. An in situ dataset was collected in Swedish coastal waters to develop a new SPM model. The model was then tested against independent datasets from both Swedish and Lithuanian coastal waters. Despite the optical variability in the datasets, SPM and turbidity were strongly correlated (r = 0.97). The developed model predicts SPM reliably from in situ turbidity (R-2 = 0.93) with a mean normalized bias (MNB) of 2.4% for the Swedish and 14.0% for the Lithuanian datasets, and a relative error (RMS) of 25.3% and 37.3%, respectively. In the validation dataset, turbidity ranged from 0.3 to 49.8 FNU (Formazin Nephelometric Unit) and correspondingly, SPM concentration ranged from 0.3 to 34.0 g m(-3) which covers the ranges typical for Baltic Sea waters. Next, the medium-resolution imaging spectrometer (MERIS) standard SPM product MERIS Ground Segment (MEGS) was tested on all available match-up data (n = 67). The correlation between SPM retrieved from MERIS and in situ SPM was strong for the Swedish dataset with r = 0.74 (RMS = 47.4 and MNB = 11.3%; n = 32) and very strong for the Lithuanian dataset with r = 0.94 (RMS = 29.5% and MNB = -1.5%; n = 35). Then, the turbidity was derived from the MERIS standard SPM product using the new in situ SPM model, but retrieving turbidity from SPM instead. The derived image was then compared to existing in situ data and showed to be in the right range of values for each sub-area. The new SPM model provides a robust and cost-efficient method to determine SPM from in situ turbidity measurements (or vice versa). The developed SPM model predicts SPM concentration with high quality despite the high coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) range in the Baltic Sea. By applying the developed SPM model to already existing remote sensing data (MERIS/Envisat) and most importantly to a new generation of satellite sensors (in particular OLCI on board the Sentinel-3), it is possible to derive turbidity for the Baltic Sea.

Blue mussel Mytilus edulis is a sentinel organism that is commonly used for monitoring chemical contaminants in coastal ecosystems, and its haemocytes play an essential role in immune function. Therefore, we estimated the effects of BDE-47 exposure on the M. edulis haemocytes' immune function under controlled laboratory conditions. The study found the following results: (1) BDE-47 exposure increased the mortality of the haemocytes and decreased the total haemocyte counts. The ultrastructure and microstructure in the haemocytes were significantly changed, and the micronucleus frequency was increased steadily in a concentration-dependent manner, inferring that cellular and molecular damages occur during the exposure. (2) The immune function of the haemocytes was estimated from lysosomal and phagocytic changes. The lysosomal membrane stability was significantly disrupted compared to the control according to neutral red retention time changes, and the phagocytic ability was reduced significantly. Two lysosomal enzymes, acid phosphatases and alkaline phosphatases, presented similar increasing trends during the treatment. (3) BDE-47 exposure significantly induced the overproduction of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde in a clear time- and concentration-dependent manner, suggesting the occurrence of oxidative stress. We thus presumed that BDE-47 exposure affected the immune function of the mussel's haemocytes, and an ROS-mediated pathway might be one of the possible explanations for the observation.

The present paper reports the study of trace metals at nine mangrove sites in Singapore in 2012/2013, using the simultaneous application of various tools, namely sediment analyses, the technique of diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) and caged/native bivalves (for both chemical and bio-marker analyses). DGT devices were successfully deployed over 28 days in tropical mangrove waters, and the concentration measured with DGT showed significant correlation with the accumulation for Cu, Zn and Cd in caged mussels, and Cu for native clams, supporting the relevance of DGT to predict metal bioaccumulation. Concentrations in mangrove sediment are reported for As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn. Sediment levels on a dry weight (dw) basis of Cu (ND-219.5 mu g/g dw) and Zn (ND-502 mu g/g dw) exceeded general sediment quality criteria at two sites. Most notably for these two metals, investigations based on the four tools (DGT, sediments, caged mussels and clams) were all able to segregate sites above and below the sediment quality guideline. This was further supported by a range of significant linear correlations between the measurements obtained with the various tools. The present findings support that these monitoring tools are comparable in the field to provide a time-integrated assessment of metals such as Cu and Zn. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Within MPAs, traditional artisanal fishing is competing for space and resources with increasing recreational fishing, likely leading to interacting ecological effects. Such effects are difficult to unravel, given the multispecies character of both fisheries and the complexity of the food webs upon which they both impact. To address these issues, we developed an Ecopath and EcoTroph trophic model for the Portofino MPA case study (NW Mediterranean), in particular to (1) identify keystone species and assess fishing impact on them; (2) analyze the interacting impact of artisanal and recreational fishing on ecosystem biomass and trophic structure; and (3) assess the impact of recreational fishing on artisanal fishing catches. Two high trophic level predator (HTLP) groups coupled important keystone roles with high sensitivity to fishing pressure and should thus be regarded as "sentinels" to be prioritized for the definition of management actions. Recreational fishing had the widest impact on the food web, strongly impacting HTLP. Simulation of different mortality scenarios for each fishery highlighted that the ecosystem is far from its carrying capacity for HTLP. Forbidding recreational fishing allowed a 24% increase in HTLP biomass and benefited artisanal fishing by increased availability of HTLP catches. Artisanal fishing alone could instead be maintained with a moderate impact on the food web. Overall, Ecopath and EcoTroph modeling is a valuable tool to advise MPA management, but it is essential to increase data availability and quality by developing long-term monitoring programs on key species and on artisanal and recreational fishing.

Histological examination of tissues from a stranded Florida manatee Trichechus manatus latirostris revealed protozoal cysts in the cerebrum and intrahistiocytic tachyzoites in the liver and caudal mesenteric lymph node. Disseminated Toxoplasma gondii infection was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and sequencing of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region of formalin-fixed tissues. The lack of baseline information on Florida manatees' exposure to this pathogen prompted a study into the seroprevalence of T. gondii in 2 separate geographic habitats in Florida, USA, during the winters from 2011-2014. Serum was collected during routine health assessments of 44 apparently healthy manatees from Crystal River (n = 26) on the west central coast of Florida and Brevard County (n = 18) on the east coast of Florida. Serum was screened for detection of T. gondii immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies via the modified agglutination test. Two animals from Crystal River from 2011 and 2012 (7.7%) and one animal from Brevard County from 2011 (5.6%) tested positive for T. gondii antibodies. Overall seroprevalence for T. gondii was low in the 2 sampled populations and may reflect a low seroprevalence or animal susceptibility. However, continued monitoring of this pathogen in aquatic ecosystems is warranted due to both possible anthropogenic sources and zoonotic potential.

The FFA pattern is involved in the regulation of different cellular pathways and differs with respect to metabolic stimuli. To this purpose, the lipid fraction of mussels coming from both sampling areas was extracted and the FFA fractions were isolated and purified by a solid phase extraction; then, nano-scale liquid chromatography coupled to electron ionization mass spectrometry (nanoLC-EI-MS) was employed for the characterization of the two samples. A total of 19 and 17 FFAs were reliably identified in the mussels coming from the reference and polluted site, respectively. Significant qualitative and quantitative differences found in saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated species may be exploited as typical pollution biomarkers (e.g, alteration of the fatty acid biosynthetic system and lipotoxicity) and explain adverse and compromising effects (e.g. oxidative stress and inflammatory processes) related to environmental pollution.

Upon in vitro contaminant exposure, the non-coplanar PCB congeners CB 138, 153, and 180, but not the coplanar CB 169, significantly reduced lymphocyte proliferation between 10 and 20 mu g g(-1). The respective in vitro EC50 values for these congeners were 13.3, 20.7, 20.8, and 54.6 mu g g(-1) ww. No modulation of lymphocyte proliferation was observed upon in vitro exposure to two individual PFASs, perfluorooctane sulphonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), at concentrations up to 1000 ng g(-1). In addition, no significant correlations were found between lymphocyte proliferation and any blood or blubber contaminant measured. Taken together, these data suggest this population of ringed seals is not currently at high risk of altered lymphocyte proliferation from exposure to the POPs or PFASs in this study.

This experiment was designed to estimate the suitability of an original cellular biomarker to early quantify the biological risk associated to hydrocarbons pollutants in seawater. Oocytes and hepatopancreas cells, isolated from oyster (Crassostrea gigas), were tested for their capacity to regulate their volume following a hypo-osmotic challenge. Cell volumes were estimated from cell images recorded at regular time intervals during a 90 min-period. When exposed to diluted seawater (osmolalities from 895 to 712 mosm kg(-1)), both cell types first swell and then undergo a shrinkage known as Regulatory Volume Decrease (RVD). This process is inversely proportional to the magnitude of the osmotic shock and is best fitted using a first-order exponential decay model. The Recovered Volume Factor (RVF) calculated from this model appears to be an accurate tool to compare cells responses. As shown by an about 50% decrease in RVF, the RVD process was significantly inhibited in cells sampled from oysters previously exposed to a low concentration of diesel oil (8.4 mg L-1 during 24 h). This toxic effect was interpreted as a decreased permeability of the cell membranes resulting from an alteration of their lipidic structure by diesel oil compounds. In contrast, the previous contact of oysters with diesel did not induce any rise in the gills glutathione S-transferase specific activity. Therefore, this work demonstrates that the study of the RVD process of cells selected from sentinel animal species could be an alternative bioassay for the monitoring of hydrocarbons and probably, of various chemicals in the environment liable to alter the cellular regulations. Especially, given the high sensitivity of this biomarker compared with a proven one, it could become a relevant and accurate tool to estimate the biological hazards of micropollutants in the water.

Dependency of the Sentinel-1 azimuth wavelength cut-off on significant wave height and wind speed	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Sea wind and sea state estimation by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements is a topic of relevance both on the scientific and user side. The new European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-1 constellation is meant to support marine studies and ensure highquality data. In this paper, we investigate the azimuth cut-off (lambda(C)) sea wind speed and significant wave height retrieval approach by taking benefit of two sets of multi-look SAR images with incidence angles varying from 20 degrees to 45 degrees. The images have been co-located with sea surface wind measurements acquired by the scatterometer onboard the Chinese satellite HY-2A (HSCAT) and with the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) operational model output. This study is meant to analyse both the empirical dependency of SAR lambda(C) on significant wave height (Hs) and wind speed (U). Several fitting geophysical model functions (lambda(C)-GMFs) are proposed and discussed. The results show that lambda(C) is strongly correlated with the significant wave height in all sea state conditions, while the correlation with the wind speed is only high for fully developed sea states. The azimuth cut-off based significant wave height retrievals are compared with independent National Data Buoy Centre (NDBC) network observations, showing a root mean square difference of about 0.5 m.

In this study, samples from 589 marine mammal species and 34 European otters (Lutra lutra), stranded on the coasts of Scotland, Belgium, France, The Netherlands and Germany, were tested for the presence of T. gondii. Brain samples were analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of parasite DNA. Blood and muscle fluid samples were tested for specific antibodies using a modified agglutination test (MAT), a commercial multi-species enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Out of 193 animals tested by PCR, only two harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) cerebrum samples, obtained from animals stranded on the Dutch coast, tested positive. The serological results showed a wide variation depending on the test used. Using a cut-off value of 1/40 dilution in MAT, 141 out of 292 animals (41%) were positive. Using IFA, 30 out of 244 tested samples (12%) were positive at a 1/50 dilution. The commercial ELISA yielded 7% positives with a cut-off of the sample-to-positive (SAP) ratio > 50; and 12% when the cut-off was set at SAP ratio > 20. The high number of positives in MAT may be an overestimation due to the high degree of haemolysis of the samples and/or the presence of lipids. The ELISA results could be an underestimation due to the use of a multispecies conjugate. Our results confirm the presence of T. gondii in marine mammals in The Netherlands and show exposure to the parasite in both the North Sea and the Eastern Atlantic Ocean. We also highlight the limitations of the tests used to diagnose T. gondii in stranded marine mammals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Here we report the emergence of this parasite in grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) in the Baltic Sea. One hundred eighty-three of 1 554 grey seals (11.9%) examined from 2002-2013 had detectable hepatobiliary trematode infection. Parasite identification was confirmed as P. truncatum by sequencing the ITS2 region of a pool of five to 10 trematodes from each of ten seals collected off the coast of seven different Swedish counties. The proportion of seals parasitized by P. truncatum increased significantly over time and with increasing age of seals. Males were 3.1 times more likely to be parasitized than females and animals killed in fishery interactions were less likely to be parasitized than animals found dead or hunted. There was no significant difference in parasitism of seals examined from the Gulf of Bothnia versus those examined from the Baltic Proper. Although the majority of infections were mild, P. truncatum can cause severe hepatobiliary disease and resulted in liver failure in at least one seal. Because cyprinid fish are the second intermediate host for opisthorchiid trematodes, diets of grey seals from the Baltic Sea were analysed regarding presence of cyprinids. The proportion of gastrointestinal tracts containing cyprinid remains was ten times higher in seals examined from 2008 to 2013 (12.2%) than those examined from 2002 to 2007 (1.2%) and coincided with a general increase of trematode parasitism in the host population. The emergence and relatively common occurrence of P. truncatum in grey seals signals the presence of this parasite in the Baltic Sea ecosystem and demonstrates how aquatic mammals can serve as excellent sentinels of marine ecosystem change. Investigation of drivers behind P. truncatum emergence and infection risk for other mammals, including humans, is highly warranted.

They are ubiquitous and can grow in hydrocarbon-polluted sites, Our aim is to determine the impact of chronic hydrocarbon contamination on the structure, activity, and functioning of a microbial mat. We compared it to an uncontaminated mat harboring similar geochemical characteristics. The mats were sampled in spring and fall for 2 years. Seasonal variations were observed for the reference mat: sulfur cycle-related bacteria dominated spring samples, while Cyanobacteria dominated in autumn. The contaminated mat showed minor seasonal variation; a progressive increase of Cyanobacteria was noticed, indicating a perturbation of the classical seasonal behavior. Hydrocarbon content was the main factor explaining the differences in the microbial community structure; however, hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria were among rare or transient Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) in the contaminated mat We suggest that in long-term contaminated systems, hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria cannot be considered a sentinel of contamination.

J	Crespo, M; Sole, M				Crespo, Marina; Sole, Montserrat			The use of juvenile Solea solea as sentinel in the marine platform of the Ebre Delta: in vitro interaction of emerging contaminants with the liver detoxification system	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Juveniles of Solea solea were sampled during the spring season in three consecutive years at a marine site by the mouth of the Ebre river. The aim was to assess if the extractive works from the toxic load upstream the river could be reflected on the health status of the fish living at the immediate sea. The biomarkers selected for the in vivo field study are commonly used as indicators of chemical exposures. They include activities of energy metabolism: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and citrate synthase (CS); neurotoxicity: cholinesterases (ChE); xenobiotic metabolism: cytochrome P450 (CYP)-dependent: EROD and BFCOD, carboxylesterase (CbE), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase (UDPGT); and oxidative stress parameters such as catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) as well as levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO). These biomarkers were mostly analysed in liver but also in gills and muscle depending on their particular tissue distribution and role. A complementary in vitro approach was also sought to see the capacity of common emerging contaminants (pharmaceuticals and personal care products; PPCPs) to interact with the liver microsomal detoxification system of the fish (EROD, BFCOD and CbE activities). The results indicated that in fish sampled in 2015 there was an enhancement in detoxification parameters (EROD, BFCOD and gill GR), muscular ChEs and gill CS, but a decrease in CbE activity and a marked oxidative stress situation (increased LPO and decreased CAT activity). Also, 4 out of the 10 PPCPs tested in vitro were able to interact with the CYP3A4 (BFCOD) enzymatic system while the lipid regulators simvastatin and fenofibrate inhibited CbE activity, as it occurs in higher vertebrates. The in vivo results support the use of a multibiomarker approach when assessing the disturbances due to chemical exposures, not only spatially but also over time, once the influence of other variables has been taken into consideration. The in vitro results highlight the importance of the CYP3A4 and CbE pathway in pharmaceutical metabolism, also in fish.

Ecotoxicological potential of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in marine organisms: Bioavailability, biomarkers and natural occurrence in Mytilus galloprovincialis	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH					18th International Symposium on Pollutant Responses in Marine Organisms (PRIMO)	MAY 24-27, 2015	Trondheim, NORWAY	Norwegian Res Council				Pharmaceuticals represent a major environmental concern since the knowledge on their occurrence, distribution and ecotoxicological potential is still limited particularly in coastal areas. In this study, bioaccumulation and cellular effects of various non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were investigated in mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis to reveal whether common molecules belonging to the same therapeutic class might cause different effects on non target organisms. Organisms exposed to environmental concentrations of acetaminophen (AMP), diclofenac (DIC), ibuprofen (IBU), ketoprofen (KET) and nimesulide (NIM) revealed a significant accumulation of DIC, IBU and NIM, while AMP and KET were always below detection limit. Nonetheless, for all tested NSAIDs, measurement of a large panel of ecotoxicological biomarkers highlighted impairment of immunological parameters, onset of genotoxicity and modulation of lipid metabolism, oxidative and neurotoxic effects. Laboratory results were integrated with a field study which provided the first evidence on the occurrence of DIC, IBU and NIM in tissues of wild mussels sampled during summer months from an unpolluted, touristic area of Central Adriatic Sea. Overall results demonstrated M. galloprovincialis as a good sentinel species for monitoring presence and ecotoxicological hazard of pharmaceuticals in the Mediterranean. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Relationships between lines of evidence of pollution in estuarine areas: Linking contaminant levels with biomarker responses in mussels and with structure of macroinvertebrate benthic communities	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH					18th International Symposium on Pollutant Responses in Marine Organisms (PRIMO)	MAY 24-27, 2015	Trondheim, NORWAY	Norwegian Res Council				Data obtained in a pollution survey performed in estuarine areas were integrated using multivariate statistics. The sites selected for the study were areas affected by treated and untreated urban discharges, harbours or industrial activities as well as reference sites. Mussels were transplanted to each site and after different times of exposure, samples of water, sediments and mussels were collected. Biomarkers were analysed on mussels after 3 and 21 days of transplant whereas concentrations of contaminants were measured in water, sediments and mussels after 21 days of transplant. The structure of macro invertebrate benthic communities was studied in sediment samples. Studied variables were organised into 5 datasets, each one constituting a line of evidence (LOE): contaminants in water, contaminants in sediments, contaminants accumulated by transplanted mussels, biomarkers in transplanted mussels and changes in the structure of macroinvertebrate benthic communities of each sampling site. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) identified the variables of each LOE best explaining variability among sites. In order to know how LOEs relate to each other., Pearson's correlations were performed. Contaminants in sediments were not correlated with the rest of LOEs. Contaminants in water were significantly correlated with contaminants and biomarkers in mussels and with structure of macroinvertebrate benthic communities. Similarly, significant correlations were found between contaminants and biomarkers in mussels and between biomarkers in mussels and structure of macroinvertebrate benthic communities. In conclusion, biomarker responses give relevant information on pollution in estuarine areas and provide a link between chemical and ecological statuses of water bodies in the context of the Water Framework Directive.

How cellular-level responses to metal pollution influence whole-organism and population-level traits is poorly understood. We tested whether exposure to single metals (zinc and cadmium) and to metal mixtures (water in equilibrium with sediment from a highly polluted lake) alters two ecologically-relevant traits in freshwater clams, locomotion and reproduction. Fingernail clams (Musculium spp.) from unimpacted habitats were exposed to single metals and the metal mixture for up to 49 days. The single metal doses (<= 5 mg/L Zn and <= 20 mu g/L Cd) were not toxicologically meaningful as clam survival, burial, and climbing activity did not differ across treatments. Water in equilibrium with the lake sediment contained cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc. Clams exposed to this metal mixture had decreased climbing activity but no change in burial activity. Metal-exposed clams had lower fecundity (number of shelled juveniles extruded by adult clams) and patterns in metal accumulation corresponded with lake sediment dose and clam activity. In contrast to the functional traits, stress protein expression and whole-clam glycogen content did not vary across treatment groups. These results indicate that fingernail clams of the genus Musculium are appropriate for development as sentinel species for metal pollution and can serve as a model for determining how metal pollution alters metabolic allocation patterns in freshwater organisms.

In view of reaching the Good Environmental Status of marine ecosystems, within this Directive the phyto-and zooplanktonic communities have received great attention, while Prokaryotes (Bacteria, Archaea, and Cyanobacteria) have been neglected. Indeed, the relevance of microbes (particularly of the faecal pollution indicators) as water quality indicators, the role that microorganisms play within the biogeochemical fluxes and in the whole ecosystem functioning, are all important features that deserve to be focused within the MSFD. The present study aims at reviewing the main issues where prokaryotic variables find useful application as descriptors of environmental status, trying to develop a panel of prokaryotic indicators suitable for the environmental quality assessment. From a survey of scientific literature and on field datasets, prokaryotic abundance and activities (enzymatic hydrolysis, prokaryotic production, and respiratory rates) are here chosen as early warning sentinels to detect changes in environmental quality, using an integrated approach with trophic (chlorophyll-a, particulate and dissolved organic matter) measurements.

Place-based conservation can be an effective tool for addressing threats to marine mammals, but this approach presents many challenges, such as the dilemma of whether to aim for protection at appropriately large scales or through networks of smaller protected areas, and how to address the socio-economic conditions of human societies whose welfare may conflict with marine mammal survival. 2. Protecting places to conserve marine mammals started about 50 years ago, when the first parks and reserves were established to protect the critical habitat of specific populations. However, the challenges of protecting habitats that cross national borders and span oceans including the high seas remain problematic. International cooperation is needed, e. g. within the framework of multilateral environmental agreements such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS), as well as a potential new agreement through the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). 3. Increasingly, the process of demarcating marine protected areas (MPAs) is being supported by other spatial designations, including CBD's ecological or biologically significant areas (EBSAs), the International Maritime Organization's particularly sensitive sea areas (PSSAs), IUCN's key biodiversity areas (KBAs), and biologically important areas (BIAs) adopted by the USA and Australia. Recently, the important marine mammal areas (IMMA) designation has been introduced by the IUCN Task Force on marine mammal protected areas. Such approaches have the potential to increase the protection of marine mammals within the overarching approach of systematic marine spatial planning. 4. Considering the attributes of marine mammals as sentinel, umbrella and flagship species, it is likely that emerging place-based approaches that incorporate IMMAs will not only benefit marine mammal populations, but also contribute more generally to the conservation of marine and aquatic species and ecosystems.

Blue sharks (Prionace glauca) as bioindicators of pollution and health in the Atlantic Ocean: Contamination levels and biochemical stress responses	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Marine ecosystems are constantly being threatened by contaminants produced by human activities. There is an urge to better understand their impacts on marine organisms and develop reliable tools for biomonitoring studies, while also assessing their potential impacts on human health. Given their position on top of food webs, sharks are particularly susceptible to bioaccumulation, making them potential sentinel species of marine contamination. The main objective of this study was to find suitable biomarkers for future marine pollution biomonitoring studies by correlating biochemical responses with tissue contaminant body burden in blue sharks (Prionace glauca), a species heavily caught and consumed by humans, while also addressing their general health. The chemical contaminants analysed comprised different persistent organic pollutants (POPS) families from polychlorinated compounds to brominaled flame retardants (BERN) and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) and different trace and heavy metals. Concentrations of some contaminants in sharks' tissues were found to be above the legally allowed limits for human consumption. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was performed and some strong associations were found between biochemical responses and contaminants' accumulation levels. DNA damage and lipid peroxidation levels, as well as the inhibition of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase, were the main effects and consequences of contamination. The impact of contamination on these vital macromolecules underlines the suboptimal conditions of the sampled P. glauca, which can ultimately lead to the degradation of core ecological aspects, such as swimming, feeding, and reproduction. It can be concluded that P. glauca demonstrates great potential to be used as environmental sentinel and suitable biomarker candidates were identified in this work. Moreover, this study also highlights the risks that the consumption of blue shark derived products can pose to human health, which is of upmost interest as the sampled organisms were still juveniles and already presented values above regulatory limits.

The present study aimed at assessing sub-lethal effects induced by a 7-day exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of CF (5, 50 and 500 ng/L) in the Mediterranean mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis. CF in water and mussel tissues, and a battery of biomarkers, including lysosomal parameters of general stress, oxidative stress responses and endpoints of neurological and genetic damages, were evaluated and tested for significance vs controls (p < 0.05). CF exposure triggered a significant decrease of lysosomal membrane stability in both haemocytes and digestive gland (at 50 and 500 ng/L CF) and a significant increase of lysosomal content of neutral lipids (at 500 ng/L CF), indicating the onset of a stress syndrome. No effects were noted on lipid peroxidation parameters, such as malondialdehyde and lipofuscin content. The activity of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione S-transferase (GST) and catalase was unmodified in gills, while a significant increase of GST activity was observed in digestive gland (at 5 and 500 ng/L CF), suggesting the occurrence of GST-mediated phase II detoxifying processes. CF did not induce geno/neurotoxicity, as shown by the lack of effects on primary DNA damages and acetylcholinesterase activity. In line with its high hydrophilicity, CF did not bioaccumulate in mussel tissues. Data were integrated using the Mussel Expert System, which assigned a low stress level to mussels exposed to 500 ng/L CF, whereas no alterations of animal health status were highlighted at lower dosages. This study revealed a low profile of toxicity for environmental concentrations of CF, and confirmed the suitability of an integrated biomarker-based approach to provide a comprehensive picture of the degree of stress induced by emerging contaminants in marine invertebrates.

J	Johnson, KM; Hofmann, GE				Johnson, Kevin M.; Hofmann, Gretchen E.			A transcriptome resource for the Antarctic pteropod Limacina helicina antarctica	MARINE GENOMICS												The pteropod Limacina helicina antarctica is a dominant member of the zooplankton assemblage in the Antarctic marine ecosystem, and is part of a relatively simple food web in nearshore marine Antarctic waters. As a shelled pteropod, Limacina has been suggested as a candidate sentinel organism for the impacts of ocean acidification, due to the potential for shell dissolution in undersaturated waters. In this study, our goal was to develop a transcriptomic resource for Limacina that would support mechanistic studies to explore the physiological response of Limacina to abiotic stressors such as ocean acidification and ocean warming. To this end, RNA sequencing libraries were prepared from Limacina that had been exposed to a range of pH levels and an elevated temperature to maximize the diversity of expressed genes. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was conducted on an Illumina NextSeq500 which produced 339,000,000150 bp paired-end reads. The de novo transcriptome was produced using Trinity and annotation of the assembled transcriptome resulted in the identification of 81,229 transcripts in 137 KEGG pathways. This RNA-seq effort resulted in a transcriptome for the Antarctic pteropod, Limacina helicina antarctica, that is a major resource for an international marine science research community studying these pelagic molluscs in a global change context.

K.			Coastal development and precipitation drive pathogen flow from land to sea: evidence from a Toxoplasma gondii and felid host system	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Rapidly developing coastal regions face consequences of land use and climate change including flooding and increased sediment, nutrient, and chemical runoff, but these forces may also enhance pathogen runoff, which threatens human, animal, and ecosystem health. Using the zoonotic parasite Toxoplasma gondii in California, USA as a model for coastal pathogen pollution, we examine the spatial distribution of parasite runoff and the impacts of precipitation and development on projected pathogen delivery to the ocean. Oocysts, the extremely hardy free-living environmental stage of T. gondii shed in faeces of domestic and wild felids, are carried to the ocean by freshwater runoff. Linking spatial pathogen loading and transport models, we show that watersheds with the highest levels of oocyst runoff align closely with regions of increased sentinel marine mammal T. gondii infection. These watersheds are characterized by higher levels of coastal development and larger domestic cat populations. Increases in coastal development and precipitation independently raised oocyst delivery to the ocean (average increases of 44% and 79%, respectively), but dramatically increased parasite runoff when combined (175% average increase). Anthropogenic changes in landscapes and climate can accelerate runoff of diverse pathogens from terrestrial to aquatic environments, influencing transmission to people, domestic animals, and wildlife.

Clams in the spilled sites displayed unusually high proportion of granulocytes, which may result in higher phagocytosis capacity and reactive oxygen species production. Hemocytes in clams from the polluted sites also displayed less DNA damage and mortality than in the control site, possibly due to a faster phagocytosis of the impaired cells. Glycogen, the major energetic reserve, was depleted in clams from the spilled sites, potentially due to energetic consumption for maintenance of a large pool of granulocytes, detoxification processes and oxidative stress. Modified hemocyte parameters in clams in the spilled area, may reflect sub-lethal physiological stresses caused by the residual oils in the sediment, in conjunction with environmental modifications such as food availability and pathogens pattern.

J	Filipkowska, A; Lubecki, L				Filipkowska, Anna; Lubecki, Ludwik			Endocrine disruptors in blue mussels and sediments from the Gulf of GdaA"sk (Southern Baltic)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Samples of blue mussel (Mytilus trossulus) and sediment were collected in the Gulf of GdaA"sk (Southern Baltic Sea) to assess the extent of their contamination with two groups of endocrine disruptors: 4-nonylphenols and organotins (butyl- and phenyltins). Five sampling stations were chosen along the coastline of the Tricity Agglomeration (GdaA"sk, Sopot, Gdynia) in 2008, 2012, and 2013. No evident differences between the three campaigns were found in either the mussel or the sediment samples. The mussels were moderately contaminated with 4-nonylphenols (30-111 ng g(-1) d.w.), whereas the levels of these compounds in the sediment samples were very low (0.8-2.7 ng g(-1) d.w.). Total concentrations of butyltin compounds in the mussels and sediments ranged between 41 and 164 ng Sn g(-1) d.w., and from below the limit of detection to 22 ng Sn g(-1) d.w., respectively, whereas phenyltins were not detected in any of the samples. Butyltin degradation indices indicate an old tributyltin input into the coastal environment, which is characterized by intense maritime activity. The results obtained from this work demonstrate that 5 years after the total ban on using organotin-based antifouling paints was imposed, butyltins are still present in mussels and sediments of the Gulf of GdaA"sk.

Thus, they provide valuable information not only about the chemical conditions of their and their hosts' environment but also deliver insights into the biological availability of allochthonous substances. While a large number of different freshwater parasites (mainly acanthocephalans and cestodes) were investigated in terms of pollutant bioaccumulation, studies based on marine host-parasites systems remain scarce. However, available data show that different marine parasite taxa such as nematodes, cestodes and acanthocephalans exhibit also an excellent metal accumulation capacity. The biological availability of metals and their uptake routes in marine biota and parasites differ from those of freshwater organisms. We assume that a large part of metals and other pollutants are also taken up via the digestive system of the host. Therefore, in addition to environmental conditions the physiology of the host also plays an important role for the accumulation process. Additionally, we highlight some advantages in using parasites as accumulation indicators in marine ecosystems. As parasites occur ubiquitously in marine food webs, the monitoring of metals in their tissues can deliver information about the spatial and trophic distribution of pollutants. Accordingly, parasites as indicators offer an ecological assessment on a broader scale, in contrast to established free-living marine indicators, which are mostly benthic invertebrates and therefore limited in habitat distribution. Globally distributed parasite taxa, which are highly abundant in a large number of host species, are suggested as worldwide applicable sentinels.

J	Moschino, V; Da Ros, L				Moschino, Vanessa; Da Ros, Luisa			Biochemical and lysosomal biomarkers in the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis from the Mar Piccolo of Taranto (Ionian Sea, Southern Italy)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Biomarkers are internationally recognized as useful tools in marine coastal biomonitoring, in particular, as early-warning signals at the level of individual organisms to assess biological effects of pollutants and other stressors. In the present study, Mytilus galloprovincialis has been employed as a sentinel organism to assess biological pollution effects in the Mar Piccolo of Taranto (Southern Italy), a coastal lagoon divided into two small inlets, connected to the open sea through one natural and one artificial narrow openings. Mussels were collected in June 2013 at three sites located within each of the two inlets of the Mar Piccolo. Biological effects were investigated through a suite of biomarkers suitable to reflect effects and/or exposure to contaminants at biochemical and cellular levels. Biochemical biomarkers included glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme activities; as histochemical biomarkers, lysosomal membrane stability, lipofuscin and neutral lipid accumulation, and lysosomal structural changes were considered. As a whole, results highlighted differences among the three study sites, particularly for GST, AChE, and lipofuscins, which are consistent with the variations of the chemical pollutants in sediments. The applied biomarkers showed that a stress syndrome likely to be ascribed to environmental pollutants is occurring in mussels living in the Mar Piccolo of Taranto, in particular, the ones inhabiting the first inlet.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUL	2016	23	13					12770	12776		10.1007/s11356-015-4929-1								WOS:000378817300020	26160119

Loren; Katsiadaki, Ioanna			The ninespine stickleback as a model organism in arctic ecotoxicology	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH												Background: The Arctic is subject to atmospheric deposition of persistent organic pollutants through the process of global distillation. It also contains thousands of sites with local sources of contamination, including military installations, mining operations, and petroleum extraction facilities. Pollutants accumulate in surface waters. Aim: To investigate the utility of ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) as a sentinel fish species to monitor the presence and biological effects of chemical contamination in the Arctic. Organism: Pungitius pungitius is a circumpolar species that occurs in freshwater, brackish water, and marine habitats. It is often the most abundant fish present. It appears to be relatively hardy with respect to potentially lethal effects of contaminants, which allows investigation of perturbed biological processes such as endocrine, gene expression, and developmental disruption. Biomarker development: We developed a homologous vitellogenin assay for the ninespine stickleback to assess the presence of estrogen-modulating contaminants in surveys of arctic contaminated sites. We also validated a thyroxine (T4) assay for the ninespine stickleback to enable investigations of thyroid-disrupting contaminants. We review recent work that demonstrates the efficacy of transcriptional profiling to identify disrupted gene networks by finding functionally related groups of genes that are up- or down-regulated due to contaminant exposure. Results and conclusions: We collected spatially explicit contaminated site data for the Arctic and found that more contaminated sites lie within the distribution of the ninespine stickleback than within that of the threespine stickleback. This biogeographic advantage combined with a suite of biomonitoring tools makes the ninespine stickleback a suitable model organism for studying contaminants in marine, brackish, and fresh waters throughout the Arctic.

In the present study, we evaluated the level of contamination of the invasive Indo-Pacific lionfish, Pterois volitans, all around the island. Concentrations of chlordecone varied from 3 to 144 mu g.kg(-1) wet weight. The highest concentrations were recorded when samples were captured in the marine zones located downstream of the previous banana plantations. This contamination seemed to decrease rapidly with the distance from the coast. Mean concentration of chlordecone in Pterois volitans was higher than that of five other fish species collected in similar sites. Due to its position at the top of the trophic web, lion fish was affected by bioaccumulation of chlordecone and can be used as a sentinel species to assess and control the level of contamination of the marine environment by chlordecone.

MARINE POLICY												Seeing the ocean through the eyes of seabirds could help meet the challenges of managing common-pool marine resources both in protected and unprotected areas. First, seabirds are top-predators, exposed to all threats affecting the oceans, and this makes them ideal sentinel organisms for monitoring changes within marine ecosystems. Second, seabirds cross both ecological and political boundaries, and following their movements should help making interdependencies within and between marine ecosystems more visible. Third, seabirds are conspicuous and often charismatic animals, which interact differently with different groups of stakeholders and provide the opportunity to acknowledge and discuss each other's values and interests. In this paper, we present these research avenues using a seabirds' view, for tackling marine conservation and management issues, and we give operational examples of implementation based on our work in the English Channel.

Use of the Atlantic nut clam (Nucula proxima) and catworm (Nephtys incisa) in a sentinel species approach for monitoring the health of Bay of Fundy estuaries	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Designing an effective environmental monitoring system for population responses requires knowledge of the biology of appropriate sentinel species and baseline information on the area's physical and chemical characteristics. This study collected information in Saint John Harbor, NB, Canada, for two abundant marine benthic invertebrates, the Atlantic nut clam (Nucula proximo!) and the catworm (Nephtys incisa) to characterize their seasonal and spatial variability, determine the ideal sampling time and methods, and develop baseline data for future studies. We also evaluated whether contamination is impacting invertebrates by comparing sediment metal concentrations to responses of benthic infauna. Metals were generally below sediment quality guidelines except for nickel and arsenic. Clam densities were variable between sites but not seasons, whereas catworm densities were not significantly different between sites or seasons. Overall, these species show potential for environmental monitoring, although investigation at more contaminated sites is warranted to assess their sensitivity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Assessment of their foraging habits was examined based on the isotopic analysis of pups (maternal indicators) (SIAR/SIBER-R). Environmental variability between 2014 and 2015 was also analyzed, in terms of sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll (Chl-a) concentration. Both otariids reached their highest abundance in July of both years; however, relative to 2014, the 2015 survey showed a 59.7% decline in the total GFS abundance and a 42.9% decrease of GFS pups, while total CSL abundance decreased 52.0% and CSL pup presence decreased in 61.7%. All monthly surveys for both otariids showed a similar trend (>50% decrease in 2015). Compared to 2014, the 2015 GFSs isotopic niche was three times larger (2.0 in 2015, 0.6 in 2014) and the delta C-13 was significantly lower. CSLs also showed significantly lower d13C and higher delta N-15 in 2015. Interannual segregation was greater for CSLs, and their pup body mass was also significantly lower during the 2015 breeding season (mean = 8.7 kg) than in the same season of 2014 (mean = 9.9 kg). The decrease in d13C for both otariids reflected a more oceanic foraging; most likely associated with the decline in primary productivity in surrounding areas to the SBA, related to a higher SST caused by the 2015 ENSO, with a subsequent increase in foraging effort. These would explain the fewer observed individuals on land, especially pups, which showed diminished body condition (CSLs). This study highlights the importance of marine mammals as sentinel species that respond dynamically to changes in environment, providing valuable information on the effect of ENSO on pinnipeds in Mexican waters.																	1932-6203					MAY 12	2016	11	5							e0155034	10.1371/journal.pone.0155034								WOS:000376588600070	27171473

To date, neither risk factors associated with marine contamination nor the route of S. neurona infection to marine mammals has been described. This study evaluated coastal S. neurona contamination using California mussels (Mytilus californianus) as sentinels for pathogen pollution. A field investigation was designed to test the hypotheses that (1) mussels can serve as sentinels for S. neurona contamination, and (2) S. neurona contamination in mussels would be highest during the rainy season and in mussels collected near freshwater. Initial validation of molecular assays through sporocyst spiking experiments revealed the ITS-1500 assay to be most sensitive for detection of S. neurona, consistently yielding parasite amplification at concentrations. 5 sporocysts/1 mL mussel haemolymph. Assays were then applied on 959 wild-caught mussels, with detection of S. neurona confirmed using sequence analysis in three mussels. Validated molecular assays for S. neurona detection in mussels provide a novel toolset for investigating marine contamination with this parasite, while confirmation of S. neurona in wild mussels suggests that uptake by invertebrates may serve as a route of transmission to susceptible marine animals.																	0031-1820	1469-8161				MAY	2016	143	6					762	769		10.1017/S0031182016000354								WOS:000376783000010	27003262					
J	Magesky, A; Ribeiro, CAO; Pelletier, E				Magesky, Adriano; Oliveiro Ribeiro, Ciro A.; Pelletier, Emilien			Physiological effects and cellular responses of metamorphic larvae and juveniles of sea urchin exposed to ionic and nanoparticulate silver	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												The widespread use of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) would likely result in their discharge into wastewater and inevitable release in densely populated coastal areas. It is known that AgNPs can cause harmful effects to marine fauna, but how they affect development stages is still an open question. In order to understand in details how polymer-coated AgNPs (PAAm-AgNPs) (from 0.19 to 4.64 mM as Ag) can affect critical stages of marine invertebrate development, metamorphic larvae and juveniles of sea urchins were used as biological models. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) approach based on Bray-Curtis similarity matrix with PERMANOVA showed organisms in a multivariate space undergoing through different physiological conditions as a function of time, chemical forms of silver, nominal concentrations, and presence or absence of food. Sublethal effects such as lethargy, oedema and immobility mainly characterized PAAm-AgNPs effects with juveniles and postlarvae, whereas necrosis and death arose in Ag+ conditions in short-term tests. Chronically exposed metamorphic larvae had their morphogenic processes interrupted by PAAm-AgNPs and a high mortality rate was observed in recovery period. On the contrary, Ag+ ions caused progressive mortality during exposure, but a quick recovery in uncontaminated seawater was observed. By means of fluorescent markers we showed that nanosilver could be transferred between consecutive stages (swimming larvae and postlarvae) and highlighted how important is food to enhance PAAm-AgNPs uptake. Using TEM we observed that unfed juveniles had nanosilver aggregates mostly restricted to their coelomic sinuses, while metamorphic larvae already had nano-contamination overspread in different tissues and blastocoel. Our main hypothesis for nanotoxicity of PAAM-AgNPs relies on the slow dissolution of nano-core over time, but in this study the effects of particulate silver form itself are also evoked. Main mechanisms governing tissular and cellular responses to nano-intoxication such as inflammatory response and detoxification based on the role of sentinel cells (peritoneal cells and coelomocytes) for general homeostasis are discussed. This paper is first to detail physiological states, main uptake routes and cellular response against polymer-coated AgNPs in developmental stages of marine invertebrate species.

The associated algorithms were generally site specific or developed over a relatively narrow range of concentration, which make them inappropriate for global applications (or at least over broad SPM range). In the frame of the GlobCoast project, a large in situ data set of SPM and remote sensing reflectance, R-rs(lambda), has been built gathering together measurements from various coastal areas around Europe, French Guiana, North Canada, Vietnam, and China. This data set covers various contrasting coastal environments diversely affected by different biogeochemical and physical processes such as sediment resuspension, phytoplankton bloom events, and rivers discharges (Amazon, Mekong, Yellow river, MacKenzie, etc.). The SPM concentration spans about four orders of magnitude, from 0.15 to 2626 g center dot m(-3). Different empirical and semi-analytical approaches developed to assess SPM from R-rs(lambda) were tested over this in situ data set. As none of them provides satisfactory results over the whole SPM range, a generic semi-analytical approach has been developed. This algorithm is based on two standard semi-analytical equations calibrated for low-to-medium and highly turbid waters, respectively. A mixing law has also been developed for intermediate environments. Sources of uncertainties in SPM retrieval such as the bio-optical variability, atmospheric correction errors, and spectral bandwidth have been evaluated. The coefficients involved in these different algorithms have been calculated for ocean color (SeaWiFS, MODIS-A/T, MERIS/OLCI, VIIRS) and high spatial resolution (LandSat8-OLI, and Sentinel2-MSI) sensors. The performance of the proposed algorithm varies only slightly from one sensor to another demonstrating the great potential applicability of the proposed approach over global and contrasting coastal waters.

Salmonella infection in grey seals (Halichoerus grypus), a marine mammal sentinel species: pathogenicity and molecular typing of Salmonella strains compared with human and livestock isolates	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Microbial pollution of the marine environment through land-sea transfer of human and livestock pathogens is of concern. Salmonella was isolated from rectal swabs of free-ranging and stranded grey seal pups (21.1%; 37/175) and compared with strains from the same serovars isolated from human clinical cases, livestock, wild mammals and birds in Scotland, UK to characterize possible transmission routes using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multi-locus variable number of tandem repeat analyses. A higher prevalence of Salmonella was found in pups exposed to seawater, suggesting that this may represent a source of this pathogen. Salmonella Bovismorbificans was the most common isolate (18.3% pups; 32/175) and was indistinguishable from isolates found in Scottish cattle. SalmonellaTyphimurium was infrequent (2.3% pups; 4/175), mostly similar to isolates found in garden birds and, in one case, identical to a highly multidrug resistant strain isolated from a human child. SalmonellaHaifa was rare (1.1% pups; 2/175), but isolates were indistinguishable from that of a human clinical isolate. These results suggest that S.

J	Duran, C; Medina-Sanchez, JM; Herrera, G; Carrillo, P				Duran, Cristina; Manuel Medina-Sanchez, Juan; Herrera, Guillermo; Carrillo, Presentacion			Changes in the phytoplankton-bacteria coupling triggered by joint action of UVR, nutrients, and warming in Mediterranean high-mountain lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												From an extensive study, we determined that heterotrophic bacterial production (HBP) variance in Sierra Nevada (Spain) lakes was explained mainly by excretion of organic carbon by algae (EOC), underlining a bacterial dependence on algal carbon. Subsequently, we studied how the interaction among global change factors such as ultraviolet radiation (UVR), nutrient inputs, and increased temperature affected this phytoplankton-bacteria coupling through in situ factorial experiments in two model high-mountain lakes, La Caldera, and Las Yeguas. Bacterioplankton were more sensitive than phytoplankton because the joint action of increased temperature and nutrient-addition unmasked an inhibitory UVR effect on HBP while reducing the inhibitory UVR effect on primary production (PP) (in La Caldera) or augmenting the net PP values (in Las Yeguas). The interaction among the three factors had a different effect on phytoplankton-bacteria coupling depending on the lake. Thus, in the colder lake (La Caldera), EOC was not adequate to meet the bacterial carbon demand (BCD), leading to a mismatch in phytoplankton-bacteria coupling. Contrarily, in the warmer lake (Las Yeguas), the phytoplankton-bacteria coupling was accentuated by the interaction among the three factors, with EOC exceeding BCD. These contrasting responses of phytoplankton-bacteria coupling may affect the microbial loop development, becoming reinforced in warmer and less UVR-transparent high-mountain lakes, but weakened in colder and more UVR-transparent high-mountain lakes, with implications in the C-flux of these sentinel ecosystems in a scenario of global change.

The concentrations of 12 Metallic Trace Elements (MTEs), 16 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), 7 PolyChlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), and 3 organotin derivatives were measured in 7 marine sponges collected in the Etel River (South Brittany, France). Results indicated Al, Co, Cr, Fe, Pb, and Ti particularly accumulated in marine sponges such as Hymeniacidon perlevis and Raspailia ramosa at higher levels compared to oysters. At the opposite, Cu and Zn accumulated significantly at higher concentrations in oysters. Among PAHs analyzed, benzo(a)pyrene bioaccumulated in H. perlevis at levels up to 17-fold higher than in oysters. In contrast, PCBs bioaccumulated preferentially in oysters. Significant differences exist in the abilities of marine phyla and sponge species to accumulate organic and metallic pollutants however, among the few sponge species studied, H. perlevis showed impressive bioaccumulation properties. The use of this species as bioindicator and/or bioremediator near shellfish farming areas is also discussed.																	1093-4529	1532-4117				FEB 23	2016	51	3					213	219		10.1080/10934529.2015.1094327								WOS:000367389600003	26634290

Using Domestic and Free-Ranging Arctic Canid Models for Environmental Molecular Toxicology Research	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The use of sentinel species for population and ecosystem health assessments has been advocated as part of a One Health perspective. The Arctic is experiencing rapid change, including climate and environmental shifts, as well as increased resource development, which will alter exposure of biota to environmental agents of disease. Arctic canid species have wide geographic ranges and feeding ecologies and are often exposed to high concentrations of both terrestrial and marine based contaminants. The domestic dog (Canis lupus farniliaris) has been used in biomedical research for a number of years and has been advocated as a sentinel for human health due to its proximity to humans and, in some instances, similar diet. Exploiting the potential of molecular tools for describing the toxicogenomics of Arctic canids is critical for their development as biomedical models as well as environmental sentinels. Here, we present three approaches analyzing toxicogenomics of Arctic contaminants in both domestic and free-ranging canids (Arctic fox, Vulpes lagopus). We describe a number of confounding variables that must be addressed when conducting toxicogenomics studies in canid and other mammalian models. The ability for canids to act as models for Arctic molecular toxicology research is unique and significant for advancing our understanding and expanding the tool box for assessing the changing landscape of environmental agents of disease in the Arctic.

Modeling Cs-137 bioaccumulation in the salmon-resident killer whale food web of the Northeastern Pacific following the Fukushima Nuclear Accident	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												To track the long term bioaccumulation of Cs-137 in marine organisms off the Pacific Northwest coast of Canada, we developed a time dependent bioaccumulation model for Cs-137 in a marine mammalian food web that included fish-eating resident killer whales. The model outcomes show that Cs-137 can be expected to gradually bioaccumulate in the food web over time as demonstrated by the increase of the apparent trophic magnification factor of Cs-137, ranging from 0.76 after 1 month of exposure to 2.0 following 30 years of exposure. Cs-137 bioaccumulation is driven by relatively rapid dietary uptake rates, moderate depuration rates in lower trophic level organisms and slow elimination rates in high trophic level organisms. Model estimates of the Cs-137 activity in species of the food web, based on current measurements and forecasts of Cs-137 activities in oceanic waters and sediments off the Canadian Pacific Northwest, indicate that the long term Cs-137 activities in fish species including Pacific herring, wild Pacific salmon, sablefish and halibut will remain well below the current Cs-137-Canada Action Level for consumption (1000 Bq/kg) following a nuclear emergency. Killer whales and Pacific salmon are expected to exhibit the largest long term Cs-137 activities and may be good sentinels for monitoring Cs-137 in the region. Assessment of the long term consequences of Cs-137 releases from the Fukushima aftermath should consider the extent of ecological magnification in addition to ocean dilution. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Assessing Disease and Mortality among Small Cetaceans Stranded at a World Heritage Site in Southern Brazil	PLOS ONE												Cetaceans are considered environmental sentinels and their health often reflects either anthropogenic or natural spatio-temporal disturbances. This study investigated the pathological findings and mortality of small cetaceans with the aim of detecting hazards and monitoring health trends in a high-biodiversity area. Between 2007 and 2012, 218 stranded cetaceans were recorded on the Parana coast, southern Brazil. Fifty-seven (26.1%) of these animals, including 50 Sotalia guianensis, 2 Pontoporia blainvillei, 2 Stenella frontalis, 1 Stenella longirostris, 1 Tursiops truncatus and 1 Globicephala melas were necropsied and samples were collected for histopathology. Causes of death were determined in 46 of the 57 (80.7%) animals and most (30 or 65.2%) were ascribed to anthropogenic activities, including fisheries bycatch (28/30) and trauma (2/30). The remaining 16 fatalities were considered natural, and attributed to pneumonia (10/16), emaciation (3/16), septicemia (1/16), neonatal pathology (1/16) and choking via food obstruction (1/16). Irrespective of the cause, bronchointerstitial pneumonia, associated with parasitism, lymphadenitis and membranous glomerulonephritis were common findings among all fatalities. These results suggest, that while anthropogenic activities are a leading cause of cetacean strandings in Parana, underlying pre-existing diseases may contribute towards deaths. Although the studied area is considered a biosphere reserve by UNESCO, complex anthropogenic and natural interactions might be occurring, increasing cetacean susceptibility to hazards. This study may help facilitate developing an effective conservation plan for coastal cetaceans focusing on reducing fisheries interactions, habitat degradation and pollution as mechanisms for ultimately increasing species resilience.

J	Rabouille, S; Claquin, P				Rabouille, Sophie; Claquin, Pascal			Photosystem-II shutdown evolved with Nitrogen fixation in the unicellular diazotroph Crocosphaera watsonii	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Protection of nitrogenase from oxygen in unicellular Cyanobacteria is obtained by temporal separation of photosynthesis and diazotrophy through transcriptional and translational regulations of nitrogenase. But diazotrophs can face environmental situations in which N-2 fixation occurs significantly in the light, and we believe that another control operates to make it possible. The night-time shutdown of PSII activity is a peculiar behaviour that discriminates Crocosphaera watsoniiWH8501 from any other phototroph, whether prokaryote or eukaryote. This phenomenon is not only due to the plastoquinone pool redox status, and suggests that the sentinel D1 protein, expressed in periods of nitrogen fixation, is inactive. Results demonstrate a tight constraint of oxygen evolution in C.watsonii as additional protection of nitrogenase activity and suggest a possible recycling of cellular components.

Mercury-induced genotoxicity in marine diatom (Chaetoceros tenuissimus)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												In this paper, we present an evaluation of genotoxic responses in marine diatom, Chaetoceros tenuissimus, isolated from Kandla Creek (lat 23.03A degrees N, long 70.22A degrees E), Gujarat, India, in terms of impairment of DNA integrity as a function of their exposure to elevated levels of mercury (Hg) under laboratory conditions. DNA integrity in C. tenuissimus was determined by partial alkaline unwinding assay. To our knowledge, this is the first such genotoxicity study to be conducted on marine diatom cultures towards understanding the relationship between Hg toxicity and DNA damage. Furthermore, we studied the impact of Hg on the growth of C. tenuissimus as a function of their exposure to enhanced levels of Hg in terms of decreasing chlorophyll a (chl a) concentrations. The data show the genotoxic effect of Hg on the growth of C. tenuissimus as well as DNA integrity to a great extent. Based on the results of our investigations, it is suggested that C. tenuissimus can be used as sentinel species for bio-monitoring of pollution due to genotoxic contaminants.

Regular monitoring of these areas is essential to assess and mitigate threats from development including construction, mining, and commercial trawling. While bathymetry alone may be insufficient to detect submerged palaeolandscape features, it can nonetheless recognize previously mapped structures that have a topographic expression. The Sentinel-1 constellation will provide unprecedented access to freely available, high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, acquired systematically and with long-term continuity, and may constitute a cost-effective solution for the monitoring of submerged palaeolandscapes. The article shows the application of a recently developed bathymetric algorithm to Sentinel-1 SAR data over a region of the southern North Sea. Results show general agreement with water depth data obtained from the European Marine Observation and Data Network portal for bathymetry (EMODnet). To assess the support that SAR bathymetry can provide to the analysis of submerged palaeolandscapes, the Sentinel-1-derived water depths were compared to a palaeolandscape map of the same area produced by the North Sea Palaeolandscapes Project (NSPP). Results show a clear correspondence between certain topographic structures identified in the Sentinel-1 water depth map and features interpreted by the NSPP as early Holocene lakes, rivers, and landscape topography.																	0143-1161	1366-5901				FEB	2016	37	3					471	491		10.1080/01431161.2015.1129563								WOS:000368723800001

Behavioral responses such as changes in swimming patterns of small aquatic invertebrates are emerging as sensitive endpoints to monitor aquatic pollution. Although behavioral responses do not deliver information on an exact type or the intensity of toxicants present in water samples, they could provide orders of magnitude higher sensitivity than lethal endpoints such as mortality. Despite the advantages of behavioral biotests performed on sentinel organisms, their wider application in real-time and near realtime biomonitoring of water quality is limited by the lack of dedicated and automated video-microscopy systems. Current behavioral analysis systems rely mostly on static test conditions and manual procedures that are time-consuming and labor intensive. Tracking and precise quantification of locomotory activities of multiple small aquatic organisms requires high-resolution optical data recording. This is often problematic due to small size of fast moving animals and limitations of culture vessels that are not specially designed for video data recording. In this work, we capitalized on recent advances in miniaturized CMOS cameras, high resolution optics and biomicrofluidic technologies to develop near real-time water quality sensing using locomotory activities of small marine invertebrates. We present proof-of-concept integration of high-resolution time-resolved video recording system and high-throughput miniaturized perfusion biomicrofluidic platform for optical tracking of nauplii of marine crustacean Artemia franciscana. Preliminary data demonstrate that Artemia sp. exhibits rapid alterations of swimming patterns in response to toxicant exposure. The combination of video-microscopy and biomicrofluidic platform facilitated straightforward recording of fast moving objects. We envisage that prospectively such system can be scaled up to perform high-throughput water quality sensing in a robotic biomonitoring facility.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0435-3				2016	10013								UNSP 100131R	10.1117/12.2242826								WOS:000394526200024

These images are used, among other purposes, for monitoring coastal and marine waters pollution where oil floating on the surface becomes visible because it damps the short gravity-capillary waves that are responsible for the radar backscattering [14]. Nowadays an important number of SAR images are available and this number will increase in coming years thanks the launch of Cosmo-Skymed 2nd generation, recent availability of Sentinel-1, ALOS Palsar-2 products and future SAOCOM launch. That will provide information suitable to support decision makers in managing emergencies or potential disasters. The present study show the results obtained from 190 regions of interest extracted from a set of X, C and L Band images, where a database related to spatial, textural, spectral and contextual characteristics of the features detected was ingested into a neural network algorithm. The classification process reached percentages of up to 95% of cases of oil spills and look-alikes correctly classified depending on the wavelength, the polarization and incidence angle.																	2153-6996		978-1-5090-3332-4				2016							7715	7717										WOS:000388114607132

Currently under Phase D (manufacturing phase), the launch is now planned for mid-2018 the later. The CFOSAT will carry two payloads, both Ku-Band radar: the wave scatterometer (SWIM) and the wind scatterometer (SCAT). Both instruments are based on new concepts with respect to existing satellite-borne wind and wave sensors. Indeed, one of the originalities of CFOSAT is that it will provide simultaneously and in the same zone, the directional spectra of ocean waves and the wind vector. The concept used to measure the directional spectra of ocean waves has never been used from space until now: it is based on a near-nadir incidence pointing, rotating fan-beam radar, used in a real-aperture mode. In this paper we present the CFOSAT mission, its objectives and main characteristics. We then focus on the SWIM instrument, the expected geophysical products and performances. Finally, we present ongoing studies based on existing satellite data of directional spectra of ocean waves (Sentinel-1,..) and carried out in preparation to CAL/VAL activities and to future data exploitation.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0119-2				2016	9878								UNSP 98780T	10.1117/12.2225619								WOS:000389774100017

The observations are measured by geostationary and sun-synchronous polar orbiting satellites in the frame of mandatory programmes. In the frame of optional programmes further observations for altimetry and oceanography are collected and disseminated. In the frame of third party programmes, EUMETSAT makes available data from other agencies' satellites to the user community. Since summer 2015 MSG-4 complements the current operational fleet of operational geostationary spacecraft, Meteosat-7, which is the last satellite of the first generation and the three satellites of the Second Generation of Meteosat, Meteosat-8, Meteosat-9 and Meteosat-10. MSG-4 became Meteosat-11 and was stored in orbit after successful commissioning. Two satellites of the EUMETSAT Polar System (EPS) provide data from sun-synchronous polar orbit. Metop-B, the second of a series of three satellites, launched in September 2012 and Metop-A, the first of the series, in orbit since October 2006 provide operational services. The satellites belong to the Initial Joint Polar System (IJPS) with the US. EUMETSAT's first optional programme continues to provide data from the Jason-2 satellite since summer 2008. As follow on the Jason-3 satellite was launched in January 2016 and is currently in commissioning. To assure continuity development of Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) is ongoing. The EPS-SG programme was fully approved in summer 2015. In the frame of the Copernicus Programme (formerly GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security)) EUMETSAT will operate the marine part of the Sentinel-3 satellite. It was launched in February 2016 and is currently under commissioning.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0335-6; 978-1-5106-0336-3				2016	9972								UNSP 997216	10.1117/12.2236201								WOS:000389369500036

Temporal shift in the isotopic niche of female Antarctic fur seals from Bouvetoya	POLAR RESEARCH												The Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) is a key marine predator in the Southern Ocean, a region that has recently started to show changes as a result of global climate change. Here, carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope analyses on whole blood and plasma samples were used to examine the isotopic niche of lactating female Antarctic fur seals. Using recently developed Bayesian approaches to determine changes in isotopic niche, a significant increase in delta C-13 and delta N-15 was found between 1997 and 2015; this change occurred at an average rate of 0.067%0 (delta C-13) and 0.072%0 (delta N-15) per year over this period. This suggests that a marked isotopic niche shift has occurred over this period, which very likely corresponds to a shift in diet towards prey at a higher trophic level, such as fish (replacing krill). Although our sampling design prevented us from exploring a seasonal trend in a conclusive manner, our data suggest that concurrent increases in delta C-13 and delta N-15 might occur as the breeding season progresses. At a seasonal scale, an average decrease of 0.7 parts per thousand per month (95% confidence interval = [0.9; 0.6]) in delta C-13 might have occurred, concurrently with an average increase of 1.1% per month in delta N-15. The results of this study constitute the first isotopic assessment for female Antarctic fur seals from Bouvetoya and provide a baseline for the use of this predator species as a sentinel of the marine trophic system in one of the least studied areas within this species' distributional range.																	0800-0395	1751-8369					2016	35								UNSP 31335	10.3402/polar.v35.31335								WOS:000387183400001

However, the current algorithms and methods usually fail on optically complex waters like coastal and inland waters. The whole Baltic Sea can be considered as optically complex coastal waters. Remote assessment of water quality parameters (eg., chlorophyll-a concentration) is of interest for monitoring of marine environment, but hasn't been used as a routine approach in Latvia. In this study, two simultaneous hyperspectral airborne data and in situ measurement campaigns were performed in the Gulf of Riga near the River Daugava mouth in summer 2015 to simulate Sentinel-3 data and test existing algorithms for retrieval of Level 2 Water products. Comparison of historical data showed poor overall correlation between in situ measurements and MERIS chlorophyll-a data products. Better correlation between spectral chl-a data products and in situ water sampling measurements was achieved during simultaneous airborne and field campaign resulting in R-2 up to 0.94 for field spectral data, R-2 of 0.78 for airborne data. Test of all two band ratio combinations showed that R-2 could be improved from 0.63 to 0.94 for hyperspectral airborne data choosing 712 and 728 nm bands instead of 709 and 666 nm, and R-2 could be improved from 0.61 to 0.83 for simulated Sentinel-3 OLCI data choosing Oa10 and Oa8 bands instead of Oa11 and Oa8. Repeated campaigns are planned during spring and summer blooms 2016 in the Gulf of Riga to get larger data set for validation and evaluate repeatability. The main challenges remain to acquire as good data as possible within rapidly changing environment and often cloudy weather conditions.

Due to climate change and the increase of temperature expected in marine environment, it is important to anticipate potential impacts on this species. The aim of this study was to investigate the immunocompetence of blue mussels acclimated to different temperatures and on the effects of increasing temperatures (5, 10 and 20 degrees C). Different indices and gonad maturation stages were also determined throughout the experiments. Cell viability, phagocytosis, serum lysozyme activity and cyclooxygenase (COX) activity were evaluated as immune parameters. The cellular immunity was also evaluated after hemocytes exposure to various cadmium concentrations in vitro. The results obtained demonstrate modulation of hemocyte viability and the ability of these cells to phagocytize in absence of contaminants. After the exposure to cadmium, hemocytes showed greater viability at 5 degrees C while maintaining a higher phagocytic competence. In addition, the lysozyme activity stayed stable at all tested temperatures, contrary to that of COX, which increased when the mussels were maintained at 20 degrees C. The evaluation of indices demonstrated no reduction of general conditions during all the experiment despite the increase of temperature and the reduction of the digestive gland weight. Moreover, the lack of food does not affect gonad maturation and the spawning process.																	2039-4705	2039-4713					2016	6	1					8	13	5889	10.4081/xeno.2016.5889								WOS:000381769400002						
J	Reichwaldt, ES; Ghadouani, A				Reichwaldt, Elke S.; Ghadouani, Anas			Can mussels be used as sentinel organisms for characterization of pollution in urban water systems?	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Urbanization strongly impacts aquatic ecosystems by decreasing water quality and altering water cycles. Today, much effort is put towards the restoration and conservation of urban waterbodies to enhance ecosystem service provision, leading to liveable and sustainable cities. To enable a sustainable management of waterbodies, the quantification of the temporal and spatial variability of pollution levels and biogeochemical processes is essential. Stable isotopes have widely been used to identify sources of pollution in ecosystems. For example, increased nitrogen levels in waterbodies are often accompanied with a higher nitrogen stable isotope signature (delta N-15), which can then be detected in higher trophic levels such as mussels. The main aim of this study was to assess the suitability of nitrogen stable isotopes as measured in mussels (Mytilus edulis), as an indicator able to resolve spatial and temporal variability of nitrogen pollution in an urban, tidally influenced estuary (Swan River estuary in Western Australia). Nitrogen concentrations were generally low and nitrogen stable isotope values of nitrate throughout the estuary were well within natural values of uncontaminated groundwater, organic nitrate from soils, or marine-derived sources, indicating groundwater inflow rather than pollution by human activity was responsible for differences between sites. The delta N-15 signature in mussels was very stable over time within each site which indicated that mussels can be used as time-integrated sentinel organisms in urban systems. In addition, our study shows that the nature of the relationship between delta N-15 in the mussels and the nitrate in the water can provide insights into site-specific biogeochemical transformation of nutrients. We suggest that mussels and other sentinel organisms can become a robust tool for the detection and characterization of the dynamics of a number of emerging anthropogenic pollutants of concern in urban water systems.

Ocean colour opportunities from Meteosat Second and Third Generation geostationary platforms	OCEAN SCIENCE												Ocean colour applications from medium-resolution polar-orbiting satellite sensors have now matured and evolved into operational services. These applications are enabled by the Sentinel-3 OLCI space sensors of the European Earth Observation Copernicus programme and the VIIRS sensors of the US Joint Polar Satellite System programme. Key drivers for the Copernicus ocean colour services are the national obligations of the EU member states to report on the quality of marine, coastal and inland waters for the EU Water Framework Directive and Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Further applications include CO2 sequestration, carbon cycle and climate, fisheries and aquaculture management, near-real-time alerting to harmful algae blooms, environmental monitoring and forecasting, and assessment of sediment transport in coastal waters. Ocean colour data from polar-orbiting satellite platforms, however, suffer from fractional coverage, primarily due to clouds, and inadequate resolution of quickly varying processes. Ocean colour remote sensing from geostationary platforms can provide significant improvements in coverage and sampling frequency and support new applications and services. EUMETSAT's SEVIRI instrument on the geostationary Meteosat Second Generation platforms (MSG) is not designed to meet ocean colour mission requirements, however, it has been demonstrated to provide valuable contribution, particularly in combination with dedicated ocean colour polar observations. This paper describes the ongoing effort to develop operational ocean colour water turbidity and related products and user services from SEVIRI. SEVIRI's multi-temporal capabilities can benefit users requiring improved local-area coverage and frequent diurnal observations. A survey of user requirements and a study of technical capabilities and limitations of the SEVIRI instruments are the basis for this development and are described in this paper. The products will support monitoring of sediment transport, water clarity, and tidal dynamics by providing hourly coverage and long-term time series of the diurnal observations. Further products and services are anticipated from EUMETSAT's FCI instruments on Meteosat Third Generation satellites (MTG), including potential chlorophyll a products.																	1812-0784						2016	12	3					703	713		10.5194/os-12-703-2016								WOS:000379347400006

J	Taylor, A; Maher, W				Taylor, Anne; Maher, William			Developing a sentinel mollusc species for toxicity assessment: metal exposure, dose and response - laboratory v. field exposures and resident organisms	ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY												Environmental contextMetal contamination in estuarine sediments can affect ecosystem health. Molluscs are commonly used as environmental indicators because they accumulate contaminants that cause adverse health effects. We investigated metal uptake and effects in the Sydney cockle, comparing exposure to contaminated lake sediments in situ and in laboratory aquariums. Although differences were observed between the different exposure types, all approaches were found to be valid for investigating metal health effects in this organism. Abstract Relationships between exposure, tissue dose and biological responses of the benthic marine bivalve Anadara trapezia to an estuarine sediment zinc, copper, lead, cadmium and selenium contamination gradient in Lake Macquarie, NSW, were evaluated using three approaches. Organisms were exposed to sediments in laboratory aquaria, caged in situ in the lake and lake resident organisms collected. Dose included total metal tissue burden and subcellular metal distribution to determine metabolically available metal. Response indices were total antioxidant capacity, lipid peroxidation, lysosomal stability and condition index. Bioaccumulation of total metals was higher in the laboratory and resident organisms than in those transplanted in the field but the contribution of individual metals to the total differed. Laboratory-exposed organisms had increased concentrations of cadmium and lead in their biologically active and detoxified metal fractions but not of the essential elements zinc and copper. Subcellular metal distribution patterns were the same in resident organisms but cadmium and lead burdens were higher in both fractions. Biomarker responses were similar in laboratory, transplanted and resident organisms. Total antioxidant capacity was significantly reduced and lipid peroxidation and lysosomal destabilisation significantly increased in all metal-exposed organisms compared with the reference A. trapezia. Condition index of laboratory-exposed organisms was significantly lower than in situ, resident and reference organisms. Clear metal exposure-dose-response relationships have been demonstrated for A. trapezia in laboratory and in situ experiments. Non-resident organisms, in both exposure scenarios, gave similar responses to resident metal-exposed organisms, showing all approaches are valid when investigating effects in this species.																	1448-2517	1449-8979					2016	13	3			SI		434	446		10.1071/EN15104								WOS:000377043800003

The mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, a well-established sentinel species, was investigated in the Adriatic Sea, Aegean Sea, and Black Sea. The mussel Brachidontes pharaonis and the striped red mullet Mullus surmuletus were used in the Levantine Sea where M. galloprovincialis is not present. The white seabream Diplodus sargus sargus and the gastropod Rapana venosa were additionally sampled in the Adriatic and the Black Sea, respectively. Mussels showed catalase, glutathione S-transferase, and acetylcholinesterase responses to pollution in most geographical areas while the response of metallothioneins was restricted to a few sites. R. venosa showed marked responses of catalase and metallothioneins whereas both fish species did not generally exhibit variations in biomarker values among sites. The approach based on the reference deviation concept using the "Integrated Biological Responses version 2" index was useful for the interpretation of overall biomarker responses.

Activity concentrations of (137)Caesium and (210)Polonium in seafood from fishing regions of New Zealand and the dose assessment for seafood consumers	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY												A study was undertaken to determine activity concentrations for (134)Caesium, (137)Caesium and (210)Polonium in New Zealand seafood, and establish if activity concentrations varied with respect to species/ecological niche and coastal region. Thirty seafood samples were obtained from six fishing regions of New Zealand along with a further six samples of two commercially important species (hold and arrow squid) with well-defined fisheries. (134)Caesium was not detected in any sample. (137)Caesium was detected in 47% of samples, predominantly in pelagic fish species, with most activities at a trace level. Detections of (137)Caesium were evenly distributed across all regions. Activity concentrations were consistent with those expected from the oceanic inventory representing residual fallout from global nuclear testing. (210)Polonium was detected above the minimum detectable concentration in 33 (92%) of the analysed samples. Molluscs displayed significantly elevated activity concentrations relative to all other species groups. No significant regional variation in activity concentrations were determined. Two dose assessment models for high seafood consumers were undertaken. Dose contribution from (137)Caesium was minimal and far below the dose exemption limit of 1 mSv/year. Exposure to (210)Polonium was significant in high seafood consumers at 0.44-0.77 mSv/year (5th-95th percentile). (137)Caesium is concluded to be a valuable sentinel radionuclide for monitoring anthropogenic releases, such as global fallout and reactor releases, in the marine environment. (210)Polonium is of importance as a natural radionuclide sentinel due to its high contribution to dietary committed dose in seafood consumers. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

From a methodological point of view, our approach relies on a Bayesian inference using Gaussian Mixture Model prior distributions on reference spectra of aerosol and water reflectance. A reference spectrum for the aerosol characterizes the specific signature of the aerosols on the observed aerosol reflectance. A reference spectrum for the water characterizes the specific signature of chlorophyll-a, suspended particulate matters and colored dissolved organic matters on the observed sea surface reflectance. In our Bayesian inversion scheme, prior distributions of the marine and aerosol variables are set conditionally to the observed values of covariates, typically acquisition geometry acquisition conditions and preestimates of the aerosol and water reflectance in the near-infrared part of the spectrum. The numerical inversion exploits a gradient-based optimization from quasi-randomized initializations. We evaluate our estimates of the sea surface reflectance from the MERIS TOA observations. Using the MERMAID radiometric in-situ dataset, we obtain significant improvements in the estimation of the sea surface reflectance, especially for the 412, 442, 490 and 510 nm bands, compared with the standard ESA MEGS algorithm and the a state-of-the-art neural network approach (OR). The mean gain value on the relative error for the 13 bands between 412 and 885 nm is of 57% compared with MEGS algorithm and 10% compared with the C2R. The water leaving reflectances are used in Ocean Color for the estimation of the chl-a concentration, the colored dissolved organic matters absorption and the suspended particulate matters concentration underlying the potential of such approach to improve the standard level 2 products in coastal areas. We further discuss the potential of MEETC2 for the incoming OLCl/Sentinel 3 mission that will be launched in December 2015. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Nevertheless, the possible threat to human health and the environment have attracted increasing attention as the production and applications of QDs increases rapidly while standard evaluation of safety lags. In the present study we performed proteomic analyses, by means of 2D gel electrophoresis and Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS). We aimed to identify potential biomarkers of exposure to CdSe/ZnS quantum dots. The marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum exposed to 2.5 nM QDs was used as a model system. Both 2DE and SELDI showed the presence of differentially expressed proteins. By Principal Component Analysis (PCA) we were able to show that the differentially expressed proteins can discriminate between exposed and not exposed cells. Furthermore, a protein profile specific for exposed cells was obtained by SELDI analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first example of the application of SELDI technology to the analysis of microorganisms used as biological sentinel model of marine environmental pollution.

Biochemical and photochemical feedbacks of acute Cd toxicity in Juncus acutus seedlings: The role of non-functional Cd-chlorophylls	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The increasing metal pollution in salt marshes and its influence on the plants that inhabit these ecosystems, has become a major concern with serious implications on the species establishment. Juncus coitus is a highly common halophyte specie in Portuguese marshes. Seeds from his specie were exposed to a range of different Cd concentrations (0.05, 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mu M) in order to evaluate the effects of acute Cd stress on seed germination and growth as well as on seedling pigment composition, photosynthetic apparatus and oxidative stress biomarkers. Seedling length was higher than in control in every Cd treatment, however biomass showed a decrease. It was also observed that increasing Cd treatments, lead to a proportional increase in the Cd tissue concentration. Also the Cd-substituted chlorophylls showed an increase with increasing Cd doses that were applied. This substitution results in a non-functional chlorophyll molecule, highly unstable under moderate light intensities which inevitably reduces the efficiency of the LHC II. As consequence, there was a decrease in the use-efficiency of the harvested energy, leading to a decay in the photosynthetic capacity and energy accumulation, which was dissipated as heat. As for the antioxidant enzymes, SOD and APX presented higher activity, responding to increasing cadmium concentrations. Thus, becomes evident that Cd affects negatively, both biochemically and photochemically, the establishment by seed process of J. acutus highlighting the potential of the use of this specie seed as potential sentinel and ecotoxicity test in extreme conditions.

Year-Long Metagenomic Study of River Microbiomes Across Land Use and Water Quality	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Select bacteria, such as Escherichia coli or coliforms, have been widely used as sentinels of low water quality; however, there are concerns regarding their predictive accuracy for the protection of human and environmental health. To develop improved monitoring systems, a greater understanding of bacterial community structure, function, and variability across time is required in the context of different pollution types, such as agricultural and urban contamination. Here, we present a year long survey of free-living bacterial DNA collected from seven sites along rivers in three watersheds with varying land use in Southwestern Canada. This is the first study to examine the bacterial metagenome in flowing freshwater (lotic) environments over such a time span, providing an opportunity to describe bacterial community variability as a function of land use and environmental conditions. Characteristics of the metagenomic data, such as sequence composition and average genome size (AGS), vary with sampling site, environmental conditions, and water chemistry. For example, AGS was correlated with hours of daylight in the agricultural watershed and, across the agriculturally and urban-affected sites, k-mer composition clustering corresponded to nutrient concentrations. In addition to indicating a community shift, this change in AGS has implications in terms of the normalization strategies required, and considerations surrounding such strategies in general are discussed. When comparing abundances of gene functional groups between high- and low-quality water samples collected from an agricultural area, the latter had a higher abundance of nutrient metabolism and bacteriophage groups, possibly reflecting an increase in agricultural runoff. This work presents a valuable dataset representing a year of monthly sampling across watersheds and an analysis targeted at establishing a foundational understanding of how bacterial lotic communities vary across time and land use. The results provide important context for future studies, including further analyses of watershed ecosystem health, and the identification and development of biomarkers for improved water quality monitoring systems.

Two complementary analytical techniques, ICP-MS and NAA, allowed for determination of concentrations of 31 major and trace elements including heavy metals and arsenic in the soft tissues of the mussels. Distinct seasonal patterns were found in the dynamics of these concentrations, with the mussels accumulating much more trace elements in winter than in the summer. In general, the mussels that grew naturally also demonstrated higher concentrations of As, Cd, Fe, Hg and Zn than those that were farmed. Fe showed the highest levels with a maximum concentration of 444 mg/kg followed by Zn with a maximum of 228 mg/kg. The concentrations of Mn and Pb were significantly higher in the Port of Saldanha close to the jetty where ores containing these metals are loaded in comparison with the other sampling sites. It was concluded that bivalve molluscs present themselves as effective biomonitors when assessing marine aquatic pollution by inorganic contaminants in the Saldanha Bay region.

Monitoring of contaminants and their effects on the common Guillemot and the White-tailed sea eagle	JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY					26th International Ornithological Congress (IOC)	AUG 18-24, 2014	Rikkyo Univ, Tokyo, JAPAN		Rikkyo Univ			A main purpose of marine contaminant monitoring in Europe is to evaluate the chemical status and environmental quality under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), to monitor and achieve Good Environmental Status (GES). Characteristics of a good matrix for monitoring purposes are the potential to detect temporal trends or differences between sites or concentration levels in relation to a target value indicating GES. In Sweden we use muscle of herring and eggs of guillemot and White-tailed sea eagle (WTSE) to study changes in contaminant exposure and their effects. Herring is important in fisheries and has target levels set for contaminants in relation to GES. Adult guillemots and eagles in the Baltic Sea are mainly stationary. Guillemots feed largely on herring, WTSEs on fish and other fish-eaters. A higher trophic level may imply biomagnification, and, for example, DDE shows concentration ratios in lipids of 110 (guillemot/ herring), 460 (WTSE/ herring) and 4.2 (WTSE/ guillemot). Banked, frozen guillemot eggs have been extensively used for retrospective temporal trend analyses for several chemicals. Ideally, the matrix should also be useful for biological effect monitoring. Eggshell and reproductive parameters are monitored in the WTSEs and guillemots. Reproductive problems and egg desiccation still occur among eagles, indicating an impact of contaminants and highlighting the importance of apex predators as environmental sentinels.																	0021-8375	1439-0361				DEC	2015	156			1			S173	S185		10.1007/s10336-015-1240-3								WOS:000367457200014

In this study, we compare the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of both soluble and particulate chromate in human and hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) skin fibroblasts. Our data show that both soluble and particulate Cr(VI) induce concentration-dependent increases in cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and intracellular Cr ion concentrations in both human and hawksbill sea turtle fibroblasts. Based on administered concentration, particulate and soluble Cr(VI) were more cytotoxic and clastogenic to human cells than sea turtle cells. When the analysis was based on the intracellular concentration of Cr, the data showed that the response of both species was similar. The one exception was the cytotoxicity of intracellular Cr ions from soluble Cr(VI), which caused more cytotoxicity in sea turtle cells (LC50 = 271 mu M) than that of human cells (LC50 = 471 mu M), but its clastogenicity was similar between the two species. Thus, adjusting for differences in uptake indicated that the explanation for the difference in potency was mostly due to uptake rather than differently affected mechanisms. Overall these data indicate that sea turtles may be a useful sentinel for human health responses to marine pollution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The objective of the present study was to assess the occurrence of HAV and HEV in different water environments, following the route of contamination from raw sewage through treated effluent to the surface waters receiving wastewater discharges . Bivalve molluscan shellfish samples were also analyzed, as sentinel of marine pollution. Samples were tested by RT-PCR nested type in the VP1/2A junction for HAV, and in the ORF1 and ORF2 regions for HEV. Hepatitis A RNA was detected in 12 water samples: 7/21 (33.3 %) raw sewage samples, 3/21 (14.3 %) treated sewage samples, and 2/27 (7.4 %) river water samples. Five sequences were classified as genotype IA, while the remaining 7 sequences belonged to genotype IB. In bivalves, HAV was detected in 13/56 samples (23.2 %), 12 genotype IB and one genotype IA. Whether the presence of HAV in the matrices tested indicates the potential for waterborne and foodborne transmission is unknown, since infectivity of the virus was not demonstrated. HEV was detected in one raw sewage sample and in one river sample, both belonging to genotype 3. Sequences were similar to sequences detected previously in Italy in patients with autochthonous HEV (no travel history) and in animals (swine). To our knowledge, this is the first detection of HEV in river waters in Italy, suggesting that surface water can be a potential source for exposure .

J	Yang, BL; Xiong, DQ				Yang, Bailin; Xiong, Deqi			Bioaccumulation and subacute toxicity of mechanically and chemically dispersed heavy fuel oil in sea urchin (Glyptocidaris crenulari)	SCIENTIA MARINA												Oil spills have a disastrous ecological impact on ecosystems but few data are available for the effects of dispersed oil on benthic marine organisms. In order to provide information for assessment, we analysed the hydrocarbon compositions of the mechanically dispersed water accommodated fraction (MDWAF) and the chemically dispersed water accommodated fraction (CDWAF) of No. 120 fuel oil, their bioaccumulation, and DNA damage related to oil exposure, using the sea urchin as a sentinel organism. The results show that the concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon in the tissues of sea urchin exposed to the CDWAF is higher than that of those exposed to the MDWAF. The single cell gel electrophoresis assay results also indicated higher DNA damage from exposure to the CDWAF of oil. Thus, dispersants should be applied with caution in oil spill accidents.																	0214-8358	1886-8134				DEC	2015	79	4					497	504		10.3989/scimar.04223.30B								WOS:000365427100011

In this study Pinna nobilis specimens, the biggest Mediterranean bivalve, were collected in the Magaluf bay (Mallorca), a touristic location and in a pristine area of the Cabrera National Park as the control location. Histological and histochemical analysis in gills of specimens sampled from Magaluf exhibited evident tissue alterations with high presence of haemocytes. Lower acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and protein expression were also found in the gills of specimens collected from Magaluf compared with the control area. The determination of antioxidant enzyme activities, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase, showed a higher activities of these antioxidant enzymes and total glutathione content in samples from Magaluf bay than in Cabrera. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that human activities result in morphological tissue alterations and a reduced AChE activity in gills of P. nobilis. Moreover, these stressful environmental conditions induced an adaptive response in P. nobilis as evidenced by increased antioxidant defences and a decreased AChE activity.

Histopathology and contaminant concentrations in fish from Kuwait's marine environment	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Kuwait has witnessed major socioeconomic and industrial development in recent decades. Consequently, a variety of contaminants related to these activities have been discharged directly into the marine environment. This paper describes the application of a histopathology baseline survey in two potential sentinel species, the Giant sea catfish (Arius thalassinus) and the Fourlined terapon (Pelates quadrilineatus) to assess the health of biota inhabiting Kuwait's marine environment. Histological analysis revealed several lesion types in both species, although the prevalence was generally considered low with no discernible differences between sampling locations. The analysis of contaminant burdens (metals, PCBs, PBDEs, HBCDD) in A. thalassinus, along with the analysis of bile for PAH metabolites in both species, indicated that levels of contaminant exposure was low. Overall the data show that both species appear to be susceptible to pathologies associated with environmental contaminants and therefore suitable for further investigation as sentinel organisms for biological effects monitoring.

Unbiased high-throughput characterization of mussel transcriptomic responses to sublethal concentrations of the biotoxin okadaic acid	PEERJ												Background. Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) responsible for Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP) represent a major threat for human consumers of shellfish. The biotoxin Okadaic Acid (OA), a well-known phosphatase inhibitor and tumor promoter, is the primary cause of acute DSP intoxications. Although several studies have described the molecular effects of high OA concentrations on sentinel organisms (e.g., bivalve molluscs), the effect of prolonged exposures to low (sublethal) OA concentrations is still unknown. In order to fill this gap, this work combines Next-Generation sequencing and custom-made microarray technologies to develop an unbiased characterization of the transcriptomic response of mussels during early stages of a DSP bloom. Methods. Mussel specimens were exposed to a HAB episode simulating an early stage DSP bloom (200 cells/L of the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima for 24 h). The unbiased characterization of the transcriptomic responses triggered by OA was carried out using two complementary methods of cDNA library preparation: normalized and Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH). Libraries were sequenced and read datasets were mapped to Gene Ontology and KEGG databases. A custom-made oligonucleotide microarray was developed based on these data, completing the expression analysis of digestive gland and gill tissues. Results. Our findings show that exposure to sublethal concentrations of OA is enough to induce gene expression modifications in the mussel Mytilus. Transcriptomic analyses revealed an increase in proteasomal activity, molecular transport, cell cycle regulation, energy production and immune activity in mussels. Oppositely, a number of transcripts hypothesized to be responsive to OA (notably the Serine/Threonine phosphatases PP1 and PP2A) failed to show substantial modifications. Both digestive gland and gill tissues responded similarly to OA, although expression modifications were more dramatic in the former, supporting the choice of this tissue for future biomonitoring studies. Discussion. Exposure to OA concentrations within legal limits for safe consumption of shellfish is enough to disrupt important cellular processes in mussels, eliciting sharp transcriptional changes as a result. By combining the study of cDNA libraries and a custom-made OA-specific microarray, our work provides a comprehensive characterization of the OA-specific transcriptome, improving the accuracy of the analysis of expresion profiles compared to single-replicated RNA-seq methods. The combination of our data with related studies helps understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying molecular responses to DSP episodes in marine organisms, providing useful information to develop a new generation of tools for the monitoring of OA pollution.

A Systematic Review of Changes in Marine Mammal Health in North America, 1972-2012: The Need for a Novel Integrated Approach	PLOS ONE												Marine mammals are often cited as "sentinels of ocean health" yet accessible, synthesized data on their health changes that could effectively warn of ocean health changes are rare. The objectives of this study were to 1) perform a systematic review of published cases of marine mammal disease to determine spatial and temporal trends in disease from 1972-2012, including changes in regions and taxa affected and specific causes; and 2) compare numbers of published cases of neoplasia with known, hospital-based neoplasia records to explore the causes of discrepancy between numbers of published cases and true disease trends. Peer-reviewed literature was compiled, and data were collected from The Marine Mammal Center database in Sausalito, California for comparison of numbers of neoplasia cases. Toxicoses from harmful algal blooms appear to be increasing. Viral epidemics are most common along the Atlantic U.S. coastline, while bacterial epidemics, especially leptospirosis, are most common along the Pacific coast. Certain protozoal and fungal zoonoses appear to be emerging, such as Toxoplasma gondii in southern sea otters in California, and Cryptococcus gattii in cetaceans in the Pacific Northwest. Disease reports were most common from California where pinniped populations are large, but increased effort also occurs. Anthropogenic trauma remains a large threat to marine mammal health, through direct mortality and indirect chronic disease. Neoplasia cases were under-reported from 2003-2012 when compared to true number of cases, and over-reported in several years due to case duplication. Peer-reviewed literature greatly underestimates the true magnitude of disease in marine mammals as it focuses on novel findings, fails to reflect etiology of multifactorial diseases, rarely reports prevalence rather than simple numbers of cases, and is typically presented years after a disease first occurs. Thus literature cannot guide management actions adequately, nor inform indices of ocean health. A real-time, nationally centralized system for reporting marine mammal disease data is needed to be able to understand how marine mammal diseases are changing with ecosystem changes, and before these animals can truly be considered 'sentinels of ocean health'.

Deep-ocean foraging northern elephant seals bioaccumulate persistent organic pollutants	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												As top predators in the northeast Pacific Ocean, northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) are vulnerable to bioaccumulation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Our study examined a suite of POPs in blubber (inner and outer) and blood (serum) of free-ranging northern elephant seals. For adult females (N=24), we satellite tracked and sampled the same seals before and after their approximately seven month long foraging trip. For males, we sampled different adults and sub-adults before (N=14) and after (N=15) the same foraging trip. For females, we calculated blubber burdens for all compounds. The highest POP concentrations in males and females were found for Sigma DDTs and Sigma PCBs. In blubber and serum, males had significantly greater concentrations than females for almost all compounds. For males and females, Sigma DDT and Sigma PBDEs were highly correlated in blubber and serum. While Sigma PCBs were highly correlated with Sigma DDTs and Sigma PBDEs in blubber and serum for males, Sigma PCBs showed weaker correlations with both compounds in females. As females gained mass while foraging, concentrations of nearly all POPs in inner and outer blubber significantly decreased; however, the absolute burden in blubber significantly increased, indicating ingestion of contaminants while foraging. Additionally, we identified three clusters of seal foraging behavior, based on geography, diving behavior, and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes, which corresponded with differences in Sigma DDTs, Sigma PBDEs, MeO-BDE 47, as well as the ratio of Sigma DDTs to Sigma PCBs, indicating the potential for behavior to heighten or mitigate contaminant exposure. The greatest concentrations of Sigma DDTs and Sigma PBDEs were observed in the cluster that foraged closer to the coast and had blood samples more enriched in C-13. Bioaccumulation of POPs by elephant seals supports mesopelagic food webs as a sink for POPs and highlights elephant seals as a potential sentinel of contamination in deep ocean food webs.

Evidence for episodic acidification effects on migrating Atlantic salmon Salmo salar smolts	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Field studies were conducted to determine levels of gill aluminium as an index of acidification effects on migrating Atlantic salmon Salmo salar smolts in the north-eastern U.S.A. along mainstem river migration corridors in several major river basins. Smolts emigrating from the Connecticut River, where most (but not all) tributaries were well buffered, had low or undetectable levels of gill aluminium and high gill Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) activity. In contrast, smolts emigrating from the upper Merrimack River basin where most tributaries are characterized by low pH and high inorganic aluminium had consistently elevated gill aluminium and lower gill NKA activity, which may explain the low adult return rates of S. salar stocked into the upper Merrimack catchment. In the Sheepscot, Narraguagus and Penobscot Rivers in Maine, river and year-specific effects on gill aluminium were detected that appeared to be driven by underlying geology and high spring discharge. The results indicate that episodic acidification is affecting S. salar smolts in poorly buffered streams in New England and may help explain variation in S. salar survival and abundance among rivers and among years, with implications for the conservation and recovery of S. salar in the north-eastern U.S.A. These results suggest that the physiological condition of outmigrating smolts may serve as a large-scale sentinel of landscape-level recovery of atmospheric pollution in this and other parts of the North Atlantic region.																	0022-1112	1095-8649				NOV	2015	87	5					1129	1146		10.1111/jfb.12763								WOS:000363590400001	26399385

The Foraging Ecology of the Endangered Cape Verde Shearwater, a Sentinel Species for Marine Conservation off West Africa	PLOS ONE												Large Marine Ecosystems such as the Canary Current system off West Africa sustains high abundance of small pelagic prey, which attracts marine predators. Seabirds are top predators often used as biodiversity surrogates and sentinel species of the marine ecosystem health, thus frequently informing marine conservation planning. This study presents the first data on the spatial (GPS-loggers) and trophic (stable isotope analysis) ecology of a tropical seabird-the endangered Cape Verde shearwater Calonectris edwardsii-during both the incubation and the chick-rearing periods of two consecutive years. This information was related with marine environmental predictors (species distribution models), existent areas of conservation concern for seabirds (i.e. marine Important Bird Areas; marine IBAs) and threats to the marine environment in the West African areas heavily used by the shearwaters. There was an apparent inter-annual consistency on the spatial, foraging and trophic ecology of Cape Verde shearwater, but a strong alteration on the foraging strategies of adult breeders among breeding phases (i.e. from incubation to chick-rearing). During incubation, birds mostly targeted a discrete region off West Africa, known by its enhanced productivity profile and thus also highly exploited by international industrial fishery fleets. When chick-rearing, adults exploited the comparatively less productive tropical environment within the islands of Cape Verde, at relatively close distance from their breeding colony. The species enlarged its trophic niche and increased the trophic level of their prey from incubation to chick-rearing, likely to provision their chicks with a more diversified and better quality diet. There was a high overlap between the Cape Verde shearwaters foraging areas with those of European shearwater species that overwinter in this area and known areas of megafauna bycatch off West Africa, but very little overlap with existing Marine Important Bird Areas. Further investigation on the potential nefarious effects of fisheries on seabird communities exploiting the Canary Current system off West Africa is needed. Such negative effects could be alleviated or even dissipated if the 'fisheries-conservation hotspots' identified for the region, would be legislated as Marine Protected Areas.

A SWIR based algorithm to retrieve total suspended matter in extremely turbid waters	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												In ocean colour remote sensing, the use of Near Infra Red (NIR) spectral bands for the retrieval of Total Suspended Matter (TSM) concentration in turbid and highly turbid waters has proven to be successful. In extremely turbid waters (TSM > 100 mg L-1) however, these bands are less sensitive to increases in TSM. Here it is proposed to use Short Wave Infra Red (SWIR) spectral bands between 1000 and 1300 nm for these extreme cases. This SWIR spectral region is subdivided into two regions, SWIR-I (1000 nm to 1200 nm) and SWIR-II (1200 nm to 1300 nm) which correspond to local minima in the pure water absorption spectrum. For both spectral regions the water reflectance signal was measured in situ with an ASD spectrometer in three different extremely turbid estuarine sites: Scheldt (Belgium), Gironde (France), and Rio de la Plata (Argentina), along with the TSM concentration. A measurable water reflectance was observed for all sites in SWIR-I, while in the SWIR-II region the signal was not significant compared to the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of current Ocean Colour (OC) sensors. For the spectral band at 1020 nm (present in Ocean and Land Colour Instrument - OLCI, onboard Sentinel-3) and at 1071 nm, an empirical single band TSM algorithm is defined which is valid for both the Gironde and Scheldt estuarine sites. This means that a single algorithm can be applied for both sites without expensive recalibration. The relationship between TSM and SWIR reflectance at 1020 and 1071 nm is linear and did not show any saturation for the concentrations measured here (up to 1400 mg L-1), while saturation was observed for the NIR wavelengths, as expected. Hence, for extremely turbid waters it is advised to switch from NIR to SWIR4 wavelengths to estimate TSM concentration. This was demonstrated for an airborne hyperspectral dataset (Airborne Prism Experiment, APEX) from the Gironde estuary having several spectral bands in the SVVIR-I. The empirical single band SWIR TSM algorithm was applied to the atmospherically corrected scene providing a TSM concentration map of the Gironde from mouth to more upstream with concentrations expected in this region ranging from a few to several hundreds mg L-1. These results, i.e. the existence of a single relationship for the Scheldt and Gironde, not showing any decrease of sensitivity, highlights the importance of having SWIR bands in future ocean colour sensors for studying extremely turbid rivers, coastal areas and estuaries in the world. A further implication of these results is that there is a TSM limit for application of atmospheric correction algorithms which assume zero SWIR marine reflectance. That limit is defined here as function of wavelength and sensor noise level. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Environmental epigenetics: A promising venue for developing next-generation pollution biomonitoring tools in marine invertebrates	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Environmental epigenetics investigates the cause-effect relationships between specific environmental factors and the subsequent epigenetic modifications triggering adaptive responses in the cell. Given the dynamic and potentially reversible nature of the different types of epigenetic marks, environmental epigenetics constitutes a promising venue for developing fast and sensible biomonitoring programs. Indeed, several epigenetic biomarkers have been successfully developed and applied in traditional model organisms (e.g., human and mouse). Nevertheless, the lack of epigenetic knowledge in other ecologically and environmentally relevant organisms has hampered the application of these tools in a broader range of ecosystems, most notably in the marine environment. Fortunately, that scenario is now changing thanks to the growing availability of complete reference genome sequences along with the development of high-throughput DNA sequencing and bioinformatic methods. Altogether, these resources make the epigenetic study of marine organisms (and more specifically marine invertebrates) a reality. By building on this knowledge, the present work provides a timely perspective highlighting the extraordinary potential of environmental epigenetic analyses as a promising source of rapid and sensible tools for pollution biomonitoring, using marine invertebrates as sentinel organisms. This strategy represents an innovative, ground-breaking approach, improving the conservation and management of natural resources in the oceans. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We report the novel result that cartographic methods with non-trivial classification errors are generally incapable of reliably detecting habitat cover losses less than about 30 to 50%, and the field labor required to increase their precision can be orders of magnitude higher than that required to estimate habitat loss directly in a field campaign. We derive a universal utility threshold of classification error in habitat maps that represents the minimum habitat map accuracy above which direct methods are superior. Widespread government reliance on blind-sentinel methods for monitoring seafloor can obscure the gradual and currently ongoing losses of benthic resources until the time has long passed for meaningful management intervention. We find two classes of methods with very high statistical power for detecting small habitat cover losses: 1) fixed-plot direct methods, which are over 100 times as efficient as direct random-plot methods in a variable habitat mosaic; and 2) remote methods with very low classification error such as geospatial underwater videography, which is an emerging, lowcost, non-destructive method for documenting small changes at millimeter visual resolution. General adoption of these methods and their further development will require a fundamental cultural change in conservation and management bodies towards the recognition and promotion of requirements of minimal statistical power and precision in the development of international goals for monitoring these valuable resources and the ecological services they provide.

Annual trend patterns of phytoplankton species abundance belie homogeneous taxonomical group responses to climate in the NE Atlantic upwelling	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Phytoplankton is a sentinel of marine ecosystem change. Composed by many species with different life-history strategies, it rapidly responds to environment changes. An analysis of the abundance of 54 phytoplankton species in Galicia (NW Spain) between 1989 and 2008 to determine the main components of temporal variability in relation to climate and upwelling showed that most of this variability was stochastic, as seasonality and long term trends contributed to relatively small fractions of the series. In general, trends appeared as non linear, and species clustered in 4 groups according to the trend pattern but there was no defined pattern for diatoms, dinoflagellates or other groups. While, in general, total abundance increased, no clear trend was found for 23 species, 14 species decreased, 4 species increased during the early 1990s, and only 13 species showed a general increase through the series. In contrast, series of local environmental conditions (temperature, stratification, nutrients) and climate-related variables (atmospheric pressure indices, upwelling winds) showed a high fraction of their variability in deterministic seasonality and trends. As a result, each species responded independently to environmental and climate variability, measured by generalized additive models. Most species showed a positive relationship with nutrient concentrations but only a few showed a direct relationship with stratification and upwelling. Climate variables had only measurable effects on some species but no common response emerged. Because its adaptation to frequent disturbances, phytoplanlcton communities in upwelling ecosystems appear less sensitive to changes in regional climate than other communities characterized by short and well defined productive periods.

Intron Invasions Trace Algal Speciation and Reveal Nearly Identical Arctic and Antarctic Micromonas Populations	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Spliceosomal introns are a hallmark of eukaryotic genes that are hypothesized to play important roles in genome evolution but have poorly understood origins. Although most introns lack sequence homology to each other, new families of spliceosomal introns that are repeated hundreds of times in individual genomes have recently been discovered in a few organisms. The prevalence and conservation of these introner elements (IEs) or introner-like elements in other taxa, as well as their evolutionary relationships to regular spliceosomal introns, are still unknown. Here, we systematically investigate introns in the widespread marine green alga Micromonas and report new families of IEs, numerous intron presence-absence polymorphisms, and potential intron insertion hot-spots. The new families enabled identification of conserved IE secondary structure features and establishment of a novel general model for repetitive intron proliferation across genomes. Despite shared secondary structure, the IE families from each Micromonas lineage bear no obvious sequence similarity to those in the other lineages, suggesting that their appearance is intimately linked with the process of speciation. Two of the new IE families come from an Arctic culture (Micromonas Clade E2) isolated from a polar region where abundance of this alga is increasing due to climate induced changes. The same two families were detected in metagenomic data from Antarctica-a system where Micromonas has never before been reported. Strikingly high identity between the Arctic isolate and Antarctic coding sequences that flank the IEs suggests connectivity between populations in the two polar systems that we postulate occurs through deep-sea currents. Recovery of Clade E2 sequences in North Atlantic Deep Waters beneath the Gulf Stream supports this hypothesis. Our research illuminates the dynamic relationships between an unusual class of repetitive introns, genome evolution, speciation, and global distribution of this sentinel marine alga.

B.; Ryan, Hunter			CLINICAL COPPER TOXICOSIS IN A LARGE MIXED GROUP OF MARINE INVERTEBRATES	JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE												A mixed group of 441 marine invertebrates was collected in Southern California. After a large mortality event, numerous water quality parameters were evaluated. Copper was present at 33 mu g/L, which is below the documented toxic level. No other toxins were identified. To investigate whether copper was the etiology for the mass mortality, purple sea urchins, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, were used as sentinel species, as they were the most severely affected during the mortality event. Purple sea urchins were placed in multiple test systems of varying copper concentrations and died in periods of time proportionate to copper concentrations. Clinical signs, disease progression, and pathologic lesions were similar between test systems and the original mortality event. Copper caused disease and death in purple sea urchins at concentrations from 15 to 50 mu g/L. The source of the copper toxicity was identified as sand filters contaminated by brass pump components.																	1042-7260	1937-2825				SEP	2015	46	3					601	604		10.1638/2014-0153.1								WOS:000361049800023	26352969

The anthropogenic disturbance is acting on ecosystems with serious consequences for the environment and human health, driving strong social and economic impacts on the community. Often, such in the case of chemical and petrochemical productions, the areas subjected to the most intensive industrialization are located along the coastline, being a severe threat to the marine environment. Recently, the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research funded the project "SYSTEMS BIOLOGY". The Project is articulated into two main phases: (1) a field monitoring program to evaluate the effects of toxic contaminants (e.g. heavy metals and hydrocarbons) on "sea sentinels" (organisms representing early living warning systems) purposely placed in different contaminated areas; (2) a series of controlled mesocosms-scale experiments to measure the effects, on the same sea sentinels, of different remediation actions on waters and sediments collected from the contaminated areas under inspection. The project is aimed to understand how the xenobiotic contamination induces or modifies the biological processes in aquatic species, and to evaluate the potential effectiveness of different biotechnological strategies in controlling and reducing the impact of marine pollution on the biological compartment. Each phase is accomplished through a synergic collaboration and multidisciplinary approach among eight research units and constitutes a pioneering advance in the international scenario.

In addition, water borne ammonia may occur simultaneously with salinity stress. Additionally, under such stressful circumstances, fish may encounter food deprivation. The physiological and ion-osmo regulatory adaptive capacities to cope with all these stressors alone or in combination are extensively addressed in fish. To date, studies revealing the modulation of antioxidant potential as compensatory response to multiple stressors are rather lacking. Therefore, the present work evaluated the individual and combined effects of salinity challenge, ammonia toxicity and nutritional status on oxidative stress and antioxidant status in a marine teleost, European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). Fish were acclimated to normal seawater (32 ppt), to brackish water (20 ppt and 10 ppt) and to hypo-saline water (2.5 ppt). Following acclimation to different salinities for two weeks, fish were exposed to high environmental ammonia (HEA, 20 mg/L representing 50% of 96h LC50 value for ammonia) for 12 h, 48 h, 84 h and 180 h, and were either fed (2% body weight) or fasted (unfed for 7 days prior to HEA exposure). Results show that in response to decreasing salinities, oxidative stress indices such as xanthine oxidase activity, levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde, MDA) increased in the hepatic tissue of fasted fish but remained unaffected in fed fish. HEA exposure at normal salinity (32 ppt) and at reduced salinities (20 ppt and 10 ppt) increased ammonia accumulation significantly (84 h-180 h) in both feeding regimes which was associated with an increment of H2O2 and MDA contents. Unlike in fasted fish, H2O2 and MDA levels in fed fish were restored to control levels (84 h-180 h); with a concomitant increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), components of the glutathione redox cycle (reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity and reduced ascorbate (ASC) content. On the contrary, fasted fish could not activate many of these protective systems and rely mainly on CAT and ASC dependent pathways as antioxidative sentinels. The present findings exemplify that in fed fish single factors and a combination of HEA exposure and reduced seawater salinities (upto 10 ppt) were insufficient to cause oxidative damage due to the highly competent antioxidant system compared to fasted fish. However, the impact of HEA exposure at a hypo-saline environment (2.5 ppt) also defied antioxidant defence system in fed fish, suggesting this combined factor is beyond the tolerance range for both feeding groups. Overall, our results indicate that the oxidative stress mediated by the experimental conditions were exacerbated during starvation, and also suggest that feed deprivation particularly at reduced seawater salinities can instigate fish more susceptible to ammonia toxicity.

More, smaller bacteria in response to ocean's warming?	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Heterotrophic bacteria play a major role in organic matter cycling in the ocean. Although the high abundances and relatively fast growth rates of coastal surface bacterioplankton make them suitable sentinels of global change, past analyses have largely overlooked this functional group. Here, time series analysis of a decade of monthly observations in temperate Atlantic coastal waters revealed strong seasonal patterns in the abundance, size and biomass of the ubiquitous flow-cytometric groups of low (LNA) and high nucleic acid (HNA) content bacteria. Over this relatively short period, we also found that bacterioplankton cells were significantly smaller, a trend that is consistent with the hypothesized temperature-driven decrease in body size. Although decadal cell shrinking was observed for both groups, it was only LNA cells that were strongly coherent, with ecological theories linking temperature, abundance and individual size on both the seasonal and interannual scale. We explain this finding because, relative to their HNA counterparts, marine LNA bacteria are less diverse, dominated by members of the SAR11 clade. Temperature manipulation experiments in 2012 confirmed a direct effect of warming on bacterial size. Concurrent with rising temperatures in spring, significant decadal trends of increasing standing stocks (3% per year) accompanied by decreasing mean cell size (-1% per year) suggest a major shift in community structure, with a larger contribution of LNA bacteria to total biomass. The increasing prevalence of these typically oli-gotrophic taxa may severely impact marine food webs and carbon fluxes by an overall decrease in the efficiency of the biological pump.

Although molluscs have been widely used to monitor water pollution, there are no records of in vivo genotoxicity studies. Heleobia cf. australis, is distributed in almost all Uruguayan coastal ecosystems, including highly polluted sites. The comet assay is a damage genetic biomarker based on the migration of negatively charged DNA fragments produced by mutagenic agents in individual cells. Live individuals were collected in the Montevideo Bay (impacted area) and Laguna Garzon (control) to analyze the presence of mutagenic agents in the former site through comet assay. Cells from organisms of the impacted area showed significantly higher levels of genetic damage than those obtained in the control population, measured by percentage of DNA in the tail. Although preliminary, this approach supports the idea that H. cf. australis could be used as a sentinel to evaluate the presence of mutagenic agents in estuarine environments, alerting to the impact of contamination in its early stages.

Since most biomonitors of TBT contamination, through imposex evaluation, are hard-bottom gastropods, the identification of soft-bottom sentinels has become useful for regions where rocky shores and coral reefs are absent. Thus, an evaluation of Olivella minuta and Hastula cinerea as monitors of TBT contamination was performed in two sandy beaches located under influence area of Sao Sebastiao harbor (Sao Paulo state, Brazil), where previous and simultaneous studies have reported environmental contamination by TBT. In addition, the imposex occurrence in H. cinerea was assessed in an area with low marine traffic (Una beach), also located in Sao Paulo State. A moderate imposex incidence in O. minuta was detected in Pernambuco (% I=9.36, RPLI=4.49 and RPLIstand=4.27) and Barequecaba (% I=2.42, RPLI=0.36 and RPLIstand=0.81) beaches, indicating TBT contamination. In contrast, more severe levels of imposex were recorded for H. cinerea in Una beach (% I=12.45) and mainly in Barequecaba beach (% I=98.92, RPLI=26.65). Our results suggest that O. minuta and H. cinerea have good potential as biomonitors for TBT based on their wide geographical distribution, common occurrence in different coastal sediment habitats, easy collection, and association with TBT-contaminated sediments.

Measurements were performed on different biological levels, from the molecular to the organismal, including measurements of messenger RNA (mRNA), proteins, cellular and tissue changes, and reproductive success. Results revealed that eelpout captured in Stenungsund had significantly higher hepatic ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity, high levels of both cytochrome P4501A and diablo homolog mRNA, and high prevalence of dead larvae and nuclear damage in erythrocytes. Eelpout collected in Goteborg harbor displayed extensive macrovesicular steatosis, whereby the majority of hepatocytes were affected throughout the liver, which could indicate an effect on lipid metabolism. Results also indicate that eelpouts collected at polluted sites might have an affected immune system, with lower mRNA expression of genes involved in the innate immune system and a higher number of lymphocytes. Biomarker assessment also was performed on livers dissected from unborn eelpout larvae collected from the ovary of the females. No significant differences were noted, which might indicate that the larvae to some extent are protected from effects of environmental pollutants. In conclusion, usage of the selected set of biological markers, covering responses from gene to organism, has demonstrated site-specific biomarker patterns that provided a broad and comprehensive picture of the impact of environmental stressors.

In the past years, coastal waters have been exposed to an increase in copper concentration due to anthropogenic inputs. One well known case is the Chanaral area (Easter South Pacific coast), where a long term coastal copper enrichment event has occurred. That event strongly affected benthic marine diversity, including microbial communities. In this work, microcosm experiments were carried out to address the changes on picophytoplankton community composition of the disturbed area, when challenged to copper additions. Eukaryotic picophytoplankton communities from two areas were analyzed: one in the most copper-perturbed area and another at the north edge of the perturbed area. Flow cytometry data showed that 25g L-1 of copper addition exerted a positive effect in the growth kinetics on part of the eukaryotic picophytoplankton communities, independently of the site. 16S-plastid terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms analysis suggested that eukaryotic picophytoplankton display a short and directional response to high copper levels. Members of the Prasinophyceae class, a Coscinodiscophyceae diatom, as well as Phaeocystis, respond in a short time to the environmental disturbance, making them excellent candidates for further studies to evaluate phytoplanktonic species as sentinels for copper disturbances in coastal marine ecosystems.

Habitat selection and utilization of white croaker (Genyonemus lineatus) in the Los Angeles and Long Beach Harbors and the development of predictive habitat use models	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												White croaker (Genyonemus lineatus) are a sentinel fish species for contamination due to their direct interaction with contaminated sediments through benthic foraging. White croaker within the Los Angeles (LA) and Long Beach (LB) Harbor exhibited hierarchical habitat selection: avoiding dredged areas while selecting for areas of high sediment total organic carbon (4.8-8.1%), high polychaete density (406 -700 polychaetes/0.1 m(2)), and small sediment grain size (<23.5 mu m). Model results suggest that these fish are moving into shallower waters at night, which may be to forage and refuge more during the day presumably to avoid predation. The predictive model for white croaker habitat use indicated three important areas of use within the LA-LB Harbor: Consolidated Slip, Inner Long Beach Harbor, and Fish Harbor. The areas containing the most frequently selected habitats by white croaker are also often areas of high sediment contamination, and thus are likely locations where these fish are acquiring contaminants. While many sediment mitigation alternatives exist, identifying and remediating sediments in key white croaker habitat may lead to a decrease in white croaker tissue concentrations over time if the fish continue to utilize these areas post remediation.

Seasonal Variation in the Skin Transcriptome of Common Bottlenose Dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from the Northern Gulf of Mexico	PLOS ONE												As long-lived predators that integrate exposures across multiple trophic levels, cetaceans are recognized as sentinels for the health of marine ecosystems. Their utility as sentinels requires the establishment of baseline health parameters. Because cetaceans are protected, measurements obtained with minimal disruption to free ranging animals are highly desirable. In this study we investigated the utility of skin gene expression profiling to monitor health and contaminant exposure in common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Remote integument biopsies were collected in the northern Gulf of Mexico prior to the Deep-water Horizon oil spill (May 2010) and during summer and winter for two years following oil contamination (2010-2011). A bottlenose dolphin microarray was used to characterize the skin transcriptomes of 94 individuals from three populations: Barataria Bay, Louisiana, Chandeleur Sound, Louisiana, and Mississippi Sound, Mississippi/Alabama. Skin transcriptomes did not differ significantly between populations. In contrast, season had a profound effect on gene expression, with nearly one-third of all genes on the array differing in expression between winter and the warmer seasons (moderated T-test; p<0.01, fold-change >= 1.5). Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in blubber changed concurrently, reaching > two-fold higher concentrations in summer compared to winter, due to a seasonal decrease in blubber thickness and loss of stored lipid. However, global gene expression did not correlate strongly with seasonally changing contaminant concentrations, most likely because the refractory, lipid-stored metabolites are not substrates for phase I or II xenobiotic detoxification pathways. Rather, processes related to cell proliferation, motility, and differentiation dominated the differences in expression in winter and the warmer seasons. More subtle differences were seen between spring and summer (1.5% of genes differentially expressed). However, two presumed oil-exposed animals from spring presented gene expression profiles more similar to the summer animals (presumed exposed) than to other spring animals. Seasonal effects have not previously been considered in studies assessing gene expression in cetaceans, but clearly must be taken into account when applying transcriptomic analyses to investigate their contaminant exposure or health status.																	1932-6203					JUN 25	2015	10	6							e0130934	10.1371/journal.pone.0130934								WOS:000356933800099	26110790

Rapid infection and proliferation of dactylogyrid monogeneans on gills of spotted rose snapper (Lutjanus guttatus) after transfer to a sea-cage	VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY												Finfish mariculture is typically threatened by parasite and disease outbreaks. Therefore, it is important to identify parasite species of potential risk for this activity. Snappers are valuable food fish worldwide. In the Eastern Pacific, spotted rose snapper (Lutjanus guttatus [Steindachner, 1869]) is a firm candidate for sea-cage aquaculture. In the current study, the parasitism of caged L. guttatus by dactylogyrids was evaluated for the first time during a complete farming period. Twenty five thousand juvenile fish produced at the Research Center for Food and Development (CIAD, Mazatlan Unit) were reared in a sentinel sea-cage from February to November 2012 in Mazatlan Bay, Mexico. A fish sample (n = 15) was obtained every month. Dactylogyrids from the left second gill arch were identified and quantified. A total of 18,704 dactylogyrids distributed in three species, Ewyhaliotrema perezponcei Garcia-Vargas, Fajer-Avila and Lamothe-Argumedo, 2008, E. mehen (Soler-Jimenez, Garcia-Gasca and Fajer-Avila, 2012), and Haliotrematoides guttati Garcia-Vargas, Fajer-Avila and Lamothe-Argumedo, 2008 (Monogenea: Dactylogyridae) was found, which were able to infect caged L guttatus since the first month of the farming period. Prevalence of these parasite species was 100% all the time, except for initial low values for E. mehen and H. guttati. The mean intensity of infection of each dactylogyrid species varied significantly between sampling months. Euryhaliotrema perezponcei was the most abundant parasite, reaching the highest mean intensity in May, June and July (154.3, 296.9 and 176.6 parasites/host, respectively). No clear seasonality of infection was observed; however, the influence of the water temperature on the observed infection levels is discussed. There was no mortality, change on behavior or pathological signs. However, given the rapid infection and proliferation of dactylogyrids, particularly E. perezpOncei on L. guttaus reared in a sentinel sea-cage, outbreak of these parasites could be expected when this fish species is cultured on a large scale.

This study used 16S rRNA gene-Illumina Miseq sequencing to investigate the microbial communities and their response to bioturbation by artificially introducing macrobenthos to the mudflat of Sansha Bay, southeast China. A total of 56 phyla were identified, dominated by delta- and gamma-Proteobacteria, with a total percentage of over 50%. Others, such as Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes and Alphaproteobacteria occupied 4-7% respectively. Eighteen genera indicating the microbial communities response to bioturbation and seasonal change were identified. Bioturbated samples contained more ecologically important genera, and untreated samples contained more genera ubiquitous in marine environments. The physicochemical characteristics did not change significantly probably due to the short time of bioremediation and low survival rate of macrobenthos, confirming that microbial communities are more sensitive and can serve as sentinels for environmental changes.

However, there are various gaps in the knowledge of many sentinel organisms and the interference of confounding factors. This work aimed (i) to develop a detailed semi-quantitative histopathological index of the digestive gland and gonad of the Mytilus galloprovincialis mussel collected from five sites contaminated with distinct patterns of organic and inorganic toxicants along the Basque coast (SE Bay of Biscay) and (ii) to investigate whether seasonal variability and parasitosis act as confounding factors. A total of twenty-three histopathological alterations were analysed in the digestive gland and gonad following a weighed condition index approach. The alterations were integrated into a single value for a better understanding of the mussels' health status. The digestive gland was consistently more damaged than the gonad. Mussels from the most impacted sites endured the most significant deleterious effects showing inflammation-related alterations together with digestive tubule atrophy and necrosis. Neoplastic diseases were scarce, with only a few cases of fibromas (benign neoplasia). In contrast, in moderately or little impacted sites, contamination levels did not cause significant tissue damage. However, parasites contributed to overestimating the values of histopathological indices (i.e. more severe tissue damage) in mussels from little impacted sites, whilst the opposite occurred in mussels from highly polluted sites. Accordingly, inter-site differences were more pronounced in autumn when natural physiological responses of advanced maturation stages did not interfere in the histological response. In conclusion, although seasonal variability and parasitosis mask the response of histopathological indices, this biomonitoring approach may provide good sensitivity for assessing the health status of mussels if fluctuations of these confounding factors are considered.

Persistent organic pollutants in a marine bivalve on the Marennes-Oleron Bay and the Gironde Estuary (French Atlantic Coast)-Part 1: Bioaccumulation	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The aim of this study was to determine 1) the relevance of using the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas as a sentinel organism, at a juvenile stage, for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and persistent organic pollutant (polychlorobiphenyl, PCB, polybromodimethylether, PBDE, and organochlorine pesticide, OCP) contamination, 2) the potential levels of chemical organic contamination in the Marennes-Oleron Bay, and their potential sources and 3) the potential influence of physiological or environmental factors on contaminant body burdens in oysters. To this end, juvenile oysters purchased from an oyster hatchery were transplanted to a reference site, in Bouin, and to different transplantation sites in the Marennes-Oleron Bay, the first oyster production area in France, and in the Gironde Estuary, the biggest estuary in Occidental Europe. Transplantations were done during summer and winter. Whole oyster soft tissues from each site were analysed for PAHs, PCBs, PBDEs and OCPs. Results obtained with a transplantation period of 3 months suggest that C. gigas, at the juvenile stage, is a relevant sentinel organism for short-term assessment of contamination for these contaminants. In addition, no significant effects of physiological factors on contaminant body burdens were observed. Principal component analysis revealed two distinct groups of contaminants (PAHs and OPCs, and PCBs and PBDEs) and three groups of sites: 1) the reference site, 2) Les Palles (LP) and Boyard (BOY) in winter and 3) all the other sites. The group of LP and BOY was clearly defined by the levels of PAHs and OCPs, suggesting higher levels of contamination of these chemical compounds on these sites, potentially due to local contamination sources. In addition, no relevant effects of physiological or environmental factors on contaminant body burdens were observed. Results suggest also a predominance of contaminants related to agricultural activities along the Marennes-Oleron Bay, and therefore, further studies on the presence of pesticides in this region should be considered.

Use of multiple cell and tissue-level biomarkers in mussels collected along two gas fields in the northern Adriatic Sea as a tool for long term environmental monitoring	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												As a consequence of the growing global demand of energy supplies, intense oil and gas exploration and exploitation programs have been carried out worldwide especially within the marine environments. The release of oil-derived compounds in the sea from anthropogenic sources both as effluents or accidental spill is perceived as a major environmental concern. An approach based on a combination of biomarkers and the distribution of some classes of environmentally relevant pollutants was used to investigate the occurrence of a stress syndrome in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) collected at three gas platforms placed in two distinct oceanographic districts within the Adriatic Sea. Biological responses were integrated by a ranking algorithm which demonstrated both a range of biological effects reflecting exposure gradients and a temporal related trend in the investigated responses. The overall results demonstrate a moderate to absent pollution from studied gas platforms with low but remarkable biological disturbance in sentinel organisms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Plasma cholinesterase activity as environmental impact biomarker for green turtles (Chelonia mydas) on the coast of Fernando de Noronha, Pernambuco, Brazil	PESQUISA VETERINARIA BRASILEIRA												Biomarkers can be used in a predictive manner, permitting actions control to be taken before they occur irreversible damage with severe environmental ecological consequences, however, sentinel species are needed to evaluate these markers. Sea turtles affected by fibropapillomas are considered sentinel species, signaling the marine environmental imbalance in their areas of occurrence. With the objective to use the plasma cholinesterase activity in green turtles (Chelonia mydas) as a biomarker, the measurement of enzyme activity was evaluated in healthy animals and in location of low pollution impact (Fernando de Noronha, Pernambuco, Brazil) to serve as a reference for comparison with animals trapped in places with higher pollution impact. Were analyzed heparinized plasma samples from 35 captured animals. All samples analyzed showed enzymatic activity of plasma cholinesterase. The values obtained ranged between 162379 IU/L, with mean and standard deviation of 216.4 +/- 51.4 IU/L. In studies of repeatability and reproducibility were obtained variance coefficients of less than 5% in all analyzes, so the analytical methodology proved successful. The longevity of marine turtles of the species C. mydas, feeding behavior, along with the fact possess detectable enzyme activity may indicate this species as a bioindicator of exposure to pollutants that influence plasma cholinesterase activity.

During postmortem investigations of stranded sea otters from 2004 to 2013 in California, US, papillomas were detected in the oral cavity of at least seven otters via necropsy and histopathology. Next-generation sequencing of viral particles purified from a single papilloma revealed a novel papillomavirus, Enhydra lutris papillomavirus 1 (ElPV-1). The genome of ElPV-1 was obtained, representing the first fully sequenced viral genome from southern sea otters. Phylogenetic analysis of the entire L1 gene, as well as a concatenated protein identities plot of all papillomaviral genes revealed that ElPV-1 is a X-papillomavirus, related to a raccoon papillomavirus (Procyon lotor papillomavirus type 1) and a canine oral papillomavirus. Immunohistochemical staining, using a cross-reactive bovine papillomavirus antibody, suggested that ElPV-1 is present in intranuclear inclusions and intracytoplasmic keratin granules. Virus-infected cells were scattered throughout the stratum granulosum and stratum spinosum of the gingival and buccal papillomas. Using ElPV-1 specific PCR, we confirmed viral DNA in oral papillomas from all seven stranded sea otters, with identical Li sequences. This virus is associated with the development of oral papillomatosis in southern sea otters.

In order to fill this gap, this study conducted an in situ biomarker approach. Mimachlamys varia were collected in contaminated and uncontaminated areas and responsiveness of oxidative stress and immunological biomarkers was evaluated in the digestive gland. In parallel, 14 trace element concentrations were evaluated in the same organ. Superoxide dismutase activity and malondialdehyde content responded efficiently to in situ contamination when a certain degree of contamination was reached. Laccase-type phenoloxidase showed a high sensitivity but saturation of the response was highlighted for the highest contaminations. Additionally, correlations were found between biomarkers and trace element concentrations. Taken together, results showed that biomarker approach conducted in the digestive gland of Mimachlamys varia represents a sensitive analytical tool to highlight ecotoxicological issues in coastal marine ecosystems.

The marine mammal microbiome: current knowledge and future directions	MICROBIOLOGY AUSTRALIA												Marine mammals are globally significant because of their sensitivity to environmental change and threatened status, often serving as 'ecosystem sentinels'(1). Disease is a major cause of marine mammal population decline and the role of the microbiome in disease has generated considerable interest. Recent research in humans has greatly enhanced our understanding of how the host-associated microbial community, the microbiome, affects host health. In this review, we provide an overview of the extent of the marine mammal microbiome with a focus on whole community characterisation using genomic methods. This research highlights the overlap in microbial communities between geographically distinct species and populations of marine mammals, suggesting tight links between marine mammals and their microbial symbionts over millions of years of evolution. An understanding of these links in both healthy and compromised hosts is essential to identifying at-risk populations and making ecologically appropriate management decisions. We advocate further development of innovative sampling and analytic techniques that advance the field of microbial ecology of marine mammals.

Bivalve mollusks, particularly mussels, are widely used as sentinel organisms in biomonitoring studies for assessing the impact of anthropogenic contaminants. The gills, mainly involved in nutrient uptake, digestion, gas exchange and neuronal signaling, are the first organ to be affected by pollutants present in the external environment, and therefore were selected as the target organ for this study. Mussels from an aquaculture farm were caged at a highly polluted petrochemical area and a reference site along the Augusta coastline (eastern Sicily, Italy) for one month. A battery of biomarkers indicative of neuronal perturbations was applied on gills in order to investigate on the serotonergic (i.e. serotonin, 5-HT, and its receptor, 5-HT3R), cholinergic (i.e. acetylcholine, acetylcholinesterase, AChE, and choline acetyltransferase, ChAT), and dopaminergic systems (i.e. tyrosine and tyrosine hydroxylase, TH). Overall, impairment in the normal ciliary motility was found in mussels caged at the polluted site. Alterations in serotoninergic and cholinergic systems were revealed, with enhancement of dopaminergic neurotransmission resulting in a cilio-inhibitory effect. However, the over-expression in 5-HT3R and ChAT at cellular level may indicate an adaptive response of mussels to recover a regular physiological activity in gills. To our knowledge, this is the first study that uses H-1 NMR and immunohistochemical assays. Their concurrent use demonstrated to be sensitive and effective for assessing environmental influences on the health status of aquatic organisms, and thus suitable to be applied in ecotoxicological studies.

We studied zooplankton-feeding little auks (Alle alle), a key sentinel species of the Arctic, at their northernmost breeding site in Franz-Josef Land (80 degrees N), Russian Arctic. We tested the hypothesis that little auks still benefit from pristine arctic environmental conditions in this remote area. To this end, we analysed remote sensing data on sea-ice and coastal glacier dynamics collected in our study area across 1979-2013. Further, we recorded little auk foraging behaviour using miniature electronic tags attached to the birds in the summer of 2013, and compared it with similar data collected at three localities across the Atlantic Arctic. We also compared current and historical data on Franz-Josef Land little auk diet, morphometrics and chick growth curves. Our analyses reveal that summer sea-ice retreated markedly during the last decade, leaving the Franz-Josef Land archipelago virtually sea-ice free each summer since 2005. This had a profound impact on little auk foraging, which lost their sea-ice-associated prey. Concomitantly, large coastal glaciers retreated rapidly, releasing large volumes of melt water. Zooplankton is stunned by cold and osmotic shock at the boundary between glacier melt and coastal waters, creating new foraging hotspots for little auks. Birds therefore switched from foraging at distant ice-edge localities, to highly profitable feeding at glacier melt-water fronts within <5km of their breeding site. Through this behavioural plasticity, little auks maintained their chick growth rates, but showed a 4% decrease in adult body mass. Our study demonstrates that arctic cryosphere changes may have antagonistic ecological consequences on coastal trophic flow. Such nonlinear responses complicate modelling exercises of current and future polar ecosystem dynamics.

J	Pinsino, A; Matranga, V				Pinsino, Annalisa; Matranga, Valeria			Sea urchin immune cells as sentinels of environmental stress	DEVELOPMENTAL AND COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY												Echinoderms, an ancient and very successful phylum of marine invertebrates, play a central role in the maintenance of ecosystem integrity and are constantly exposed to environmental pressure, including: predation, changes in temperature and pH, hypoxia, pathogens, UV radiation, metals, toxicants, and emerging pollutants like nanomaterials. The annotation of the sea urchin genome, so closely related to humans and other vertebrate genomes, revealed an unusually complex immune system, which may be the basis for why sea urchins can adapt to different marine environments and survive even in hazardous conditions. In this review, we give a brief overview of the morphological features and recognized functions of echinoderm immune cells with a focus on studies correlating stress and immunity in the sea urchin. Immune cells from adult Paracentrotus lividus, which have been introduced in the last fifteen years as sentinels of environmental stress, are valid tools to uncover basic molecular and regulatory mechanisms of immune responses, supporting their use in immunological research. Here we summarize laboratory and field studies that reveal the amenability of sea urchin immune cells for toxicological testing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The average levels, in order of concentration, were 14.64 mg/kg As, 3.58 mg/kg Cr, 1.18 mg/kg Pb, 1.15 mg/kg Ni, and 0.07 mg/kg Cd. Dry weight concentrations described bioaccumulation of As and Cr, and, to a lesser extent, Ni and Pb. A hotspot of As at the station near the delta of Marangone stream reflected the effect of mine waste deposits of galena, pyrite, and marcasite in this basin. The As concentration in the northern part of the study area increased closer to the Mignone delta, and according to the prevailing winds, this could reflect enrichment from the combustion of coal at the Torrevaldaliga power plant. Comparing data with the literature, As in marine sediments show a ratio of 0.7 in the tissues of P. lividus from the Civitavecchia area. These results were also compared to those found in P. lividus in an environmental biomonitoring program currently ongoing to control the emissions from the coal-fired power plant in Torrevaldaliga Nord, highlighting a substantial quantitative correspondence. In view of the presence of various industrial activities in the study area that can influence the enrichment of these elements, this work emphasizes the need for performing further studies aimed at assessing the actual contribution of anthropogenic activities even when the background concentrations in marine sediments and marine organisms are high, because burning coal is considered the major anthropogenic source of many trace elements especially As.

Marine mammals are sentinels of persistent and bioaccumulative contaminants due to their longevity and high trophic position. Using nontargeted analysis, we constructed a mass spectral library of 327 persistent and bioaccumulative compounds identified in blubber from two ecotypes of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) sampled in the Southern California Bight. This library of halogenated organic compounds (HOCs) consisted of 180 anthropogenic contaminants, 41 natural products, 4 with mixed sources, 8 with unknown sources, and 94 with partial structural characterization and unknown sources. The abundance of compounds whose structures could not be fully elucidated highlights the prevalence of undiscovered HOCs accumulating in marine food webs. Eighty-six percent of the identified compounds are not currently monitored, including 133 known anthropogenic chemicals. Compounds related to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) were the most abundant. Natural products were, in some cases, detected at abundances similar to anthropogenic compounds. The profile of naturally occurring HOCs differed between ecotypes, suggesting more abundant offshore sources of these compounds. This nontargeted analytical framework provided a comprehensive list of HOCs that may be characteristic of the region, and its application within monitoring surveys may suggest new chemicals for evaluation.

Prooxidant-antioxidant balance (PAB) as a novel approach in biomonitoring of marine environments	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Cadmium and 17 beta-estradiol are rapidly accumulated in mussel tissues, making mussels excellent pollution sentinel organisms. The aim of the present study was to compare the oxidative responses of the mussels after I, 3 and 7 days of exposure to cadmium with those to 17 beta-estradiol and subsequently, to suggest a multi-parametric approach for biomonitoring studies. Our results showed that environmentally relevant concentrations of either cadmium or 17 beta-estradiol for 1, 3 and 7 days induced oxidative stress in hemocytes of exposed mussels. The latter was determined by significantly increased ROS levels and apoptosis, by suppression of antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) expression levels and subsequent increased prooxidant levels, as measured by prooxidant-antioxidant balance (PAB) assay. To our knowledge this is the first time that prooxidant-antioxidant balance is evaluated in invertebrates as an index of oxidative stress. The simultaneous use of the parameters of prooxidant-antioxidant balance and antioxidant enzymes expression patterns, in combination with ROS production levels and apoptosis, in mussel hemocytes is suggested as an approach that may help to better evaluate the impact of environmental pollution on marine organisms and thereupon ecosystems.

J	Arellano-Peralta, VA; Medrano-Gonzalez, L				Arellano-Peralta, Veronica A.; Medrano-Gonzalez, Luis			Ecology, conservation and human history of marine mammals in the Gulf of California and Pacific coast of Baja California, Mexico	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												In total, 43 marine mammal species, eight of which are threatened, inhabit the Gulf of California and Pacific coast of Baja California. The unique attributes of marine mammal fauna such as species richness, risk condition, energy consumption and calving in this region are historically and geographically important. Marine mammals in the Baja California seas have been hunted for the past 10,000 years and they are also currently subject to severe anthropogenic impacts. Commercial hunting started in the late 18th century and some populations declined until the 1970s. Anthropogenic impacts on marine mammals diversified during the 20th century, with fisheries and pollution now being their greatest threats. Currently, the coasts surrounding Baja California seas are home to 3.06% of Mexican people and 1.77% live in relation with maritime activities. This is a relatively small population that has been growing since the Spanish conquest in the 16th century together with decimation of the regional indigenous populations. The scarce people around Baja California seas have important contributions to Mexican economy and marine disturbance, mostly because the arid environments of northwestern Mexico have historically encouraged marine fisheries as the major intake of natural living resources in the region. Therefore, the region's environmental problems do not stem from an overpopulation requiring ecosystem services, with the exception that exhaustion of the underground aquifers is of great concern, but from historical Problems related with social and economic development. Conservation of marine mammals in the Baja California seas may be helpful to geographically and socially integrate human development and ecosystem protection, to address current problems of illegality, sectorial conflicts and partiality in conservation actions as well as to monitor the modifications and functionality of the marine ecosystem.

After 6 months commissioning phase from its lunch on April 3rd 2014, S1-A started to systematically deliver data to Copernicus Ocean, Land and Emergency services. Interferometric Wide Swath (IWS) mode in dual-polarization VV+VH is the standard acquisition mode used for the observation of the European marine environment. The objectives of this study are the comparison and synergetic use of the S1-A imagery in IWS mode with TerraSAR-X (TS-X) imagery in StripMap mode for SAR ship detection application. Exemplary dataset acquired over the English Channel during a controlled experiment is used to pursue the objective. Automatic Identification System ships messages received by terrestrial stations in the area are used as ground truth and to identify the SAR detections.																	2153-6996		978-1-4799-7929-5				2015							3282	3285										WOS:000371696703094

A CA-CFAR AND LOCALIZED WAVELET SHIP DETECTOR FOR SENTINEL-1 IMAGERY	2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS)	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS				IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 26-31, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE				The Maritime Domain Awareness initiative seeks to constantly improve the ways in which maritime information is collected. With the recent release of free Sentinel-1 imagery to the public, monitoring the maritime environment has become a more affordable. Using the basis of a cell-averaging constant false alarm rate prescreening method as input, this paper presents a novel method for detecting ships within Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery using a Gabor wavelet correlator. The method proposed allows for any configuration of the filter bank and prevents false detections by processing possible targets at a local scale. The method was tested against two Sentinel-1 images in both HH and HV polarization with a total of 82 ships. The method provided significantly improved FAR over the conventional CA-CFAR method at the cost of slightly worse detection accuracies in some cases.																	2153-6996		978-1-4799-7929-5				2015							3707	3710										WOS:000371696703202

SHIP DETECTION IN SENTINEL-1 IMAGERY USING THE H-DOME TRANSFORMATION	2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS)	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS				IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 26-31, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE				The ability to reliably detect ships within the ocean is one of the core capabilities of Maritime Domain Awareness. Constant improvements are pursued in both computational speed and reliable responses to events by exploring new ship detection methods. One such improvement is the availability of Sentinel-1 imagery. Owing to the fact that ships are considered locally bright objects, we propose using the H-dome transform to process the SAR image and improve ship detectability. The method was tested against two Sentinel-1 images in both HH and HV polarizations containing 82 ships. The method improved the false alarm rates when compared to the conventional cell-averaging Constant False Alarm Rate method at a minor reduction in detection accuracy.																	2153-6996		978-1-4799-7929-5				2015							3711	3714										WOS:000371696703203

The project is aiming to prepare a technical infrastructure and set in motion operational procedures for the satellite monitoring of the Baltic Sea ecosystem. The main sources of input data for this system will be the results of systematic observations by metrological and environmental satellites such as TIROS N/NOAA, MSG (currently Meteosat 10), EOS/AQUA and Sentinel - 1, 2, 3 (in the future). The system will deliver on a routine basis the variety of structural and functional properties of this sea, based on data provided by relevant satellites and supported by hydro-biological models. Among them: the solar radiation influx to the sea's waters in various spectral intervals, energy balances of the short- and long-wave radiation at the Baltic Sea surface and in the upper layers of the atmosphere over the Baltic, sea surface temperature distribution, dynamic states of the water surface, concentrations of chlorophyll a and other phytoplankton pigments in the Baltic waters, spatial distributions of algal blooms, the occurrence of coastal upwelling events, and the characteristics of primary production of organic matter and photosynthetically released oxygen in the water and many others. The structure of the system and preliminary results will be presented.

When the oil on the surface irradiated by the specific wavelength of ultraviolet light, it will be excited to produce fluorescence. In order to design a real-time monitoring equipment of oil spill, fluorescence received path and pulsed light emitting devices were built, as well as the special circuits to capture the fluorescence peaks. The results of experiments show that the key issues were solved in the designed oil spill detecting equipment, and the monitoring system can effectively distinguish the water surface with oil from which without.																			978-1-60595-248-2				2015							130	136										WOS:000361104200022

Occurrence of Human Pathogenic Bacteria and Toxoplasma gondii in Cetaceans Stranded in the Philippines: Providing Clues on Ocean Health Status	AQUATIC MAMMALS												The general consensus of a rapidly changing ocean ecosystem being affected by anthropogenic activities needs to be understood in relation to both wildlife and human health. The risks and challenges for the Philippines include lack of scientific information on waterborne diseases that are potentially zoonotic. The present study fills in this knowledge gap by detecting the occurrence of bacteria, Giardia, and Toxoplasma gondii in locally found cetacean species. Cetaceans (n = 30) that stranded from January 2012 through March 2013 were appropriately responded to, and biological materials were taken whenever applicable. A total of 25 bacteria were isolated from nine stranders. Phenotypic and genotypic methods of isolate identification yielded 12 consensus genera: Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Burkholderia, Enterococcus, Moraxella, Proteus, Providencia, Rhizobium, Serratia, Sphingomonas, Staphylococcus, and Vibrio. No screened strander was positive for Giardia. Serological assay detected antibodies for T. gondii in five stranders, while nested polymerase chain reaction positively amplified the B1 gene of the parasite in two stranders. This study provides the first report on bacteria and T. gondii in cetaceans found in the Philippines. Since the detected microorganisms include species recognized to cause new infections in marine mammals worldwide, the findings of the study underscore the potential of stranded cetaceans to serve as sentinels for studying the movement of emerging pathogens in marine habitats, provide clues on the health status of their free-ranging populations, and present the health risks available to humans who share the same water resource with them.																	0167-5427						2015	41	2					149	166		10.1578/AM.41.2.2015.149								WOS:000358296900003

Out in the wash: spatial ecology of a temperate marine shallow rocky-reef species derived using acoustic telemetry	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Characterising the movement and habitat affinities of fish is a fundamental component in understanding the functioning of marine ecosystems. A comprehensive array of acoustic receivers was deployed at two near-shore coastal sites in south-eastern Australia, to examine the movements, activity-space size and residency of a temperate rocky-reef, herbivorous species Girella elevata. Twenty-four G. elevata individuals were internally tagged with pressure-sensing acoustic transmitters across these two arrays and monitored for up to 550 days. An existing network of coastal receivers was used to examine large-scale movement patterns. Individuals exhibited varying residency, but all had small activity-space sizes within the arrays. The species utilised shallow rocky-reef habitat, displaying unimodal or bimodal patterns in depth use. A positive correlation was observed between wind speed and the detection depth of fish, with fish being likely to move to deeper water to escape periods of adverse conditions. Detection frequency data, corrected using sentinel tags, generally illustrated diurnal behaviour. Patterns of habitat usage, residency and spatial utilisation highlighted the susceptibility of G. elevata to recreational fishing pressure. The results from the present study will further contribute to the spatial information required in the zoning of effective marine protected areas, and our understanding of temperate reef fish ecology.

Overfishing of marine resources: some lessons from the assessment of demersal stocks off Mauritania	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												The recent, rapid development of fishing in Mauritania offers a good case study for a comparative approach of the resilience of the species exploited there, in the face of increasing fishing pressure. First, we assessed the health of 22 demersal stocks with differing ecological requirements, demographic strategies, and states of exploitation. A dynamic production model was fitted in a framework of Bayesian statistics to abundance indices estimated from scientific trawl surveys or commercial catch per unit efforts. We show that 12 of the 22 stocks assessed are overexploited and 3 are fully exploited. The combined assessment of all 22 stocks demonstrates an overall overexploitation, with total demersal biomass decreasing by similar to 75% since 1982 and fishing effort 30% higher than that at maximum sustained yield (40% higher for finfish). Second, relations between states of stocks and life history traits were analysed. The stocks of large and vulnerable species currently undergo the highest fishing pressure and are those that are the most overexploited. At the scale of the community represented by the stocks considered, surveys-based indictors of the mean intrinsic vulnerability, the mean maximum length, and the mean trophic level exhibit a significant decrease from 1990 to 2010. Changes observed in catch-based indicators depend on fishing strategies and are impacted by the recent development of the small-scale fishery. But indicators expressed as a function of a multiplier of fishing effort or fishing mortality clearly decrease, thus confirming that the intensification of exploitation leads to communities dominated by smaller species and lower trophic levels. We conclude that large and high trophic level species, such as white grouper, meagre, guitarfish, and smooth-hound, are markers of ecosystem health and should be considered as sentinel species.				martel, celine/O-6651-2016; Gascuel, Didier/C-1439-2011	martel, celine/0000-0002-1800-4558; Gascuel, Didier/0000-0001-5447-6977												1054-3139	1095-9289				JAN-FEB	2015	72	2					414	427		10.1093/icesjms/fsu144								WOS:000350154300010

The comet assay in Environmental Risk Assessment of marine pollutants: applications, assets and handicaps of surveying genotoxicity in non-model organisms	MUTAGENESIS												Determining the genotoxic effects of pollutants has long been a priority in Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) for coastal ecosystems, especially of complex areas such as estuaries and other confined waterbodies. The acknowledged link between DNA damage, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity to the exposure to certain toxicants has been responsible to the growing interest in determining the genotoxic effects of xenobiotics to wildlife as a measure of environmental risk. The comet assay, although widely employed in in vivo and in vitro toxicology, still holds many constraints in ERA, in large part owing to difficulties in obtaining conclusive cause-effect relationships from complex environments. Nevertheless, these challenges do not hinder the attempts to apply the alkaline comet assay on sentinel organisms, wild or subjected to bioassays in or ex situ (from fish to molluscs) as well to standardise protocols and establish general guidelines to the interpretation of findings. Fish have been regarded as an appealing subject due to the ease of performing the comet assay in whole blood. However, the application of the comet assay is becoming increasingly common in invertebrates (e.g. in molluscan haemocytes and solid tissues such as gills). Virtually all sorts of results have been obtained from the application of the comet assay in ERA (null, positive and inconclusive). However, it has become clear that interpreting DNA damage data from wild organisms is particularly challenging due to their ability to adapt to continuous environmental stressors, including toxicants. Also, the comet assay in non-model organisms for the purpose of ERA implies different constraints, assumptions and interpretation of findings, compared with the in vitro procedures from which most guidelines have been derived. This paper critically reviews the application of the comet assay in ERA, focusing on target organisms and tissues; protocol developments, case studies plus data handling and interpretation.

Impacts of Coastal Development on the Ecology of Tidal Creek Ecosystems of the US Southeast Including Consequences to Humans	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Upland areas of southeastern United States tidal creek watersheds are popular locations for development, and they form part of the estuarine ecosystem characterized by high economic and ecological value. The primary objective of this work was to define the relationships between coastal development, with its concomitant land use changes and associated increases in nonpoint source pollution loading, and the ecological condition of tidal creek ecosystems including related consequences to human populations and coastal communities. Nineteen tidal creek systems, located along the southeastern US coast from southern North Carolina to southern Georgia, were sampled in the summer, 2005 and 2006. Within each system, creeks were divided into two primary segments based upon tidal zoning-intertidal (i.e., shallow, narrow headwater sections) and subtidal (i.e., deeper and wider sections)-and then watersheds were delineated for each segment. Relationships between coastal development, concomitant land use changes, nonpoint source pollution loading, the ecological condition of tidal creek ecosystems, and the potential impacts to human populations and coastal communities were evaluated. In particular, relationships were identified between the amount of impervious cover (indicator of coastal development) and a range of exposure and response measures including increased chemical contamination of the sediments, increased pathogens in the water, increased nitrate/nitrite levels, increased salinity range, decreased biological productivity of the macrobenthos, alterations to the food web, increased flooding potential, and increased human risk of exposure to pathogens and harmful chemicals. The integrity of tidal creeks, particularly the headwaters or intertidally dominated sections, was impaired by increases in nonpoint source pollution associated with sprawling urbanization (i.e., increases in impervious cover). This finding suggests that these habitats are valuable early warning sentinels of ensuing ecological impacts and potential public health and flooding risk from sprawling coastal development. The results also validate the use of a conceptual model with impervious cover thresholds for tidal creek systems in the southeast region.																	1559-2723	1559-2731				JAN	2015	38			1			S49	S66		10.1007/s12237-013-9635-y								WOS:000347956700005						
J	Cook, TC; James, K; Bearzi, M				Cook, Taylor C.; James, Kira; Bearzi, Maddalena			Angler perceptions of California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) depredation and marine policy in Southern California	MARINE POLICY												California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) off the coast of Southern California are known to damage both commercial and recreational fishing activities, causing decreases to fish catch and damage to gear. Their increasing population has intensified the potential for conflict between sea lions and anglers, likely requiring changes to current legislation. The recreational fishing community in Southern California is a valuable and largely underutilized source for information and potential solutions to management and legislative problems. This recreational fishing survey-based study conducted in 2013 utilized personal interviews, conducted in the field with recreational anglers and commercial passenger fishing vessel (CPFV) crews in Southern California, to gather data on: (a) the occurrence and impact of sea lion depredation on the local fishing, (b) angler awareness and opinions on current legislation, and (c) the conflict between fishing activities and conservation efforts. Results show that surveyed CPFV operators and private boaters had the most conflict with sea lions and perceive them as more of a problem than anglers on piers, jetties or kayaks. The conflict was also reportedly more prevalent in San Diego County compared to the other counties surveyed (Orange, Los Angeles and Ventura). Participating CPFV operators were overwhelmingly in support of a government culling program for sea lions, while recreational angler respondents did not feel that a control program was necessary. These CPFV operators reported more money lost, and were willing to pay more for an effective deterrent device. There was also a consensus among respondents that fish catch is declining, yet anglers were unsatisfied with the effectiveness of current legislation designed to increase fish stocks. These data will provide a better understanding of California sea lion depredation in Southern California and its effect on recreational anglers in order to aid future mitigation efforts. Additionally, these results provide stakeholder feedback on local marine protected areas and other fisheries management legislation, and build a foundation for future conservation and education programs.

Evidence of land-sea transfer of the zoonotic pathogen Campylobacter to a wildlife marine sentinel species	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Environmental pollution often accompanies the expansion and urbanization of human populations where sewage and wastewaters commonly have an impact on the marine environments. Here, we explored the potential for faecal bacterial pathogens, of anthropic origin, to spread to marine wildlife in coastal areas. The common zoonotic bacterium Campylobacter was isolated from grey seals (Halichoerus grypus), an important sentinel species for environmental pollution, and compared to isolates from wild birds, agricultural sources and clinical samples to characterize possible transmission routes. Campylobacter jejuni was present in half of all grey seal pups sampled (24/50 dead and 46/90 live pups) in the breeding colony on the Isle of May (Scotland), where it was frequently associated with histological evidence of disease. Returning yearling animals (19/19) were negative for C.jejuni suggesting clearance of infection while away from the localized colony infection source. The genomes of 90 isolates from seals were sequenced and characterized using a whole-genome multilocus sequence typing (MLST) approach and compared to 192 published genomes from multiple sources using population genetic approaches and a probabilistic genetic attribution model to infer the source of infection from MLST data. The strong genotype-host association has enabled the application of source attribution models in epidemiological studies of human campylobacteriosis, and here assignment analyses consistently grouped seal isolates with those from human clinical samples. These findings are consistent with either a common infection source or direct transmission of human campylobacter to grey seals, raising concerns about the spread of human pathogens to wildlife marine sentinel species in coastal areas.

Fatty acids and stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) reveal temporal changes in narwhal (Monodon monoceros) diet linked to migration patterns	MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE												Narwhals (Monodon monoceros) are sentinel species in the Arctic and to investigate marine food web changes from 1982-2011 we examined diet using fatty acids, N-15, and C-13, in narwhals from Baffin Bay (BB) and northern Hudson Bay (NHB). We predicted temporal changes would be greater in NHB due to a significant reduction in summer ice cover. In NHB, N-15 significantly increased, C-13 displayed a parabolic trend, and fatty acids gradually shifted, albeit not significantly, over time. N-15 was stable, C-13 decreased, and fatty acids significantly changed over time in BB. Stable isotope mixing models indicated a dietary reduction in capelin and increase in Greenland halibut from 1994-2000 to 2006-2011 in BB, while capelin was an important dietary component for narwhals in NHB in recent years (2006-2011). These dietary changes may be attributed to changes in sea ice and narwhal migration. Seasonal dietary changes, as evidenced by changes in blubber fatty acids and skin and muscle stable isotopes, were not as apparent in the NHB population, which may be indicative of a reduced migratory distance. Long-term monitoring of narwhal diet and migratory patterns associated with reduced sea ice provides invaluable information about how the marine ecosystem will redistribute with global warming.																	0824-0469	1748-7692				JAN	2015	31	1					21	44		10.1111/mms.12131								WOS:000346769200002

Tim			Effects of wildfire on sea otter (Enhydra lutris) gene transcript profiles	MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE												Wildfires have been shown to impact terrestrial species over a range of temporal scales. Little is known, however, about the more subtle toxicological effects of wildfires, particularly in downstream marine or downwind locations from the wildfire perimeter. These down-current effects may be just as substantial as those effects within the perimeter. We used gene transcription technology, a sensitive indicator of immunological perturbation, to study the effects of the 2008 Basin Complex Fire on the California coast on a sentinel marine species, the sea otter (Enhydra lutris). We captured sea otters in 2008 (3 mo after the Basin Complex Fire was controlled) and 2009 (15 mo after the Basin Complex Fire was controlled) in the adjacent nearshore environment near Big Sur, California. Gene responses were distinctly different between Big Sur temporal groups, signifying detoxification of PAHs, possible associated response to potential malignant transformation, and suppression of immune function as the primary responses of sea otters to fire in 2008 compared to those captured in 2009. In general, gene transcription patterns in the 2008 sea otters were indicative of molecular reactions to organic exposure, malignant transformation, and decreased ability to respond to pathogens that seemed to consistent with short-term hydrocarbon exposure.																	0824-0469	1748-7692				JAN	2015	31	1					191	210		10.1111/mms.12151								WOS:000346769200011

In an era of environmental change, monitoring top predators species can provide valuable insights into the zones of ecological importance that need to be protected. In this context, we monitored the Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) as a bio-indicator near Dumont d'Urville, an area of the East Antarctic sector currently being considered for the establishment of a Marine Protected Area ( MPA), using GPS-based tracking tags during the 2012/13 austral summer breeding season. Results: The habitat use and foraging areas of the penguins differed by breeding stage and sex and were strongly associated with patterns in bathymetry and sea-ice distribution. The first trips, undertaken during the incubation phase, were longer than those during the guard phase and were associated with the northern limit of the sea-ice extent. During the guard phase, birds strongly depended on access to a polynya, a key feature in Antarctic marine ecosystem, in the vicinity of the colony. The opening of the ice-free area was synchronous with the hatching of chicks. Moreover, a sex-specific use of foraging habitat observed only after hatching suggests sex-specific differences in the diet in response to intra-specific competition. Conclusions: Sea-ice features that could be affected by the climate change were important factors for the use of foraging habitat by the Adlie penguins. The extent of the foraging area observed in this study is congruent with the area of the proposed MPA. However, both penguin behavior and their environment should be monitored carefully.																	2051-3933						2015	3								30	10.1186/s40462-015-0052								WOS:000215741800030	26392864

Biotechnological Potential of Marine Microbes	SPRINGER HANDBOOK OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY												The world's oceans, from the coasts to the abysses, harbor an incredible level of microbial diversity. This marine microbial biosphere is an enormous, untapped resource of biotechnological interest. This chapter reviews the potential of marine microbes in biotechnology. The biotechnological potential is considerable, ranging from the synthesis of bioactive molecules to the production of biofuels, cosmeceuticals, nutraceuticals, and biopolymers; from the engineering of marine microbes for biomedical purposes to the degradation of pollutants, and the use of microbial biosensors as sentinels for environmental quality. Marine viruses have great biotechnological potential, yet the exploration of the marine virome, and the associated gene and protein pool, is only beginning. Marine archaea have so far been exploited for the isolation of enzymes, yet many biotechnological exploitations can be foreseen. Bacteria and microbial eukaryotes, especially fungi and photosynthetic protists, provide an important contribution to biotechnology; the combination of omics-driven technologies and improved cultivation techniques is widening the knowledge on their biological diversity, paving the way for new biotechnological exploitations. The exploration of the marine microbial biosphere, and its extraordinary genetic and physiological diversity, will undoubtedly continue to offer chances for the development of new and sustainable blue biotechnologies, helping to solve important societal challenges of the twenty-first century.																			978-3-642-53971-8; 978-3-642-53970-1				2015							651	661			10.1007/978-3-642-53971-8							WOS:000401724500026

Within this context, this paper presents a methodological approach for a fast and repeatable monitoring that allows quantitative assessment of seabed abrasion pressure due to recreational boat anchoring. The methodology consists of two steps: a semi-automatic procedure based on an algorithm for the ship detection in SAR imagery and a statistical model to obtain maps of spatial and temporal distribution density of anchored boats. Ship detection processing has been performed on 36 ASAR VV-pol images of Liguria test site, for the three years 2008, 2009 and 2010. Starting from the pointwise distribution layer produced by ship detection in imagery, boats points have been subdivided into 4 areas where a constant distribution density has been assumed for the entire period 2008-2010. In the future, this methodology will be applied also to higher resolution data of Sentinel-1 mission, specifically designed for the operational needs of the European Programme Copernicus.

Molecular biomarkers in grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) to evaluate pollutant exposure, health and immune status	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Grey seals as top-predators bioaccumulate contaminants and can be considered as sentinels of ecosystem health. Pups are weaned after a short nursing period, characterised by an enormous lipid transfer and exposure to contaminants. This study established molecular biomarkers of the xenobiotic metabolism and immune system to help assess health and immune status. mRNA transcription of AHR, ARNT, PPAR alpha and cytokine IL-2 and heat-shock-protein HSP70 was measured in blood of grey seal pups and adults in rehabilitation and permanent care using RT-qPCR and compared to rehabilitating harbour seal pups and haematology values. In pups highest levels at admission in xenobiotic biomarker, HSP70 and cytokine transcription may show contaminant exposure via lactation, stress during abandonment and dehydration. The significant decrease may be linked to diet, health improvement and adaptation. Adults showed higher levels and more variation in biomarker transcription and clear species-specific differences between harbour and grey seal pups were found. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Domoic acid-induced seizures in California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) are associated with neuroinflammatory brain injury	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												California sea lions (CSLs) exposed to the marine biotoxin domoic acid (DA) develop an acute or chronic toxicosis marked by seizures and act as sentinels of the disease. Experimental evidence suggests that oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are important mechanisms underlying the seizurogenic potential of environmental toxicants but these pathways are relatively unstudied in CSLs. In the current study, we investigated the role of glutamate-glutamine changes and gliosis in DA-exposed CSLs to better understand the neurotoxic mechanisms occurring during DA toxicity. Sections from archived hippocampi from control and CSLs diagnosed with DA toxicosis were immunofluorescently stained for markers of gliosis, oxidative/nitrative stress and changes in glutamine synthetase (GS). Quantitative assessment revealed increasing loss of microtubule associated protein-2 positive neurons with elevations in 4-hydroxynonenal correlating with chronicity of exposure, whereas the pattern of activated glia expressing nitric oxide synthase 2 and tumor necrosis factor followed pathological severity. There was no significant change in the amount of GS positive cells but there was increased 3-nitrotyrosine in GS expressing cells and in neurons, particularly in animals with chronic DA toxicosis. These changes were consistently seen in the dentate gyrus and in the cornu ammonis (CA) sectors CA3, CA4, and CA1. The results of this study indicate that gliosis and resultant changes in GS are likely important mechanisms in DA-induced seizure that need to be further explored as potential therapies in treating exposed wildlife.

Cytochrome P4501A1 expression in blubber biopsies of endangered false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens) and nine other odontocete species from Hawai'i	ECOTOXICOLOGY												Odontocetes (toothed whales) are considered sentinel species in the marine environment because of their high trophic position, long life spans, and blubber that accumulates lipophilic contaminants. Cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) is a biomarker of exposure and molecular effects of certain persistent organic pollutants. Immunohistochemistry was used to visualize CYP1A1 expression in blubber biopsies collected by non-lethal sampling methods from 10 species of free-ranging Hawaiian odontocetes: short-finned pilot whale, melon-headed whale, pygmy killer whale, common bottlenose dolphin, rough-toothed dolphin, pantropical spotted dolphin, Blainville's beaked whale, Cuvier's beaked whale, sperm whale, and endangered main Hawaiian Islands insular false killer whale. Significantly higher levels of CYP1A1 were observed in false killer whales and rough-toothed dolphins compared to melon-headed whales, and in general, trophic position appears to influence CYP1A1 expression patterns in particular species groups. No significant differences in CYP1A1 were found based on age class or sex across all samples. However, within male false killer whales, juveniles expressed significantly higher levels of CYP1A1 when compared to adults. Total polychlorinated biphenyl (aPCBs) concentrations in 84 % of false killer whales exceeded proposed threshold levels for health effects, and aPCBs correlated with CYP1A1 expression. There was no significant relationship between PCB toxic equivalent quotient and CYP1A1 expression, suggesting that this response may be influenced by agonists other than the dioxin-like PCBs measured in this study. No significant differences were found for CYP1A1 expression among social clusters of false killer whales. This work provides a foundation for future health monitoring of the endangered stock of false killer whales and other Hawaiian odontocetes.																	0963-9292	1573-3017				NOV	2014	23	9					1607	1618		10.1007/s10646-014-1300-0								WOS:000343877400002	25134676

The results based on single-cell gel electrophoresis showed that the extent of DNA damage was significantly elevated in the polluted zone. The severity of DNA damage in the impacted zone was largely attributed to high levels of heavy metals, such as As, Zn, Pb, and Ni. The DNA damage biomarker in benthic fish was sensitive to habitat change, which suggested that this fish species and biomarker are excellent tools for risk assessment. The acute toxicity tests demonstrated that SCGE was sufficient to reflect the different genotypes and pollution statuses and to propose the possibility of zebrafish erythrocytes as competitive materials.																	0007-4861	1432-0800				NOV	2014	93	5					555	560		10.1007/s00128-014-1392-5								WOS:000343043000009	25260997					
J	Ribalta, C; Sole, M				Ribalta, Carla; Sole, Montserrat			In Vitro Interaction of Emerging Contaminants with the Cytochrome P450 System of Mediterranean Deep-Sea Fish	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The interactions of emerging contaminants with the xenobiotic and endogenous metabolizing system of deep-sea fish were compared. The drugs diclofenac, fluoxetine, and gemfibrozil belong to different pharmaceutical classes with diverse mechanistic actions, and the personal care products triclosan, galaxolide, and nonylphenol are representative of antibacterial agents, nitro-musks, and surfactants, respectively. The fish compared are representative of the middle and lower slope of deep-sea habitats. The species were adults of Trachyrynchus scabrus, Mora moro, Cataetix laticeps, and Alepocehalus rostratus. The hepatic metabolic system studied were the activities associated with several cytochrome P450 isoforms (CYPs): 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), benzyloxy-4-[trifluoromethyl]-coumarin-O-debenzyloxylase (BFCOD), and 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase (ECOD). Results showed differences in baseline activities and sensitivity to chemicals which were species, chemical, and pathway dependent. T. scabrous was the most sensitive species to chemical interactions with the xenobiotic and endogenous metabolizing (EROD and BFCOD) systems, especially in the case of diclofenac interference with BFCOD activity (IC50 = 15.7 +/- 2.2 mu M). Moreover, T. scabrous and A. rostratus possessed high basal ECOD activity, and this was greatly affected by in vitro exposure to diclofenac in T. scabrous also (IC50 = 6.86 +/- 1.4 mu M). These results highlight the sensitivity of marine fish to emerging contaminants and propose T. scabrous (middle slope) and A. rostratus (lower slope) as sentinels and the inclusion of ECOD activity as a sensitive biomarker to these exposures.

Surveillance for zoonotic and selected pathogens in harbor seals Phoca vitulina from central California	DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS												The infection status of harbor seals Phoca vitulina in central California, USA, was evaluated through broad surveillance for pathogens in stranded and wild-caught animals from 2001 to 2008, with most samples collected in 2007 and 2008. Stranded animals from Mendocino County to San Luis Obispo County were sampled at a rehabilitation facility: The Marine Mammal Center (TMMC, n = 175); wild-caught animals were sampled at 2 locations: San Francisco Bay (SF, n = 78) and Tomales Bay (TB, n = 97), that differed in degree of urbanization. Low prevalences of Salmonella, Campylobacter, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium were detected in the feces of stranded and wild-caught seals. Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli were more prevalent in the feces of stranded (58% [78 out of 135] and 76% [102 out of 135]) than wild-caught (42% [45 out of 106] and 66% [68 out of 106]) seals, whereas Vibrio spp. were 16 times more likely to be cultured from the feces of seals from SF than TB or TMMC (p < 0.005). Brucella DNA was detected in 3.4% of dead stranded harbor seals (2 out of 58). Type A influenza was isolated from feces of 1 out of 96 wild-caught seals. Exposure to Toxoplasma gondii, Sarcocystis neurona, and type A influenza was only detected in the wild-caught harbor seals (post-weaning age classes), whereas antibody titers to Leptospira spp. were detected in stranded and wild-caught seals. No stranded (n = 109) or wild-caught (n = 217) harbor seals had antibodies to phocine distemper virus, although a single low titer to canine distemper virus was detected. These results highlight the role of harbor seals as sentinel species for zoonotic and terrestrial pathogens in the marine environment.

De novo transcriptome analysis of Perna viridis highlights tissue-specific patterns for environmental studies	BMC GENOMICS												Background: The tropical green-lipped mussel Perna viridis is a common biomonitor throughout the Indo-Pacific region that is used for environmental monitoring and ecotoxicological investigations. However, there is limited molecular data available regarding this species. We sought to establish a global transcriptome database from the tissues of adductor muscle, gills and the hepatopancreas of P. viridis in an effort to advance our understanding of the molecular aspects involved during specific toxicity responses in this sentinel species. Results: Illumina sequencing results yielded 544,272,542 high-quality filtered reads. After de novo assembly using Trinity, 233,257 contigs were generated with an average length of 1,264 bp and an N50 length of 2,868 bp; 192,879 assembled transcripts and 150,111 assembled unigenes were obtained after clustering. A total of 93,668 assembled transcripts (66,692 assembled genes) with putative functions for protein domains were predicted based on InterProScan analysis. Based on similarity searches, 44,713 assembled transcripts and 25,319 assembled unigenes were annotated with at least one BLAST hit. A total of 21,262 assembled transcripts (11,947 assembled genes) were annotated with at least one well-defined Gene Ontology (GO) and 5,131 assembled transcripts (3,181 assembled unigenes) were assigned to 329 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. The quantity of assembled unigenes and transcripts obtained from male and female mussels were similar but varied among the three studied tissues, with the highest numbers recorded in the gills, followed by the hepatopancreas, and then the adductor muscle. Multivariate analyses revealed strong tissue-specific patterns among the three different tissues, but not between sexes in terms of expression profiles for annotated genes in various GO terms, and genes associated with stress responses and degradation of xenobiotics. The expression profiles of certain selected genes in each tissue type were further validated using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays and a similar tissue-specific trend was seen. Conclusions: The extensive sequence data generated from this study will provide a valuable molecular resource for facilitating environmental studies with P. viridis, and highlight the importance of tissue-specific approaches in the future.

A selection of reference genes and early-warning mRNA biomarkers for environmental monitoring using Mytilus spp. as sentinel species	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												mRNA biomarkers are promising tools for environmental health assessment and reference genes are needed to perform relevant qPCR analyses in tissue samples of sentinel species. In the present study, potential reference genes and mRNA biomarkers were tested in the gills and digestive glands of native and caged mussels (Mytilus spp.) exposed to harbor pollution. Results highlighted the difficulty to find stable reference genes in wild, non-model species and suggested the use of normalization indices instead of single genes as they exhibit a higher stability. Several target genes were found differentially expressed between mussel groups, especially in gills where cyp32, pi-gst and CuZn-sod mRNA levels could be biomarker candidates. Multivariate analyses confirmed the ability of mRNA levels to highlight site-effects and suggested the use of several combined markers instead of individual ones. These findings support the use of qPCR technology and mRNA levels as early-warning biomarkers in marine monitoring programs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Notably, the presence in the environment of some compounds termed endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can cause adverse effects on reproduction by interfering with the endocrine system. In some cases, exposure to EDCs leads to the animal feminization and male fish may develop oocytes in testis (intersex condition). Mugilid fish are well suited sentinel organisms to study the effects of reproductive EDCs in the monitoring of estuarine/marine environments. Up-regulation of aromatases and vitellogenins in males and juveniles and the presence of intersex individuals have been described in a wide array of mullet species worldwide. There is a need to develop new molecular markers to identify early feminization responses and intersex condition in fish populations, studying mechanisms that regulate gonad differentiation under exposure to xenoestrogens. Interestingly, an electrophoresis of gonad RNA, shows a strong expression of 5S rRNA in oocytes, indicating the potential of 5S rRNA and its regulating proteins to become useful molecular makers of oocyte presence in testis. Therefore, the use of these oocyte markers to sex and identify intersex mullets could constitute powerful molecular biomarkers to assess xenoestrogenicity in field conditions.

One of the main goals is to achieve Good Environmental Status (GES) in the marine environment. Environmental monitoring of biota e.g., Baltic herring and guillemot eggs, is conducted annually in Sweden to follow temporal changes in environmental contaminants. To determine the suitability of guillemot eggs as a sentinel species for investigating GES, we compared temporal trends of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs) in these two species from single sampling sites within Sweden. Lipid content from guillemot eggs was consistently high and stable (yearly mean for >40 years, similar to 12%) compared to that of herring (yearly mean for >20 years, similar to 3%). A significant decreasing trend of Sigma PCDD/F in TEQ WHO1998 was observed in guillemot eggs, but no trend was seen in herring. CB118 significantly decreased in both species, but in the last 10 years this decrease was not significant in herring. A number of advantages, such as high lipid content in the egg and a low coefficient of variation make guillemot suitable as a sentinel species. The advantages and disadvantages of using either guillemot eggs or Baltic herring are compared. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Detrital zircon provenance and paleogeography of the Pahrump Group and overlying strata, Death Valley, California	PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH												The Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic Pahrump Group of Death Valley, California spans ca. 1300-635 Ma and provides a >500 million-year record of geologic events in southwestern Laurentia. The strata analyzed include preserved sequences separated by unconformities recording syn-Rodinia basin development (Crystal Spring Formation); Rodinia stability; regional extension culminating in Neoproterozoic rifting of the Laurentian margin of Rodinia (Horse Thief Springs through Johnnie Formations); and multiple phases of glacial sedimentation and subsequent cap carbonate deposition (Kingston Peak Formation and Noonday Dolomite). U-Pb detrital zircon analyses were conducted on samples from the entire Pahrump Group and the Noonday Dolomite in the southeastern Death Valley region (20 samples, 1945 grains) to further constrain hypotheses for regional basin development during the development of the southwestern Laurentian margin. Our interpretation of provenance data expands upon and clarifies previous models defining a series of tectonostratigraphic units including: (A) the <1400 Ma basal conglomerate of the Crystal Spring Formation, comprised of metasedimentary quartzite clasts, and exhibiting a unimodal detrital zircon sample distribution at 1690 Ma with northerly source; (B) the ca. 1320-1080 Ma Crystal Spring Formation exhibiting unimodal zircon distributions derived from southerly, local Paleoproterozoic basement sources punctuated by a ca. 300 Ma duration unconformity; (C) the ca. 780-740 Ma sequence of the Horse Thief Springs Formation, Beck Spring Dolomite, and KP1 unit of Kingston Peak Formation deposited in a marine basin with mixed southwestern Laurentian provenance; (D) a ca. 710-635 Ma glaciogenic sequence (KP2-KP4 members of Kingston Peak Formation), recording the onset of Rodinia rifting, and Sturtian and Marinoan "Snowball Earth" intervals with provenance data suggesting derivation from erosion and recycling of older Pahrump Group strata; (E) the ca. 635 Ma cap dolostone of the Sentinel Peak Member of the Noonday Dolomite, representing post-glacial drainage reorganization with more regional provenance; followed by (F) the <635 Ma strata of the Radcliff Member of the Noonday Dolomite, showing a marked shift to bimodal age distributions, indicating derivation from local basement sources. These data synthesize and complement previous provenance studies from overlying units and result in the addition of ca. 500 Ma of new provenance analysis for the southwestern Laurentian margin.

Overview on the European green crab Carcinus spp. (Portunidae, Decapoda), one of the most famous marine invaders and ecotoxicological models	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Green crabs (Carcinus, Portunidae) include two species native to Europe-Carcinus aestuarii (Mediterranean species) and Carcinus maenas (Atlantic species). These small shore crabs (maximal length carapace, approximately 10 cm) show rapid growth, high fecundity, and long planktonic larval stages that facilitate broad dispersion. Carcinus spp. have a high tolerance to fluctuations of environmental factors including oxygen, salinity, temperature, xenobiotic compounds, and others. Shipping of Carcinus spp. over the past centuries has resulted in its invasions of America, Asia, and Australia. Classified as one of the world's 100 worst invaders by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, Carcinus spp. are the most widely distributed intertidal crabs in the world. Their voracious predatory activity makes them strong interactors in local communities, and they are recognized as a model for invasiveness in marine systems as well as a sentinel species in ecotoxicology. This review shows an exhaustive analysis of the literature on the life cycle, diversity, physiological tolerance, genomic investigations, ecotoxicological use, historical invasion, control programs, and putative economical valorization of shore crabs.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2014	21	15					9129	9144		10.1007/s11356-014-2979-4								WOS:000340460500018	24793074					
J	Alessi, J; Fiori, C				Alessi, Jessica; Fiori, Cristina			From science to policy-a geostatistical approach to identifying potential areas for cetacean conservation: a case study of bottlenose dolphins in the Pelagos sanctuary (Mediterranean Sea)	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												Cetaceans are top-level predators that serve as sentinels of the health and status of lower trophic levels in the marine ecosystem. For this reason they attract significant attention in marine conservation planning and often have been used to promote designation of reserve areas in many countries (e.g., Ligurian Sea, Moray Firth, Hawaiian Islands, The Gully, Wadden Sea, Banks Peninsula, and Golfo San Jos,). Many policies are designed to protect cetaceans. For example, the Habitat Directive requires member states to select, designate, and protect sites that support certain natural habitats or species, such as the bottlenose dolphin, as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) that aim to create a network of protected areas across the European Union known as Natura 2000. The boundaries of protected areas for cetacean species must be defined for management purposes. In recent years, many techniques have been developed to define the distribution of cetaceans in relation to habitat preferences. Although these models can provide an understanding of the ecological processes that determine species distribution, their application requires prior knowledge of the variables that should be included in the model, the interactions among these variables, and their effects on species distribution. Thus, the lack of available data in understudied areas precludes the application of these types of models. As an alternative, we describe a geostatistical approach to identifying areas that potentially should be designated as marine protected areas for cetaceans. We illustrate the application of the kriging algorithm to the bottlenose dolphin population that resides in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. The data derived from a 7-year survey were used. The encounter rate is the only variable required for this method, making it very easy to apply. The resulting georeferenced and high resolution map includes areas most visited by bottlenose dolphins, which are called core areas. Core areas are helpful for establishing the boundaries of marine reserves for the protection of the species. The approach described herein is accurate, precise, unbiased, replicable to all highly mobile species and easy to understand by both researchers and policy makers.

The bivalve Mytilus sp, largely utilized as a sentinel for marine contamination, has been shown to represent a significant target for different types of NP, including n-TiO2, one of the most widespread in use. In this work, the possible interactive effects of n-TiO2 and 2,3,7,8-TCDD, chosen as models of NP and organic contaminant, respectively, were investigated in Mytilus galloprovincialis. In vitro experiments with n-TiO2 and TCDD, alone and in combination, were carried out in different conditions (concentrations and times of exposure), depending on the target (hemocytes, gill cells and biopsies) and the endpoint measured. Mussels were also exposed in vivo to n-TiO2 (100 mu g L-1) or to TCDD (0.25 mu g L-1), alone and in combination, for 96 h. A wide range of biomarkers, from molecular to tissue level, were measured: lysosomal membrane stability and phagocytosis in hemocytes, ATP-binding cassette efflux transporters in gills (gene transcription and efflux activity), several biomarkers of genotoxicity in gill and digestive cells (DNA damage, random amplified polymorphic DNA-RAPD changes), lysosomal biomarkers and transcription of selected genes in the digestive gland. The results demonstrate that n-TiO2 and TCDD can exert synergistic or antagonistic effects, depending on experimental condition, cell/tissue and type of measured response. Some of these interactions may result from a significant increase in TCDD accumulation in whole mussel organisms in the presence of n-TiO2, indicating a Trojan horse effect. The results represent the most extensive data obtained so far on the sub-lethal effects of NPs and organic contaminants in aquatic organisms. Moreover, these data extend the knowledge on the molecular and cellular targets of NPs in bivalves. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Many human activities are considered to be important sources of environmental pollutants, elements among them. In this study, pet dogs were enrolled as environmental sentinels from three different areas of Campania, with a different degree of pollution, evaluating elements in blood and hair. The obtained data indicated that dogs from less polluted area were exposed to a hot spot of pollution, as only animals from one city (Sessa Aurunca) presented elements concentrations very close to toxic levels. When excluding these animals, the area proved to be the less contaminated. The present report confirm the higher degree of pollution of the most industrialized areas, and a certain concern originates from Cr, Ni and As, which are present as levels well above toxic thresholds. These data are indicative of a reduced pollution of the areas considered by Cd and Pb, but arise concern for Hg, As, Cr and Ni, which reach concentrations high enough to impact dogs and humans health, in term of acute (in the city of Sessa Aurunca) and chronic toxicity (i.e. reproduction impairment, endocrine disruption, immunosuppression). Additional studies are necessary to better define not only the precise distribution of hot spots of pollution, but also the real impact of such an exposure on the health of dogs, in term of endocrine balance and/or immune system activity.

Molecular responses of European flounder (Platichthys flesus) chronically exposed to contaminated estuarine sediments	CHEMOSPHERE												Molecular responses to acute toxicant exposure can be effective biomarkers, however responses to chronic exposure are less well characterised. The aim of this study was to determine chronic molecular responses to environmental mixtures in a controlled laboratory setting, free from the additional variability encountered with environmental sampling of wild organisms. Flounder fish were exposed in mesocosms for seven months to a contaminated estuarine sediment made by mixing material from the Forth (high organics) and Tyne (high metals and tributyltin) estuaries (FT) or a reference sediment from the Ythan estuary (Y). Chemical analyses demonstrated that FT sediment contained significantly higher concentrations of key environmental pollutants (including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), chlorinated biphenyls and heavy metals) than Y sediment, but that chronically exposed flounder showed a lack of differential accumulation of contaminants, including heavy metals. Biliary 1-hydroxypyrene concentration and erythrocyte DNA damage increased in FT-exposed fish. Transcriptomic and H-1 NMR metabolomic analyses of liver tissues detected small but statistically significant alterations between fish exposed to different sediments. These highlighted perturbance of immune response and apoptotic pathways, but there was a lack of response from traditional biomarker genes. Gene-chemical association annotation enrichment analyses suggested that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were a major class of toxicants affecting the molecular responses of the exposed fish. This demonstrated that molecular responses of sentinel organisms can be detected after chronic mixed toxicant exposure and that these can be informative of key components of the mixture.

We assessed age-weight, length-weight relationships, age structure, and reproductive status (i.e. fecundity, egg size) of the blue mussel Mytilus edulis complex from six sites in central Puget Sound, Washington, and one site in the relatively pristine area of northern Puget Sound. Results of this study suggest that mussels from urban areas of Puget Sound exhibit a lower growth rate, altered population age-structure, and potential reproductive impairment as a result of exposure to chemical contaminants. These findings support the use of mussels as sentinel species to assess the biological effects of contaminants on invertebrate populations.																	0007-4861	1432-0800				JUL	2014	93	1					7	12		10.1007/s00128-014-1287-5								WOS:000337028500002	24852611

Histopathological survey of potential biomarkers for the assessment of contaminant related biological effects in species of fish and shellfish collected from Kuwait Bay, Arabian Gulf	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The marine environment in Kuwait is dominated by Kuwait Bay, a shallow, depositional habitat vital for the breeding and propagation of marine organisms. The bay receives effluent inputs from industrial centres, ports, sewage outflows along with discharges from power and desalination plants. The major classes of pollutant discharged into the bay include petroleum hydrocarbons, metals, nutrients, cooling water and hyper-saline water. Further, the bay has been historically impacted by a deliberate release of oil and contamination with ordnance and shipwrecks during the 1991 Gulf war. With an aim to establish an integrated pollution effects monitoring programme in Kuwait, this paper describes the application of a quality assured approach to conduct a histopathology baseline survey in oriental sole (Synaptura orientalis) and the large-toothed flounder (Pseudorhombus arsius), which are two potential sentinel flatfish species present in the Arabian Gulf. Liver and gonadal histopathology revealed a range of pathologies similar to those previously observed in European and American pollution effects surveys that utilise flatfish (including pathology markers indicative of possible carcinogenesis and endocrine disruption). Further, we extended these studies to invertebrates (Jinga prawn, Metapenaeus affinis and the grooved tiger prawn, Penaeus semisulcatus) found within the Arabian Gulf. Such baseline data is essential before attempts are made to develop integrated monitoring programmes that aim to assess the health of fish and shellfish in relation to chemical contamination.

Identification of global marine hotspots: sentinels for change and vanguards for adaptation action	REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES												Major changes consistent with the fingerprint of global warming have been reported for nearly every ecosystem on earth. Recently, studies have moved beyond correlation-based inference to demonstrate mechanistic links between warming and biological responses, particularly in regions experiencing rapid change. However, the assessment of climate change impacts and development of adaptation options that humans can undertake are at the earliest stages, particularly for marine systems. Here, we use trends in ocean temperature to characterize regions that can act as natural laboratories or focal points for early learning. These discrete marine 'hotspots', where ocean warming is fastest, were identified based on 50 years of historical sea surface temperature data. Persistence of these hotspots into the future was evaluated using global climate models. This analysis provides insights and a starting point for scientists aiming to identify key regions of concern with regard to ocean warming, and illustrates a potential approach for considering additional physical drivers of change such as ocean pH or oxygenation. We found that some hotspot regions were of particular concern due to other non-climate stressors. For instance, many of the marine hotspots occur where human dependence on marine resources is greatest, such as south-east Asia and western Africa, and are therefore of critical consideration in the context of food security. Intensive study and development of comprehensive inter-disciplinary networks based on the hotspot regions identified here will allow earliest testing of management and adaptation pathways, facilitating rapid global learning and implementation of adaptation options to cope with future change.

Ecological relevance of sentinels' biomarker responses: A multi-level approach	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												In response to the need for more sensitive and rapid indicators of environmental quality, sublethal effects on the lowest levels of biological organization have been investigated. The ecological relevance of these responses assumes a prevailing role to assure effectiveness as indicator of ecological status. This study aimed to investigate the linkages between biomarker responses of caged bivalves and descriptive parameters of macrobenthic community structure. For this purpose a multi-level environmental assessment of marine and estuarine zones was performed in Sao Paulo coast, Brazil. Multivariate analysis was applied to identify linkages between biological responses and ecological indices, as well as to characterizing the studied stations. Individuals of the marine mussel Perna perna caged along Santos Bay showed signs of oxidative stress, lysosomal membrane destabilization, histological alterations and reduced embryonic development. The estuarine oyster Crassostrea rhizophorae caged along Santos Port Channel showed alterations on biotransformation enzymes and antioxidant system, DNA damage and lysosomal membrane destabilization. The benthic community analysis showed reduced richness and diversity in the same areas of the Santos bay and estuary where biomarker responses were altered. Our results revealed that xenobiotics are inducing physiological stress, which may lead to changes of the benthic community structure and deterioration of the ecological status over time. Integrating biomarker responses and ecological indexes improved certainty that alterations found at community level could be related to xenobiotic as stressors, which was very useful to improve the discriminatory power of the environmental assessment.

Penguins are endemic species of Antarctica situated at the top of food web and are useful sentinels of pollution. To improve data of trace metal contamination in the Antarctic Peninsula region, concentrations of Cd, Pb, As, Cu and Zn in fresh excrement of penguins were determined by atomic absorption. Samples were collected in several locations during the 2011/2012 austral summer: eight sites (O'Higgins Station, Yankee Harbour, Mikkelsen Harbor, Danco Island, Gonzalez Videla Base, Yelcho Station and Brown Station) from gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) colonies and four locations (Hydrurga Rocks, Cape Shirreff, Narebski Point and Kopaitic Island) from chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica) colonies. Data showed that gentoo penguin colonies had higher levels of metals (mu g g(-1) dw) like Pb, Cu and Zn at locations such as O'Higgins (2.89 for Pb, 199.95 for Cu and 379.99 for Zn) and Gonzalez Videla (2.74 for Pb and 222.51 for Cu). Levels of Cd in excreta of chinstrap penguins were higher at Narebski Point (3.13 mu g g(-1)). The levels of Pb, As, Cd, Cu and Zn were similar or even higher to those reported in excreta of the same species by previous studies at Antarctica. Data suggest that metals ingested by these two penguin species feeding in the sea end up in terrestrial ecosystems.

Birds with high levels of ingested plastic exhibited reduced body condition and increased contaminant load (p < 0.05). More than 60% of fledglings exceed international targets for plastic ingestion by seabirds, with 16% of fledglings failing these targets after a single feeding (range: 0.13-3.21 g of plastic/feeding). As top predators, seabirds are considered sentinels of the marine environment. The amount of plastic ingested and corresponding damage to Flesh-footed Shearwater fledglings is the highest reported for any marine vertebrate, suggesting the condition of the Australian marine environment is poor. These findings help explain the ongoing decline of this species and are worrying in light of increasing levels of plastic pollution in our oceans. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Gooseneck Barnacle (Pollicipes pollicipes) as a Candidate Sentinel Species for Coastal Contamination	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												The assessment of toxic effects caused by complex mixtures of contaminants in the marine environment requires previous validation of toxicological criteria, which may include biomarker end points with distinct biological meanings. This is the case of oxidative stress/phase II detoxification (glutathione-S-transferases activity), oxidative damage (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances), and neurotransmission (cholinesterase activity), which are likely to be affected after toxic insults by common marine pollutants. The main purpose of the present study was to assess potential biological alterations in the mollusk species Pollicipes pollicipes (gooseneck barnacle) caused by human contamination and seasonality, during a period of 1 year, in three different areas of the North Atlantic shore of Portugal. Our results indicate that fluctuations of the mentioned biomarkers were strongly related to seasonality, but they may also suffer influence by the already documented patterns of chemical contamination. Organisms collected in contaminated sampling sites (urban areas and oil refinery) showed greater levels of metabolic enzymes and increased levels of lipid peroxidation. These alterations were more evident during the summer, and, in some cases, spring months, suggesting an association between the presence of chemical stressors and temperature-dependent seasonal physiological fluctuations, which contribute to the modulation of the toxic response. In general terms, P. pollicipes was shown to be a promising organism in coastal biomonitoring programs, with an adequate sensitivity toward contamination and/or seasonal fluctuations. However, it is of the utmost importance to consider seasonal fluctuations in physiological parameters that modulate the toxic response. These factors can ultimately compromise the development and interpretation of data from marine biomonitoring programs if a thorough characterization of biological responses is not previously performed.

Contemporary Diet of Bowhead Whales (Balaena mysticetus) from the Eastern Canadian Arctic Inferred from Fatty Acid Biomarkers	ARCTIC												The diet and feeding ecology of Eastern Canada-West Greenland bowhead whales were examined using fatty acid (FA) composition of the outer blubber layer of 50 individuals sampled during the summers of 2008 and 2009. Bowhead blubber was rich in the following FAs: 14:0, 16:0, 16:1n-7, 18:0, 18:1n-11, 18:1n-9, 18:1n-7, 20:1n-11, 20:1n-9, 20:1n-7, 20:5n-3, 22:1n-11, 22:1n-9, 22:5n-3, and 22:6n-3, which together accounted for 91% of total FAs identified. Four groups of bowhead whales were identified from their FA signatures using multivariate analysis. Long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) (20:1n-9, 20:1n-11, 22:1n-9, and 22:1n-11) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (20:5n-3, 22:5n-3, 22:6n-3) accounted for most of the variance among groups. Whales from a single sampling site segregated into different groups, some of which included whales from other sampling sites, suggesting summer mixing of whales from different wintering areas and prey assemblages, or alternatively, selective feeding. FA composition was similar in males and females and among whales of different age classes, which suggests that these different groups shared foraging areas and had similar diets. The blubber of bowhead whales from the eastern Canadian Arctic was composed of high proportions of calanoid copepod markers (20:1n-9 and 22:1n-11), especially compared to the adipose tissue of western Arctic bowhead whales. This finding suggests that Calanus spp. were likely a major prey item. Given the expected change in Arctic zooplankton assemblages with climate warming, bowhead whales, through their FA biomarkers, may serve as sentinels of change in Arctic ecosystems.																	0004-0843	1923-1245				MAR	2014	67	1					84	92		10.14430/arctic4366								WOS:000334975400009						
J	Farrington, JW; Takada, H				Farrington, John W.; Takada, Hideshige			Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), and Plastics Examples of the Status, Trend, and Cycling of Organic Chemicals of Environmental Concern in the Ocean	OCEANOGRAPHY												Four decades of research have provided a reasonable understanding of the outline of the biogeochemical cycles of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in coastal ocean and surface ocean ecosystems, including atmospheric transport to the sea, air-sea exchange processes, and the role of particulate matter in removing these chemicals from surface waters. It is clear that deep ocean fish are contaminated with POPs. However, despite available sampling and analytical capabilities, deep ocean ecosystems are much less sampled and understood. A multidecade assessment of POPs and PAHs in US coastal waters using bivalve sentinel organisms documents high concentrations near urban areas and also some stations where concentrations have begun to decline. The results are consistent with coastal sediments near urban areas being a leaky sink for POPs and PAHs, and sources from land continuing to contribute these contaminants to the sea. Other studies document coastal and continental margin surface sediments as a sink, albeit a potentially leaky sink, for POPs and PAHs. Floating plastic debris, including small pellets, has reemerged as an oceanic environmental concern. A "Pellet Watch" assessing plastic pellets and associated POPs and PAHs is underway. Enhanced studies of deep-ocean ecosystems are recommended. The findings are also relevant to biogeochemical cycles for emerging organic pollutants.

A review of detection range testing in aquatic passive acoustic telemetry studies	REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES												Passive acoustic telemetry provides an important tool to study the spatial ecology and behaviour of organisms in marine and freshwater systems, but understanding the detection range of acoustic receivers is critical for interpreting acoustic data and establishing receiver spacing to maximize study efficiency. This study presents a comprehensive review of how acoustic detection range has been considered and assessed to date, summarizes important variables to monitor when determining the detection range of a receiver array, and provides recommendations to account for detection range during experimental design, analysis and data interpretation. A total of 378 passive acoustic telemetry studies (1986-2012) were scored against a set of pre-defined criteria to provide a standardized assessment of how well detection range was accounted for, from a maximum possible score of 45. Scores ranged from 0 to 39 (11.1 +/- A 0.4; mean +/- A 1 SE). Over the past decade mean scores have been consistently between 6.7 and 12.9 which indicates that detection range has not been adequately considered in most contemporary acoustic telemetry studies. Given the highly variable nature of detection range over space and time, it is necessary to create a culture of detection range testing among the scientific community. For robust telemetry studies it is recommended that consideration of detection range should be given a greater focus within study design, execution and data analysis. To aid array design in new systems, short-term detection range tests should be conducted in the most representative area of the study system prior to deployment. As well, fixed distance sentinel tags should ideally be deployed at a representative receiver site within the array to provide a continuous assessment of detection range and influential environmental parameters should be monitored to facilitate modeling of detection range variability over time. When warranted, data analysis should incorporate modeled variation in detection ranges.

The present study used laboratory exposures to examine estrogenic, androgenic, and thyroid-related endocrine responses in marine hornyhead turbot (Pleuronichthys verticalis) exposed to CECs from municipal effluents with 2 degrees of treatment. Fish were exposed for 14 d to environmentally realistic concentrations of effluent (0.5%) and to a higher concentration (5%) to investigate dose responses. Plasma concentrations of estradiol (E2), vitellogenin (VTG), 11-keto testosterone, and thyroxine were measured to assess endocrine responses. Contaminants of emerging concern were analyzed to characterize the effluents. Diverse types of effluent CECs were detected. Statistically significant responses were not observed in fish exposed to environmentally realistic concentrations of effluent. Elevated plasma E2 concentrations were observed in males exposed to ammonia concentrations similar to those found in effluents. However, exposure to ammonia did not induce VTG production in male fish. The results of the present study highlight the importance of conducting research with sentinel organisms in laboratory studies to understand the environmental significance of the presence of CECs in aquatic systems.

To address this uncertainty about current status, we conducted a comprehensive aerial survey of this population during August, 2011, when the region was ice-free and bears were on shore. We flew a combination of overland transects oriented perpendicular to the coastline, coastal transects parallel to shore, and transects across small islands. We used distance sampling and sight-resight protocols to estimate abundance. Bears were concentrated along the coast in central and southern Manitoba and Ontario portions of the population, although sightings >10 km inland were not uncommon in central Manitoba. We analyzed 2 combinations of data and derived an abundance estimate of 1030 bears (95% CI: similar to 754-1406). This figure is similar to a 2004 mark-recapture estimate but higher than projections indicating declining abundance since then. Our results suggest that mark-recapture estimates may have been negatively biased due to limited spatial sampling. We observed large numbers of bears summering in southeastern WH, an area not regularly sampled by mark-recapture. Consequently, previous mark-recapture estimates are not directly comparable to our aerial survey of the entire population. Whereas our results do not necessarily contradict the reported declines in this population, we believe that improvements are needed in monitoring, and methodological limitations and inconsistencies must be resolved to accurately assess status and the impacts of climate change.

In this study, a multidisciplinary weight of evidence (WOE) study was carried out on a shallow seepage, integrating sediment chemistry with bioavailability and onset of subcellular responses (biomarkers) in caged eels and mussels. Results from different lines of evidence (LOEs) were elaborated within a quantitative WOE model which, based on logical flowcharts, provide synthetic indices of hazard for each LOE, before their integration in a quantitative risk assessment. Evaluations of different LOEs were not always in accordance and their overall elaboration summarized as Moderate the risk in the seepage area. This study provided first evidence of biological effects in organisms exposed to natural hydrocarbon emissions, confirming the limit of chemical characterization as stand-alone criteria for environmental quality assessment and the utility of multidisciplinary investigations to determine the good environmental status as required by Environmental Directives.

Multi-biomarker responses in green mussels exposed to PFCs: effects at molecular, cellular, and physiological levels	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) are extremely persistent and have been found extensively in the environment and wildlife. Oceans are the final sink for many persistent organic pollutants (POPs) including PFCs. However, to date, there has been a lack of studies that investigated the environmental consequences of PFCs on marine organisms. To fill in this gap, environmental toxicity of two dominant PFCs, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), was examined in a sentinel species, green mussel Perna viridis, using a series of biomarkers corresponding to different biological levels (molecular, cellular, and physiological). Correlations among these biomarkers were also investigated. The results showed that the tested compounds can induce a series adverse effect at different biological levels, including oxidative stress, DNA damage, membrane instability, suppressed filtration rate, and reduced body weight. Correlation analysis revealed that excess production of reactive oxygen species could be the major toxic pathway. An indirect mode of toxic action was also explored where adverse impacts could be secondary effects of PFC exposure. The joint analysis of biomarkers from multiple biological levels resulted in a comprehensive understanding of how PFC exposure can influence the health of organisms. The correlations of these biomarkers also provided a new perspective of the ecological consequences of PFCs.

The Ocean Sentinel is owned and operated by the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center (NNMREC) at Oregon State University (OSU). The study involved a field observation as well as numerical modeling. The Ocean Sentinel was deployed from 7/29/2013 - 10/04/2013 at the NNMREC North Energy Test Site, which is located between 2 3 nautical miles (3.7 - 5.6 km) offshore of Yaquina Head, north of Newport, OR. It was configured in a three-point mooring with load cells on each mooring line. Prior to deployment, the numerical model was used for design and testing of the Ocean Sentinel mooring system. After deployment, recorded environmental conditions were coupled with the model to simulate deployed conditions, and model predictions of tension in the mooring lines were compared with actual results.																			978-0-7918-4553-0				2014									UNSP V09AT09A019									WOS:000363499000019

Baselines and Monitoring Methods for Detecting Impacts of Hydrodynamic Energy Extraction on Intertidal Communities of Rocky Shores	MARINE RENEWABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL INTERACTIONS	Humanity and the Sea											As part of the UK government's objective to deliver an increasing proportion of electricity from renewable sources, West Mainland, Orkney, is at the forefront of the development of wave-energy extraction devices. Exposure to wave energy plays a dominant role in shaping the Orkney landscape and determining the ecological community, but little is known of the consequences of commercial scale removal of energy from the environment. An extensive long-term monitoring programme to assess the impacts of altering wave-energy exposure on these rocky shores alongside responses to other systemic forcing agents such as climate change is continuing. Within the programme are photographic surveys, including quadrat and fixed viewpoint techniques, littoral studies of sentinel species, and the development of cost-effective wave-energy quantifying devices. Software has been developed to analyse images efficiently, to produce quantitative data on species and biotope coverage. Additionally, extensive surveys along the shoreline provide detailed image records, including areas without prior scientific description, and have helped identify locations of environmental sensitivity. Collectively, the data provide a comprehensive pre-development baseline along this important coast.																	2213-607X		978-94-017-8002-5; 978-94-017-8001-8				2014							21	38		10.1007/978-94-017-8002-5_3	10.1007/978-94-017-8002-5							WOS:000344882300003						
J	Goberville, E; Beaugrand, G; Edwards, M				Goberville, Eric; Beaugrand, Gregory; Edwards, Martin			Synchronous response of marine plankton ecosystems to climate in the Northeast Atlantic and the North Sea	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Over the last few decades, global warming has accelerated both the rate and magnitude of changes observed in many functional units of the Earth System. In this context, plankton are sentinel organisms because they are sensitive to subtle levels of changes in temperature and might help in identifying the current effects of climate change on pelagic ecosystems. In this paper, we performed a comparative approach in two regions of the North Atlantic (i.e. the Northeast Atlantic and the North Sea) to explore the relationships between changes in marine plankton, the regional physico-chemical environment and large-scale hydro-climatic forcing using four key indices: the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), the East Atlantic (EA) pattern and Northern Hemisphere Temperature (NHT) anomalies. Our analyses suggest that long-term changes in the states of the two ecosystems were synchronous and correlated to the same large-scale hydro-climatic variables: NHT anomalies, the AMO and to a lesser extent the EA pattern. No significant correlation was found between long-term ecosystem modifications and the state of the NAO. Our results suggest that the effect of climate on these ecosystems has mainly occurred in both regions through the modulation of the thermal regime. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Analyses of the science needed to manage human uses of ecosystem services have concentrated on terrestrial ecosystems. Our focus is on the provision of multidisciplinary data needed to inform adaptive, ecosystem-based approaches (EBAs) for maintaining coastal ecosystem services based on comparative ecosystem analyses. Key indicators of pressures on coastal ecosystems, ecosystem states and the impacts of changes in states on services are identified for monitoring and analysis at a global coastal network of sentinel sites nested in the ocean-climate observing system. Biodiversity is targeted as the "master" indicator because of its importance to a broad spectrum of services. Ultimately, successful implementation of EBAs will depend on establishing integrated, holistic approaches to ocean governance that oversee the development of integrated, operational ocean observing systems based on the data and information requirements specified by a broad spectrum of stakeholders for sustainable development. Sustained engagement of such a spectrum of stakeholders on a global scale is not feasible. The global coastal network will need to be customized locally and regionally based on priorities established by stakeholders in their respective regions. The E.U. Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the U.S. Recommendations of the Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force are important examples of emerging regional scale approaches. The effectiveness of these policies will depend on the co-evolution of ocean policy and the observing system under the auspices of integrated ocean governance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Serum Chemistry Reference Ranges for Steller Sea Lion (Eumetopias jubatus) Pups from Alaska: Stock Differentiation and Comparisons Within a North Pacific Sentinel Species	ECOHEALTH												Blood chemistry and hematologic reference ranges are useful for population health assessment and establishing a baseline for future comparisons in the event of ecosystem changes due to natural or anthropogenic factors. The objectives of this study were to determine if there was any population spatial structure for blood variables of Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus), an established sentinel species, and to report reference ranges for appropriate populations using standardized analyses. In addition to comparing reference ranges between populations with contrasting abundance trends, data were examined for evidence of disease or nutritional stress. From 1998 to 2011, blood samples were collected from 1,231 pups captured on 37 rookeries across their Alaskan range. Reference ranges are reported separately for the western and eastern distinct population segments (DPS) of Steller sea lion after cluster analysis and discriminant function analysis (DFA) supported underlying stock structure. Variables with greater loading scores for the DFA (creatinine, total protein, calcium, albumin, cholesterol, and alkaline phosphatase) also were greater for sea lions from the endangered western DPS, supporting previous studies that indicated pup condition in the west was not compromised during the first month postpartum. Differences between population segments were likely a result of ecological, physiological, or age related differences.

The aim of the present study was to search enterotoxin-encoding genes plus the mecA gene among coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) isolates from shellfish meats of A. brasiliana. The specimen clam (n=48; 40 clams per sample) was collected during low tide in the bay area of Mangue Seco from April through June 2009, and random samples of chilled and frozen shelled clam meat (n=33; 250g per sample) were obtained from retail shops from January through March 2012. Seventy-nine CNS isolates were identified, including Staphylococcus xylosus, S. cohnii spp. urealyticus, S. sciuri, and S. lentus. A high percentage of isolates resistant to erythromycin (58.5%), penicillin (51.2%), and tetracycline (43.9%), and the fluoroquinolones levofloxacin (39%) and ciprofloxacin (34.1%) were recorded from those environmental samples. Isolates from retail shops were particularly resistant to oxacillin (55.3%) and penicillin (36.8%). All CNS resistant to oxacillin and/or cefoxitin were positive for the presence of the mecA gene, but phenotypically susceptible to vancomycin. Also, the enterotoxin-encoding genes seg and seh were detected through multiplex-polymerase chain reaction in 77.7% and 88.8% of the isolates from environmental samples, versus 90.5% and 100% of the isolates from retail shops, respectively. The data reveal the risk to public health due to consuming raw or undercooked shellfish containing enterotoxigenic plus methicillin-resistant CNS.																	1535-3141	1556-7125				DEC 1	2013	10	12					1044	1049		10.1089/fpd.2013.1576								WOS:000327220100008	24102081

Topography and biological noise determine acoustic detectability on coral reefs	CORAL REEFS												Acoustic telemetry is an increasingly common tool for studying the movement patterns, behavior and site fidelity of marine organisms, but to accurately interpret acoustic data, the variability, periodicity and range of detectability between acoustic tags and receivers must be understood. The relative and interactive effects of topography with biological and environmental noise have not been quantified on coral reefs. We conduct two long-term range tests (1- and 4-month duration) on two different reef types in the central Red Sea to determine the relative effect of distance, depth, topography, time of day, wind, lunar phase, sea surface temperature and thermocline on detection probability. Detectability, as expected, declines with increasing distance between tags and receivers, and we find average detection ranges of 530 and 120 m, using V16 and V13 tags, respectively, but the topography of the reef can significantly modify this relationship, reducing the range by similar to 70 %, even when tags and receivers are in line-of-sight. Analyses that assume a relationship between distance and detections must therefore be used with care. Nighttime detection range was consistently reduced in both locations, and detections varied by lunar phase in the 4-month test, suggesting a strong influence of biological noise (reducing detection probability up to 30 %), notably more influential than other environmental noises, including wind-driven noise, which is normally considered important in open-water environments. Analysis of detections should be corrected in consideration of the diel patterns we find, and range tests or sentinel tags should be used for more than 1 month to quantify potential changes due to lunar phase. Some studies assume that the most usual factor limiting detection range is weather-related noise; this cannot be extrapolated to coral reefs.

Bivalve Omics: State of the Art and Potential Applications for the Biomonitoring of Harmful Marine Compounds	MARINE DRUGS												The extraordinary progress experienced by sequencing technologies and bioinformatics has made the development of omic studies virtually ubiquitous in all fields of life sciences nowadays. However, scientific attention has been quite unevenly distributed throughout the different branches of the tree of life, leaving molluscs, one of the most diverse animal groups, relatively unexplored and without representation within the narrow collection of well established model organisms. Within this Phylum, bivalve molluscs play a fundamental role in the functioning of the marine ecosystem, constitute very valuable commercial resources in aquaculture, and have been widely used as sentinel organisms in the biomonitoring of marine pollution. Yet, it has only been very recently that this complex group of organisms became a preferential subject for omic studies, posing new challenges for their integrative characterization. The present contribution aims to give a detailed insight into the state of the art of the omic studies and functional information analysis of bivalve molluscs, providing a timely perspective on the available data resources and on the current and prospective applications for the biomonitoring of harmful marine compounds.

The ranking of its four main prey types did not vary annually. Numerically, the prey comprised 50-75% limpets, 14-34% mussels, 8-18% chitons, 1-2% Northern Abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana), and <1% other species. In 2009, we estimated prey availability and prey preference by Ivlev's electivity index. Northern Abalone, limpets, and chitons were highly preferred; mussels, turban snails, and barnacles were taken in proportion to their occurrence or avoided. Black Oystercatchers preferred abalone of 50 mm, smaller than the mean size available, in contrast to the selection of larger-than-average prey, typical for other prey species. In 2010, 52% of nesting territories sampled contained remains of Northern Abalone, despite that species' small contribution to the diet. The Northern Abalone has never been reported as prey of the Black Oystercatcher despite its high vulnerability to predation at low tides. We speculate that the recent inclusion of the Northern Abalone in the Black Oystercatcher diet on Haida Gwaii may indicate a greater abundance of Northern Abalone than in other regions of its distribution. The frequency of the oystercatcher's feeding on abalone was unexpected because under Canada's Species at Risk Act, the Northern Abalone was listed as "endangered" in 2010, after the population continued to decline after legal protection from harvest in 1990.																	0010-5422	1938-5129				NOV	2013	115	4					800	807		10.1525/cond.2013.120182								WOS:000328295800011

The use of caging techniques has proven to be useful for assessment of water quality in coastal and estuarine environments. This study investigates the application of caging techniques for monitoring uptake of 20 elements [Li, Na, Mg, Al, P, K, Ca, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, As, Sb, Pb, Hg, Cd and Zn] in three marine species namely Nucella lapillus, Mytilus edulis and Crassostrea gigas. Stable isotopes were used to determine predatory effects and also used for modelling metal uptake in test species and to track nutrient assimilation. Metal levels were monitored at three different coastal locations, namely Dublin Bay, Dunmore East and Omey Island over 18 weeks. Significant differences in concentrations of Mn, Co and Zn between mussels and oysters were found. Correlations between cadmium levels in N. lapillus and delta C-13 and delta N-15 suggest dietary influences in Cd uptake. Levels of Zn were highest in C gigas compared to the other two species and levels of Zn were most elevated at the Dunmore East site. Copper levels were more elevated in all test species at both Dublin Bay and Dunmore East. Mercury was raised in all species at Dunmore East compared to the other two sites. Biotic accumulation of metals in the test species demonstrates that caging techniques can provide a valid tool for biomonitoring in metal impacted areas. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Lipophilic polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) 153, 1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p'-DDE), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and protein-bound perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), were measured repeatedly in blood plasma of individual goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) and white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) nestlings, 1 to 3 wk after hatching and near fledging. Maternally derived POPs dilute as nestlings grow (growth dilution), and increasing plasma concentrations would indicate dietary input. First, plasma concentrations given no dietary input were estimated, and concentrations of p,p'-DDE, HCB, and notably PFOS were significantly higher than predicted from a growth-dilution scenario (approximately 1.5-fold to 2.5-fold higher; p<0.001). In contrast, PCB 153 declined in both species, although concentrations were still higher than predicted in white-tailed eagle nestlings (p<0.05). Second, the relationships between plasma POP concentrations and trophic position (N-15) and dietary carbon source (C-13) were analyzed, controlling for growth rate. Both N-15 and C-13 (measured in body feathers) were significantly associated to the accumulation of most POPs, except PFOS. In conclusion, pollutant data acquired in plasma of nestling raptors should be interpreted and further investigated in the light of individual feeding ecology, and the use of raptor nestlings as sentinels for POP monitoring could be optimized by correcting for different factors such as body condition, brood size, and age.

The biomarkers that were investigated were the hepatosomatic index (HSI), 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity. In addition, we have measured the levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and selected heavy metals (lead, cadmium, mercury, copper and zinc) in sediment samples at the polluted site. Although the polluted site had high environmental levels of PAHs and heavy metals, there was no difference in hepatic EROD activity and HSI between fish caged at the polluted site and controls. On the other hand, GST activity was significantly lower in fish caged at the polluted site compared to controls. Our results point out that the studied biomarkers have limited use in environmental risk assessment studies, at least when caged adult sea bass is used as the sentinel species and complex toxicant mixtures are involved.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				NOV	2013	185	11					9009	9018		10.1007/s10661-013-3230-3								WOS:000325116500018	23644668

Waterborne cadmium impacts immunocytotoxic and cytogenotoxic endpoints in green-lipped mussel, Perna canaliculus	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												Mussels are sentinel species that can be used to monitor coastal metal pollution through the application of biomarkers. Among the several important metal toxicants in coastal settings, cadmium (Cd) is of particular concern, being a non-essential metal that is known to cause harmful impacts in aquatic organisms at low concentrations. The aim of the present study was to examine the immunocytotoxic and cytogenotoxic effects of Cd on the green-lipped mussel, Perna canaliculus, under laboratory conditions. The acute (96 h; 0, 2000 and 4000 mu g Cd L-1) and subchronic (28 d; 0, 200 and 2000 mu g Cd L-1) toxic effects of waterborne Cd were measured in haemocytes and gill cells using differential haemocyte cell count, the micronucleus test and the comet assay. During subchronic exposure to Cd the relative counts of eosinophils and hyalinocytes increased significantly in Cd-exposed mussels while the proportion of basophils decreased. All of these effects were time- and concentration-dependent. Conversely, the relative numbers of basophils and eosinophils increased significantly during acute Cd exposure. Nuclear aberrations such as the formation of micronuclei, nuclear buds, fragmented-apoptotic cells and binuclei were observed in gill cells of Cd-exposed mussels. All of these parameters increased significantly at 2000 mu g Cd L-1 during subchronic exposure to Cd, and all showed a strong and significant correlation to gill Cd accumulation. Comet assay results demonstrated a significant increase in DNA damage in the haemocytes of mussels exposed to subchronic Cd concentrations. The results indicate that Cd has the capacity to induce immune system and genotoxic damage in green-lipped mussels, an impact that may have implications such as reduced disease resistance and compromised survival. These data also suggest that immunocytotoxic and cytogenotoxic biomarkers would be a valuable addition to environmental monitoring programmes using green-lipped mussels. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

These unprecedented lifetime profiles (i.e., birth to death) were reconstructed with a 6-mo resolution for a wide range of analytes including cortisol (stress hormone), testosterone (developmental hormone), organic contaminants (e.g., pesticides and flame retardants), and mercury. Cortisol lifetime profiles revealed a doubling of cortisol levels over baseline. Testosterone profiles suggest this male blue whale reached sexual maturity at approximately 10 y of age, which corresponds well with and improves on previous estimates. Early periods of the reconstructed contaminant profiles for pesticides (such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes and chlordanes), polychlorinated biphenyls, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers demonstrate significant maternal transfer occurred at 0-12 mo. The total lifetime organic contaminant burden measured between the earplug (sum of contaminants in laminae layers) and blubber samples from the same organism were similar. Total mercury profiles revealed reduced maternal transfer and two distinct pulse events compared with organic contaminants. The use of a whale earplug to reconstruct lifetime chemical profiles will allow for a more comprehensive examination of stress, development, and contaminant exposure, as well as improve the assessment of contaminant use/emission, environmental noise, ship traffic, and climate change on these important marine sentinels.

A real-time PCR assay for differential expression of vitellogenin I and II genes in the liver of the sentinel fish species Lipophrys pholis	TOXICOLOGY MECHANISMS AND METHODS												The recent advances in molecular biology techniques have prompted the use of vitellogenin (VTG) gene expression as a sensitive and reliable indicator of estrogenic chemicals (EC) exposure. However, data on the dynamic response of the different VTGs genes upon EC exposure is still poorly understood, particularly in sentinel fish species used in field monitoring studies. Hence, the present study aimed at developing a sensitive real-time PCR assay for determining the response of VTG I and II in the recently proposed marine sentinel species Lipophrys pholis upon exposure to the model EC 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2). The findings of the laboratory study indicate that L. pholis VTG I proved to be not only more inducible but also more sensitive to EE2 exposure than VTG II, for the same range of concentrations. In fact, VTG I gene induction was 475-fold higher than VTG II at 15 ng/L EE2, and 13-fold at 5 ng/L EE2. Overall, the findings of the present study indicate that in the field, expression of VTG I in L. pholis should be preferentially used in the screening of EC exposure because of its higher sensitivity. Furthermore, the present study favors L. pholis integration in monitoring programs associated with EC's pollution within the European water policy legislation.

Biological sentinels like seabirds' chicks have been widely used to monitorize the levels of some heavy metals. Due to its mainly marine foraging habits, Audouin's gull fits well for this purpose. Mercury and lead levels were measured in mantle feathers of Audouin's gull chicks from two colonies in NE Iberian Peninsula: the Ebro Delta and the Llobregat Delta. Both are anthropized areas subject to differential pollutant inputs. Lead levels were significantly higher in the Llobregat Delta probably due to the use of leaded fuel in the nearby Barcelona airport. On the other side, mercury concentrations were higher in the Ebro Delta, in relation with the disposal of the toxic sediments at the Flix site carried down by the Ebro River. These mercury levels in the Ebro chicks reached values that have been described as toxic. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Mean PFOS concentrations were 1250 ng/g wet weight and some mink from the urban inland area had among the highest PFOS concentrations ever recorded in mink (up to 21 800 ng/g wet weight). PFBS was detected in 89% of the samples, but in low concentrations (mean 0.6 ng/g ww). There were significant differences in PFAA concentrations between the geographical areas (p < 0.001-0.01). Age, body condition and body weight did not influence the concentrations significantly, but there was a seasonal influence on the concentrations of perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA) (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively), with lower concentrations in autumn samples than in samples taken" in the winter and spring. It is thus recommended to take possible seasonal differences into account when using mink exposure data. The overall results suggest that the mink is a suitable sentinel species for assessing and monitoring environmental levels of PFAAs. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Sherrard-Smith, E; Chadwick, EA; Cable, J				Sherrard-Smith, Ellie; Chadwick, Elizabeth A.; Cable, Joanne			Climatic variables are associated with the prevalence of biliary trematodes in otters	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY												Parasites with complex life cycles are expected to be disproportionately affected by climate change. Knowledge of current associations with weather and host-parasite interactions is therefore essential for the inference of future distributions. The Eurasian otter, Lutra lutra, is exposed to a range of parasites due to its large home range and use of terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats. As such, it can act as a sentinel species for generalist parasites. Here we consider two biliary parasites recently reported in the United Kingdom, Pseudamphistomum truncatum and Metorchis albidus (Trematoda. Opisthorchiidae), and ask whether there are associations between abiotic factors (season, temperature, rainfall and the North Atlantic Oscillation) and the prevalence and intensities of these parasites in otters (n = 586). To control for biotic interactions we first examined whether particular sub-groups of the otter population (grouped by sex, age-class and condition) are more prone to infection and whether any damage is associated with the presence of these parasites. Even though mean intensities of the smaller trematode, P. truncatum (28.3 worms/host), were much higher than M. albidus (4.1), both parasite species had similar impacts on the otter. The distributions of parasites on host sexes were similar, but males suffered greater damage and regardless of sex, parasite intensity increased in older hosts. The probability of infection with either parasite was negatively associated with ground frost, minimum temperatures and rainfall, but was positively associated with warm long-term average temperatures. Although it is widely accepted that multiple variables influence parasite distributions, to our knowledge this is one of only a few studies to examine the combined impact of biotic and abiotic variables on parasites with complex life cycles within their wild definitive host. Identifying such associations can give greater accuracy to predictions concerning the distribution and spread of trematodes with future climate change.

Understanding myxozoan infection dynamics in the sea: Seasonality and transmission of Ceratomyxa puntazzi	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY												Ceratomyxa puntazzi affects the sharpsnout seabream, Diplodus puntazzo, a recently explored aquaculture species in the Mediterranean. Little is known about the transmission and seasonality of marine myxozoans, although this knowledge is of considerable importance for the design of management strategies for aquaculture. In the present study on C. puntazzi we investigated the potential pathways of transmission as well as the parasite abundance in fish and its density in environmental water samples, throughout a full year. We performed monthly sentinel fish exposures in a C puntazzi enzootic environment and quantified waterborne stages in seawater. Two novel C. puntazzi-specific PCR and quantitative PCR assays were developed to determine infection levels in fish and water samples. Ceratomyxa puntazzi presents marked seasonal changes in parasite density, with a double-peaked prevalence of infection in sentinel fish in spring and late summer/autumn, at 16-24 degrees C, and a covert infection during the winter months. Invasive blood stages were detected all year round by PCR. The combination of sentinel fish exposure with the quantification of waterborne stages allowed us to attribute this pattern in C. puntazzi density to higher numbers of actinospores in the water, while myxospores are predominant in summer and winter. We demonstrated that temperature increase triggered actinospore production in the invertebrate host in a benthic habitat and we suggest that the life cycle dynamics of the invertebrate host explain the double-peaked infection prevalence in fish. Experimental transmission of different C. puntazzi developmental stages in seawater or by oral and intracoelomic injection was unsuccessful which indicates fish-to-fish transmission is unlikely to occur in aquaculture systems. This is the first model studying seasonality and infection dynamics of a marine myxozoan. (C) 2013 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mortalities also occurred in wild diploid C. gigas in the Georges River and shortly thereafter in the adjacent Parramatta River estuary upstream from Sydney Harbour. Neighbouring Saccostrea glomerata (Sydney rock oysters) did not experience mortalities in either estuary. Surviving oysters were collected to investigate the cause of mortalities. Histologically all oysters displayed significant pathology, and molecular testing revealed a high prevalence of ostreid herpesvirus-1 (OsHV-1). Quantitative PCR indicated that many C. gigas were carrying a high viral load at the time of sampling, while the load in S. glomerata was significantly lower (p<0.001). Subsequent in situ hybridisation experiments confirmed the presence of a herpesvirus in C. gigas but not S. glomerata tissues, suggesting that S. glomerata is not susceptible to infection with OsHV-1. Naive sentinel triploid C. gigas placed in the Georges River estuary in January 2011 quickly became infected and experienced nearly 100% mortality within 2 wk of exposure, indicating the persistence of the virus in the environment. Phylogenetic analysis of sequences derived from the C2/C6 region of the virus revealed that the Australian strain of OsHV-1 belongs to the microvariant (mu-var) cluster, which has been associated with severe mortalities in C. gigas in other countries since 2008. Environmental data revealed that the Woolooware Bay outbreaks occurred during a time of considerable environmental disturbance, with increased water temperatures, heavy rainfall, a toxic phytoplankton bloom and the presence of a pathogenic Vibrio sp. all potentially contributing to oyster stress. This is the first confirmed report of OsHV-1 mu-var related C. gigas mortalities in Australia.

Biomarkers and transcription levels of cancer-related genes in cockles Cerastoderma edule from Galicia (NW Spain) with disseminated neoplasia	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												Disseminated neoplasia (DN) is a pathological condition reported for several species of marine bivalves throughout the world, but its aetiology has not yet been satisfactorily explained. It has been suggested that chemical contamination could be a factor contributing to neoplasia. The aim of the present study was to compare cell and tissue biomarkers and the transcription level of cancer-related genes in cockles (Cerastoderma edule) affected by DN with those of healthy cockles in relation to chemical contaminant burdens. For this, cockles were collected from a natural bed in Cambados (Ria de Arousa, Galicia) in May 2009. The prevalence of DN was 12.36% and 3 degrees of DN severity were distinguished. No significant differences in metal accumulation, non-specific inflammatory responses and parasites were observed between healthy and DN-affected cockles. Lysosomal membrane stability was significantly reduced in cockles affected by DN, which indicates a poorer health condition. Very low frequencies of micronuclei were recorded and no significant differences were detected between DN severity groups. Haemolymph analyses showed a higher frequency of mitotic figures and binucleated cells in cockles affected by moderate and heavy DN than in healthy ones. Neoplastic animals showed significantly higher transcription levels of p53 and ras than healthy cockles and mutational alterations in ras gene sequence were detected. Low concentrations of metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls and phthalate esters were measured in cockles from Cambados.

These tests were conducted by the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center (NNMAEC) at its Pacific Ocean test site off the coast of Newport, Oregon. The WET-NZ is the product of a research consortium between Callaghan Innovation, a New Zealand Crown. Entity, and Power Projects Limited (PPL), a Wellington, New Zealand private company. The Oregon deployment was project managed by Northwest Energy Innovations (NWEI), a Portland, OR firm. NNMREC is a Department of Energy sponsored partnership between Oregon State University (OSU), the University of Washington (UW), and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The Ocean Sentinel was deployed and operated for the first during the 2012 WET-NZ tests. During these tests, the operation of the WET-NZ was demonstrated and its performance was chracterized, while also proving successful deployment and operation of the Ocean Sentinel.																	0025-3324					JUL-AUG	2013	47	4					164	176		10.4031/MTSJ.47.4.4								WOS:000324844400017

Change at the margin of the North Water Polynya, Baffin Bay, inferred from organic matter records in dated sediment cores	MARINE GEOLOGY												The North Water Polynya (NOW) is one of the most productive marine environments in the Arctic. With Arctic sea-ice cover a prominent control in the production of marine organic matter (OM), polynyas are likely to be sentinels of the effects of recent change in ice climate. We collected six sediment cores from the NOW, dated them using Pb-210 corroborated with Cs-137 where possible, and analysed down-core profiles of OM kerogen (Rock-Eval 6 analysis), total organic carbon (TOC), total organic nitrogen (TON), delta C-13 and delta N-15. The down-core records were examined for evidence of recent (past 150 years) change. Sediment OM bulk concentrations (TOC and TON) displayed exponential decreases with water depth reflecting water-column remineralization processes. Using a model to account for sedimentation rate and sediment surface mixing, we found that cores from the interior of the NOW showed no significant change between pre-1900 sediments and post-1900 sediments, and little variance among cores. In contrast, a core from the northwest boundary of the region showed evidence of increased marine organic carbon input, and two cores from the southeast boundary showed evidence of decreased terrigenous carbon input. In addition, the cores at the southeast boundary, on the slope off Greenland, witnessed a significant decline in sedimentation rate during the same time interval. We interpret the change in OM in the boundary cores in the context of change in regional ice climate and runoff. Our results suggest that the margin of this polynya is more vulnerable to change than the interior, and thus is a better location to seek evidence of change. Furthermore, the diversity of settings within NOW indicates that change must be understood at sub-regional scales. Crown Copyright 2013 (C) Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Identifying robust bioindicators of light stress in seagrasses: A meta-analysis	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Bioindicators are used to monitor responses to environmental pressures. They should reflect important ecological values, be scientifically defensible, respond in a predictable manner and be easy to measure and interpret. Seagrasses are significant marine habitat, which globally are under threat and are considered "sentinels" of coastal degradation. Light reduction via (for example) eutrophication, dredging and turbid terrestrial run-off is a key anthropogenic pressure impacting seagrasses. Consequently, seagrasses are regularly included in monitoring programs, both to protect them and for their value as indicators of change in light availability. This paper assessed published literature on seagrass responses to light reduction to identify which seagrass characteristics provide the most robust bioindicators of light reduction. ISI Web of Science was searched in July 2011 to retrieve refereed publications that documented the response of seagrasses to light reduction. Only studies with a control were included, giving confidence that the response was due to light reduction and not other, unexplained factors. This yielded a dataset of 58 published studies, covering eight of 11 seagrass genera and 18 species, with a wide geographic range. In each study, the response of each variable to light reduction was categorised into no effect, reduce or increase. Where studies tested the intensity and durations of light reduction, the consistency of responses at these different levels was also assessed. A set of consistent and robust bioindicators is proposed that respond to the pressure of light reduction and can indicate different timescales and levels of pressure. These include: those that respond early and reflect sub-lethal changes at the scale of the plant, such as rhizome sugars, shoot C:N, leaf growth and the number of leaves per shoot; and those that respond later, reflecting changes at the meadow-scale, such as shoot density or above-ground biomass. We recommend these variables for monitoring programs with the goal of detecting significant light reduction and indicating the severity and duration of impact.

Suspension feeding invertebrates, in particular bivalve mollusks, may play a role in NP biotransformation and transfer through food webs and may represent a significant target for NP toxicity. In this work, the in vivo effects of titanium dioxide (n-TiO2), one of the most widespread NPs in use, were investigated in the bivalve Mytilus galloprovincialis, largely utilised as a sentinel for marine contamination. Mussels were exposed for 96 h to different concentrations of n-TiO2 suspensions (1, 10 and 100 mu g L-1) and multiple responses were evaluated in the digestive gland and immune cells, the haemocytes. In the digestive gland, n-TiO2 affected lysosomal and oxidative stress biomarkers and decreased transcription of antioxidant and immune-related genes. In the haemocytes, n-TiO2 decreased lysosomal membrane stability-LMS and phagocytosis, increased oxyradical production and transcription of antimicrobial peptides; moreover, pre-apoptotic processes were observed. The effects of n-TiO2 on digestive gland and haemocytes were distinct, also depending on the endpoint and on nominal NP concentrations, with many significant responses elicited by the lowest concentrations tested. The results show that n-TiO2, at concentrations close to predicted environmental levels, significantly affected different functional and molecular parameters of mussel digestive gland and immune cells. In particular, the observed changes in immune parameters that represent significant biomarkers of exposure at the organism level suggest that exposure to n-TiO2 may pose a serious risk to mussel health.

J	Peirano, A				Peirano, Andrea			Wrecks on the Bottom: Useful, Ecological Sentinels?	MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL												Wrecks play an important role in enhancing marine biodiversity, SCUBA diving video-samplings were performed on eight wrecks, including seven shipwrecks and a sunken airplane, scattered over 180 km along the Ligurian coastline in the north-western Mediterranean Sea, in the water depths of 30-65 m. Differences in composition of macrobenthic communities were found to be related to the bottom sedimentology and the composition and geometry of the investigated structures. The iron, flat, and even substrata of shipwrecks were dominated by Bivalvia (Ostrea edulis) and Anthozoa (Corynactis viridis), whereas the aluminum, cage-like structure of the airplane was dominated by massive sponges and bryozoans. Furthermore, abundances of some macrobenthic invertebrates were greater on the wrecks than those observed on natural, rocky substrates. Because of the increasing popularity of use of video and photo digital apparatuses among recreational divers, combined with wrecks resistance to corrosion, artificial geometries and available surfaces that facilitate species' settlement and growth, data from wrecks consisting of images and related metadata (depth, date, water temperature, etc.) could provide a new apportunity for monitoring Mediterranean marine biodiversity.																	0025-3324	1948-1209				MAY-JUN	2013	47	3					118	127		10.4031/MTSJ.47.3.5								WOS:000321602400010

Antarctic penguins present several of the characteristics of useful sentinels of pollution in Antarctica such as they are long-lived species situated at the top of food web. The concentrations of Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Cd, and Pb were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry in samples of liver, kidney, muscle, bone, feather, and stomach contents of gentoo, chinstrap, and Ad,lie penguin (12 adults, five juveniles) from carcasses of naturally dead individuals collected opportunistically in the Antarctic Peninsula area. The obtained results showed that accumulation and magnification of several elements can be occurring, so that Cd and Se reached levels potentially toxic in some specimens. The presence of human activities seems to be increasing the presence of toxic metals such as Mn, Cr, Ni, or Pb in penguins.

Dynamics of Vibrio with Virulence Genes Detected in Pacific Harbor Seals (Phoca vitulina richardii) Off California: Implications for Marine Mammal Health	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Given their coastal site fidelity and opportunistic foraging behavior, harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) may serve as sentinels for coastal ecosystem health. Seals using urbanized coastal habitat can acquire enteric bacteria, including Vibrio that may affect their health. To understand Vibrio dynamics in seals, demographic and environmental factors were tested for predicting potentially virulent Vibrio in free-ranging and stranded Pacific harbor seals (Phoca vitulina richardii) off California. Vibrio prevalence did not vary with season and was greater in free-ranging seals (29 %, n = 319) compared with stranded seals (17 %, n = 189). Of the factors tested, location, turbidity, and/or salinity best predicted Vibrio prevalence in free-ranging seals. The relationship of environmental factors with Vibrio prevalence differed by location and may be related to oceanographic or terrestrial contributions to water quality. Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio alginolyticus, and Vibrio cholerae were observed in seals, with V. cholerae found almost exclusively in stranded pups and yearlings. Additionally, virulence genes (trh and tdh) were detected in V. parahaemolyticus isolates. Vibrio cholerae isolates lacked targeted virulence genes, but were hemolytic. Three out of four stranded pups with V. parahaemolyticus (trh+ and/or tdh+) died in rehabilitation, but the role of Vibrio in causing mortality is unclear, and Vibrio expression of virulence genes should be investigated. Considering that humans share the environment and food resources with seals, potentially virulent Vibrio observed in seals also may be of concern to human health.																	0095-3628	1432-184X				MAY	2013	65	4					982	994		10.1007/s00248-013-0188-1								WOS:000318183800022	23392641

It covers only 1.1% of the world's area, but is the global hotspot for marine biodiversity and a rich spawning area for tuna. One-third of the CT6 population and millions more from outside the region are dependent on these resources. However, a range of human pressures threaten the biological health and diversity in the CT, affecting the food security and livelihoods of these people. A set of Crisis Sentinel Indicators (CSI) has been proposed to discuss the current state of affairs of the Coral Triangle based on the three dimensions of sustainability: Ecological, Socioeconomic, and Governance indicators. Furthermore, a Pressure-State-Response (PSR) analysis was performed for each CT6 country, using the three dimensions of sustainability, to capture and discuss the local state of affairs.

Hg persists, bioaccumulates and is toxic putting high trophic consumers at risk. The sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus), is a sentinel of ocean health due to its wide distribution, longevity and high trophic level. Our aim was to survey Hg concentrations worldwide in the skin of free-ranging sperm whales considering region, gender and age. Samples were collected from 343 whales in 17 regions during the voyage of the research vessel, Odyssey, between 1999 and 2005. Skin was analyzed for total Hg and detected in all but three samples with a global mean of 2.5 0.1 mu g g(-1) ranging from 0.1 to 16.0 mu g g(-1). The Mediterranean Sea had the highest regional mean with 6.1 mu g g(-1) followed by Australia with 3.5 mu g g(-1). Considering gender, females and males did not have significantly different global Hg concentrations. The variation among regions for females was significantly different with highest levels in the Mediterranean and lowest in Sri Lanka; however, males were not significantly different among regions. Considering age in males, adults and subadults did not have significantly different Hg concentrations, and were not significantly different among regions. The toxic effects of these Hg concentrations are uncertain. Selenium (Se), an essential element, antagonizes Hg at equimolar amounts. We measured total Se concentrations and found detectable levels in all samples with a global mean of 33.1 +/- 1.1 mu g g(-1), ranging from 2.5 to 179 mu g g(-1). Se concentrations were found to be several fold higher than Hg concentrations with the average Se:Hg molar ratio being 59:1 and no correlation between the two elements. It is possible Hg is being detoxified in the skin by another mechanism. These data provide the first global analysis of Hg and Se concentrations in a free-ranging cetacean. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Arctic ecosystems are difficult to monitor because of the extensive winter ice coverage and extreme environmental conditions in addition to low human population densities. However, passive acoustic monitoring has proved to be a reliable method to remotely survey the presence of some marine mammals in the Arctic. In this study, we evaluate the potential use of echolocation loggers (T-POD and C-POD, Chelonia Ltd.) for remote monitoring of white whales. Captive experiments and open water surveys in three arctic/subarctic habitats (ice-noise-dominated environment, ice-free environment and low-turbidity waters) were used to document detection performance and to explore the use of logger angle and inter-click interval data to look at activity patterns and tidal influences on space use. When acoustic results were compared to concurrent visual observations, echolocation detection was only attributed to periods of white whale presence near the recorder deployment sites. Both T-PODs and C-PODs effectively detected echolocation, even under noisy ice. Diel and tidal behavioural patterns were identified. Acoustically identified movement patterns between sites were visually confirmed. This study demonstrates the feasibility of monitoring white whales using echolocation loggers and describes some important features of their behaviour as examples of the potential application of this passive acoustic monitoring method in Arctic and subarctic regions.																	0722-4060					APR	2013	36	4					493	509		10.1007/s00300-012-1276-2								WOS:000316331600003

The CHROMEVALOA Database: A Resource for the Evaluation of Okadaic Acid Contamination in the Marine Environment Based on the Chromatin-Associated Transcriptome of the Mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis	MARINE DRUGS												Okadaic Acid (OA) constitutes the main active principle in Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP) toxins produced during Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), representing a serious threat for human consumers of edible shellfish. Furthermore, OA conveys critical deleterious effects for marine organisms due to its genotoxic potential. Many efforts have been dedicated to OA biomonitoring during the last three decades. However, it is only now with the current availability of detailed molecular information on DNA organization and the mechanisms involved in the maintenance of genome integrity, that a new arena starts opening up for the study of OA contamination. In the present work we address the links between OA genotoxicity and chromatin by combining Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies and bioinformatics. To this end, we introduce CHROMEVALOAdb, a public database containing the chromatin-associated transcriptome of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis (a sentinel model organism) in response to OA exposure. This resource constitutes a leap forward for the development of chromatin-based biomarkers, paving the road towards the generation of powerful and sensitive tests for the detection and evaluation of the genotoxic effects of OA in coastal areas.

El Nino Impact on Mollusk Biomineralization-Implications for Trace Element Proxy Reconstructions and the Paleo-Archeological Record	PLOS ONE												Marine macroinvertebrates are ideal sentinel organisms to monitor rapid environmental changes associated with climatic phenomena. These organisms build up protective exoskeletons incrementally by biologically-controlled mineralization, which is deeply rooted in long-term evolutionary processes. Recent studies relating potential rapid environmental fluctuations to climate change, such as ocean acidification, suggest modifications on carbonate biominerals of marine invertebrates. However, the influence of known, and recurrent, climatic events on these biological processes during active mineralization is still insufficiently understood. Analysis of Peruvian cockles from the 1982-83 large magnitude El Nino event shows significant alterations of the chemico-structure of carbonate biominerals. Here, we show that bivalves modify the main biomineralization mechanism during the event to continue shell secretion. As a result, magnesium content increases to stabilize amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC), inducing a rise in Mg/Ca unrelated to the associated increase in sea-surface temperature. Analysis of variations in Sr/Ca also suggests that this proxy should not be used in these bivalves to detect the temperature anomaly, while Ba/Ca peaks are recorded in shells in response to an increase in productivity, or dissolved barium in seawater, after the event. Presented data contribute to a better understanding of the effects of abrupt climate change on shell biomineralization, while also offering an alternative view of bivalve elemental proxy reconstructions. Furthermore, biomineralization changes in mollusk shells can be used as a novel potential proxy to provide a more nuanced historical record of El Nino and similar rapid environmental change events.

Asymmetric sleep in apneic human patients. Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 304: R232-R237, 2013. First published November 28, 2012; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.00302.2011.-Unilateral sleep in marine mammals has been considered to be a defense against airway obstruction, as a sentinel for pod maintenance, and as a thermoregulatory mechanism. Birds also show asymmetric sleep, probably to avoid predation. The variable function of asymmetric sleep suggests a general capability for independence between brain hemispheres. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea share similar problems with diving mammals, but their eventual sleep asymmetry has received little attention. The present report shows that human sleep apnea patients also present temporary interhemispheric variations in dominance during sleep, with significant differences when comparing periods of open and closed airways. The magnitude of squared coherence, an index of interhemispheric EEG interdependence in phase and amplitude, rises in the delta EEG range during apneic episodes, while the phase lag index, a measure of linear and nonlinear interhemispheric phase synchrony, drops to zero. The L index, which measures generalized nonlinear EEG interhemispheric synchronization, increases during apneic events. Thus, the three indexes show significant and congruent changes in interhemispheric symmetry depending on the state of the airways. In conclusion, when confronted with a respiratory challenge, sleeping humans undergo small, but significant, breathing-related oscillations in interhemispheric dominance, similar to those observed in marine mammals. The evidence points to a relationship between cetacean unihemispheric sleep and their respiratory challenges.

However, only limited data are available in the literature on factors driving variability in concentrations of organic pollutants in this species. This study characterizes the differences in contaminant concentrations in subcutaneous fat of male mink from four different areas in Sweden and demonstrates how age, season and body condition influence concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners (including methoxylated forms, MeO-PBDEs), as well as the pesticides dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), chlordane and hexachlorobenzene (HCB). The data were statistically treated using multiple regression and principal component analysis. The Sigma PCB concentration and concentrations of PCB congeners 138, 156, 157, 180,170/190, 189, 194, 206, 209 as well as PBDE 153/154 varied with age. Season had an influence on Sigma PCB, PBDE 47 and PBDE 153/154 concentrations, as well as concentrations of most PCB congeners, with the exception of PCB 101, 110, 141 and 182/187. Lean mink had higher concentrations of most PCBs and PBDEs than mink with larger fat depots. The analyzed pesticides (DDE, oxychlordane, HCB) showed no systematic variation with season, age or body condition. The concentrations of MeO-PBDEs were generally low and 6Me-PBDEO 47 was the most commonly detected MeO-PBDE in mink from marine, brackish and freshwater areas. The results indicate that age, season and body condition are factors that may influence the concentrations of PCBs and PBDEs, and it is thus recommended to take these factors into account when analyzing mink exposure data.

Risk assessment of herbicides and booster biocides along estuarine continuums in the Bay of Vilaine area (Brittany, France)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												A 2-year study was implemented to characterize the contamination of estuarine continuums in the Bay of Vilaine area (NW Atlantic Coast, Southern Brittany, France) by 30 pesticide and biocide active substances and metabolites. Among these, 11 triazines (ametryn, atrazine, desethylatrazine, desethylterbuthylazine, desisopropyl atrazine, Irgarol 1051, prometryn, propazine, simazine, terbuthylazine, and terbutryn), 10 phenylureas (chlortoluron, diuron, 1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-methylurea, fenuron, isoproturon, 1-(4-isopropylphenyl)-3-methylurea, 1-(4-isopropylphenyl)-urea, linuron, metoxuron, and monuron), and 4 chloroacetanilides (acetochlor, alachlor, metolachlor, and metazachlor) were detected at least once. The objectives were to assess the corresponding risk for aquatic primary producers and to provide exposure information for connected studies on the responses of biological parameters in invertebrate sentinel species. The risk associated with contaminants was assessed using risk quotients based on the comparison of measured concentrations with original species sensitivity distribution-derived hazardous concentration values. For EU Water Framework Directive priority substances, results of monitoring were also compared with regulatory Environmental Quality Standards. The highest residue concentrations and risks for primary producers were recorded for diuron and Irgarol 1051 in Arzal reservoir, close to a marina. Diuron was present during almost the all survey periods, whereas Irgarol 1051 exhibited a clear seasonal pattern, with highest concentrations recorded in June and July. These results suggest that the use of antifouling biocides is responsible for a major part of the contamination of the lower part of the Vilaine River course for Irgarol 1051. For diuron, agricultural sources may also be involved. The presence of isoproturon and chloroacetanilide herbicides on some dates indicated a significant contribution of the use of plant protection products in agriculture to the contamination of Vilaine River. Concentration levels and associated risk were always lower in estuarine sites than in the reservoir, suggesting that Arzal dam reduces downstream transfer of contaminants and favors their degradation in the freshwater part of the estuary. Results of the additional monitoring of two tidal streams located downstream of Arzal dam suggested that, although some compounds may be transferred to the estuary, their impact was probably very low. Dilution by marine water associated with tidal current was also a major factor of concentration reduction. It is concluded that the highest risks associated to herbicides and booster biocides concerned the freshwater part of the estuary and that its brackish/saltwater part was exposed to a moderate risk, although some substances may sometimes exhibit high concentration but mainly at low tide and on an irregular basis.

Focusing on the mussel gills, first target of toxic water contaminants and actively proliferating tissue, we detected significant dose-related increases of cells with micronuclei and other nuclear abnormalities in the treated mussels, with differences in the bioconcentration of the three metals determined in the mussel flesh by atomic absorption spectrometry. Gene expression profiles, determined in the same individual gills in parallel, revealed some transcriptional changes at the 50 nM dose, and substantial increases of differentially expressed genes at the 100 and 200 nM doses, with roughly similar amounts of up-and down-regulated genes. The functional annotation of gill transcripts with consistent expression trends and significantly altered at least in one dose point disclosed the complexity of the induced cell response. The most evident transcriptional changes concerned protein synthesis and turnover, ion homeostasis, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, and intracellular trafficking (transcript sequences denoting heat shock proteins, metal binding thioneins, sequestosome 1 and proteasome subunits, and GADD45 exemplify up-regulated genes while transcript sequences denoting actin, tubulins and the apoptosis inhibitor 1 exemplify down-regulated genes). Overall, nanomolar doses of co-occurring free metal ions have induced significant structural and functional changes in the mussel gills: the intensity of response to the stimulus measured in laboratory supports the additional validation of molecular markers of metal exposure to be used in Mussel Watch programs.

Chicks of 21 sympatric seabirds presented a wide range of Hg concentrations, with the highest contaminated species containing similar to 102 times more feather Hg than the less contaminated species. Hence, Kerguelen seabirds encompass the whole range of chick feather Hg values that were previously collected worldwide in poorly industrialized localities. Using stable isotopes, the effects of foraging habitats (reflected by delta C-13) and trophic positions (reflected by delta N-15) on Hg concentrations were investigated. Species-related Hg variations were highly and positively linked to feather delta N-15 values, thus highlighting the occurrence of efficient Hg biomagnification processes within subantarctic marine trophic webs. By contrast, Hg contamination overall correlated poorly with feeding habitats, because of the pooling of species foraging within different isotopic gradients corresponding to distinct seabird habitats (benthic, pelagic, neritic and oceanic). However, when focusing on oceanic seabirds, Hg concentration was related to feather delta C-13 values, with species feeding in colder waters (lower delta C-13 values) south of Kerguelen Islands being less prone to be contaminated than species feeding in northern warmer waters (higher delta C-13 values). Within the context of continuous increase in global Hg emissions, Kerguelen Islands that are located far away from anthropogenic sources can be considered as an ideal study site to monitor the temporal trend of global Hg contamination. The present work helps selecting some seabird species as sentinels of environmental pollution according to their high Hg concentrations and their contrasted foraging ecology.

A.; Ramiro Pastorinho, M.; Takahashi, Shin; Tanabe, Shinsuke			Organotin Compounds from Snails to Humans	POLLUTANT DISEASES, REMEDIATION AND RECYCLING	Environmental Chemistry for a Sustainable World											Human activities are producing and transforming more than 140,000 chemical compounds according to the European Union Regulation REACH (registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals). Humans and wildlife can be exposed to chemicals at all stages of the chemical life cycle: raw material extraction, manufacturing and processing, use, recycling or disposal. Some chemicals can mimic or antagonize hormone action, affecting the normal functioning of organisms. These chemicals, defined as endocrine disruptors, include among many other organotin compounds. Organotins are the most widely used organometallic compounds for agricultural, industrial and biomedical applications with an annual production of about 60,000 tons. The most notorious organotin is tributyltin, a potent biocide used in antifouling paints. Tributyltin has adverse and even bizarre effects, such as imposex, on aquatic organisms. Tributyltin, derivatives and to a lesser extent other classes of organotins are found in all compartments of the aquatic environment due to the intensive use of organotins for the protection of ships hulls and other immersed structures. The lowest concentrations are found in the water column, whereas the highest are detected in sediments and biota, particularly in top predators. Humans are highly exposed because they consume top predators and other fishes and shellfish. Tributyltin became thus a well-known example of how chemicals can have a global detrimental effect on the environment, even to the eyes of public opinion. Organotins include also tributyltin derivatives (dibutyltin, monobutyltin), phenyltins (triphenyltin, diphenyltin and monophenyltin), octyltins (trioctyltin, dioctyltin and monooctyltin) and methyltins: trimethyltin, dimethyltin and monomethyltin. They are employed as biocides, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) stabilizers and industrial catalysts for the manufacture of silicone and polyurethane foams. Such diverse industrial applications imply their presence on our everyday lives in clothes, pillows, toys, wallpaper, plastic food containers, pipes including drinking water mains and household piping, medical devices and breast implants. Hence, humans are exposed to organotins not solely through ingestion of contaminated food but also by inhalation and ingestion of dust and through direct contact with treated products. As a consequence, organotins have already been detected in human samples and toxicity data reveals that they are endocrine disruptors, imunotoxicants and carcinogens. Moreover, a link to obesity was recently established. We review the levels, fate and effects of organotin compounds towards wildlife and humans, starting with a description of organotin applications, with particular incidence in antifouling paints. The need to develop antifouling strategies is presented and the history on the use of tributyltin as the active biocide described. The global contamination of the marine environment and the deleterious effects of tributyltin towards non-target organisms are addressed. Particular attention is drawn to the imposex phenomenon, with an historical perspective and a brief explanation on the induction mechanisms proposed. A case study of imposex in a sentinel species - Nassarius reticulatus - is also presented. The restrictions on tributyltin use in antifouling paints are also described alongside with the new regulations for other organotins used in consumer products. The sources and pathways of organotins in the environment are briefly addressed and an overview of marine environmental levels is provided alongside with references to regional and global monitoring surveys. At last, studies in human exposure to organotins are presented, a thorough review on human tissues burdens is performed and future research is proposed.					Pastorinho, M.

J	Keledjian, AJ; Mesnick, S				Keledjian, Amanda J.; Mesnick, Sarah			The Impacts of El Nino Conditions on California Sea Lion (Zalophus californianus) Fisheries Interactions: Predicting Spatial and Temporal Hotspots Along the California Coast	AQUATIC MAMMALS												California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) are often viewed as a sentinel species whose health can be affected by prevailing oceanographic conditions and environmental quality. For this reason, it has become increasingly important to study natural stressors and anthropogenic impacts that can lead to diminished health and survival among individuals of this coastal species. In this study, Z. californianus stranding records spanning 1983 to 2010 were used to first identify regional and seasonal fisheries interaction hotspots in California, and second, to examine how these hotspots might change under additional environmental stress induced by El Nino oceanographic conditions that can affect prey availability. Analyzing mean monthly fisheries interaction cases as an example of human-related stranding revealed that (1) the number of monthly fisheries interaction cases has risen significantly over time proportional to statewide abundance estimates; (2) cases were significantly higher in Monterey, Los Angeles, and Orange Counties; (3) cases peaked May through August; and (4) fisheries interactions were significantly greater during El Nino conditions throughout the state. These results indicated that over a 27-y period, California sea lion health was affected by oceanographic conditions and that anthropogenic impacts may be heightened in early summer following the weaning period when young animals learning to forage may be less successful in El Nino conditions. Spatially and temporally explicit data such as these can be useful in mapping marine mammal health and understanding the dynamic natural and anthropogenic landscapes in which they are a part.																	0167-5427						2013	39	3					221	232		10.1578/AM.39.3.2013.221								WOS:000323549300002

NNMREC is a Department of Energy-sponsored partnership among Oregon State University (OSU), the University of Washington (UW), and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The Ocean Sentinel instrumentation buoy is a surface buoy based on the 6-m NOMAD (Navy Oceanographic Meteorological Automatic Device) design. The Ocean Sentinel provides power analysis, data acquisition, and environmental monitoring, as well as an active converter interface to control power dissipation to an onboard electrical load. The WEC being tested and the instrumentation buoy are moored with approximately 125 meters separation; connected by a power and communication umbilical cable. The Ocean Sentinel was completed in 2012 and was deployed for the testing of a WEC at the NNMREC open-ocean test site, north of Newport, OR, during August and September of 2012.																	0025-3324					JAN-FEB	2013	47	1					47	54		10.4031/MTSJ.47.1.4								WOS:000316585600005						
J	Coll, M; Navarro, J; Palomera, I				Coll, Marta; Navarro, Joan; Palomera, Isabel			Ecological role, fishing impact, and management options for the recovery of a Mediterranean endemic skate by means of food web models	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												The Mediterranean endemic starry ray (Raja asterias) is one of the few demersal skates that are still present in Mediterranean exploited ecosystems. However, this species has declined with time, its presence in survey data is scarce, and limited information is available about its ecology and the impact of fishing on its populations. We examined key ecological features of this species such as reproduction, trophic behaviour and growth. We assessed the ecological role of this species within the food web using an ecological model of a North-Western Mediterranean ecosystem and setting the new information in an ecosystem context. We then explored impacts of fishing on the starry ray population using a dynamic temporal model and we developed fishing scenarios aiming at recovering the species. Field and modelling results showed that the starry ray is a potentially ecologically important predator of the Mediterranean demersal ecosystems, but its ecological importance in the food web is moderate-low since it is present at a low abundance. Results confirmed that the species has been and still is highly impacted by fishing and it is very sensitive to increasing fishing impacts. However, alternative fishing scenarios showed that Mediterranean starry ray populations may respond under decreasing trawl fishing effort and could substantially recover. The recovery of the starry ray may be accompanied by recovery of other demersal species and could have wider ecosystem impacts. Therefore, this skate could be a good sentinel species to indicate ecosystem health in current Mediterranean Sea ecosystems. These new insights may be useful to ensure the recovery and conservation of this species while triggering the recovery of exploited marine communities in the Mediterranean Sea. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We simultaneously evaluated the influence of individuals' trophic position (as revealed by delta N-15 values) and dietary exploitation of particular systems (using delta C-13 and delta S-34 as proxies) on inorganic pollutant concentrations measured on fledglings' feathers of a wide-range feeder, the Yellow-legged Gull (Larus michahellis), sampled at four locations throughout the Western Mediterranean. Concentrations of total Hg and Se in fledgling feathers (2.43 +/- 1.30 and 1.16 +/- 0.43 mu g/g, respectively) were under the threshold points for deleterious effects on seabirds. On the contrary, alarming Pb concentrations were found in one colony (mean: 1.57 +/- 2.46 mu g/g, range: 0.16-12.13). With the exception of Pb, pollutant concentrations were positively influenced by consumption of marine resources (as suggested by the positive relationship with delta S-34 values), whereas trophic position played a minor role in determining pollutant body burdens.

J	Suarez, P; Ruiz, Y; Alonso, A; San Juan, F				Suarez, Pilar; Ruiz, Yolanda; Alonso, Ana; San Juan, Fuencisla			Organochlorine compounds in mussels cultured in the Ria of Vigo: Accumulation and origin	CHEMOSPHERE												This paper analyzes the influence of mussel physiological conditions on bioaccumulation of organochlorine pollutants. A direct relationship between reproductive stage, lipid content and accumulation of PCBs, DDTs and HCHs was observed. The organochlorine compounds accumulated by mussels cultured in the Ria of Vigo show levels below the limits set by the European legislation for human consumption, ranging between 12.50-58, 2.21-10.80 and 0.50-2.69 mu g kg(-1) dry weight for PCBs, DDTs and HCHs, respectively. Other organochlorine pesticides normally present in estuarine areas, such as hexachlorobenzene (HCB), aldrin, chlordane and nonachlor were not detected. The proportion of PCBs, between 2 and 7 times higher than OCPs, indicates a pollution of predominantly industrial origin in the sampling area. Several molecular indices were used to identify the source of accumulated OCPs by Mytilus, showing recent inputs of technical DDT, mainly in summer-autumn, and continued discharges of lindane. On the other hand, other pesticides containing DDT impurities, such as dicofol, can contribute to DDT pollution in the Ria of Vigo. Multivariate analysis suggests the usefulness of including physiological parameters such as the gonad condition index and lipid content of sentinel organisms in environmental biomonitoring of lipophilic pollutants, as well as in the determination of their origin.

Coris julis (Linneaus, 1758) was chosen as a sentinel organism, and the specimens were collected from three well-known sites along the Ionic coast of Sicily: the protected marine area (P.M.A) "Cyclops Islands" of Acitrezza (CT), used as a control site, Riposto (CT), and the industrial site of Augusta (SR). Abiotic levels of contaminants were also detected. High levels of biotic and abiotic accumulation were found at the industrial site in which the presence of genotoxic and oxidative damage were also evidenced, measured by Micronuclei, Alkaline and Fpg-modified Comet assays. The protein expression analysis showed metallothioneins (MTs) as good tissue-specific markers of metal accumulation. Their levels were significantly higher in muscle than in liver tissue for all the sampling sites, with a positive correlation among tissue levels and the degree of pollution at the sites. Conversely, heat shock proteins 70 (HSP70) expression was higher in Augusta and Riposto than in the control site, but no significant difference was found between the examined tissues among all sites.

Annual Variation in the Levels of Transcripts of Sex-Specific Genes in the Mantle of the Common Mussel, Mytilus edulis	PLOS ONE												Mytilus species are used as sentinels for the assessment of environmental health but sex or stage in the reproduction cycle is rarely considered even though both parameters are likely to influence responses to pollution. We have validated the use of a qPCR assay for sex identification and related the levels of transcripts to the reproductive cycle. A temporal study of mantle of Mytilus edulis found transcripts of male-specific vitelline coat lysin (VCL) and female-specific vitelline envelope receptor for lysin (VERL) could identify sex over a complete year. The levels of VCL/VERL were proportional to the numbers of sperm/ova and are indicative of the stage of the reproductive cycle. Maximal levels of VCL and VERL were found in February 2009 declining to minima between July - August before increasing and re-attaining a peak in February 2010. Water temperature may influence these transitions since they coincide with minimal water temperature in February and maximal temperature in August. An identical pattern of variation was found for a cryptic female-specific transcript (H5) but a very different pattern was observed for oestrogen receptor 2 (ER2). ER2 varied in a sex-specific way with male > female for most of the cycle, with a female maxima in July and a male maxima in December. Using artificially spawned animals, the transcripts for VCL, VERL and H5 were shown to be present in gametes and thus their disappearance from mantle is indicative of spawning. VCL and VERL are present at equivalent levels in February and July-August but during gametogenesis (August to January) and spawning (March to June) VCL is present at lower relative amounts than VERL. This may indicate sex-specific control mechanisms for these processes and highlight a potential pressure point leading to reduced reproductive output if environmental factors cause asynchrony to gamete maturation or release.																	1932-6203					NOV 30	2012	7	11							e50861	10.1371/journal.pone.0050861								WOS:000312376100218	23226407

Effect of beta-naphthoflavone on hepatic cytochrome P4501A activity in the scribbled rabbitfish (Siganus spinus) from tropical Indo-Pacific coral reefs	ECOTOXICOLOGY												Several classes of carcinogenic environmental organic pollutants, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and dioxins, negatively affect aquatic ecosystems worldwide. Pollutant detection is often difficult and expensive, especially when dealing with complex mixtures and matrices. Biological markers are informative tools to identify living sources that may harbor toxic compounds and areas unsuitable for recreation. Currently, no species have established biomarkers for organopollutant monitoring in Indo-Pacific coral reefs. This study evaluated the time-and dose-dependent induction of the cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) system in the scribbled rabbitfish, Siganus spinus (Siganidae), as a biomarker for organic pollutant exposures in these environments. Results indicate that S. spinus hepatic CYP1A enzymatic activity and protein level respond dose-, and time-dependently following a single intraperitoneal injection of the classic aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist, beta-naphthoflavone. S. spinus hepatic CYP1A protein and enzymatic activity rose as function of dose during the first two days and slowly returned to levels close to normal after 16 days, as measured using the 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase and the noncompetitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, respectively. These findings support use of the inducible CYP1A system of S. spinus as a biomarker for reef fish exposure to coastal marine pollution. Baseline CYP1A expression levels among Guam's wild S. spinus populations were also measured and compared.																	0963-9292	1573-3017				NOV	2012	21	8					2153	2162		10.1007/s10646-012-0969-1								WOS:000312664900006	22760666

Mercury sources and fate in the Gulf of Maine	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Most human exposure to mercury (Hg) in the United States is from consuming marine fish and shellfish. The Gulf of Maine is a complex marine ecosystem comprising twelve physioregions, including the Bay of Fundy, coastal shelf areas and deeper basins that contain highly productive fishing grounds. Here we review available data on spatial and temporal Hg trends to better understand the drivers of human and biological exposures. Atmospheric Hg deposition from U.S. and Canadian sources has declined since the mid-1990s in concert with emissions reductions and deposition from global sources has increased. Oceanographic circulation is the dominant source of total Hg inputs to the entire Gulf of Maine region (59%), followed by atmospheric deposition (28%), wastewater/industrial sources (8%) and rivers (5%). Resuspension of sediments increases MeHg inputs to overlying waters, raising concerns about benthic trawling activities in shelf regions. In the near coastal areas, elevated sediment and mussel Hg levels are co-located in urban embayments and near large historical point sources. Temporal patterns in sentinel species (mussels and birds) have in some cases declined in response to localized point source mercury reductions but overall Hg trends do not show consistent declines. For example, levels of Hg have either declined or remained stable in eggs from four seabird species collected in the Bay of Fundy since 1972. Quantitatively linking Hg exposures from fish harvested from the Gulf of Maine to human health risks is challenging at this time because no data are available on the geographic origin of seafood consumed by coastal residents. In addition, there is virtually no information on Hg levels in commercial species for offshore regions of the Gulf of Maine where some of the most productive fisheries are located. Both of these data gaps should be priorities for future research. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The effects of exposure (up to 96 h) and plastic ingestion were observed at the cellular and subcellular level. Microplastic uptake into the gills and digestive gland was analyzed by a new method using polarized light microscopy. Mussel health status was investigated incorporating histological assessment and cytochemical biomarkers of toxic effects and early warning. In addition to being drawn into the gills, HDPE particles were taken up into the stomach and transported into the digestive gland where they accumulated in the lysosomal system after 3 h of exposure. Our results show notable histological changes upon uptake and a strong inflammatory response demonstrated by the formation of granulocytomas after 6 h and lysosomal membrane destabilization, which significantly increased with longer exposure times. We provide proof of principle that microplastics are taken up into cells and cause significant effects on the tissue and cellular level, which can be assessed with standard cytochemical biomarkers and polarized light microscopy for microplastic tracking in tissue.																	0013-936X					OCT 16	2012	46	20					11327	11335		10.1021/es302332w								WOS:000309805000062	22963286

Biological effects of palytoxin-like compounds from Ostreopsis cf. ovata: A multibiomarkers approach with mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis	CHEMOSPHERE												Massive blooms of the harmful benthic dinoflagellate Ostreopsis cf. ovata are of growing environmental concern in the Mediterranean, having recently caused adverse effects on benthic invertebrates and also some intoxication episodes to humans. The toxicological potential of produced palytoxin-like compounds was investigated in the present study on a typical marine sentinel species, the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. Organisms were sampled during various phases of a O. cf. ovata bloom, in two differently impacted sites. The presence of the algal toxins was indirectly assessed in mussels tissues (mouse test and hemolysis neutralization assay), while biological and toxicological effects were evaluated through the measurement of osmoregulatory and neurotoxic alterations (Na+/K+-ATPase and acetylcholinesterase activities), oxidative stress responses (antioxidant defences and total oxyradical scavenging capacity), lipid peroxidation processes (level of malondialdehyde), peroxisomal proliferation, organelle dysfunctions (lysosomal membrane stability. accumulation of lipofuscin and neutral lipids), immunological impairment (granulocytes percentage). Obtained results demonstrated a significant accumulation of algal toxins in mussels exposed to O. cf. ovata. These organisms exhibited a marked inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase activity and alterations of immunological, lysosomal and neurotoxic responses. Markers of oxidative stress showed more limited variations suggesting that toxicity of the O. cf. ovata toxins is not primarily mediated by an over production of reactive oxygen species. This study provided preliminary results on the usefulness of a multi-biomarker approach to assess biological alterations and toxicological events associated to blooms of O. cf. ovata in marine organisms.

Alonso			Health Assessment and Seroepidemiologic Survey of Potential Pathogens in Wild Antillean Manatees (Trichechus manatus manatus)	PLOS ONE												The Antillean manatee (Trichechus manatus manatus), a subspecies of the West Indian manatee, inhabits fresh, brackish, and warm coastal waters distributed along the eastern border of Central America, the northern coast of South America, and throughout the Wider Caribbean Region. Threatened primarily by human encroachment, poaching, and habitat degradation, Antillean manatees are listed as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The impact of disease on population viability remains unknown in spite of concerns surrounding the species' ability to rebound from a population crash should an epizootic occur. To gain insight on the baseline health of this subspecies, a total of 191 blood samples were collected opportunistically from wild Antillean manatees in Belize between 1997 and 2009. Hematologic and biochemical reference intervals were established, and antibody prevalence to eight pathogens with zoonotic potential was determined. Age was found to be a significant factor of variation in mean blood values, whereas sex, capture site, and season contributed less to overall differences in parameter values. Negative antibody titers were reported for all pathogens surveyed except for Leptospira bratislava, L. canicola, and L. icterohemorrhagiae, Toxoplasma gondii, and morbillivirus. As part of comprehensive health assessment in manatees from Belize, this study will serve as a benchmark aiding in early disease detection and in the discernment of important epidemiologic patterns in the manatees of this region. Additionally, it will provide some of the initial tools to explore the broader application of manatees as sentinel species of nearshore ecosystem health.

Heavy metals and related biomarkers in Perna viridis (Bivalvia: Mytilidae) collected on the coast of Sucre State, Venezuela	CIENCIAS MARINAS												The green mussel Perna viridis has been used as a sentinel organism in marine and coastal ecosystem health assessments. In this study the degree of contamination at three sites on the coast of Sucre State (Venezuela) was analyzed using molecular, cellular, and immunological biomarkers in P viridis. Specimens were collected from Chacopata-Guayacan (CG, Araya Peninsula), Rio Caribe (RC, Paria Peninsula), and San Antonio del Golfo (SAG, southern Gulf of Cariaco). We determined the concentration of heavy metals in the soft tissue of each individual, as well as the total number, viability, phagocytosis, and stability of the lysosomal membranes in hemocytes. The oxidative damage to lipids (TBARS), sulfhydryl group levels, total proteins, and lysozyme activity were quantified in the digestive gland. The results revealed high concentrations of Zn, Cr, and Cd in the organisms from CG. The total hemolymph cell count was lower in organisms from RC and CG A slight increase in the number of phagocytes was observed in the organisms from RC and CG relative to those from SAG. The highest percentage of hemocytes with destabilized lysosomal membranes was recorded for the organisms from CG, followed by RC, indicating a weak association with the content of peroxidized lipids (TBARS); these values could be associated with the body loads of heavy metals.. According to the results, the mussels from CG show slight signs of contamination by heavy metals, likely originated by human activities. The use of biological markers to estimate the effect of heavy metals on sentinel organisms is recommended.																	0185-3880					SEP	2012	38	3					517	528		10.7773/cm.v38i3.2046								WOS:000309309500004

Mercury Concentrations in Hair from Neonatal and Juvenile Steller Sea Lions (Eumetopias jubatus): Implications Based on Age and Region in this Northern Pacific Marine Sentinel Piscivore	ECOHEALTH												Mercury is a global contaminant of concern for the fetus and the neonate of piscivores. Methylmercury, produced within marine ecosystems, is of particular concern as a readily absorbed neurotoxicant transported across the blood brain barrier and transplacentally. In the North Pacific Ocean, Steller sea lions are broadly distributed apex predators and, as such, integrate complex food webs and the associated exposure and possible adverse effects of toxic and infectious agents. Hair, including lanugo, was examined using regional and age groupings to assess mercury concentrations in young Alaskan Steller sea lions. The highest concentrations of mercury occurred in the youngest animals, likely via in utero exposure. Based on the adverse developmental outcomes of methylmercury toxicity this specific cohort is of concern. Regionally, higher concentrations of mercury were observed in the endangered western population of Steller sea lions and mirrored patterns observed in human biomonitoring studies of Alaskan coastal communities. These data have broader implications with respect to human and ecosystem health as Steller sea lions rely on similar prey species and foraging areas as those targeted by commercial fisheries and subsistence users and are therefore valuable sentinels of marine ecosystem health.

A recurrent feature at both the population and community level was the differentiation of the samples along the increasing PCB levels simultaneously registered in the sediments. Both directly transmitted ectoparasites and endoparasites with complex life-cycles transmitted via food chains exhibited a decrease in abundance with the increase in PCB levels. Parasite numerical responses translated into significant differences in infracommunity structure with decreasing predictability associated with increasing PCB levels. The abundance of two species, the specialist Opecoeloides furcatus and the generalist nematode Hysterothylacium fabri, contributed substantially to the observed dissimilarity between infracommunity samples along the gradient. The observed parasite responses to moderate levels of pollution were simultaneously validated by both chemical monitoring and effect biomarkers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A global review of the cosmopolitan flathead mullet Mugil cephalus Linnaeus 1758 (Teleostei: Mugilidae), with emphasis on the biology, genetics, ecology and fisheries aspects of this apparent species complex	REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES												This study reviews published information on Mugil cephalus from around the world, with recent genetic studies indicating that the flathead mullet may indeed be a species complex. Disciplines that are covered range from the taxonomy, genetics and systematics, through a variety of biological and ecological attributes, to biomarker and fisheries studies. The eurytopic nature of M. cephalus is emphasized, with the migratory life history covering a succession of very different aquatic environments (e.g. rivers, estuaries, coastal lakes/lagoons, marine littoral, open ocean), each of which is occupied for varying lengths of time, depending on the population characteristics within a region and the life-history stage of the species. Interpretation of these movements over time has been greatly enhanced by the use of otolith microchemistry which has enabled scientists to map out the different habitats occupied by individual fish at the different life stages. The range of physico-chemical attributes within these environments necessitates a wide tolerance to differing conditions, especially with regard to salinity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen and temperature, all of which are discussed in this review. The importance of M. cephalus to the ecological functioning of coastal systems is emphasized, as well as the pivotal role that this species fulfills in fisheries in some parts of the world. The parasites range from internal trematode and cestode infestations, to external branchyuran and copepod parasites, which use M. cephalus as either an intermediate or final host. The value of the flathead mullet as a biomarker for the monitoring of the health of coastal habitats is discussed, as well as its potential as an indicator or sentinel species for certain ecosystems.

Although this emerging compound has been detected in aquatic environments, scarce information is found on the effects of Triclosan to marine organisms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxicity of a concentration range of Triclosan through fertilization assay (reproductive success), embryo-larval development assay (early life stage) and physiological stress (Neutral Red Retention Time assay - NRRT) (adult stage) in the marine sentinel organism Perna perm The mean inhibition concentrations for fertilization (IC50 = 0.490 mg L-1) and embryo-larval development (IC50 = 0.135 mg L-1) tests were above environmental relevant concentrations (ng L-1) given by previous studies. Differently, significant reduction on NRRT results was found at 12 ng L-1, demonstrating the current risk of the continuous introduction of Triclosan into aquatic environments, and the need of ecotoxicological studies oriented by the mechanism of action of the compound.

Nontargeted Comprehensive Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography/Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry Method and Software for Inventorying Persistent and Bioaccumulative Contaminants in Marine Environments	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Analytical methods for contaminant monitoring are generally targeted; i.e., they measure defined lists compounds. Routine monitoring projects using targeted methods are not usually designed to screen for unrecognized or novel contaminants and therefore miss compounds within the region or population of study that cause, or have the potential to cause, adverse biological impacts. We describe a nontargeted analytical method utilizing direct sample introduction coupled to comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry. To test the capabilities of this instrumental method within the context of marine contaminant surveys, we characterized a broad array of nonpolar, persistent, and bioaccumulative contaminants in Atlantic common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) blubber, including compounds that are not typically monitored. Compound identifications were made by searching a standard reference database, by contemporaneously analyzing mass spectra from reference standards, and by de novo interpretation. We identified a total of 271 compounds belonging to 24 classes; all compounds but 1 were halogenated. Anthropogenic contaminants and halogenated natural products were concurrently detected. A total of 86 compounds were anthropogenic contaminants that are not routinely targeted in environmental surveys, and 54 compounds were halogenated natural products. A total of 112 spectra were identified de novo, demonstrating that exclusive reliance on commercially available reference standards and mass spectral libraries may miss a significant fraction of identifiable compounds. We also cataloged 27 halogenated mass spectra that were not able to be identified. Due to the volume and complexity of the identification data, we developed custom software to organize and provide shared access to the identified mass spectra and related information. The nontargeted analytical method and data reporting system, in combination with the analysis of a high-trophic-level sentinel species, demonstrates a framework for creating an inventory of persistent and bioaccumulative contaminants in marine environments, with the future goal of suggesting new compounds for further investigation by targeted monitoring and risk assessment.

J	Srinivasan, U; Quader, S				Srinivasan, Umesh; Quader, Suhel			To Eat and Not Be Eaten: Modelling Resources and Safety in Multi-Species Animal Groups	PLOS ONE												Using mixed-species bird flocks as an example, we model the payoffs for two types of species from participating in multi-species animal groups. Salliers feed on mobile prey, are good sentinels and do not affect prey capture rates of gleaners; gleaners feed on prey on substrates and can enhance the prey capture rate of salliers by flushing prey, but are poor sentinels. These functional types are known from various animal taxa that form multi-species associations. We model costs and benefits of joining groups for a wide range of group compositions under varying abundances of two types of prey-prey on substrates and mobile prey. Our model predicts that gleaners and salliers show a conflict of interest in multi-species groups, because gleaners benefit from increasing numbers of salliers in the group, whereas salliers benefit from increasing gleaner numbers. The model also predicts that the limits to size and variability in composition of multi-species groups are driven by the relative abundance of different types of prey, independent of predation pressure. Our model emphasises resources as a primary driver of temporal and spatial group dynamics, rather than reproductive activity or predation per se, which have hitherto been thought to explain patterns of multi-species group formation and cohesion. The qualitative predictions of the model are supported by empirical patterns from both terrestrial and marine multi-species groups, suggesting that similar mechanisms might underlie group dynamics in a range of taxa. The model also makes novel predictions about group dynamics that can be tested using variation across space and time.																	1932-6203					JUL 27	2012	7	7							e42071	10.1371/journal.pone.0042071								WOS:000306950200155	22848706

EPIDEMIOLOGY AND POTENTIAL LAND-SEA TRANSFER OF ENTERIC BACTERIA FROM TERRESTRIAL TO MARINE SPECIES IN THE MONTEREY BAY REGION OF CALIFORNIA	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES												Marine mammals are at risk for infection by fecal-associated zoonotic pathogens when they swim and feed in polluted nearshore marine waters. Because of their tendency to consume 25-30% of their body weight per day in coastal filter-feeding invertebrates, southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis) can act as sentinels of marine ecosystem health in California. Feces from domestic and wildlife species were tested to determine prevalence, potential virulence, and diversity of selected opportunistic enteric bacterial pathogens in the Monterey Bay region. We hypothesized that if sea otters are sentinels of coastal health, and fecal pollution flows from land to sea, then sea otters and terrestrial animals might share the same enteric bacterial species and strains. Twenty-eight percent of fecal samples tested during 2007-2010 were positive for one or more potential pathogens. Campylobacter spp. were isolated most frequently, with an overall prevalence of 11%, followed by Vibrio cholerae (9%), Salmonella spp. (6%), V. parahaemolyticus (5%), and V. alginolyticus (3%). Sea otters were found positive for all target bacteria, exhibiting similar prevalences for Campylobacter and Salmonella spp. but greater prevalences for Vibrio spp. when compared to terrestrial animals. Fifteen Salmonella serotypes were detected, 11 of which were isolated from opossums. This is the first report of sea otter infection by S. enterica Heidelberg, a serotype also associated with human clinical disease. Similar strains of S. enterica Typhimurium were identified in otters, opossums, and gulls, suggesting the possibility of land-sea transfer of enteric bacterial pathogens from terrestrial sources to sea otters.

Inability to demonstrate fish-to-fish transmission of Ichthyophonus from laboratory infected Pacific herring Clupea pallasii to naive conspecifics	DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS												The parasite Ichthyophonus is enzootic in many marine fish populations of the northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Forage fishes are a likely source of infection for higher trophic level predators; however, the processes that maintain Ichthyophonus in forage fish populations (primarily clupeids) are not well understood. Lack of an identified intermediate host has led to the convenient hypothesis that the parasite can be maintained within populations of schooling fishes by waterborne fish-to-fish transmission. To test this hypothesis we established Ichthyophonus infections in Age-1 and young-of-the-year (YOY) Pacific herring Clupea pallasii (Valenciennes) via intraperitoneal (IP) injection and cohabitated these donors with naive conspecifics (sentinels) in the laboratory. IP injections established infection in 75 to 84% of donor herring, and this exposure led to clinical disease and mortality in the YOY cohort. However, after cohabitation for 113 d no infections were detected in naive sentinels. These data do not preclude the possibility of fish-to- fish transmission, but they do suggest that other transmission processes are necessary to maintain Ichthyophonus in wild Pacific herring populations.																	0177-5103					JUN 13	2012	99	2					139	144		10.3354/dao02458								WOS:000305188900006	22691982					
J	Bolognesi, C; Fenech, M				Bolognesi, Claudia; Fenech, Michael			Mussel micronucleus cytome assay	NATURE PROTOCOLS												The micronucleus (MN) assay is one of the most widely used genotoxicity biomarkers in aquatic organisms, providing an efficient measure of chromosomal DNA damage occurring as a result of either chromosome breakage or chromosome mis-segregation during mitosis. The MN assay is today applied in laboratory and field studies using hemocytes and gill cells from bivalves, mainly from the genera Mytilus. These represent 'sentinel' organisms because of their ability to survive under polluted conditions and to accumulate both organic and inorganic pollutants. Because the mussel MN assay also includes scoring of different cell types, including necrotic and apoptotic cells and other nuclear anomalies, it is in effect an MN cytome assay. The mussel MN cytome (MUMNcyt) assay protocol we describe here reports the recommended experimental design, sample size, cell preparation, cell fixation and staining methods. The protocol also includes criteria and photomicrographs for identifying different cell types and scoring criteria for micronuclei (MNi) and nuclear buds.

Metabolomic analysis of sex specific metabolites in gonads of the mussel, Mytilus edulis	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY D-GENOMICS & PROTEOMICS												Marine mussels have been used as sentinel organisms to monitor exposure to a variety of chemical contaminants, including endocrine disrupting chemicals, in the aquatic environment. Although they are an important species for use in ecotoxicology investigations, information on their reproductive physiology and biochemistry is fragmentary. Mass spectrometry-based profiling techniques are increasingly being used to study how the metabolome of an organism changes as a result of tissue differentiation, disease or in response to environmental stressors. In this study, ultraperformance liquid chromatography-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-TOFMS) was used to investigate sex specific differences in the mussel metabolome in order to further investigate the reproductive physiology of this species. Using this method, a comparison of female and male mantle tissues containing mature gonad, revealed significant differences in glycerophosphatidylcholine (PC) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) metabolites. A number of other unidentified metabolites, including those putatively identified as conjugated sterols, were also differentially expressed between male and female mantle/gonadal tissue.

The first of these satellite series will be launched in 2013. The Sentinel missions will provide a unique set of observations utilising different techniques spanning C-band SAR, mid to medium resolution optical and thermal observations with increased spectral resolution, altimeter and dedicated spectrometers for atmospheric chemistry. This data, combined with in-situ data, some assimilated into models, will then be turned into services for monitoring the environment, the climate and for security related issues. The GMES Space Component (GSC) is organised in two overlapping phases: the development phase and the operational phase, the latter planned to start in 2014. The main challenge is now to ensure the programme's long-term sustainability. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

One-year monitoring of core biomarker and digestive enzyme responses in transplanted zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha)	ECOTOXICOLOGY												A 12-month active biomonitoring study was performed in 2008-2009 on the Vesle river basin (Champagne-Ardenne, France) using the freshwater mussel Dreissena polymorpha as a sentinel species; allochthonous mussels originating from a reference site (Commercy) were exposed at four sites (Bouy, Sept-Saulx, Fismes, Ardre) within the Vesle river basin. Selected core biomarkers (acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, glutathione-S transferase (GST) activity, metallothionein concentration), along with digestive enzyme activities (amylase, endocellulase) and energy reserve concentrations (glycogen, lipids), were monitored throughout the study in exposed mussels. At the Fismes and Ardre sites (downstream basin), metallic and organic contamination levels were low but still high enough to elicit AChE and GST activity induction in exposed mussels (chemical stress); besides, chemical pollutants had no apparent deleterious effects on mussel condition. At the Bouy and Sept-Saulx sites (upstream basin), mussels obviously suffered from adverse food conditions which seriously impaired individual physiological state and survival (nutritional stress); food scarcity had however no apparent effects on core biomarker responses. Digestive enzyme activities responded to both chemical and nutritional stresses, the increase in energy outputs (general adaptation syndrome-downstream sites) or the decrease in energy inputs (food scarcity-upstream sites) leading to mid- or long-term induction of digestive carbohydrase activities in exposed mussels (energy optimizing strategy). Complex regulation patterns of these activities require nevertheless the use of a multi-marker approach to allow data interpretation. Besides, their sensitivity to natural confounding environmental factors remains to be precised.																	0963-9292					APR	2012	21	3					888	905		10.1007/s10646-012-0851-1								WOS:000302065400025	22252290

Serological evidence of Toxoplasma gondii infection in captive marine mammals in Mexico	VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY												Toxoplasma gondii infection in marine mammals is important because they are considered as a sentinel for contamination of seas with T. gondii oocysts, and toxoplasmosis causes mortality in these animals, particularly sea otters. Serological evidence of T. gondii infection was determined in 75 captive marine mammals from four facilities in southern and central geographical regions in Mexico using the modified agglutination test (MAT). Antibodies (MAT, 1:25 or higher) to T. gondii were found in 55 (87.3%) of 63 Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus truncatus), 3 of 3 Pacific bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops truncatus gillii), 2 of 4 California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), but not in 3 West Indian manatees (Trichechus manatus), and 2 Patagonian sea lions (Otariaflavescens). Sero positive marine mammals were found in all 4 (100%) facilities sampled. All marine mammals were healthy and there has not been any case of clinical toxoplasmosis in the facilities sampled for at least the last 15 years. The seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in marine mammals of the same species did not vary significantly with respect to sex and age. This is the first report on the detection of antibodies to T. gondii in marine mammals in Mexico.

Chromatin specialization in bivalve molluscs: A leap forward for the evaluation of Okadaic Acid genotoxicity in the marine environment	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY												Marine biotoxins synthesized by Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) represent one of the most important sources of contamination in marine environments as well as a serious threat to fisheries and aquaculture-based industries in coastal areas. Among these biotoxins Okadaic Acid (OA) is of critical interest as it represents the most predominant Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning biotoxin in the European coasts. Furthermore, OA is a potent tumor promoter with aneugenic and clastogenic effects on the hereditary material, most notably DNA breaks and alterations in DNA repair mechanisms. Therefore, a great effort has been devoted to the biomonitoring of OA in the marine environment during the last two decades, mainly based on physicochemical and physiological parameters using mussels as sentinel organisms. However, the molecular genotoxic effects of this biotoxin make chromatin structure a good candidate for an alternative strategy for toxicity assessment with faster and more sensitive evaluation. To date, the development of chromatin-based studies to this purpose has been hampered by the complete lack of information on chromatin of invertebrate marine organisms, especially in bivalve molluscs. Our preliminary results have revealed the presence of histone variants involved in DNA repair and chromatin specialization in mussels and clams. In this work we use this information to put forward a proposal focused on the development of chromatin-based tests for OA genotoxicity in the marine environment. The implementation of such tests in natural populations has the potential to provide an important leap in the biomonitoring of this biotoxin. The outcome of such monitoring may have critical implications for the evaluation of DNA damage in these marine organisms. They will provide as well important tools for the optimization of their harvesting and for the elaboration of additional tests designed to evaluate the safety of their consumption and potential implications for consumer's health.

Molecular profiling of marine fauna: Integration of omics with environmental assessment of the world's oceans	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Many species that contribute to the commercial and ecological richness of our marine ecosystems are harbingers of environmental change. The ability of organisms to rapidly detect and respond to changes in the surrounding environment represents the foundation for application of molecular profiling technologies towards marine sentinel species in an attempt to identify signature profiles that may reside within the transcriptome, proteome, or metabolome and that are indicative of a particular environmental exposure event. The current review highlights recent examples of the biological information obtained for marine sentinel teleosts, mammals, and invertebrates. While in its infancy, such basal information can provide a systems biology framework in the detection and evaluation of environmental chemical contaminant effects on marine fauna. Repeated evaluation across different seasons and local marine environs will lead to discrimination between signature profiles representing normal variation within the complex milieu of environmental factors that trigger biological response in a given sentinel species and permit a greater understanding of normal versus anthropogenic-associated modulation of biological pathways, which prove detrimental to marine fauna. It is anticipated that incorporation of contaminant-specific molecular signatures into current risk assessment paradigms will lead to enhanced wildlife management strategies that minimize the impacts of our industrialized society on marine ecosystems.

As a first step towards the evaluation of oxidative DNA damage (8-oxodG) in organisms exposed to chemical water pollution, we have optimized the association between the comet assay and the hOGG1 enzyme for use on zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) gill cells by in vitro exposure to H2O2. Firstly, we observed that in vitro exposure of D. polymorpha gill cells to benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P, 98.4 nM) induced an increase of the Olive Tail Moment (OTM) in both the comet-hOGG1 and comet-Fpg assays, indicating that B[a]P causes oxidative DNA damage. By contrast, methylmethane sulfonate (MMS, 33 mu M) only induced an increase of the Fpg-sensitive sites, indicating that MMS caused alkylating DNA damage and confirming that hOGG1 does not detect alkylating damage. Thus, the hOGG1 enzyme seems to be more specific towards oxidative DNA damage, such as 8-oxodG than Fpg. Secondly, as was observed in vitro, the in vivo exposure of D. polymorpha to B[a]P (24.6 and 98.4 nM) increased oxidative DNA damage in gill cells, whereas only Fpg-sensitive sites were detected in mussels exposed to MMS (240 mu M). These results show that the comet-hOGG1 assay detects oxidative DNA lesions induced in vitro by H2O2 and in vivo with BaP. The comet-hOGG1 assay will be used to detect oxidative DNA lesions (8-oxodG) in mussels exposed in situ. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Histone H2A (H2A.X and H2A.Z) Variants in Molluscs: Molecular Characterization and Potential Implications For Chromatin Dynamics	PLOS ONE												Histone variants are used by the cell to build specialized nucleosomes, replacing canonical histones and generating functionally specialized chromatin domains. Among many other processes, the specialization imparted by histone H2A (H2A.X and H2A.Z) variants to the nucleosome core particle constitutes the earliest response to DNA damage in the cell. Consequently, chromatin-based genotoxicity tests have been developed in those cases where enough information pertaining chromatin structure and dynamics is available (i.e., human and mouse). However, detailed chromatin knowledge is almost absent in most organisms, specially protostome animals. Molluscs (which represent sentinel organisms for the study of pollution) are not an exception to this lack of knowledge. In the present work we first identified the existence of functionally differentiated histone H2A.X and H2A.Z variants in the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis (MgH2A.X and MgH2A.Z), a marine organism widely used in biomonitoring programs. Our results support the functional specialization of these variants based on: a) their active expression in different tissues, as revealed by the isolation of native MgH2A.X and MgH2A.Z proteins in gonad and hepatopancreas; b) the evolutionary conservation of different residues encompassing functional relevance; and c) their ability to confer specialization to nucleosomes, as revealed by nucleosome reconstitution experiments using recombinant MgH2A.X and MgH2A.Z histones. Given the seminal role of these variants in maintaining genomic integrity and regulating gene expression, their preliminary characterization opens up new potential applications for the future development of chromatin-based genotoxicity tests in pollution biomonitoring programs.

Mussels were sampled seasonally at five sites (mariculture Lim, Pula and Rijeka harbours, industrialized site Bakar and reference site Brestova) in the period from March 2002 to October 2007. Mussels from mariculture site Lim and reference site Brestova generally displayed good health conditions. The highest level of general stress in mussels was mostly evident at sites in the inner part of Pula and Rijeka harbours and to a lesser extent at industrialized site Bakar. Temporal changes revealed improvement trends of the mussels' health status at site Lim. The evaluation of lysosomal membrane stability confirmed to be a useful tool for discrimination of stressed from non-stressed marine environments and revealed long - term trends during the assessment of marine water quality.																	0001-5113						2012	53	3		1			457	466										WOS:000318670500012

Increasing frequency and extension of jellyfish blooms in coastal waters have significant impact to economically important sectors (tourism, fishery, and aquaculture). Due to connectivity of Mediterranean sub-basins jellyfish blooms developed in one sub-basin may disperse and sustain high jellyfish abundance over whole basin. This study presents historical evidence of Aurelia medusae and periodicity of appearance in the northern Adriatic, the seasonality of polyp density and their reproduction. The study pointed to possible causes of recent bloom increases in the northern Adriatic. The wavelet analyses reveal increasing periodicity in the last decades, and from 2002 Aurelia blooms become an annual event. The Aurelia medusae from the northern Adriatic were phylogenetically identified as Aurelia sp. 8 with distribution range in Mediterranean and the Red Sea. Intertwining of several factors (habitat modifications with marine constructions allow suitable substrata for polyps, empty niches due to removal of higher predators etc.) with intrinsic characteristics of metagenetic life history can be causes of recent blooms.																	0007-9723						2012	53	3			SI		337	342										WOS:000306634500005

This review summarized the levels, trends, and bioaccumulation characteristics of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and other potential alternative BFRs including hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs), 1,2-bis(2,4,6-dibromophenoxy) ethane (BTBPE) and decabromodiphenylethane (DBDPE) in wildlife from China. PBDE levels in wildlife from China were generally higher than those from other parts in Asia, and were comparable to those from Europe but were lower than those from North America. However, wildlife from the e-waste recycling sites in South China and East China contained much higher PBDEs compared to other reports around the world, suggesting the heavy contamination of PBDEs in these regions. The alternative BFRs were also detected in wildlife, revealing that the animals are exposed to these chemicals, in addition to PBDEs. Temporal trends indicated by levels in marine mammals from South China suggested that PBDE levels increased from the beginning of 1990s to 2000s, but decreased from the middle of 2000s, followed by relatively steady levels. In contrast, HBCDs were found to be continuously increasing from 1997 to 2007, indicating the increasing usage of HBCDs in China in recent years. Compared to PBDE profiles found in other parts, aquatic species and birds from China contained relatively higher contributions of BDE-28 and 209, respectively, suggesting the possible different usage pattern of PBDEs. Future works including keeping monitoring at a reasonable scale and frequency to make sure levels near urban centers indicative of population do not increase are needed. Additionally, focus effort on e-waste recycling regions to look for impacts and to determine if regulation/controls are resulting in lower environmental contamination, and incorporation of sentinel species in monitoring efforts are recommended.					luo, xiaojun/0000-0002-2572-8108												1001-0742	1878-7320					2012	24	2					183	194		10.1016/S1001-0742(11)60758-4								WOS:000300653300001	22655375

Sponges as sentinels: Patterns of spatial and intra-individual variation in trace metal concentration	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												If sponges are to be effective biomonitors we require a better understanding of the spatial scales over which metals vary in these organisms. We determined how concentration of Cd, Zn, Cu, Pb, Hg and Se varied over four spatial scales for two common estuarine sponge species in the Sydney region. We examined variability with a fully nested sampling design; between coastal lakes, within coastal lakes, between sponges and within sponges. Calculation of variance components confirmed that 'within-sponge' variation in Cd, Zn, Cu, Pb and Se concentrations were low (1-14%) relative to the two largest spatial scales (49-98%) examined. In contrast, Hg concentrations exhibited marked variability 'between-sponges' and were below detection at one location. There was little evidence that sponge size was a good predictor of metal concentration. Taken together, these outcomes confirm that fragments of these sponges could be successfully transplanted and therefore show promise as biomonitors of metal contamination. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

With the recognized importance and wide use of stress biochemical responses as indicators of metal contamination it becomes essential to compare these markers between different species and verify their ubiquity and accuracy. Using wild Diopatra neapolitana and Cerastoderma edule, collected at several areas differing in metal contamination, this study aimed to assess the use of these two macrobenthic species as sentinel organisms and to determine the applicability of currently used biomarkers in benthic species exposed to a range of low metal and As concentrations. Total metal accumulation and intracellular partitioning was analyzed and metal-induced alterations were assessed through the analysis of several biochemical parameters in both organisms, including stress-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation and protein content, the activity of antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and of glutathione S-transferase (GST). Metal chelation by Metallothioneins (MTs) was also determined. Results revealed that D. neapolitana accumulated higher levels of metals when compared to C edule, independently of the sediment concentration. Results also showed strong species-specific responses to metals and differences in the ability to sequester metals. Overall, C. edule showed to be more efficient metal chelator and precipitatior than D. neapolitana, which was less tolerant and presented oxidative stress. MTs proved to be a good predictor of metal accumulation in both species, even under low metal exposures. On the other hand, lipid peroxidation was a good indicator of oxidative damage, only observed in D. neapolitana, which was a result of higher metal retention in the soluble fraction.

Response of different benthic indices to diverse human pressures	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The interest in benthic indicators for soft-bottom marine communities has dramatically increased after a rather long period of relative stagnation due to the need for new tools to assess the status of marine waters, called for by the Clean Water Act and the Water Framework Directive. Our expertise on benthic communities has permitted us to gather a vast amount of data from diverse water bodies under unpolluted and polluted conditions (e.g.. accidental oil spill, sewage, long-term anthropogenic estuarine constraints) in tidal estuaries, harbours, and on the coastal shelf from Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. We compared the results of four biotic indices on the various available datasets: Shannon-Wiener H' diversity, AMBI and BO2A, which divide the species into Ecological Groups, and ITI, which divides the species into trophic groups, and the agreement of Best Professional Judgement (BPJ) on the assessment of ecological conditions. Benthic indicators as "sentinel species", which is a particular species that by its presence or its relative abundance warns of possible unbalances in the surrounding environment or distortions in community functions, was also tested. Indicators. BPJ and opportunist sentinel species gave similar ECoQS for the different sampling sites. We discuss the use of Biological Indicators as 'objective' or 'subjective' alternatives for assessing soft-bottom communities, and propose to employ simple methods such as BPJ and taxonomy sufficiency in such diagnostic approaches.

Concentrations of mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls in blood of Southern Beaufort Sea polar bears (Ursus maritimus) during spring: variations with lipids and stable isotope (delta N-15, delta C-13) values	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												Polar bears (Ursus maritimus Phipps, 1774) are exposed to heavy metal and lipophilic contaminants that are known to bioaccumulate and biomagnify. Few studies concurrently report both chemical classes in the same individuals and are thus unable to assess drivers of observed tissue concentrations, and the potential adverse biological responses to combined exposures. We examined blood concentrations of mercury (Hg) and the sum of seven polychlorinated biphenyls (Sigma 7PCB) from free-ranging Southern Beaufort Sea polar bears to assess which factors contributed to variations among cohorts (adult males, adult females, young) during spring. Concentrations of Hg ranged from 10.3 to 228.0 ng/g wet mass, but mean concentrations were similar between males and females independent of age. Concentrations of Sigma 7PCB (range 2.0-132.8 ng/g wet mass) were greater among females and young than among males. Toxicant concentrations were related to packed cell delta N-15, an estimate of trophic position, after the inclusion of packed cell delta C-13. Concentrations of Sigma 7PCB were also positively correlated with concentrations of neutral lipids (triglycerides and free fatty acids) and inversely correlated to body condition indices. Elevated concentrations of toxicants and lower body condition indices in females and young compared with males may be a sentinel to a changing arctic environment. Further assessment of the potential adverse health impacts of contaminants and nutritional stress in these cohorts is warranted.																	0008-4301					NOV	2011	89	11					999	1012		10.1139/Z11-071								WOS:000297599400001

The potential use of Atlantic silverside (Menidia menidia) for monitoring estuarine pollution	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING												Monitoring chronic impacts of nearshore pollution on fish in Atlantic marine systems is challenging due to the mobility and seasonal nature of most habitat use. We evaluated Atlantic silverside (Menidia menidia) as a potential indicator of pollution across a gradient of contaminated sites in the Saint John River Estuary, New Brunswick, Canada. Fish returning from offshore in the spring showed no differences in length, weight, or condition factor between sites, but a graded response in condition factor appeared gradually, consistent with levels of contamination. Gonad size peaked in early June, however no differences in GSI were found among sites. By September, most fish collected were young of the year, with a significant bias towards female juveniles at the exposed site. These results indicate that Atlantic silverside are locally resident during their onshore period, and demonstrates their potential as a sentinel species. Sampling should focus on early June prior to the full moon to ensure maximal exposure periods before spawning, or in late October to evaluate growth as fish grow rapidly prior to offshore movement.

Testes specific accumulation of tributyltin in turbot Scophthalmus maximus from the southern Baltic Sea	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Concentrations of tributyltin (TBT) and its breakdown products, dibutyltin (DBT) and monobutyltin (MTB), were measured in tissues of male turbot Scophthalmus maximus from the Gulf of Gdansk (GDA) and the Pomeranian Bay (POM) in the southern Baltic Sea. The fish (n = 206) were collected during the spawning seasons of 2008-2009. All specimens were at the same maturity stage and in full breeding condition. The ripe testes of the turbot appeared to be a target tissue for TBT accumulation. We report that TBT is extensively eliminated at the specific whole-body level and that the males from TBT-contaminated location (GDA) reach this specific level at 23-24 cm in total length.

North Pacific albatross are wide-ranging, top-level consumers that forage in pelagic regions of the North Pacific Ocean, making them an ideal sentinel species for detection and distribution of marine contaminants. Our work on contaminant burdens in albatross tissue provides information on transport of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) to the remote North Pacific and serves as a proxy for regional environmental quality. We sampled black-footed (Phoebastria nigripes; n = 20) and Laysan albatross (P. immutabilis; n = 19) nesting on Tern Island, Hawaii, USA, and Laysan albatross (n = 16) nesting on Guadalupe Island, Mexico. Our results indicate that North Pacific albatross are highly exposed to both PCBs and OCPs, with levels ranging from 8.8 to 86.9 ng/ml wet weight and 7.4 to 162.3 ng/ml wet weight, respectively. A strong significant gradient exists between Laysan albatross breeding in the Eastern Pacific, having approximately 1.5-fold and 2.5-fold higher levels for PCBs and OCPs, respectively, compared to those from the Central Pacific. Interspecies levels of contaminants within the same breeding site also showed high variation, with Tern black-footed albatross having approximately threefold higher levels of both PCBs and OCPs than Tern Laysan albatross. Surprisingly, while PBDEs are known to travel long distances and bioaccumulate in wildlife of high trophic status, we detected these three PBDE congeners only at trace levels ranging from not detectable (ND) to 0.74 ng/ml wet weight in these albatross.

Chronic traumatic encephalopathy in an Iraqi war veteran with posttraumatic stress disorder who committed suicide	NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS												Following his discovery of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in football players in 2002, Dr. Bennet Omalu hypothesized that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in military veterans may belong to the CTE spectrum of diseases. The CTE surveillance at the Brain Injury Research Institute was therefore expanded to include deceased military veterans diagnosed with PTSD. The authors report the case of a 27-year-old United States Marine Corps (USMC) Iraqi war veteran, an amphibious assault vehicle crewman, who committed suicide by hanging after two deployments to Fallujah and Ramadi. He experienced combat and was exposed to mortar blasts and improvised explosive device blasts less than 50 m away. Following his second deployment he developed a progressive history of cognitive impairment, impaired memory, behavioral and mood disorders, and alcohol abuse. Neuropsychiatric assessment revealed a diagnosis of PTSD with hyperarousal (irritability and insomnia) and numbing. He committed suicide approximately 8 months after his honorable discharge from the USMC. His brain at autopsy appeared grossly unremarkable except for congestive brain swelling. There was no atrophy or remote focal traumatic brain injury such as contusional necrosis or hemorrhage. Histochemical and immunohistochemical brain tissue analysis revealed CTE changes comprising multifocal, neocortical, and subcortical neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic threads (ranging from none, to sparse, to frequent) with the skip phenomenon, accentuated in the depths of sulci and in the frontal cortex. The subcortical white matter showed mild rarefaction, sparse perivascular and neuropil infiltration by histiocytes, and mild fibrillary astrogliosis. Apolipoprotein E genotype was 3/4. The authors report this case as a sentinel case of CTE in an Iraqi war veteran diagnosed with PTSD to possibly stimulate new lines of thought and research in the possible pathoetiology and pathogenesis of PTSD in military veterans as part of the CTE spectrum of diseases, and as chronic sequelae and outcomes of repetitive traumatic brain injuries.

Assessment of claw growth-layer groups from ringed seals (Pusa hispida) as biomonitors of inter- and intra-annual Hg, delta N-15, and delta C-13 variation	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												The ringed seal (Pusa hispida (Schreber, 1775)) is a sentinel species of arctic marine mammals; therefore, methods to monitor its life-history changes are crucial to establish effective conservation strategies. We evaluate the potential use of claws of ringed seals as a proxy for counts of tooth growth-layer groups (age) and a biomonitor of total mercury burden (THg) and diet (stable isotope ratios expressed as delta N-15 and delta C-13). The count of claw growth-layer groups was indicative of age up to 8 years and we infer differentiation of dark and light annuli as being associated with the spring moult. No differences of THg, delta N-15, or delta C-13 were observed among flipper digits. The proximal claw annulus representing the most recent growth had delta C-13 values that were correlated to both muscle and liver delta C-13, supporting the use of claws to monitor visceral delta C-13. Claw log(10)THg from the proximate annulus was significantly correlated to liver and whisker log(10)THg, while significant interannual THg accumulation was observed in 18 of 32 seals >= 4 years, suggesting the claws receive and disperse Hg from active tissues of the body. Results support the use of claw tissue from ringed seal to provide a chronological record of inter- and intra-annual variations representing seal diet, contaminant load, and life history.																	0008-4301					SEP	2011	89	9					774	784		10.1139/Z11-047								WOS:000295992500002

Response of larval barnacle proteome to CO2-driven seawater acidification	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY D-GENOMICS & PROTEOMICS												The majority of benthic marine invertebrates have a complex life cycle, during which the pelagic larvae select a suitable substrate, attach to it, and then metamorphose into benthic adults. Anthropogenic ocean acidification (OA) is postulated to affect larval metamorphic success through an altered protein expression pattern (proteome structure) and post-translational modifications. To test this hypothesis, larvae of an economically and ecologically important barnacle species Balanus amphitrite, were cultured from nauplius to the cyprid stage in the present (control) and in the projected elevated concentrations of CO2 for the year 2100 (the OA treatment). Cyprid response to OA was analyzed at the total proteome level as well as two protein post-translational modification (phosphorylation and glycosylation) levels using a 2-DE based proteomic approach. The cyprid proteome showed OA-driven changes. Proteins that were differentially up or down regulated by OA come from three major groups, namely those related to energy-metabolism, respiration, and molecular chaperones, illustrating a potential strategy that the barnacle larvae may employ to tolerate OA stress. The differentially expressed proteins were tentatively identified as OA-responsive, effectively creating unique protein expression signatures for OA scenario of 2100. This study showed the promise of using a sentinel and non-model species to examine the impact of OA at the proteome level. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Baseline heavy metals and metalloid values in blood of loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) from Baja California Sur, Mexico	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Environmental pollution due to heavy metals is having an increased impact on marine wildlife accentuated by anthropogenic changes in the planet including overfishing, agricultural runoff and marine emerging infectious diseases. Sea turtles are considered sentinels of ecological health in marine ecosystems. The objective of this study was to determine baseline concentrations of zinc, cadmium, copper, nickel, selenium, manganese, mercury and lead in blood of 22 clinically healthy, loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta), captured for several reasons in Puerto Lopez Mateos, Baja California Sur, Mexico. Zinc was the most prevalent metal in blood (41.89 mu g g(-1)), followed by Selenium (10.92 mu g g(-1)). The mean concentration of toxic metal Cadmium was 6.12 mu g g(-1) and 1.01 mu g g(-1) respectively. Mean concentrations of metals followed this pattern: Zn > Se > Ni > Cu > Mn > Cd > Pb and Hg. We can conclude that blood is an excellent tissue to measure in relatively non-invasive way baseline values of heavy metals in Caretta caretta. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Relationship between mRNA biomarker candidates and location near a marine municipal wastewater outfall in the benthic indicator species Modiolus modiolus (L.)	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												The deep-sea horse mussel Modiolus modiolus (L.) is a sentinel bivalve species used for the assessment of potential biological exposure to anthropogenic contaminants in benthic environments. Using a combination of endpoints that included gross biological metrics, reproductive status, tissue contaminant load, and mRNA abundance profiles, we characterized variation in the local M. modiolus population situated in different spatial zones relative to a municipal wastewater outfall. Significant differences were observed in reproductive indicators, growth parameters, and abundance of four specific mRNA transcripts representative of stress response or membrane transport (CAT, NET/SCF6, ABCA4 and HSP70) in adductor muscle tissue of animals adjacent to the wastewater outfall. Concentrations of metals and organic chemicals in M. modiolus tissue were generally highest directly at the outfall site with much lower levels at 100-800 m from the outfall. This general pattern did not match the mRNA profiles. HSP70 and ABCA4 mRNA showed increased abundance in all regions adjacent to the municipal outfall compared to the reference site. One site group located within 100-200 m south/south-easterly of the outfall had increased levels of all four transcripts. Some mRNAs showed significant correlations with nickel, arsenic, lead, selenium, copper, and one of thirteen polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons measured (dibenzo(a,h)-anthracene). Three mRNAs (CAT, NET/SCF6, and ABCA4) were negatively correlated with bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate. The data suggest that these benthic organisms are exhibiting biological responses to the outfall and support an alternate interpretation regarding dispersal of contaminants. The potential effects of emerging chemicals of concern entering the receiving environment merits further assessment. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Malondialdehyde concentrations (MDA) and the activities of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase were all analyzed in the fishes' livers and gills after 2 and 7 days of exposure to different concentrations of diesel (0.1 and 0.5 mL/L). In the tilapia, MDA levels and the activities of EROD and GST activity in the liver, as well as MDA levels and the activities of GST and SOD in the gill had statistically significant differences between the treatments and between the times of exposure. For the catfish, the same occurred in the case of MDA, EROD, and SOD in the liver and in CAT and SOD in the gills. There were significant differences in the enzyme activity and lipid peroxidation between the species. Although the activity of most enzymes seemed to be more expressive and responsive to diesel in O. niloticus, diesel oil also caused significant effects on oxidative stress parameters in P. anisitsi, even though this species is benthic and thus has less access to insoluble fractions of diesel oil. Therefore, both species can be used as sentinel organisms in environmental biomonitoring of diesel contamination.

Arctica islandica: the longest lived non colonial animal known to science	REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES												The ocean quahog, Arctica islandica is not just the longest living bivalve, it is also the longest lived, non-colonial animal known to science. With the maximum life span potential ever increasing and currently standing in excess of 400 years the clam has recently gained interest as a potential model organism for ageing research. This review details what is known about the biology of A. islandica, it discusses observed age-associated changes and reviews previous ageing research undertaken on the species and other long-lived bivalves which may be applicable to future ageing research and discusses future directions for ageing research with A. islandica. Historically much of the research on bivalves has been targeted at their utilization as a food source, environmental sentinels and more recently the use of their shells as archives of environmental change. The result of this has been an abundance of knowledge on bivalve life strategies, and a limited amount of information on the physiological changes in the cells and tissues of bivalves during the ageing process. However, research into the mechanisms of senescence of long-lived bivalves from a biogerontological perspective has advanced only recently. The research undertaken thus far has documented age-related differences in anti-oxidant defences and accumulation of oxidative products but despite the recent attention into ageing of A. islandica it is still to be ascertained if the species experiences senescence. Future directions for ageing research using A. islandica are discussed.																	0960-3166	1573-5184				SEP	2011	21	3					297	310		10.1007/s11160-010-9171-9								WOS:000293398600001

The oxidative DNA damage and the co-genotoxicity of Cd in combination with B[a]P were investigated. We measured DNA damage in haemocytes and gill cells of zebra mussels exposed for 11 days to a constant concentration of Cd (10 mu g/L), B[a]P (10 mu g/L) or the two combined chemicals (10 mu g/L + 1 mu g/L). Enzymatic dissociation of gills with dispase gave the lower percentage DNA in tail, compared with collagenase/dispase or collagenase. Bioaccumulation of cadmium in the soft tissues of mussels exposed to CdCl2 or CdCl2 + B[a]P increased in a time-dependent manner indicating that both exposures were effective. Cd (10 mu g/L) is genotoxic only during the first 3 days of exposure in gill cells, while in haemocytes the genotoxicity of Cd was observed later. B[a]P (10 mu g/L) induced an early increase of DNA damage in gill cells (after 10 h and 1 day), while in both gill cells and haemocytes, B[a]P caused a marked increase of DNA damage after 3 days of exposure. The Cd + B[a]P mixture decreased the DNA-damaging effect of Cd and B[a]P in both cell types. Cd induced an increase of DNA damage in Fpg-treated slides, indicating that Cd contributed to oxidative DNA damage. Cadmium induced a cytogenetic effect in gill cells, assessed by the number of micronuclei, throughout the duration of the exposure, while B[a]P did not induce any cytogenetic effect. B[a]P, Cd and Cd + B[a]P induced a transient increase in the number of bi-nucleated cells. Our data clearly show that gills are more sensitive to Cd and B[a]P, which makes them more suitable for future bio-monitoring studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IMPOSEX AND TRIBUTYLTIN (TBT) CONCENTRATION IN STROMBUS GIGAS FROM THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS	BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE												The queen conch, Strombus gigas (Linnaeus, 1758), was collected from sites with substantial boating activity and adjacent reference sites from the British Virgin Islands in 2008-2009 to determine the incidence and severity of imposex. Comparisons were made to a previous study by Phillip (2000) in the same area to determine if there were any changes in imposex over the last decade. Imposex was present in S. gigas at all sites with boating activity, but not found in individuals collected at reference sites. Tributyltin (TBT) and its degradative product, dibutyltin (DBT), were found in S. gigas, turtle grass, Thalassia testidium (Banks ex Konig), and marine algae from sites with known point sources of TBT. We established a relationship between the highest incidence and severity of imposex and TBT concentrations in the tissues of S. gigas from sites with elevated boating activity (Road Harbour > Nanny Cay > Trellis Bay), suggesting that TBT, a known inducer of imposex in female prosobranch gastropods, is the causative agent. Strombus gigas is the second most important commercial fishery species in the Caribbean and any factors that could affect reproduction and population ecology are important in maintaining a viable population and managing a sustainable fishery. We suggest using S. gigas as a sentinel of TBT pollution despite not meeting all of the recommended criterion, such as lack of non-dispersive larvae.																	0007-4977					JUL	2011	87	3					421	435		10.5343/bms.2010.1093								WOS:000292994500009

Thermal Tolerance of Antarctic Notothenioid Fishes Correlates with Level of Circulating Hemoglobin	PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY												The West Antarctic Peninsula region is experiencing some of the most rapid elevations in temperature of any marine environment. We assessed thermal tolerance of white- and red-blooded Antarctic notothenioid fishes inhabiting these waters, using a modified critical thermal maximum (CT(max)) design. Temperature was elevated acutely from ambient at a constant rate of 3.6 degrees C h(-1), and CT(max) was defined as the temperature where animals lost righting response. CT(max) temperatures of white-blooded icefishes Chionodraco rastrospinosus (13.3 degrees +/- 0.2 degrees C) and Chaenocephalus aceratus (13.9 degrees +/- 0.4 degrees C) were significantly lower than those of red-blooded fishes Gobionotothen gibberifrons (15.5 degrees +/- 0.2 degrees C) and Notothenia coriiceps (17.1 degrees +/- 0.2 degrees C). Lepidonotothen squamifrons, a red-blooded species with low hematocrit, exhibited a CT(max) (14.2 degrees +/- 0.4 degrees C) that was significantly lower than that of the other red-blooded animals and similar to that of icefishes. A strong relationship between CT(max) and hematocrit (R(2) = 0.76) suggests that the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood may partially dictate acute lethal temperature. Despite a short treatment duration, we detected a rise in the mRNA level of hypoxia response gene HIF-1 alpha in N. coriiceps heart tissue. One-week exposure to 4 degrees C had no effect on the CT(max) of N. coriiceps, indicating an inability to compensate for rising temperature under these experimental conditions. Our results suggest that icefishes are particularly sensitive to temperature elevation because of a lack of hemoglobin and may be a sentinel taxon for climate change.																	1522-2152					JUL-AUG	2011	84	4					353	362		10.1086/660191								WOS:000292925900002	21743249

Limnological studies on Asian reservoirs have emphasized that climate and hydrology under the influences of monsoon are dominant factors regulating seasonal patterns of lake trophic status; yet, little is known of synchrony or asynchrony of trophic status in the single reservoir ecosystem. Based on monthly monitoring data of chlorophyll a, transparency, nutrients, and nonvolatile suspended solids (NVSS) during 1-year period, the present study evaluated temporal coherence to test whether local-scale regulators disturb the seasonal dynamics of trophic state indices (TSI) in a giant dendritic reservoir, China (Three Gorges Reservoir, TGR). Reservoir-wide coherences for TSI(CHL), TSI(SD), and TSI(TP) showed dramatic variations over spatial scale, indicating temporal asynchrony of trophic status. Following the concept of TSI differences, algal productivity in the mainstream of TGR and Xiangxi Bay except the upstream of the bay were always limited by nonalgal turbidity (TSI(CHL)-TSI(SD) < 0) rather than nitrogen and phosphorus (TSI(CHL)-TSI(TN) < 0 and TSI(CHL)-TSI(TP) < 0). The coherence analysis for TSI differences showed that local processes of Xiangxi Bay were the main responsible for local asynchrony of nonalgal turbidity limitation levels. Regression analysis further proved that local temporal asynchrony for TSI(SD) and nonalgal turbidity limitation levels were regulated by local dynamics of NVSS, rather than geographical distance. The implications of the present study are to emphasize that the results of trophic status obtained from a single environment (reservoir mainstream) cannot be extrapolated to other environments (tributary bay) in a way that would allow its use as a sentinel site.

J	Mellish, JAE; Hindle, AG; Horning, M				Mellish, Jo-Ann E.; Hindle, Allyson G.; Horning, Markus			Health and condition in the adult Weddell seal of McMurdo Sound, Antarctica	ZOOLOGY												Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) are large-bodied, long-lived mammals that live only in the circumpolar Antarctic. As such, they represent an ideal sentinel species for the impacts of environmental change on polar species. However, longitudinal physiological studies of marine mammals are notoriously difficult due to their largely aquatic lifestyle, such that many baseline indicators of health and condition are not well defined. Fifty known-age, adult seals (9-27 years, 24 males, 26 females) in McMurdo Sound were sampled for mass, total body fat, blubber depth and a suite of blood parameters (21 variables) to assess hydration state, nutritional plane, reproductive hormones (females only), organ function and immune status. Total body mass increased with age, whereas variation in blubber depth was best described by mass and/or sex, with an overall greater blubber thickness in female seals (p < 0.001). Ten blood parameters showed a significant effect of one or more model variables, most prominently between the sexes. Serum chemistry suggested that females were better nourished and displayed lower indicators of acute stress compared to males. We noted limited age-related declines that might indicate impaired organ function. Overall, seals demonstrated clinically normal values for large mammals, even at the upper end of the age continuum. Future physiological studies in this species are strongly encouraged to incorporate potential sex effects in experimental design and analysis. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

J	Perez, DG; Fontanetti, CS				Perez, Danielli Giuliano; Fontanetti, Carmem Silvia			Hemocitical responses to environmental stress in invertebrates: a review	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Although invertebrates are recognized by the great facility to accumulate pollutants present in their environment and many of them are used as sentinel species in biomonitoring studies, little is known about the impact of toxicants on the immune system of these animals. In this regard, hemocytes play a fundamental role: these cells circulate freely through the hemolymph of invertebrates and act on the recognition of foreign material to the organism, mediating and effecting the cellular defense, such as phagocytosis, nodulation, and encapsulation. Different morphological types can be recognized but still there is controversy among the researchers about the exact classification of the hemocytes due to the diversity of techniques for the preservation and observation of these cells. In the present study, a review on the main hemocyte responses to environmental stress in different invertebrate organisms is presented, emphasizing the contamination by heavy metals. It is discussed parameters such as: alteration in the number of cells involved in the defense reaction, phagocytic activity, lysosomal responses, and production of reactive oxygen species.

However, genomic resources for R. philippinarum are still extremely limited. Global analysis of gene expression profiles is increasingly used to evaluate the biological effects of various environmental stressors on aquatic animals under either artificial conditions or in the wild. Here, we report on the development of a transcriptomic platform for global gene expression profiling in the Manila clam. Results: A normalized cDNA library representing a mixture of adult tissues was sequenced using a ultra high-throughput sequencing technology (Roche 454). A database consisting of 32,606 unique transcripts was constructed, 9,747 (30%) of which could be annotated by similarity. An oligo-DNA microarray platform was designed and applied to profile gene expression of digestive gland and gills. Functional annotation of differentially expressed genes between different tissues was performed by enrichment analysis. Expression of Natural Antisense Transcripts (NAT) analysis was also performed and bi-directional transcription appears a common phenomenon in the R. philippinarum transcriptome. A preliminary study on clam samples collected in a highly polluted area of the Venice Lagoon demonstrated the applicability of genomic tools to environmental monitoring. Conclusions: The transcriptomic platform developed for the Manila clam confirmed the high level of reproducibility of current microarray technology. Next-generation sequencing provided a good representation of the clam transcriptome. Despite the known limitations in transcript annotation and sequence coverage for non model species, sufficient information was obtained to identify a large set of genes potentially involved in cellular response to environmental stress.

Polyparasitism Is Associated with Increased Disease Severity in Toxoplasma gondii-Infected Marine Sentinel Species	PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES												In 1995, one of the largest outbreaks of human toxoplasmosis occurred in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. Genetic typing identified a novel Toxoplasma gondii strain linked to the outbreak, in which a wide spectrum of human disease was observed. For this globally-distributed, water-borne zoonosis, strain type is one variable influencing disease, but the inability of strain type to consistently explain variations in disease severity suggests that parasite genotype alone does not determine the outcome of infection. We investigated polyparasitism (infection with multiple parasite species) as a modulator of disease severity by examining the association of concomitant infection of T. gondii and the related parasite Sarcocystis neurona with protozoal disease in wild marine mammals from the Pacific Northwest. These hosts ostensibly serve as sentinels for the detection of terrestrial parasites implicated in water-borne epidemics of humans and wildlife in this endemic region. Marine mammals (151 stranded and 10 healthy individuals) sampled over 6 years were assessed for protozoal infection using multi-locus PCR-DNA sequencing directly from host tissues. Genetic analyses uncovered a high prevalence and diversity of protozoa, with 147/161 (91%) of our sampled population infected. From 2004 to 2009, the relative frequency of S. neurona infections increased dramatically, surpassing that of T. gondii. The majority of T. gondii infections were by genotypes bearing Type I lineage alleles, though strain genotype was not associated with disease severity. Significantly, polyparasitism with S. neurona and T. gondii was common (42%) and was associated with higher mortality and more severe protozoal encephalitis. Our finding of widespread polyparasitism among marine mammals indicates pervasive contamination of waterways by zoonotic agents. Furthermore, the significant association of concomitant infection with mortality and protozoal encephalitis identifies polyparasitism as an important factor contributing to disease severity in marine mammals.																	1935-2735					MAY	2011	5	5							e1142	10.1371/journal.pntd.0001142								WOS:000291099100021	21629726					
J	Bossart, GD				Bossart, G. D.			Marine Mammals as Sentinel Species for Oceans and Human Health	VETERINARY PATHOLOGY												The long-term consequences of climate change and potential environmental degradation are likely to include aspects of disease emergence in marine plants and animals. In turn, these emerging diseases may have epizootic potential, zoonotic implications, and a complex pathogenesis involving other cofactors such as anthropogenic contaminant burden, genetics, and immunologic dysfunction. The concept of marine sentinel organisms provides one approach to evaluating aquatic ecosystem health. Such sentinels are barometers for current or potential negative impacts on individual- and population-level animal health. In turn, using marine sentinels permits better characterization and management of impacts that ultimately affect animal and human health associated with the oceans. Marine mammals are prime sentinel species because many species have long life spans, are long-term coastal residents, feed at a high trophic level, and have unique fat stores that can serve as depots for anthropogenic toxins. Marine mammals may be exposed to environmental stressors such as chemical pollutants, harmful algal biotoxins, and emerging or resurging pathogens. Since many marine mammal species share the coastal environment with humans and consume the same food, they also may serve as effective sentinels for public health problems. Finally, marine mammals are charismatic megafauna that typically stimulate an exaggerated human behavioral response and are thus more likely to be observed.																	0300-9858	1544-2217				MAY	2011	48	3					676	690		10.1177/0300985810388525								WOS:000290442300012	21160025

J	Merzouk, A; Johnson, LE				Merzouk, Anissa; Johnson, Ladd Erik			Kelp distribution in the northwest Atlantic Ocean under a changing climate	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Warming of the planet has accelerated in recent years and is predicted to continue over the next century. Environmental consequences include increasing water temperatures, and evidence of ecological responses to current warming in marine coastal ecosystems is found in poleward shifts in the geographic range of species as well as changes in the composition of nearshore benthic communities. Most evidence has, however, been obtained from intertidal studies, but similar shifts should be occurring for subtidal communities as well, especially for the ecologically important kelp species that provide both food and shelter to a multitude of organisms. Kelp may be particularly vulnerable to climate change due to their cold-water affinities and limited dispersal ability. A major biogeographic transition occurs along northwest Atlantic shores of Canada between subarctic and boreal zones where major shifts can be seen in the composition of kelp assemblages of Alaria esculenta, Laminaria digitata, Saccharina longicruris and Saccharina latissima. Here we review the historic and recent distribution and abundance of these species and find no evidence of changes in the past century. However, sparse coverage of data, inconsistent methodology and a lack of adequate time series prevent us from concluding that no changes have occurred, especially with respect to natural variation and anthropogenic alteration. These shortcomings illustrate the need for identifying sentinel species and sites for studies dedicated to the specific questions of climate-induced changes in kelp abundance and distribution. We suggest that a combination of traditional and modern tools (e.g., benthic surveys and climate model forecasting, respectively) offers the best path forward. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The characteristic development of Intersex in L. littorea has been widely applied as a biomarker for tributyltin (TBT) contamination. Here, we assess the potential of L. littorea as a novel sentinel species for evaluating the sublethal effects in wild populations of widely distributed contaminants. We collected animals from six sites across the South coast of England. Tissue concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organotin compounds (OTCs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were measured and compared with biomarkers of damage to DNA (Cornet assay), lysosomal stability (NRR assay), and endocrine disruption (Intersex development). There was a strong correlation between DNA damage and PAH bioaccumulation (n = 6, r = 0.84, p < 0.05), as well as that between Intersex development and OTC pollution (n = 6, r = 0.91, p < 0.05). The relationship between PAH bioaccumulation and DNA strand breaks was nonlinear, highlighting the need to consider the role of adaptive mechanisms in the interpretation of field results. These results illustrate the potential use of periwinkles for monitoring a wide range of priority pollutants.

Concurrent Exposure of Bottlenose Dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) to Multiple Algal Toxins in Sarasota Bay, Florida, USA	PLOS ONE												Sentinel species such as bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) can be impacted by large-scale mortality events due to exposure to marine algal toxins. In the Sarasota Bay region (Gulf of Mexico, Florida, USA), the bottlenose dolphin population is frequently exposed to harmful algal blooms (HABs) of Karenia brevis and the neurotoxic brevetoxins (PbTx; BTX) produced by this dinoflagellate. Live dolphins sampled during capture-release health assessments performed in this region tested positive for two HAB toxins; brevetoxin and domoic acid (DA). Over a ten-year study period (2000-2009) we have determined that bottlenose dolphins are exposed to brevetoxin and/or DA on a nearly annual basis (i.e., DA: 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009; brevetoxin: 2000, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2009) with 36% of all animals testing positive for brevetoxin (n = 118) and 53% positive for DA (n = 83) with several individuals (14%) testing positive for both neurotoxins in at least one tissue/fluid. To date there have been no previously published reports of DA in southwestern Florida marine mammals, however the May 2008 health assessment coincided with a Pseudo-nitzschia pseudodelicatissima bloom that was the likely source of DA observed in seawater and live dolphin samples. Concurrently, both DA and brevetoxin were observed in common prey fish. Although no Pseudo-nitzschia bloom was identified the following year, DA was identified in seawater, fish, sediment, snails, and dolphins. DA concentrations in feces were positively correlated with hematologic parameters including an increase in total white blood cell (p = 0.001) and eosinophil (p < 0.001) counts. Our findings demonstrate that dolphins within Sarasota Bay are commonly exposed to two algal toxins, and provide the impetus to further explore the potential long-term impacts on bottlenose dolphin health.

PCR-positive results have recently been reported for Haplosporidium nelsoni (MSX), a pathogen of the oyster Crassostrea virginica in 31 of 40 oysters from 6 sites in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. Histological confirmation of the PCR results was not undertaken, and no haplosporidian has been reported from the numerous histological studies and surveys of oysters in the region. To further investigate the possibility that H. nelsoni is present in this region, we sampled 210 oysters from 40 sites around the Gulf of Mexico and Puerto Rico using PCR and 180 of these using tissue-section histology also. None of the oysters showed evidence of H. nelsoni by PCR or of any haplosporidian by histology. We cannot, therefore, confirm that H. nelsoni is present and widespread in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. Our results do not prove that H. nelsoni is absent from the region, but taken together with results from previous histological surveys, they suggest that for the purposes of controlling oyster importation, the region should continue to be considered free of the parasite.																	0177-5103					FEB 22	2011	93	3					251	256		10.3354/dao02306								WOS:000287668000009	21516978					
J	Poisbleau, M; Demongin, L; Strange, IJ; Eens, M; Quillfeldt, P				Poisbleau, Maud; Demongin, Laurent; Strange, Ian J.; Eens, Marcel; Quillfeldt, Petra			Is the reduced incubation time for B-eggs in Rockhopper Penguins Eudyptes chrysocome linked to egg density variation?	JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												Crested penguins (genus Eudyptes) present a unique reversed egg-size dimorphism and hatching asynchrony, with the larger second-laid egg (B-egg) hatching before the smaller first-laid egg (A-egg). Both a higher water vapour conductance and parental favouritism during incubation could explain the shorter incubation period for the B-egg than for the A-egg. Because the incubation period is increased by the presence of a sibling for A-eggs, but not for B-eggs, and because both egg categories have the same incubation period when they are incubated alone, it has been suggested that the difference in incubation period was largely driven by the parental favouritism for B-eggs during incubation. We tested whether A- and B-eggs show a difference in laying density, density at the beginning of incubation and in density decrease during incubation according to the presence of a sibling. Although density at the start of incubation was significantly higher for B-eggs than for A-eggs, the decrease in density during incubation had the same slope for both egg categories. Moreover, the presence of a sibling did not influence densities. We additionally provide two equations that allow the back-dating of laying dates for a clutch of SouthernRockhopper Penguin (Eudyptes c. chrysocome) and we discuss the precision of the method (3.04 +/- A 2.29 days for A-eggs and 2.73 +/- A 2.10 days for B-eggs) for penguins which are increasingly being used as marine environmental sentinels.

A multidisciplinary approach to evaluate the environmental impact of offshore gas platforms in the western Adriatic Sea	CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY												Detecting the anthropogenic impacts of offshore gas platforms requires reliable tools, because the traditional evaluation based only on chemical analyses is neither appropriate nor sufficiently sensitive. Thus, a 3-year monitoring project was carried out to evaluate the impact of a platform based on a chemical-biological approach. Benthic communities are investigated as they are widely used to monitor the effects of marine impacts because the organisms are mostly sessile and integrate the effects of pollutants over time. Changes in benthic infauna, sediments and water quality, as well as biota bioaccumulation, caused by drilling and platform operations were evaluated experimentally. Furthermore, mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were collected seasonally from the platform legs, both close to and far from the sacrificial anodes and at a control site. Responses of biomarkers of exposure and effect were related to the average levels of polycyclic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, organic matter content and heavy metals in bivalve tissues. Our data suggested that a slight perturbation can be detected only by integrating the results of chemical analyses on water and sediments and those obtained from benthic biological surveys.

Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum is one of important sentinel organisms in 'Mussel Watch Program' launched in China and therefore used as a bioindicator in marine and coastal ecotoxicology. There are dominantly distributed three pedigrees of clam (White, Liangdao Red and Zebra) in Yantai population endowed with different tolerances to environmental stressors. In this study, gill tissues were collected from both untreated and mercury exposed White, Liangdao Red and Zebra clams, and the extracts were analyzed by NMR-based metabolomics to compare the original metabolomes and the toxicological effects induced by mercury exposure in three pedigrees. The major abundant metabolites in White clam sample were branched-chain amino acids, lactate, alanine, arginine, acetoacetate, glutamate, succinate, citrate, malonate and taurine, while the metabolite profile of Liangdao Red clam sample comprises relative high levels of alanine, arginine, glutamate, succinate and glycogen. For Zebra clam sample, the metabolite profile exhibited relatively high amount of aspartate, acetylcholine and homarine. After 48 h exposure of 20 mu g l(-1) Hg2+, the metabolic profiles from all the three pedigrees of clams commonly showed significant increases in alanine, arginine, glutamate, aspartate, alpha-ketoglutarate, glycine and ATP/ADP, and decreases in citrate, taurine and homarine. The unique metabolic differences between the metabolomes of gill tissues from Hg2+-exposed White, Liangdao Red and Zebra clams were found, including elevated acetylcholine and branched-chain amino acids in White clams, and the declined succinate in both White and Liangdao Red samples as well as the declined betaine in Zebra and White clams. Overall, our findings showed the differential toxicological responses to mercury exposure and that White clams could be a preferable bioindicator for the metal pollution monitoring based on the metabolic changes from gill compared with other two (Liangdao Red and Zebra) pedigrees of clams.

In the first part of the study, range and pattern of AChE activity annual variation was established by monthly investigation of two populations of mussels originating from different natural habitats. No correlation of AChE activity and environmental parameters (temperature, salinity, oxygen) was found. Seasonal monitoring along the coast at sites with presumably different level and type of contamination was also performed in order to study the spatial and temporal trend of AChE activity in mussels, in relation to possible exposure to neurotoxic compounds. Significantly lower enzyme activity in comparison to reference site was recorded at sites in the close vicinity to urban and industrial areas (P and R). In addition, AChE activity decreased at the site within the area of Lim Bay (L1). AChE reduction in the gills of mussels, recorded mostly in the polluted harbours, could be related to the presence of common environmental pollutants. The results obtained in this study will be useful as background data for future biomonitoring surveys along the Adriatic coast using M. galloprovincialis as sentinel organisms.

The catalase, glutathione S-transferase, lactate dehydrogenase, acetycholinesterase activities; and metallothionein and malonediladehyde levels in gills were evaluated. Results revealed differences among sites in relation to each specific biomarker. Hence, a suite of biomarkers can be used to discriminate sampling sites according to types of pollution, reflecting differing conditions of anthropogenic impact. Based on Integrated Biomarker Response, the highest values and critical biochemical alteration were observed at Khniss and Ksibat in response to urban and industrial discharges and the lowest IBR value was found at reference site. The current study has shown clearly that a biomarker-based index is usefulness tool in the monitoring Tunisian coast using C. maenas as sentinel specie.

J	Bolognesi, C; Hayashi, M				Bolognesi, Claudia; Hayashi, Makoto			Micronucleus assay in aquatic animals	MUTAGENESIS												Aquatic pollutants produce multiple consequences at organism, population, community and ecosystem level, affecting organ function, reproductive status, population size, species survival and thus biodiversity. Among these, carcinogenic and mutagenic compounds are the most dangerous as their effects may exert a damage beyond that of individual and may be active through several generations. The application of genotoxicity biomarkers in sentinel organisms allows for the assessment of mutagenic hazards and/or for the identification of the sources and fate of the contaminants. Micronucleus (MN) test as an index of accumulated genetic damage during the lifespan of the cells is one of the most suitable techniques to identify integrated response to the complex mixture of contaminants. MN assay is today widely applied in a large number of wild and transplanted aquatic species. The large majority of studies or programmes on the genotoxic effect of the polluted water environment have been carried out with the use of bivalves and fish. Haemocytes and gill cells are the target tissues most frequently considered for the MN determination in bivalves. The MN test was widely validated and was successfully applied in a large number of field studies using bivalves from the genera Mytilus. MN in fish can be visualised in different cell types: erythrocytes and gill, kidney, hepatic and fin cells. The use of peripheral erythrocytes is more widely used because it avoids the complex cell preparation and the killing of the animals. The MN test in fish erythrocytes was validated in laboratory with different species after exposure to a large number of genotoxic agents. The erythrocyte MN test in fish was also widely and frequently applied for genotoxicity assessment of freshwater and marine environment in situ using native or caged animals following different periods of exposure. Large interspecies differences in sensitivity for MN induction were observed.

Greenhouse gas mitigation can reduce sea-ice loss and increase polar bear persistence	NATURE												On the basis of projected losses of their essential sea-ice habitats, a United States Geological Survey research team concluded in 2007 that two-thirds of the world's polar bears (Ursus maritimus) could disappear by mid-century if business-as-usual greenhouse gas emissions continue(1-3). That projection, however, did not consider the possible benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation. A key question is whether temperature increases lead to proportional losses of sea-ice habitat, or whether sea-ice cover crosses a tipping point and irreversibly collapses when temperature reaches a critical threshold(4-6). Such a tipping point would mean future greenhouse gas mitigation would confer no conservation benefits to polar bears. Here we show, using a general circulation model(7), that substantially more sea-ice habitat would be retained if greenhouse gas rise is mitigated. We also show, with Bayesian network model outcomes, that increased habitat retention under greenhouse gas mitigation means that polar bears could persist throughout the century in greater numbers and more areas than in the business-as-usual case(3). Our general circulation model outcomes did not reveal thresholds leading to irreversible loss of ice(6); instead, a linear relationship between global mean surface air temperature and sea-ice habitat substantiated the hypothesis that sea-ice thermodynamics can overcome albedo feedbacks proposed to cause sea-ice tipping points(5,6,8). Our outcomes indicate that rapid summer ice losses in models(9) and observations(6,10) represent increased volatility of a thinning sea-ice cover, rather than tipping-point behaviour. Mitigation-driven Bayesian network outcomes show that previously predicted declines in polar bear distribution and numbers(3) are not unavoidable. Because polar bears are sentinels of the Arctic marine ecosystem(11) and trends in their sea-ice habitats foreshadow future global changes, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions to improve polar bear status would have conservation benefits throughout and beyond the Arctic(12).

ACCUMULATION OF CURRENT-USE AND ORGANOCHLORINE PESTICIDES IN CRAB EMBRYOS FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Invertebrates have long been used as resident sentinels for assessing ecosystem health and productivity. The shore crabs, Hemigrapsus oregonensis and Pachygrapsus crassipes, are abundant in estuaries and beaches throughout northern California, USA and have been used as indicators of habitat conditions in several salt marshes The overall objectives of the present study were to conduct a lab-based study to test the accumulation of current-use pesticides, validate the analytical method and to analyze field-collected crabs for a suite of 74 current-use and legacy pesticides. A-simple laboratory uptake study was designed to determine if embryos could bioconcentrate the herbicide molinate over a 7-d period. At the end of the experiment, embryos were removed nom the crabs and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Although relatively hydrophilic (log K-OW of 2.9). molinate did accumulate with an estimated bioconcentration factor (log BCF) of approximately 2 5 Following method validation, embryos were collected from two different Northern California salt marshes and analyzed. In field-collected embryos 18 current-use and eight organochlorine pesticides were detected including synthetic pyrethroids and organophosphate insecticides, as well as DDT and its degradates. Lipid-normalized concentrations of the pesticides detected in the field-collected crab embryos ranged from 0 1 to 4 ppm. Pesticide concentrations and profiles in crab embryos were site specific and could be correlated to differences in land-use practices. These preliminary results indicate that embryos are an effective sink for or game contaminants in the environment and have the potential to be good indicators of ecosystem health, especially when contaminant body burden analyses are paired with reproductive impairment assays Environ Toxicol Chem 2010;29.2593-2599 (C) 2010 SETAC					Smalling, Kelly/0000-0002-1214-4920												0730-7268	1552-8618				NOV	2010	29	11					2593	2599		10.1002/etc.317								WOS:000283639500026	20853457

Application of Solid Phase Adsorption Toxin Tracking (SPATT) for field detection of the hydrophilic phycotoxins domoic acid and saxitoxin in coastal California	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												Recent publications have identified the analysis of phycotoxins in sentinel shellfish as a problematic tool for environmental monitoring purposes. Domoic acid (DA), a neurotoxin produced by some species of the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia, can remain undetected in sentinel shellfish stocks during toxic blooms and subsequent marine bird and mammal mass mortality events. Solid Phase Adsorption Toxin Tracking (SPATT) has previously been described for monitoring of lipophilic toxins, whereas resin-based sampling methods are routinely employed for many other environmental contaminants. Here, we evaluate the applicability of SPATT for monitoring the hydrophilic phycotoxin DA and demonstrate that the same field sampling methods can be used for the detection of saxitoxins. We present laboratory-based adsorption profiles characterizing the performance of SPATT with four resin types: (1) HP20, (2) SP700, (3) SP207, and (4) SP207SS. We present results from 17 mo of approximately weekly SPATT deployments in Monterey Bay, California (USA); this period included two significant toxigenic Pseudo-nitzschia bloom events as well as low-level saxitoxin events. SPATT signaled the presence of DA 3 and 7 weeks before the recognition of bloom conditions by traditional monitoring techniques (7 and 8 weeks before shellfish toxicity). Under ambient (non-bloom) conditions, all resins detected DA when its presence was not apparent from traditional monitoring, highlighting the ubiquity of low level or transient toxin events in the environment. This study is the first to evaluate SPATT deployments in U. S. waters, and the first to demonstrate the applicability of SPATT toward detection of hydrophilic phycotoxins in the field.																	1541-5856					NOV	2010	8						645	660		10.4319/lom.2010.8.645								WOS:000288494300006

The results suggest that the humoral immune system of sledge dogs may be suppressed by the dietary blubber composition of OHCs and polyunsaturated fatty acids while a larger follow-up study is recommended in order to investigate this relationship further (C) 2010 Elsevier B V.

Validating a multi-biomarker approach with the shanny Lipophrys pholis to monitor oil spills in European marine ecosystems	CHEMOSPHERE												Oil spills are an importance source of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the aquatic environment. Intertidal communities are particularly sensitive since most organisms from these ecosystems are sessile or present reduced mobility. Hence, it is important to validate the use of resident species as sentinels to characterize the impact of oil spills on the rocky shores and the improvement during the restoration process. Recently the advantages of using the shanny Lipophrys pholis in pollution monitoring within the northwestern Atlantic coast has been pointed out. Therefore, with the aim of further validating the use of L. pholis in pollution monitoring associated with petrogenic hydrocarbon contamination, a multi-biomarker approach study was carried out 1 week after a moderate oil spill from the waste treatment plant (WTP) of the major Portuguese refinery in the north of Portugal (Petrogal). Fish collected at 2 km from the accident displayed a significant induction of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity (EROD) and fluorescent aromatic compounds (FACs) in bile (up to a 5-fold induction) in comparison with the pre-spill scenario, and a 15% induction in erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA), a biomarker of genotoxicity. In contrast, no significant differences were recorded in the reference site. In order to better characterize the time-course accumulation of FACs in bile after a PAH insult, laboratory exposure of L pholis to benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) was performed. A clear dose response accumulation of B[a]P metabolites was observed that closely reflected nominal exposure concentrations already after 3 d. Overall, the findings of the present study highlight the potential of L. pholis in pollution monitoring dealing not only with chronic contamination, but also with oil spill accidents of a moderate scale. Taking into consideration that EROD and FACs determinations in L pholis are cost effective, rapid and easy to use, they offer a great potential to be incorporated into risk assessment of PAHs in the scope of national monitoring programs and the European Water Policy legislation.

The intra-sedimentary bivalve Donax trunculus commonly found in West Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts is a sentinel species useful for biomonitoring studies in sandy beaches. The objective of this work was to link responses at the infra-individual level (core biomarkers as early and sensitive tools) to supra-individual level (population for its ecological relevance). D. trunculus. originating from a polluted site (Rades Meliane) and a comparatively reference site (Sidi Jehmi) in the Gulf of Tunis (Tunisia), were collected bimonthly from November 2008 to October 2009. An increase in catalase activities was usually observed in bivalves from the polluted site compared to the reference site whereas no differences in TBARs were depicted. The anti-oxydant enzyme (catalase) could be able to prevent the deleterious effect on the lipid membranes. Usually GST activities were decreased in the polluted site. Significantly high inhibition in AChE activities in bivalves from the polluted site suggested neurotoxicity disturbances to their in situ exposure to compounds such as organophosphate and carbamates pesticides, heavy metals. Size-distribution of populations of D. trunculus from the polluted Rades Meliane site consisted of four cohorts whereas five cohorts were depicted in the comparatively reference Sidi Jehmi site. The mean total length size and the growth rate of cohorts were significantly reduced in the impacted site compared to the reference site. In conclusion, it may be suggested that disturbances in responses to chemical stress at the infra-individual level could be linked to the responses observed at the population level.

Morbillivirus and Toxoplasma Exposure and Association with Hematological Parameters for Southern Beaufort Sea Polar Bears: Potential Response to Infectious Agents in a Sentinel Species	ECOHEALTH												Arctic temperatures are increasing in response to greenhouse gas forcing and polar bears have already responded to changing conditions. Declines in body stature and vital rates have been linked to warming-induced loss of sea-ice. As food webs change and human activities respond to a milder Arctic, exposure of polar bears and other arctic marine organisms to infectious agents may increase. Because of the polar bear's status as arctic ecosystem sentinel, polar bear health could provide an index of changing pathogen occurrence throughout the Arctic, however, exposure and monitoring protocols have yet to be established. We examine prevalence of antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii, and four morbilliviruses (canine distemper [CDV], phocine distemper [PDV], dolphin morbillivirus [DMV], porpoise morbillivirus [PMV]) including risk factors for exposure. We also examine the relationships between antibody levels and hematologic values established in the previous companion article. Antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii and morbilliviruses were found in both sample years. We found a significant inverse relationship between CDV titer and total leukocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, and eosinophils, and a significant positive relationship between eosinophils and Toxoplasma gondii antibodies. Morbilliviral prevalence varied significantly among age cohorts, with 1-2 year olds least likely to be seropositive and bears aged 5-7 most likely. Data suggest that the presence of CDV and Toxoplasma gondii antibodies is associated with polar bear hematologic values. We conclude that exposure to CDV-like antigen is not randomly distributed among age classes and suggest that differing behaviors among life history stages may drive probability of specific antibody presence.																	1612-9202					SEP	2010	7	3					321	331		10.1007/s10393-010-0323-0								WOS:000289685500006	20607348					
J	Gremillet, D; Charmantier, A				Gremillet, David; Charmantier, Anne			Shifts in phenotypic plasticity constrain the value of seabirds as ecological indicators of marine ecosystems	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Marine ecosystems are critically challenged by human activities, urgently calling for better management practices. It has been proposed that conspicuous top predators such as seabirds may be used as ecological indicators. This approach requires intimate knowledge of relationships connecting seabird parameters to other ecosystem components (i.e., population plasticity, underlined by individual reaction norms), information which remains scarce. Furthermore, if seabirds are to be used as long-term indicators, the strength of the average plastic response in a studied population has to be sustained through time and space. This second aspect has so far been startlingly neglected, although previous studies underline shifts in the plasticity of seabird traits and detail the tools allowing an evolutionary and ecological study of plasticity in bird populations. Building upon these advances, we argue that gradual or sudden spatiotemporal changes in seabird phenotypic plasticity should not be neglected when designing monitoring schemes. We conclude that seabirds are best used as qualitative sentinels, rather than as quantitative indicators.																	1051-0761					SEP	2010	20	6					1498	1503		10.1890/09-1586.1								WOS:000281278500002	20945754

Here, we document the distribution of diatoms among the diverse habitat types and long environmental gradients represented by the shallow topographic relief of the South Florida, USA, coastline. A total of 592 species were encountered from 38 freshwater, mangrove, and marine locations in the Everglades wetland and Florida Bay during two seasonal collections, with the highest diversity occurring at sites of high salinity and low water column organic carbon concentration (WTOC). Freshwater, mangrove, and estuarine assemblages were compositionally distinct, but seasonal differences were only detected in mangrove and estuarine sites where solute concentration differed greatly between wet and dry seasons. Epiphytic, planktonic, and sediment assemblages were compositionally similar, implying a high degree of mixing along the shallow, tidal, and storm-prone coast. The relationships between diatom taxa and salinity, water total phosphorus (WTP), water total nitrogen (WTN), and WTOC concentrations were determined and incorporated into weighted averaging partial least squares regression models. Salinity was the most influential variable, resulting in a highly predictive model (r(apparent)(2)=0.97, r(jackknife)(2)=0.95) that can be used in the future to infer changes in coastal freshwater delivery or sea-level rise in South Florida and compositionally similar environments. Models predicting WTN (r(apparent)(2)=0.75, r(jackknife)(2)=0.46), WTP (r(apparent)(2)=0.75, r(jackknife)(2)= 0.49), and WTOC (r(apparent)(2)=0.79, r(jackknife)(2)=0.57) were also strong, suggesting that diatoms can provide reliable inferences of changes in solute delivery to the coastal ecosystem.																	1559-2723					SEP	2010	33	5					1080	1098		10.1007/s12237-010-9283-4								WOS:000282510200004

A guide to toxicity assessment and monitoring effects at lower levels of biological organization following marine oil spills in European waters	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												The usefulness of applying biological-effects techniques (bioassays and biomarkers) as tools to assist in evaluating damage to the health of marine ecosystems produced by oil spills has been demonstrated clearly during recent decades. Guidelines are provided for the use of biological-effects techniques in oil spill pollution monitoring for the NE Atlantic coasts and the NW Mediterranean Sea. The emphasis is on fish and invertebrates and on methods at lower levels of organization (in vitro, suborganismal, and individual). Guidance is provided to researchers and environmental managers on: hazard identification of the fuel oil released; selection of appropriate bioassays and biomarkers for environmental risk assessment; selection of sentinel species; the design of spatial and temporal surveys; and the control of potential confounding factors in the sampling and interpretation of biological-effects data. It is proposed that after an oil spill incident, a monitoring programme using integrated chemical and biological techniques be initiated as soon as possible for ecological risk assessment, pollution control, and monitoring the efficacy of remediation. This can be done by developing new biomonitoring programmes or by adding appropriate biological-effects methods to the existing monitoring programmes.

Eosinophilia and biotoxin exposure in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from a coastal area impacted by repeated mortality events	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) inhabiting coastal waters in the northern Gulf of Mexico have been impacted by recurrent unusual mortality events over the past few decades. Several of these mortality events along the Florida panhandle have been tentatively attributed to poisoning from brevetoxin produced by the dinoflagellate Karenia brevis. While dolphins in other regions of the Florida coast are often exposed to K. brevis blooms, large-scale dolphin mortality events are relatively rare and the frequency and magnitude of die-offs along the Panhandle raise concern for the apparent vulnerability of dolphins in this region. We report results from dolphin health assessments conducted near St. Joseph Bay, Florida, an area impacted by 3 unusual die-offs within a 7-year time span. An eosinophilia syndrome, manifested as an elevated blood eosinophil count without obvious cause, was observed in 23% of sampled dolphins. Elevated eosinophil counts were associated with decreased T-lymphocyte proliferation and increased neutrophil phagocytosis. In addition, indication of chronic low-level exposure to another algal toxin, domoic acid produced by the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia spp., was determined. Previous studies of other marine mammal populations exposed recurrently to Pseudo-nitzschia blooms have suggested a possible link between the eosinophilia and domoic acid exposure. While the chronic eosinophilia syndrome could over the long-term produce organ damage and alter immunological status and thereby increase vulnerability to other challenges, the significance of the high prevalence of the syndrome to the observed mortality events in the St. Joseph Bay area is unclear. Nonetheless, the unusual immunological findings and concurrent evidence of domoic acid exposure in this sentinel marine species suggest a need for further investigation to elucidate potential links between chronic, low-level exposure to algal toxins and immune health.

Predicting population consequences of ocean climate change for an ecosystem sentinel, the seabird Cassin's auklet	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Forecasting the ecological effects of climate change on marine species is critical for informing greenhouse gas mitigation targets and developing marine conservation strategies that remain effective and increase species' resilience under changing climate conditions. Highly productive coastal upwelling systems are predicted to experience substantial effects from climate change, making them priorities for ecological forecasting. We used a population modeling approach to examine the consequences of ocean climate change in the California Current upwelling ecosystem on the population growth rate of the planktivorous seabird Cassin's auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus), a demographically sensitive indicator of marine climate change. We use future climate projections for sea surface temperature and upwelling intensity from a regional climate model to forecast changes in the population growth rate of the auklet population at the important Farallon Island colony in central California. Our study projected that the auklet population growth rate will experience an absolute decline of 11-45% by the end of the century, placing this population on a trajectory toward extinction. In addition, future changes in upwelling intensity and timing of peak upwelling are likely to vary across auklet foraging regions in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE), producing a mosaic of climate conditions and ecological impacts across the auklet range. Overall, the Farallon Island Cassin's auklet population has been declining during recent decades, and ocean climate change in this century under a mid-level emissions scenario is projected to accelerate this decline, leading toward population extinction. Because our study species has proven to be a sensitive indicator of oceanographic conditions in the CCE and a powerful predictor of the abundance of other important predators (i.e. salmon), the significant impacts we predicted for the Cassin's auklet provide insights into the consequences that ocean climate change may have for other plankton predators in this system.																	1354-1013					JUL	2010	16	7					1923	1935		10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02194.x								WOS:000278308100003

MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Over the last few years, the interest in using benthic indicators to assess marine environments has increased dramatically after a rather long period of relative stagnation, mostly due to the need to assess the status of coastal marine waters required by North American and European regulations. Numerous papers on this topic have been published in the domain of ecology, using a variety of different terms to refer to two categories of information: benthic species and the status of benthic communities. Nowadays, the abundant literature on these two categories makes it possible to comment on (1) the definition of the different terms used by benthic researchers, (2) the current increase of papers of rising complexity about benthic indicators, and (3) the subjectivity and objectivity involved in using benthic indicators. Faced with the increase in the number of methods, we recommend pragmatism and thus the transfer of simple methods to the research consultancies that are responsible for assessing benthic quality in numerous impact studies. Using certain procedures, such as the "sentinel species", the best professional judgement (BPJ) and taxonomic sufficiency (TS), should clearly be encouraged. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ramsdell, JS				Ramsdell, John S.			Neurological Disease Rises from Ocean to Bring Model for Human Epilepsy to Life	TOXINS												Domoic acid of macroalgal origin was used for traditional and medicinal purposes in Japan and largely forgotten until its rediscovery in diatoms that poisoned 107 people after consumption of contaminated mussels. The more severely poisoned victims had seizures and/or amnesia and four died; however, one survivor unexpectedly developed temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) a year after the event. Nearly a decade later, several thousand sea lions have stranded on California beaches with neurological symptoms. Analysis of the animals stranded over an eight year period indicated five clusters of acute neurological poisoning; however, nearly a quarter have stranded individually outside these events with clinical signs of a chronic neurological syndrome similar to TLE. These poisonings are not limited to sea lions, which serve as readily observed sentinels for other marine animals that strand during domoic acid poisoning events, including several species of dolphin and whales. Acute domoic acid poisoning is five-times more prominent in adult female sea lions as a result of the proximity of their year-round breeding grounds to major domoic acid bloom events. The chronic neurological syndrome, on the other hand, is more prevalent in young animals, with many potentially poisoned in utero. The sea lion rookeries of the Channel Islands are at the crossroads of domoic acid producing harmful algal blooms and a huge industrial discharge site for dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDTs). Studies in experimental animals suggest that chronic poisoning observed in immature sea lions may result from a spatial and temporal coincidence of DDTs and domoic acid during early life stages. Emergence of an epilepsy syndrome from the ocean brings a human epilepsy model to life and provides unexpected insights into interaction with legacy contaminants and expression of disease at different life stages.																	2072-6651					JUL	2010	2	7					1646	1675		10.3390/toxins2071646								WOS:000208435100003	22069654

Insights into shell deposition in the Antarctic bivalve Laternula elliptica: gene discovery in the mantle transcriptome using 454 pyrosequencing	BMC GENOMICS												Background: The Antarctic clam, Laternula elliptica, is an infaunal stenothermal bivalve mollusc with a circumpolar distribution. It plays a significant role in bentho-pelagic coupling and hence has been proposed as a sentinel species for climate change monitoring. Previous studies have shown that this mollusc displays a high level of plasticity with regard to shell deposition and damage repair against a background of genetic homogeneity. The Southern Ocean has amongst the lowest present-day CaCO3 saturation rate of any ocean region, and is predicted to be among the first to become undersaturated under current ocean acidification scenarios. Hence, this species presents as an ideal candidate for studies into the processes of calcium regulation and shell deposition in our changing ocean environments. Results: 454 sequencing of L. elliptica mantle tissue generated 18,290 contigs with an average size of 535 bp (ranging between 142 bp-5.591 kb). BLAST sequence similarity searching assigned putative function to 17% of the data set, with a significant proportion of these transcripts being involved in binding and potentially of a secretory nature, as defined by GO molecular function and biological process classifications. These results indicated that the mantle is a transcriptionally active tissue which is actively proliferating. All transcripts were screened against an in-house database of genes shown to be involved in extracellular matrix formation and calcium homeostasis in metazoans. Putative identifications were made for a number of classical shell deposition genes, such as tyrosinase, carbonic anhydrase and metalloprotease 1, along with novel members of the family 2 G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs). A membrane transport protein (SEC61) was also characterised and this demonstrated the utility of the clam sequence data as a resource for examining cold adapted amino acid substitutions. The sequence data contained 46,235 microsatellites and 13,084 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms(SNPs/INDELS), providing a resource for population and also gene function studies. Conclusions: This is the first 454 data from an Antarctic marine invertebrate. Sequencing of mantle tissue from this non-model species has considerably increased resources for the investigation of the processes of shell deposition and repair in molluscs in a changing environment. A number of promising candidate genes were identified for functional analyses, which will be the subject of further investigation in this species and also used in model-hopping experiments in more tractable and economically important model aquaculture species, such as Crassostrea gigas and Mytilus edulis.

Indeed, correlation between molecular and cell-organism responses need further investigations, especially under field conditions. In this study, we followed the development of physiological alterations in Mytilus galloprovincialis transplanted into a polluted coastal lagoon for 2, 4, 7, 14 and 30 days. Three consolidated biomarkers were measured, i.e. lysosomal membrane stability, lipofuscin and metallothionein contents. In parallel, the expressions of stress-related genes encoding metallothioneins (mt10 and mt20), 70-kDa heat shock proteins (MgHSC70 and MgHSP70), and Multi Xenobiotic Resistance-related transporters (MgPgp. MgMrp2, and MgMvp) were analyzed, to have a greater insight into the time-related evolution of the response. Significant (p<0.05) biomarker responses were induced after 7 days of exposure and further increased with time, whereas gene expression profiles were dramatically altered 2 days after transplanting. Biomarkers and gene expression profiles indicated a stress syndrome development in mussels, although with different temporal patterns. Their combined application provided insights into the molecular and cellular basis of mussel responses to challenging environments, and may have far-reaching implications for monitoring environmental health.

Discovery of Metabolic Signatures for Predicting Whole Organism Toxicology	TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Toxicological studies in sentinel organisms frequently use biomarkers to assess biological effect. Development of "omic" technologies has enhanced biomarker discovery at the molecular level, providing signatures unique to toxicant mode-of-action (MOA). However, these signatures often lack relevance to organismal responses, such as growth or reproduction, limiting their value for environmental monitoring. Our primary objective was to discover metabolic signatures in chemically exposed organisms that can predict physiological toxicity. Marine mussels (Mytilus edulis) were exposed for 7 days to 12 and 50 mu g/l copper and 50 and 350 mu g/l pentachlorophenol (PCP), toxicants with unique MOAs. Physiological responses comprised an established measure of organism energetic fitness, scope for growth (SFG). Metabolic fingerprints were measured in the same individuals using nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics. Metabolic signatures predictive of SFG were sought using optimal variable selection strategies and multivariate regression and then tested upon independently field-sampled mussels from rural and industrialized sites. Copper and PCP induced rational metabolic and physiological changes. Measured and predicted SFG were highly correlated for copper (r(2) = 0.55, P = 2.82 x 10(-7)) and PCP (r(2) = 0.66, P = 3.20 x 10(-6)). Predictive metabolites included methionine and arginine/phosphoarginine for copper and allantoin, valine, and methionine for PCP. When tested on field-sampled animals, metabolic signatures predicted considerably reduced fitness of mussels from the contaminated (SFG = 6.0 J/h/g) versus rural (SFG = 15.2 J/h/g) site. We report the first successful discovery of metabolic signatures in chemically exposed environmental organisms that inform on molecular MOA and that can predict physiological toxicity. This could have far-reaching implications for monitoring impacts on environmental health.

Metal concentration and structural changes in Corallina elongata (Corallinales, Rhodophyta) from hydrothermal vents	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Shallow-water hydrothermal activity is widely present at Azores archipelago. Organisms in such environments present great potential as sentinels of the effects derived from chronically exposure to increased temperature, metal concentrations and reduced pH. This study aimed to evaluate metal concentration in Corallina elongata collected at locations exposed and not exposed to shallow-water hydrothermal activity and evaluate changes in its calcareous structure. Elemental concentration was determined and morphometric analysis was performed by scanning electron microscopy. Thicker cell walls and a bleached appearance were observed on C. elongata specimens from the hydrothermally active location, as well as increased concentrations of elements associated to volcanic activity. This study reports on metal accumulation and morphometric changes in the calcareous structure of C. elongata from a hydrothermally active location, adding new data for further research on such habitats and communities, providing an insight on how coralline algae might be affected by ocean acidification.

Identification of novel and zoonotic Cryptosporidium species in marine fish	VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY												Little is known about the prevalence and genotypes of Cryptosporidium in fish. The present study investigated the prevalence of Cryptosporidium species in cultured fingerlings (n = 227), wild freshwater (n = 227) and wild marine/estuarine species (n = 255) of fish in Western Australia by PCR amplification at the 18S rRNA locus. Results revealed a low prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection in fish hosts: 0.8% (6/709). Four species of Cryptosporidium were identified including C parvum, C. xiaoi and pig genotype II in whiting (Sillago vittata) and a novel Cryptosporidium spp. in mullets (Mugil cephalus). The identification of zoonotic species of Cryptosporidium in fish indicates that future research to gain a better understanding of the public health impacts is warranted. The detection of the protozoa in fish may also be a good sentinel for environmental contamination or ecosystem health. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Species Composition and Relative Abundance of Large Medusae in Puget Sound, Washington	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												We assessed species composition and relative biomass densities of large medusae (bell diameters larger than 4 cm) at four locations in Puget Sound, Washington, over two sampling periods (June and September). We specifically sampled sites in southern Hood Canal (near Hoodsport), northern Hood Canal (Hazel Point), southern Admiralty Inlet (Useless Bay) and Possession Sound using a bottom trawl as part of a larger survey of demersal fish and invertebrate community structure. In total, four species were observed during June sampling: three schyphomedusae (Phacellophora camtschatica, Cyanea capillata, Aurelia labiata) and one hydromedusa (Aequorea victoria). The highest jellyfish densities in June were observed off Hoodsport where Aurelia labiata and Cyanea capillata dominated the assemblage. In the remaining locations, Cyanea capillata dominated catches. In September, relative biomass densities were lower throughout the area surveyed and species composition simplified with usually one species of jellyfish clearly dominating each location. Our results indicate that jellyfish biomass changed markedly within and among locations, which has implications for modeling energy flows in Puget Sound and developing monitoring schemes that are able to capture interannual variability in jellyfish biomass. Given the abundance of jellyfish in our survey and their potential as sentinels of change in the marine environment we recommend that jellyfish populations be routinely monitored in Puget Sound.																	0029-344X					SPR	2010	84	2					131	140		10.3955/046.084.0202								WOS:000278261800002

Pleuritis and suppurative pneumonia associated with a hypermucoviscosity phenotype of Klebsiella pneumoniae in California sea lions (Zalophus californianus)	VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY												The aim of this study is to document the isolation of a hypermucoviscosity (HMV) phenotype of Klebsiella pneumoniae from 25 cases of suppurative pneumonia and pleuritis and two cases of abscesses in California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) from the central California coast, representing the first report of this zoonotic pathogen from the marine environment and only the second report in non-humans. Animals died 2 h to 4 days after first being observed sick on beaches. Clinical signs varied from dyspnoea to coma. Gross post-mortem examination of 25 cases revealed fibrinous pleuritis, copious pus in the pleural cavity and suppurative bronchopneumonia. K. pneumoniae isolates obtained from lung and pleural swabs and the hepatic and subcuticular abscesses were highly mucoid on blood agar culture media and were positive to the "string test". Twenty-one of the 27 isolates were examined by PCR and all were positive for rmpA and K2wyz and negative for K1magA genes. Although pneumonia and pleuritis have previously commonly been observed in marine mammals, their association with pure cultures of a zoonotic bacteria, K. pneumoniae HMV phenotype, has not. This report provides further evidence of the role marine mammals play as sentinels of health risks to humans from coastal waters. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Muscular cholinesterase activities and lipid peroxidation levels as biomarkers in several Mediterranean marine fish species and their relationship with ecological variables	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL												Muscular cholinesterase activities, as potential markers of neurotoxic exposure, and lipid peroxidation levels, indicative of oxidative stress damage, both currently used in early-warning pollution monitoring, were characterised in eighteen fish species of ecologic and/or economic importance. These species comprise five orders and eleven families of teleosts and two species of elasmobranchs, feed using different strategies (benthic, epilhenthic, endobenthic and pelagic), belong to different trophic levels and express different swimming behaviour. Their habitat ranges from 50 to 60 m (shallow or continental shelf) and 600 to 850 m (middle continental slope). Sampling took place in front of the Barcelona coast (NW Mediterranean) during four seasonal cruises in 2007. In the summer sampling, another site potentially exposed to a different pollution load (Vilanova) was included for comparison. Species, seasonal and site differences were tested and discussed in relation to chemical analysis of the local sediment, systematic position, habitat depth. feeding strategy, trophic level and swimming activity. Greater inter species differences rather than seasonal or site trends were seen in accordance to little pollution fluctuations. Higher cholinesterase activities were recorded in suprabenthos feeders, regardless of depth habitat, whereas LP levels were similar in all species except for the shark Scyliorhinus canicula in which they were consistently elevated. This study confirms and broadens former observations carried out with a more reduced number of fish species (Sold et al., 2008a). (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Among the compounds analyzed, concentrations of DDTs and PCBs (up to 23,000 and 12,400 ng/g lipid wt, respectively) were the highest. The present study is the foremost to report the occurrence of brominated flame retardants such as PBDEs and HBCDs in deep-sea organisms from the North Pacific region. Significant positive correlations found between delta N-15 (parts per thousand) and PCBs, DDTs and PBDEs suggest the high biomagnification potential of these contaminants in food web. The large variation in delta C-13 (parts per thousand) values observed between the species indicate multiple sources of carbon in the food web and specific accumulation of hydrophobic organohalogen compounds in benthic dwelling carnivore species like snubnosed eel. The results obtained in this study highlight the usefulness of deep-sea fishes as sentinel species to monitor the deep-sea environment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Gene expression analyses of hepatocellular adenoma and hepatocellular carcinoma from the marine flatfish Limanda limanda	DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS												At selected sites around the UK, the offshore sentinel flatfish species dab Limanda limanda are found to contain elevated levels of macroscopic liver tumors. Previous proteomic and metabolomic studies have demonstrated that differences exist between tumor and non-tumor tissues; however, these differing features were not identified, and little is known about the changes at the gene expression level, or whether prognostic markers are present and can be identified. A flounder Platichthys flesus custom cDNA microarray and RT-PCR were used to investigate hepatic mRNA expression in the histologically confirmed tumors, hepatocellular adenoma (HA) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HC) from dab, and in adjacent normal tissue from the same fish. Differences in gene expression were observed between tumor and normal tissues, and between tumor types, A class-prediction approach using 50 transcripts revealed sufficient group-specific expression profiles to allow segregation of samples dependent on their tumor type or the sex of the host. Vitellogenins were found to display the greatest induction (up to 500-fold induction) in some HC tumors from female fish and in both HA and HC tumors from males. To the best Of Our knowledge, this is the first report of the association of vitellogenin expression with tumors of wild fish.

Effect of age on liver pathology and other diseases in flatfish: implications for assessment of marine ecological health status	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Age at disease onset, a familiar concept in human medicine, has not been commonly discussed in relation to diseases of wildlife. Furthermore, while age has been anecdotally linked with disease susceptibility in aquatic animals (e. g. in aquaculture), little attention has been devoted to health of specific cohorts in wild aquatic animal populations. In an attempt to refine current approaches to marine environmental monitoring programmes that utilise fish diseases as a sentinel for ecological status, we have investigated age at onset for 10 disease variables in the flatfish Limanda limanda, a commonly utilised species in such programmes in Europe. By comparing the prevalence of these variables (including several associated with liver neoplasia) in different age classes from the same sites, we have demonstrated an increased propensity for 'harm' (a cumulative measure of multiple disease variables) with age. Furthermore, a comparison of age-matched cohorts from geographically distinct offshore marine sites revealed that this tendency for increased harm differs in magnitude between sites. In these scenarios, the age at onset for key disease variables (such as pre-neoplastic and neoplastic pathologies of the liver) also differs between sites, with some locations containing populations with apparently increased susceptibility in younger age classes. We conclude that while age is an important variable when assessing fish population health status, it does not explain all of the differences in disease prevalence observed in natural populations, and further, that age-matched cohorts from certain populations have a higher propensity for disease than fish of the same age from other sites. The basis for these differences in susceptibility is discussed in relation to the prevailing burden of anthropogenic contaminants and to other natural factors (such as population genetics and migration) inherent in sampled populations.

Upper layer current variability in the Central Ligurian Sea	OCEAN SCIENCE												Long-time series of surface currents and meteorological parameters were analysed to estimate the variability of the upper layer circulation and the response to the local winds. Current meter data were collected by an upward-looking RDI Sentinel 300 kHz ADCP deployed in the Central Ligurian Sea (43 degrees 47.77`N; 9 degrees 02.85`E) near the meteo-oceanographic buoy ODAS Italia 1 for more than eight months, from 13th of September 2003 to 24th of May 2004. The ADCP sampled the upper 50 m of water column at 8 m vertical resolution and 1 h time interval; surface marine and atmospheric hourly averaged data were provided by the buoy. Currents in the sampled layer were mainly barotropic, directed North-West in accordance with the general circulation of the area, and had a mean velocity of about 18 cm/s and hourly mean peaks up to 80 cm/s. Most of the observed variability in the upper thermocline was determined by inertial currents and mesoscale activity due to the presence of the Ligurian Front. Local wind had a minor role in the near-surface circulation but induced internal waves propagating downward in the water column.

Three collections of water and fish were made in the main rice ditch, and one collection for the control group was taken in the Ararangua River. The toxicity test with D. magna and the comet assay followed protocols previously described. The toxicity factor for the control group and collections 1, 2, and 3 were, respectively, 0, 1, 0, and 2. The comet assay demonstrated significant differences just in collection 2, in comparison to the control group and collections 1 and 3. These results, despite significant statistical data, are not a biological problem, because the values were not so large but serve to warn of a possible disruption of the balance in this environment system.

J	Smolarz, K; Berger, A				Smolarz, Katarzyna; Berger, Agata			Long-term toxicity of hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) to the benthic clam Macoma balthica (L.) from the Baltic Sea	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												The world's largest brackish water sea area, the Baltic Sea, is considered to be one of the most polluted seas of the world. Many new pollutants are constantly entering the environment, such as brominated flame-retardants (BFRs). BFRs; represent a group of compounds that structurally resemble hydrophobic organic contaminants, but only scarce data about their toxicity to marine organism exist. Thus, the purpose of this study was to analyze long-term in vivo cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of hexabromocyclodododecane (HBCDD) to exposed marine invertebrates using a suite of cytogenetic biomarkers. This included a set of nuclear and nucleolar characteristics and the micronucleus test. The use of those parameters reflects different mechanisms of nuclear activity regulation in cells (as a parameter of cytotoxicity) and measures subcellular processes. The induction of nuclear abnormalities (like the formation of micronuclei) was also employed here as a parameter of genotoxicity. In order to reflect the proliferative and metabolic activity of the cells the number of argylophillic nucleolar organiser regions (NORs) in interphase cells was scored. Over a period of 50 days an in vivo exposure experiment with a clam Macoma balthica and different concentrations of HBCDD (nominal concentrations of 0, 100 and 250 mu g/l) with three replicates each was performed. Gill cells were used as "sentinel systems" considering specificity in metabolism, repair mechanisms, adaptative response and cell proliferation. A significant increase in nuclear and nucleolar abnormalities and in the frequency of dead cells was observed during the duration of the experiment with the highest peak occurring 10 days after exposure for nuclear abnormalities and 20-30 days after exposure for malfunction of ribosomal genes (NORs) (GLM analyses and Spearman correlation, p < 0.05). Thus, the induction of micronuclei and other nuclear abnormalities reflected the toxic potential of HBCDD to marine invertebrates while an increase in the number of NOR may also reflect adaptive responses of the system as enhanced induction of proliferative regeneration of the gill tissue.

Alpine lake optical properties as sentinels of dust deposition and global change	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We characterized dissolved organic matter in La Caldera, an alpine lake in Sierra Nevada (Spain), and water-soluble organic compounds (WSOC) in dry and wet deposition originating from Saharan and marine air masses using ultraviolet-visible absorbance and three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy. Molar absorption coefficients at 250 and 280 nm in the lake were highly correlated with those in organic aerosol deposition, originating mainly from Saharan dust, and suggest that absorption in clear alpine lakes in unvegetated catchments may represent a unique sentinel of desertification and global change. Using parallel factor analysis modeling to resolve dominant fluorescent components, we identified a semiquinone-like fluorophore (C9) in the WSOC of deposition that was traced into the lake. At least three fluorescent components, including C9, contributed significantly to absorption of WSOC from atmospheric deposition. Saharan dust supplied chromophoric, aromatic, and fluorescent organic matter to this alpine lake. In contrast, marine organic aerosols had lower absorption coefficients, lower fluorescence intensity, and more microbial fluorescence properties.

Melanomacrophages in three species of free-ranging sharks from the northwestern Atlantic, the blue shark Prionacae glauca (L.), the shortfin mako, Isurus oxyrhinchus Rafinesque, and the thresher, Alopias vulpinus (Bonnaterre)	JOURNAL OF FISH DISEASES												The melanomacrophage aggregates or cells (MMC) are commonly used as biomarkers of exposure to pollution in fish, albeit their numbers and morphological characteristics can be influenced not only by environmental toxins but also by a range of physiological parameters and pathological conditions. Accordingly, before we can use MMC as biomarkers in any fish species, their normal, 'background' characteristics have to be established in apparently healthy fish. The knowledge of MMC in sharks is minimal. The aim of this study was to characterize MMC from 51 free-ranging, large pelagic sharks from the northwestern Atlantic, including shortfin mako, Isurus oxyrhinchus, thresher, Alopias vulpinus and blue shark, Prionacae glauca. The rationale of this study was twofold. First, because, sharks have life histories predisposing them to the accumulation of environmental toxins they constitute good sentinel species of the health of the global marine ecosystem. Second, because many shark populations are in decline or threatened by extinction, we need to expand our understanding of their health status in order to develop appropriate protective measures. All sharks were collected by sports fishing gear between June and August in 2007. Their health condition was assessed by necropsy, morphometrics, and by microscopic examination of gonads, livers, spleens and kidneys. Routine, haematoxylin and eosin and/or Pearl's reagent-stained paraffin embedded sections were studied by light microscopy. Our results provide the first data on the morphometric and morphological characteristics of MMC in viscera of apparently healthy free-ranging sharks from the northwestern Atlantic.																	0140-7775					OCT	2009	32	10					883	891		10.1111/j.1365-2761.2009.01067.x								WOS:000269977900008	19602092					
J	Galimany, E; Ramon, M; Delgado, M				Galimany, Eve; Ramon, Montserrat; Delgado, Maximino			First evidence of fiberglass ingestion by a marine invertebrate (Mytilus galloprovincialis L.) in a NW Mediterranean estuary	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Alfacs Bay is a N.W. Mediterranean estuary important for mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) aquaculture. During studies at the site, fiberglass particles were detected. The presence of fiberglass occurred naturally in the water throughout the study period (November 2006 to July 2007). An investigation was undertaken into its role in the feeding behavior of the local mussels. Fiberglass was present in all types of mussel samples. Rejection, which we would have expected for the whole study period, was only evident during the second season studied. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the ingestion of fiberglass by a marine organism. Our novel finding indicates the need to investigate fiberglass ingestion by marine organisms at different levels of the food web and the possible implications for human health and the health of the organisms themselves. In addition, we propose the use of mussels as sentinel organisms to monitor fiberglass contamination in marine ecosystems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mussels are worldwide studied as sentinels of pollution in marine environments while mullets such as the thicklip grey mullet Chelon labrosus have been proposed as appropriate sentinel species since they inhabit highly polluted environments. In order to study genes of the inducible peroxisomal beta-oxidation pathway in mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis and in C labrosus, genes coding for the three enzymes in the inducible peroxisomal P-oxidation pathway, palmitoyl-CoA oxidase (AOX1), multifunctional protein (MFP1 in mullet and MFP2 in mussels), and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (THIO), were cloned. Additionally, a fragment of the peroxisomal Delta(2), Delta(4) dienoyl-CoA reductase 2 (DECR) necessary for the beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids was cloned in mullets. The whole open reading frame of aox1 sequenced in both mussels and mullets revealed high homology with known aox1 sequences, with highly conserved important domains such as the FAD binding motif or the typical peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1). A thorough in silico analysis of the gene and genome databases allowed to identify in fish and molluscs sequence homologs of all the enzymes necessary for 2 of the 3 different paralog peroxisomal beta-oxidation pathways described in metazoans (AOX1, AOX3, MFP1. MFP2, THIO and sterol carrier protein X). Only the enzyme necessary for the oxidation of branched chain fatty acids, AOX2, described in mammalian, avian and amphibian species, seems to be lacking from the genomes of fish and molluscs. In order to study the expression and regulation capacity of peroxisomal beta-oxidation genes, aox1 and thio expression was determined in different tissues of mature and immature mullets and mussels collected in January and June, both genes being expressed higher in the digestive gland of mussels collected in June compared to January. Finally, in silico studies of the promoter regions in the piscine genomes available in the Ensembl genome repository, allowed the identification of putative peroxisome proliferator response elements that could explain the possible cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to peroxisome proliferation in fish. Further studies are needed to decipher molecular mechanisms of peroxisome proliferation in aquatic organisms under exposure to peroxisome proliferator xenobiotics. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence is growing that contaminants may be partly responsible for the observed increase of disease in marine organisms by adversely affecting their immunity. Fish are commonly used as sentinel organisms in vertebrate immunotoxicology; however, to date, studies have been undertaken only on a single size group of fish (juvenile/adult) and for acute exposure. In the present study, Lateolabrax japonicus fingerlings and juveniles were exposed to two sublethal concentrations (200 and 2,000 ng/L) of 17 beta-estradiol (E-2) for 30 d under laboratory conditions, and alterations in immune parameters comprising differential leukocyte count, respiratory burst, myeloperoxidase, immunoglobulin levels, serum lysozyme, and bactericidal activity were investigated to establish whether estrogen produced immunomodulation and to understand the effects of long-term exposure on these immune parameters in fish fingerlings and juveniles. The results revealed a significant elevation of respiratory burst activity, myeloperoxidase, immunoglobulin levels, and differential leukocyte counts of the fish exposed to estrogen compared to the control. The remaining parameters were significantly reduced in the experimental groups when compared to the control. The results indicated that sublethal E 2 exposure induced immunomodulation in both fingerling and juvenile L. japonicus, and the changes caused by estrogen might affect the function of immune system in fish.

J	Bonacci, S; Corsi, I; Focardi, S				Bonacci, Stefano; Corsi, Ilaria; Focardi, Silvano			Cholinesterases in the Antarctic scallop Adamussium colbecki: Characterization and sensitivity to pollutants	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Antarctica is affected by man-made contamination and development of sensitive ecotoxicological tools for impact assessment is a priority task. The aims of the present study were to characterize cholinesterase (ChE) activities in an Antarctic key species, the scallop Adamussium colbecki, and to investigate their sensitivity as biological markers (biomarkers) of exposure to pollutants and of their effects. Our results show that ChEs in gills share most characteristics with true acetylcholinesterase. The present results show that ChE activities in A. colbecki are significantly inhibited by organophosphates (OPs) and somehow affected by in vitro exposure to mixtures of marine contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), even if no concentration-dependent pattern of response was observed and no effect was elicited by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The present results do not demonstrate ChEs in A. colbecki as sensitive tools to measure exposure to the above chemicals, but they may be worthy of further study considering the importance of the scallop in Antarctic marine ecosystems and its suitability as a sentinel species.

Gene expression profiling in the deep water horse mussel Modiolus modiolus (L.) located near a marine municipal wastewater outfall	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												The marine bivalve Modiolus modiolus (L.) is a sentinel species used for the assessment of potential biological exposure to anthropogenic contaminants in benthic environments. Herein, we have developed real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays for 12 specific mRNAs. The levels of each mRNA transcript were evaluated in adductor muscle, gonad, and hepatopancreas tissue collected from animals located at a reference site and a site near a preliminary municipal wastewater treatment outfall. Significant differences in mRNA abundance in animals located at the wastewater outfall site were observed for CAT and NET/SCF6 in all three tissues examined, ABCA4 and HSP70 transcript abundance were increased in the adductor muscle and hepatopancreas, respectively. Transcript levels for MDR, CYP4, rpS4, rpS9, and Ca(2+)-ATPase were not different between sites in the three tissues examined. This study sets the foundation for further evaluation of these transcripts' utility in the evaluation of effluent effects within the marine environment. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Oryzias melastigma, also called O. dancena, a marine medaka that showed sensitive response to hypoxia and estrogenic endocrine disruptors in Previous studies, is becoming a sentinel species for marine ecotoxicology studies. However, the lack of strong molecular foundation and knowledge of early developmental stages hampers its practical applications. Combining our research strength on zebrafish embryos, this study revealed both morphological and molecular (at mRNA and protein levels) development of embryos of this emergent model. Whole mount immunostaining technique specific for O. melastigma was Successfully developed based on zebrafish standard protocols. We demonstrated that 17 Out of 61 primary antibodies, which were previously tested in zebrafish, showed specific immunoreactivity with O. melastigma. These antibodies clearly illustrated the embryonic development of target tissues (principally neurons) in this medaka. Additionally, partial cDNA fragments of 11 organ-specific market genes were isolated according to genomic resources of zebrafish, Japanese medaka and other fishes. of the 11 genes, 8 are widely used as organ markers and their expression patterns were remarkably Similar to their homologues in zebrafish and Japanese medaka. The expression profiles of the remaining 3 genes in fish are reported for the first time. These molecular markers (17 antibodies and 11 mRNA probes) can be used as responsive indicators in environmental toxicity evaluation. Moreover, this Study brought forward and demonstrated the advantage of transferring techniques and resources front one model to another to hasten the research of interest. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Presently, in laboratory and field studies, both responses were measured separately (in terms of lysosomal volume density - Vv - and labilisation period -LP) and combined (lysosomal response index - LRI) in order to contribute to their understanding and to develop an index useful for decisions makers. LRI integrates Vv and LP, which are not necessarily dependent lysosomal responses. It is unbiased and more sensitive than Vv and LP alone and diminishes background due to confounding factors. LRI provides a simple numerical index (consensus reference = 0; critical threshold = 1) directly related to the pollution impact degree. Moreover, LRI can be represented in a way that allows the interpretation of lysosomal responses, which is useful for environmental scientists. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Green Evolution and Dynamic Adaptations Revealed by Genomes of the Marine Picoeukaryotes Micromonas	SCIENCE												Picoeukaryotes are a taxonomically diverse group of organisms less than 2 micrometers in diameter. Photosynthetic marine picoeukaryotes in the genus Micromonas thrive in ecosystems ranging from tropical to polar and could serve as sentinel organisms for biogeochemical fluxes of modern oceans during climate change. These broadly distributed primary producers belong to an anciently diverged sister clade to land plants. Although Micromonas isolates have high 18S ribosomal RNA gene identity, we found that genomes from two isolates shared only 90% of their predicted genes. Their independent evolutionary paths were emphasized by distinct riboswitch arrangements as well as the discovery of intronic repeat elements in one isolate, and in metagenomic data, but not in other genomes. Divergence appears to have been facilitated by selection and acquisition processes that actively shape the repertoire of genes that are mutually exclusive between the two isolates differently than the core genes. Analyses of the Micromonas genomes offer valuable insights into ecological differentiation and the dynamic nature of early plant evolution.

Medaka (Oryzias latipes) as a sentinel species for aquatic animals: Medaka cells exhibit a similar genotoxic response as North Atlantic right whale cells	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY					4th Conference on Aquatic Animal Models of Human Disease	JAN 31-FEB 03, 2008	Duke Univ, Durham, NC	Nicholas Sch Environm	Duke Univ			Hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) is emerging as a major concern for aquatic environments, particularly marine environments. Medaka (Oryzias latipes) has been used as a model species for human and aquatic health, including the marine environment, though few studies have directly compared toxicological responses in medaka to humans or other aquatic species. We used a medaka fin cell line to compare the genotoxic response of medaka to Cr(VI) to the response observed in North Atlantic right whale cells to see if responses in medaka were similar to those of other aquatic species, particularly aquatic mammals. We used the production of chromosomal aberrations as a measure of genotoxicity. We found that in medaka cells, concentrations of 1, 5 and 10 mu M sodium chromate damaged 17, 32 and 43% of metaphases, respectively and these same concentrations 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 mu M sodium chromate damaged 14, 24 and 49% of metaphases, respectively, in North Atlantic right whale lung cells and 11, 32 and 41 % of metaphases, respectively, in North Atlantic right whale testes cells. These data show that genotoxic responses in medaka are comparable to those seen in North Atlantic right whale cells, consistent with the hypothesis that medaka are a useful model for other aquatic species.

Swabs (n = 909) were collected from the blowhole, gastric fluid, and feces of 171 individual dolphins The most frequently cultured organisms were Plesiomonas shigelloides (n = 161), Aeromonas hydrophila (n = 144), Escherichia coli (n = 85), and Pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 82). In descending frequency, organisms demonstrated resistance to erythromycin, ampicillin, and cephalothin. Human and animal pathogens resistant to antibiotics used in human and veterinary medicine were cultured. Escherichia coli (E. coli) more often was resistant in IRL dolphins. Three cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were found at CHS. Emergence of antibiotic resistance is not confined to humans. Bottlenose dolphins may serve as sentinels for transfer of resistance from humans and animals or indicate that antibiotics are reaching the marine environment and causing resistance to emerge through selective pressure and genetic adaptation.																	1612-9202					MAR	2009	6	1					33	41		10.1007/s10393-009-0221-5								WOS:000270837100007	19415386

Following the fish: penguins and productivity in the South Atlantic	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												We tested four predictions for central-place foragers provisioning offspring along a gradient in primary production spanning 1000 km of coastline in Argentina, using male Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus). Three of the predictions were supported. (1) Foraging trip distances corresponded with the production gradient; penguins swam shorter distances (mean maximum distance: 60-110 km) at the southern colonies where production is higher and prey species aggregate nearshore, and longer distances (143-242 km) at the northern colonies where production is lower and prey species aggregate at offshore fronts. Within these broad regions, foraging locations coincided with tidal mixing fronts or high chlorophyll concentrations. (2) Foraging trips followed a pattern of intermediate speed and meandering when outbound (32% of locations at sea), slow meandering movements within the foraging areas (45%), and very fast and direct returns to the colony (23%). Regardless of how far they went, penguins spent the most time at the outer limits of their trips, and travel speed slowed there, consistent with foraging. In 54% of trips, penguins left foraging patches between 15:00 and 21:00 hours, presumably with full loads for chicks. Returning penguins swam up to 173 km/d (2 m/s), swimming day and night and arriving at all hours to feed chicks. (3) Penguins stayed longer in more distant than closer foraging areas, presumably to feed themselves to recover the increased cost of swimming. One prediction was not supported. (4) Following a long trip, penguins did not meander more on their next outbound trip. Most penguins returned repeatedly to the same area to forage or alternated between two areas. Overall, penguin foraging patterns reflected patterns of oceanographic production, making them important sentinels of environmental variation.																	0012-9615	1557-7015				FEB	2009	79	1					59	76		10.1890/06-0419.1								WOS:000263566600004

Turbot and other flatfish are used to characterize the presence of chemicals in the marine environment. Unfortunately, there are relatively few genes of turbot and other flatfish in GenBank, which limits the use of molecular tools such as microarrays and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to study disruption of endocrine responses in sentinel fish captured by regulatory agencies. OBJECTIVES: We fabricated a multigene cross-species microarray as a diagnostic tool to screen the effects of environmental chemicals in fish, for which there is minimal genomic information. The array included genes that are involved in the actions of adrenal and sex steroids, thyroid hormone, and xenobiotic responses. This microarray will provide a sensitive tool for screening for the presence of chemicals with adverse effects on endocrine responses in coastal fish species. METHODS: We used a custom multispecies microarray to study gene expression in wild hornyhead turbot (Pleuronichthys verticalis) collected from polluted and clean coastal waters and in laboratory male zebrafish (Danio rerio) after exposure to estradiol and 4-nonylphenol. We measured gene-specific expression in turbot liver by qRT-PCR and correlated it to microarray data. RESULTS: Microarray and qRT-PCR analyses of livers from turbot collected from polluted areas revealed altered gene expression profiles compared with those from nonaffected areas. CONCLUSIONS: The agreement between the array data and qRT-PCR analyses validates this multispecies microarray. The microarray measurement of gene expression in zebrafish, which are phylogenetically distant from turbot, indicates that this multispecies microarray will be useful for measuring endocrine responses in other fish.

Presence of Alexandrium catenella and paralytic shellfish toxins in finfish, shellfish and rock crabs in Monterey Bay, California, USA	MARINE BIOLOGY												The central California coast is a highly productive, biodiverse region that is frequently affected by the toxin-producing dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella. Despite the consistent presence of A. catenella along our coast, very little is known about the movement of its toxins through local marine food webs. In the present study, we investigated 13 species of commercial finfish and rock crabs harvested in Monterey Bay, California for the presence of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) and compared them to the presence of A. catenella and PSTs in sentinel shellfish over a 3-year period. Between 2003 and 2005, A. catenella was noted in 55% of surface water samples (n = 307) and reached a maximum concentration of 17,387 cells L(-1) at our nearshore site in Monterey Bay. Peak cell densities occurred in the month of July and were associated with elevated shellfish toxicity in the summers of 2004 and 2005. When A. catenella was present, particulate PSTs were detected 71% of the time and reached a maximum concentration of 962 ng STXeq L(-1). Of the 13 species tested, we frequently detected PSTs in Pacific sardines (Sardinops sagax; maximum 250 mu g STXeq 100 g(-1)), northern anchovies (Engraulis mordax; maximum 23.2 mu g STXeq 100 g(-1)), brown rock crabs (Cancer antennarius; maximum 49.3 mu g STXeq 100 g(-1)) and red rock crabs (C. productus; 23.8 mu g STXeq 100 g(-1)). PSTs were also present in one sample of Pacific herring (Clupea pallas; 13.3 mu g STXeq 100 g(-1)) and one sample of English sole (Pleuronectes vetulus; 4.5 mu g STXeq 100 g(-1)), and not detected in seven other species of flatfish tested. The presence of PSTs in several of these organisms reveals that toxins produced by A. catenella are more prevalent in California food webs than previously thought and also indicates potential routes of toxin transfer to higher trophic levels.																	0025-3162					FEB	2009	156	3					493	504		10.1007/s00227-008-1103-z								WOS:000262578800024

COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY												The presence of estrogenic chemicals (ECs) in the aquatic environment is a growing problem. While most attention was initially given to fresh water and estuarine ecosystems, it is now evident that coastal marine areas are also vulnerable to these pollutants. The use of vitellogenin induction in male fish, a specific biomarker of EC exposure, has been the most widely applied methodology. However, in some occasions, the high mobility and migratory behaviour of common sentinel fish species makes data interpretation difficult. Hence, there is the need to validate new sentinel marine fish species which should display, among other features, a strong homing behaviour. The shanny, Lipophrys pholis, is an intertidal fish that combines many of the required characteristics for a sentinel species: abundance and easy of catch, wide geographical distribution and restricted home range. Thus, in order to evaluate, in the field, the species sensitivity to ECs, L. pholis males were collected at two sites reflecting different degrees of anthropogenic contamination. The vitellogenin It gene (VTGII) was isolated and its liver expression evaluated by RT-PCR in the field samples. A significant induction of gene expression was observed in the specimens collected in the urban area, if compared to the reference site, which suggests exposure to ECs. Moreover, a 21-days laboratory exposure to environmental relevant concentrations of ethinylestradiol (EE2) was also performed. A significant induction of L pholis VTGII gene in EE2 exposed males was observed suggesting similar sensitivity to that of other marine/estuarine fishes. Even though further validation is currently in progress, the available data indicates that L. pholis is responsive to ECs, thus favouring its future integration in monitoring programmes designed to evaluate the presence of ECs in European marine ecosystems.

Xenobiotic metabolism markers in marine fish with different trophic strategies and their relationship to ecological variables	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY												Nine fish species of commercial interest from six teleost families and two species of elasmobranchs were selected for characterisation of hepatic biomarkers used in early-warning assessment of pollutant exposure. The sampling was carried out in front of the Barcelona coast (NW Mediterranean) during December 2006 at shelf (53 m) and slope (660 m) depths. The enzymes considered included the antioxidant defence catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR), phase I ethoxyresorufln O-deethylase (EROD) and phase 11 glutathione S-transferase (GST). Protein yield (PY) was used as a general marker of hepatic protein synthesis. Significant interspecies differences were evidenced, although each marker varied independently. Enzymatic activities in teleosts were higher than in elasmobranchs; they were very low in Scyliorhinus canicula (mainly a benthic feeder), but not so low in Galeus melastomus (pelagic feeder). In relation to depth, shallow water, shelf-living species had higher metabolic activities. Trophic variables were significantly related to PY and EROD activity, and were especially high in benthic/suprabenthic feeders. Trophic level (deduced from stable isotopy) and stomach fullness were associated with all hepatic markers, except GR. Swimming capacity was related to all hepatic enzymes. Our findings can be applied, not only from the perspective of conservation ecology regarding pollution, but also in fisheries, due to the economic interest of the species involved.

Geostatistical analysis of DNA damage in oysters, Crassostrea virginica, in Lavaca Bay, Texas	ECOTOXICOLOGY												This study evaluated the health of the marine ecosystem in Lavaca Bay, Texas using the Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) as the sentinel species. Lavaca Bay has a history of having gradients of concentrations of pollutants present with some areas containing concentrations high enough to pose a threat to marine ecosystem health. The Comet assay was used to evaluate for the presence of genotoxic response in oyster hematocytes. Bayesian geostatistical analysis was then used to determine if the DNA damage in oyster hematocytes was spatially oriented and to develop continuous surface maps of the risk of DNA damage in this sentinel species. Results indicated that proximity to industrial facilities increased the locational risk of genotoxicity in this species.																	0963-9292	1573-3017				JAN	2009	18	1					69	74		10.1007/s10646-008-0258-1								WOS:000262589200010	18763037

A shift in the dominant toxin-producing algal species in central California alters phycotoxins in food webs	HARMFUL ALGAE												In California, the toxic algal species of primary concern are the dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella and members of the pennate diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia, both producers of potent neurotoxins that are capable of sickening and killing marine life and humans. During the summer of 2004 in Monterey Bay, we observed a change in the taxonomic structure of the phytoplankton community-the typically diatom-dominated community shifted to a red tide, dinoflagellate-dominated community. Here we use a 6-year time series (2000-2006) to show how the abundance of the dominant harmful algal bloom (NAB) species in the Bay up to that point, Pseudo-nitzschia, significantly declined during the dinoflagellate-dominated interval, while two genera of toxic dinoflagellates, Alexandrium and Dinophysis, became the predominant toxin producers. This change represents a shift from a genus of toxin producers that typically dominates the community during a toxic bloom, to HAB taxa that are generally only minor components of the community in a toxic event. This change in the local HAB species was also reflected in the toxins present in higher trophic levels. Despite the small contribution of A. catenella to the overall phytoplankton community, the increase in the presence of this species in Monterey Bay was associated with an increase in the presence of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins in sentinel shellfish and clupeoid fish. This report provides the first evidence that PSP toxins are present in California's pelagic food web, as PSP toxins were detected in both northern anchovies (Engraulis mordax) and Pacific sardines (Sardinops sagax). Another interesting observation from our data is the co-occurrence of DA and PSP toxins in both planktivorous fish and sentinel shellfish. We also provide evidence, based on the statewide biotoxin monitoring program, that this increase in the frequency and abundance of PSP events related to A. catenella occurred not just in Monterey Bay, but also in other coastal regions of California. Our results demonstrate that changes in the taxonomic structure of the phytoplankton community influences the nature of the algal toxins that move through local food webs and also emphasizes the importance of monitoring for the full suite of toxic algae, rather than just one genus or species.

In order to estimate the strength of correlations between accumulated elements in these crustaceans and surficial sediment, bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) were calculated. The results of factor analysis (FA) and the Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA) clearly indicate geographical differences between the concentrations of these elements. Cd, Co, Fe, Ni, Pb and Zn levels were higher in S. entomon from the Gulf of Gdansk, whereas Cr and Mn levels were higher in the crustaceans inhabiting open Baltic waters. The concentrations of Ag and Cu were comparable in both regions. There was a tendency for metal concentrations to distinguish organisms inhabiting the muddy bottom from those living in sandy sediments. The granulometric composition of the sediment appears to influence trace metal bioavailability. The results show that S. entomon could be a valuable sentinel organism for biomonitoring heavy metal contamination in the southern Baltic.

Live native mussels were collected from selected coastal and estuarine sites around the British Isles, including the rivers Test, Thames, Tees, and Clyde, and Lunderston Bay. A suite of biological effects techniques was undertaken on these mussels, including whole organism responses (scope for growth), tissue responses (histopathology), and subcellular responses (lysosomal stability, multi-xenobiotic resistance [MXR], and Comet assay). In addition, whole mussel homogenates were used to measure organic (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAH], polychlorinated biphenyls [PCB]) and metal concentrations. Overall the mussels collected from the Thames were in relatively poor health, based on histopathological markers, significantly higher DNA damage, and elevated expression of MXR detoxifying proteins. In contrast, the mussels collected from the River Test were in the best health, based on histopathological markers, respiration rate (SFG), and low frequency of DNA damage. In conclusion, the biological effects techniques were able to distinguish between relatively contaminated and clean environments, with the Thames mussels in worst health. Mussel tissue chemistry data were not able to explain the variations in biological response. Evidence indicates that the difference in the health of the mussels between the different sites was due to either effects of contaminants that were not measured, or the combined effects of mixture toxicity resulting in a threshold effect.

The Comet assay for the evaluation of genotoxic impact in aquatic environments	MUTATION RESEARCH-REVIEWS IN MUTATION RESEARCH												This review considers the potential of the Comet assay (or Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis, SCGE) to evaluate the environmental impact of genotoxins in aquatic environments. It focuses on in vivo and in situ studies that have been carried out in various marine and freshwater sentinel species, published in the last 5 years. A large number of the studies reviewed report that the Comet assay is more sensitive when compared with other biomarkers commonly used in genetic ecotoxicology, such as sister chromatid exchanges or micronucleus test. Due to its high sensitivity, the Comet assay is widely influenced by laboratory procedures suggesting that standard protocols are required for both fish and mussel cells. However, there are still a wide variety of personalised Comet procedures evident in the literature reviewed, making comparison between published results often very difficult. Standardization and inter-laboratory calibration of the Comet assay as applied to aquatic species will be required if the Comet assay is to be used routinely by national bodies charged with monitoring water quality.

The biological response of the mussels was evaluated by their condition index and the use of a general stress biomarker (evaluation of lysosomal membrane stability: the neutral red retention time (NRRT) method), a genotoxic effects biomarker (determination of micronuclei (MN) frequency) and a neurotoxic effects biomarker (determination of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) concentration). Compared to the K reference specimens, OH and MH caged mussels presented a significant decrease of NRRT in lysosomal haemocytes (56.45 +/- 26.48 min and 67.25 +/- 22.77 min, respectively) (78 +/- 16.97 min for K mussels), an MN frequency respectively 7.3 and 9 times higher in the haemocytes and the gill cells of the OH caged mussels, and 7.2 and 6.4 times higher in the two tissues of the MH caged mussels. Significant inhibition of AChE activity was noted in the gills (16.93 +/- 3.1 nmol min(-1) mg prot(-1) and the digestive gland (7.69 +/- 1.79 nmol min(-1) mg prot(-1)) of the OH mussels, but only in the gills (23.21 +/- 5.94 nmol min(-1) mg prot(-1)) of the MH mussels, compared to the organs of the K control specimens (35.9 +/- 6.4 nmol min(-1) mg prot(-1) in the gills and 11.17 +/- 0.49 mnol min(-1) mg prot(-1) in the digestive gland). This study reflects the interest in such in situ biomonitoring assays and the utility of these biomarkers for assessing the effects of pollution in the Algerian coastal marine environment.																	0078-3234	2300-7370					2009	51	1					63	84		10.5697/oc.51-1.063								WOS:000265040000003

Sea urchin coelomocytes as a novel cellular biosensor of environmental stress: a field study in the Tremiti Island Marine Protected Area, Southern Adriatic Sea, Italy	CELL BIOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGY												The aim of the present study was to investigate on the suitability of the sea urchin as a sentinel organism for the assessment of the macro-zoobenthos health state in bio-monitoring programmes. A field study was carried out during two oceanographic campaigns using immuno-competent cells, the coelomocytes, from sea urchins living in a marine protected area. In particular, coelomocytes subpopulations ratio and heat shock protein 70 (HSC70) levels were measured in specimens of Paracentrotus lividus (Lamark, 1816) collected in two sampling sites, namely Pianosa and Caprara Islands, both belonging to the Tremiti Island Marine Protected Area (MPA) in the Southern Adriatic Sea, Italy. By density gradients separation performed on board the Astrea boat, we found an evident increase in red amoebocytes, a subpopulation increasing upon stress, in those specimens collected around Pianosa (strictly protected area with no human activities allowed), unlike those collected around Caprara (low restrictions for human activities). Likewise, we found higher HSC70 protein levels in the low impacted site (Pianosa) by Western blots on total coelomocyte lysates. The apparent paradox could be explained by the presence in the Pianosa sampling area of contaminating remains from Second World War conventional ammunitions and a merchant boat wreck. Metal determination performed using sea urchin gonads by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) revealed higher Fe and lower Zn levels around Pianosa with respect to Caprara, in accordance with the persistent contaminating metal sources, and thus calling for remediation measures. Taken all together, our results confirm the feasibility of using sea urchin coelomocytes as biosensors of environmental stress.

Glasgow lake: An early-warning sentinel of lake acidification in cape breton highlands national park (Nova scotia, canada)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In contrast to other lakes studied in Cape Breton Highlands National Park (Nova Scotia, Canada), our paleolimnological results indicated that Glasgow Lake has been impacted by acidic deposition starting in the early 1900s. Based on analysis of diatom assemblages, the lake experienced a decrease in diatom-inferred lakewater pH from a pre-industrial pH of similar to 5.8 to a current pH of 5.3 (2000-2002 measured mean pH = 5.0) as well as a decrease in diatom-inferred Gran-alkalinity. In this study, diatom-based paleolimnological techniques were used in conjunction with a dynamic biogeochemical model (MAGIC) to assess both the timing and extent of the acidification trend, as well as determine a probable explanation as to why this lake, and none of the other 15 Cape Breton Highlands lakes studied for paleolimnology thus far, acidified under a peak non-marine sulphate deposition load of 43.6 mmol(c) m-2supercript stop year(-1) in the mid-1970s. Steady-state models estimate that Glasgow Lake had the lowest buffering capacity of six study lakes and estimated critical sulphate loading of < 1 mmol(c) m(-2) year(-1). MAGIC also estimated a loss of charge balance alkalinity from a pre-1850 value of 38 mu mol(c) l(-1) to a low of 12 mu mol(c) l(-1). While no evidence of biological recovery has been recorded, MAGIC estimates an increase in charge balance alkalinity to 27 mu mol(c) l(-1) in 2002 in response to decreased SO(2) emissions. Of the five other lakes that were modelled, all showed trends towards more acidic states and subsequent increases in charge balance alkalinity; however, the empirical paleo-diatom approach applied to these lakes showed no evidence of acidification. Thus, Glasgow Lake has the lowest buffering capacity among the Cape Breton Highland study lakes and serves as a sentinel of potential acidification trends and recovery in this region.

Evaluation of impairment of DNA integrity in marine gastropods (Cronia contracta) as a biomarker of genotoxic contaminants in coastal water around Goa, West coast of India	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												The measurement of the impairment of DNA in marine gastropod (Cronia contracta) provides an insight into the genotoxic effects of contaminants on marine organisms along the Goa coast. The impact of genotoxic contaminants on Goan coastal environment was evaluated in terms of the loss of DNA integrity (expressed as the value of 'l') in marine snails with respect to those from the reference site (Palolem) over a period from April 2004 to May 2005 using the technique of alkaline unwinding assay. The DNA integrity in marine snails was found to be significantly damaged at Dona Paula (58%), Vasco (73.5%), and Velsao (48.5%) during the monsoon period (July-August 2004). Similar trend in the loss of DNA integrity in marine gastropods was also detected during the post-monsoon (November December 2004) and the pre-monsoon (April-May 2005) periods. The low integrities of DNA in marine gastropods at these sites can be attributed to exposure to genotoxic contaminants especially polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and toxic heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Cu, Fe, and Mn) prevalent in the marine environment as evident by their accumulation in the tissues of the marine snails inhabiting different sites along the Goa coast. The contaminant-induced DNA strand breaks in marine snails increased significantly at Dona Paula, Vasco, and Velsao clearly indicating the levels of contamination of the sites by genotoxic compounds in those regions. The genotoxic effects of contaminants were further substantiated by detection of the impairment (39%) of DNA integrity in marine snails in a field experiment in which the same species of marine snails (C contracta) collected from the reference site, Palolem, were deployed at Dona Paula and caged for 25 days for exposure to ambient marine pollutants. The impairment of DNA integrity in marine gastropods along the Goa coast can thus act as a biomarker for marine pollution monitoring of genotoxic contaminants. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Florida red tide and brevetoxins: Association and exposure in live resident bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, USA	MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE												Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) along the Gulf of Mexico are frequently exposed to blooms of the toxic alga, Karenia brevis, and brevetoxins associated with these blooms have been implicated in several dolphin mortality events. Studies on brevetoxin accumulation in dolphins have typically focused on analyses of carcasses from large-scale die-offs; however, data are scarce for brevetoxin loads in live individuals frequently exposed to K. brevis blooms. This study investigated in vivo brevetoxin exposure in free-ranging bottlenose dolphins resident to Sarasota Bay, Florida, utilizing samples collected during health assessments performed during multiple K. brevis blooms occurring from 2003 to 2005. Brevetoxins were detected by ELISA and LC-MS in 63% of bottlenose dolphins sampled (n = 30) concurrently with a K. brevis bloom. Brevetoxins were present in urine and gastric samples at concentrations ranging from 2 to 9 ng PbTx-3 eq/g, and in feces at concentrations ranging from 45 to 231 ng PbTx-3 eq/g. Samples from individuals (n= 12) sampled during nonbloom conditions (<= 1,000 cells/L) were negative for brevetoxin activity.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in surface seawater and in indigenous mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) from coastal areas of the Saronikos Gulf (Greece)	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were identified and measured in surface seawater and in the tissues (gills and mantle) of indigenous black mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis, collected from three coastal sites of Saronikos Gulf (Greece), a gulf that exhibits high levels of pollution. The total PAHs measured by spectrofluorometry in the surface seawater were found in the range of 425-459 ng L-1 at the most polluted sites 1 and 2 (Elefsis Bay-Salamis Island) and in the range of 103-124 ng L-1 at site 3 (Aegina Island). PAHs' sources in seawater were identified by application of specific PAH ratios, such as phenanthrene/anthracene and fluoranthene/pyrene. Levels of PAHs in soft tissues (gills and mantle) of indigenous mussels were much higher than those reported for seawater. Total PAH concentrations in mantle tissues were in the range of 1300-1800 ng g(-1) dry weight (dw) tissue at sites 1 and 2 and approximately 380 ng g-1 dw at site 3. In gill tissues total PAH concentrations were in the range of 1480-2400 ng g(-1) dw at sites 1 and 2 and approximately 430 ng g(-1) dw at site 3. PAHs composition was dominated by two-, three- and four-ring compounds in seawater, where 17 different PAH compounds were identified and measured in mussel tissues. Mussels can be used as sentinel organisms to monitoring PAHs' contamination, since they concentrate PAHs from the surrounding water media and therefore making the chemical analysis simpler and less prone to error than that for water. In surface seawater possible weathering and photodegradation due to hot climates contribute to reduced PAHs concentrations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the neurotoxic effect of TBT has not been extensively described, especially in fishes which have a high number of species in the marine environment. This study was conducted to investigate the neurotoxic effects of TBT at environmental levels (1, 10, and 100 ng l(-1)) on female Sebastiscus marmoratus. The results showed that TBT exposure induced apoptosis in brain cells of three regions including the pallial areas of the telencephalon, the granular layer of the optic tectum, and the cerebellum. In addition, the increase of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide levels, and the decrease of Na+/K+-ATPase activity were found in the brain. The results strongly indicated neurotoxicity of TBT to fishes. According to the regions in which apoptosis was found in the brain, TBT exposure might influence the schooling, sensory and motorial functions of fishes. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Environmental pollutants originating from diverse anthropogenic sources have been known to possess adverse values capable of degrading the ecological integrity of marine environment. The consequences of anthropogenic contamination of marine environments have been ignored or poorly characterized with the possible exception of coastal and estuarine waters close to sewage outlets. Monitoring the impact of pollutants on aquatic life forms is challenging due to the differential sensitivities of organisms to a given pollutant, and the inability to assess the long-term effects of persistent pollutants on the ecosystem as they are bio-accumulated at higher trophic levels. Marine microalgae are particularly promising indicator species for organic and inorganic pollutants since they are typically the most abundant life forms in aquatic environments and occupy the base of the food chain. We review the effects of pollutants on the cellular biochemistry of microalgae and the biochemical mechanisms that microalgae use to detoxify or modify pollutants. In addition, we evaluate the potential uses of microalgae as bioindicator species as an early sentinel in polluted sites. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Irizuki, T; Seto, K; Nomura, R				Irizuki, Toshiaki; Seto, Koji; Nomura, Ritsuo			The impact of fish farming on Ostracoda in Uranouchi and bank construction Bay on the Pacific coast of southwest Japan - Faunal changes between 1954 and 2002/2005	PALEONTOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Uranouchi Bay, an enclosed bay in the southern part of Shikoku Island, southwest Japan, has a complicated geography, being long and narrow with some small inlets. Since 1955, it has been influenced by organic pollution from fish farming. In the spring of 1954, many surface sediment samples were collected in the bay, and were then studied by Ishizaki (1968) to examine ostracode thanatocoenoses. Comparison with this earlier work allows us to investigate faunal changes over this approximately 50-year period. We collected surface sediment and seaweed samples in the bay for ostracode analysis in 2002 and 2005. A total of 124 species were obtained from 29 samples. Comparison between the results suggests that ostracodes have decreased in number in the inner part of the bay and increased greatly in the middle and outer parts of the bay. The number of species and the species diversity has also increased in the middle and outer parts of the bay. Mud dwellers have mostly disappeared from the inner bay and are now found in small inlets in the middle and outer parts of the bay. These changes are caused by the enlargement of areas of anoxic or oxygen-poor bottom waters in the inner part of the bay during the summer. This summer hypoxia is thought to have been brought on by organic pollution from fish farms and the complicated geographical features of the bay. The decrease of inflows of coarse-grained sandy sediments from the outside of the bay, resulting from the intermittent construction of artificial concrete banks in the mouth of the bay in 1946-1950, 1969-1974 and 1991-1996, induced the emergence of preferable environments for a variety of bay and phytal ostracodes in the middle and outer parts of the bay. Valves of phytal species such as xestoleberidid and paradoxostomatid ostracodes increased greatly in the muddy bottoms of the middle part of the bay, where many artificial floating rafts for fish farms are distributed. Seaweed has grown on submerged parts of the floating materials, providing new habitats for phytal ostracodes.																	1342-8144					SEP	2008	12	3					283	302		10.2517/1342-8144-12.3.283								WOS:000259982700006

Cholinesterases activities and lipid peroxidation levels in muscle from shelf and slope dwelling fish from the NW Mediterranean: Its potential use in pollution monitoring	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												We selected muscle tissue from nine commercial fish species, seven teleosts and two elasmobranchs, frequently caught in the NW Mediterranean trawling grounds in two different habitats (the continental shelf at 53 in and the slope at 660 m) for cholinesterases (ChEs) characterisation and activities determination, as well as the measure of lipid peroxidation (LP) levels. Acethyl- (AChE), butyryl- (BChE) and propionyl- (PrChE) cholinesterase were chosen as exposure markers of neurotoxic chemicals/molecules and LP as an effect marker of oxidative damage. The use of diagnose inhibitors: eserine sulphate, iso-OMPA and BW284c51 confirmed the measurement of true ChEs as well as the presence of pseudocholinesterases. The present study has evidenced the existence of interspecies differences, especially between teleosts and elasmobranchs but not in relation to depth. Moreover, the good correlation observed between all ChEs in most of the studied fish, supports the use of AChE as neurotoxic marker in field pollution monitoring. The non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis identified the commercial species hake Merluccius merluccius, among teleosts, and the shark, Galeus melastomus, as more adequate sentinel species in commercial fishing grounds. AChE activity showed a relationship with the fish trophic level, while all ChEs revealed a relationship with the feeding habits (benthic, suprabenthic, pelagic) and the stomach fullness. BChE activity and LP levels were the only markers to show a relationship with their swimming capacity. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

No acute toxicity to Uca pugnax, the mud fiddler crab, following a 96-h exposure to sediment-bound permethrin	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY												In coastal areas, the application of pyrethroid insecticides and the resulting sediment residues pose a potential threat to marine benthic ecosystems. Pyrethroids cause acute toxicity and exhibit a wide range of sublethal effects on fish and crustaceans when exposure is aqueous. Fiddler crabs that inhabit salt marsh sediment are sensitive to sediment-associated pollutants and serve as a sentinel species for xenobiotic exposure. We exposed adult U. pugnax to salt marsh sediment spiked with different 60% trans/40% cis permethrin concentrations for 96 h, and evaluated changes in oxygen consumption rate, hemolymph osmolarity, and glutathione S-transferase activity (GST) following exposure. Marsh sediment was not lethal to U. pugnax at permethrin concentrations of 100-10,000 mu g/kg. Sediment-bound permethrin had no significant effect on respiration and osmoregulation. Exposure caused an induction of hepatopancreas GST in a dose-dependent manner. Gill and midgut tissues showed induction at permethrin concentrations at 10,000 mu g/kg. We conclude that short term exposure to permethrin-contaminated sediment does not pose a significant threat to this species or impact respiration and osmoregulation. Furthermore, increased GST activity allows us to evaluate this enzyme's induction as a generalist biomarker for sediment-bound pyrethroid exposures. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Recent studies have identified detrimental effects on wildlife including endocrine disruption, impairment of enzyme activity, and reduced immune function. The Arctic spider crab, Hyas araneus, shown interesting potential for its use as sentinel organism in polar ecosystems. This study investigated the effect of 2,2',4,4'-tetra bromo diphenyl ether (BPDE), bisphenol A (BPA), and diallyl phthalte (DPA) on H. araneus in a three weeks exposure study. Expression of multixenibiotic resistance (MXR) proteins has been studied using the C219 monoclonal antibody which allows identifying an immunoreactive protein of 40 kDa in the digestive gland while no such protein could be observed in the gills. Expression of this protein was increased by exposure to DPA (+75%; p < 0.05, n = 10). All compounds significantly affected muscle acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity (p < 0.05, n = 10) with 50 mu g/L DPA having the strongest effect by lowering the value to 37% of control. The total oxyradical scavenging capacity measured in the digestive gland toward peroxyl, hydroxyl and peroxynitrite was also significantly reduced indicating a decreased resistance to oxidative stress generated by DPA (p < 0.05, n = 5). These results thus suggest the potential detrimental effects of DPA even at concentration as low as 50 mu g/L on H. araneus. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Boersma, PD				Boersma, P. Dee			Penguins as marine sentinels	BIOSCIENCE												From the tropics to Antarctica, penguins depend on predictable regions of high ocean productivity where their prey aggregate. Increases in precipitation and reductions in sea ice associated with climate warming are affecting penguins. The largest breeding colony of Patagonian (Magellanic) penguins, at Punta Tombo, Argentina, had approximately 200,000 breeding pairs in October-2006-a decline of 22% since 1987. In the 1980s and 1990s, petroleum pollution was a major source of Patagonian penguin mortality. In 1994, tanker lanes were moved 40 kilometers (km) farther off the coast of Chubut, and the dumping of ballast water and the oiling of penguins are now rare. However, penguins are swimming 60 km farther north from their nests during incubation than they did a decade ago, very likely reflecting shifts in prey in response to climate change and reductions in prey abundance caused by commercial fishing. These temperate penguin species, marine sentinels for southern oceans, demonstrate that new challenges are confronting their populations.																	0006-3568	1525-3244				JUL-AUG	2008	58	7					597	607		10.1641/B580707								WOS:000258014700007

Biochemical and cellular responses to pollutant exposure (i.e., biomarkers) increasingly are investigated in mussel tissues and their measurements largely used in marine environmental monitoring. The aim of the present study was to investigate possible pollutant-induced morphometric alterations in Mytilus galloprovincialis granulocytes in view of future applications as a sensitive, simple, and quick biomarker for monitoring and assessment applications. Granulocyte morphometric alterations were determined by image analysis on Diff-Quick(R) stained cells. For the first time, the rapid alcohol-fixed Diff-Quick stain protocol, utilized in clinical and veterinary applications for immediate interpretation of histological samples, was shown to be suitable for rapid cytological staining of M. galloprovincialis haemocytes. The present study was carried out in standardized laboratory conditions and further validated in field conditions. Results show consistent pollutant-induced enlargement of mussel granulocytes. This was verified by standardized biomarkers such as metallothionein concentrations in the digestive gland or lysosomal membrane stability in laboratory and field exposures. Results further suggest that the observed morphometric alterations can be used as a biomarker of chemical stress. Because no single biomarker generally is adequate for describing the complexity of effects induced by environmental pollutants on the organisms, we propose that morphometric alterations of granulocytes should be used in a biomarker battery in marine environmental monitoring programs such as Mussel Watch.				lionetto, maria giulia/H-1356-2011	Lionetto, Maria Giulia/0000-0003-3752-0192; calisi, antonio/0000-0002-8146-7280; caricato, roberto/0000-0002-7928-4573												0730-7268					JUN	2008	27	6					1435	1441		10.1897/07-396.1								WOS:000255906100025	18260695

Large-scale marine ecosystem change and the conservation of marine mammals	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY												Papers in this Special Feature stem from a symposium on large-scale ecosystem change and the conservation of marine mammals convened at the 86th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Mammalogists in June 2006. Major changes are occurring in multiple aspects of the marine environment at unprecedented rates, within the life spans of some individual marine mammals. Drivers of change include shifts in climate, acoustic pollution, disturbances to trophic structure, fisheries interactions, harmful algal blooms, and environmental contaminants. This Special Feature provides an in-depth examination of 3 issues that are particularly troublesome. The 1st article notes the huge spatial and temporal scales of change to which marine mammals are showing ecological responses, and how these species can function as sentinels of such change. The 2nd paper describes the serious problems arising from conflicts with fisheries, and the 3rd contribution reviews the growing issues associated with underwater noise.																	0022-2372	1545-1542				JUN	2008	89	3					529	533		10.1644/07-MAMM-S-416R.1								WOS:000256553100001						
J	Moore, SE				Moore, Sue E.			Marine mammals as ecosystem sentinels	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY												The earth's climate is changing, possibly at an unprecedented rate. Overall, the planet is warming, sea ice and glaciers are in retreat, sea level is rising, and pollutants are accumulating in the environment and within organisms. These clear physical changes undoubtedly affect marine ecosystems. Species dependent on sea ice, such as the polar bear (Ursus maritimus) and the ringed seal (Phoca hispida), provide the clearest examples of sensitivity to climate change. Responses of cetaceans to climate change are more difficult to discern, but in the eastern North Pacific evidence is emerging that gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) are delaying their southbound migration, expanding their feeding range along the migration route and northward to Arctic waters, and even remaining in polar waters over winter-all indications that North Pacific and Arctic ecosystems are in transition. To use marine mammals as sentinels of ecosystem change, we must expand our existing research strategies to encompass the decadal and ocean-basin temporal and spatial scales consistent with their natural histories.																	0022-2372					JUN	2008	89	3					534	540		10.1644/07-MAMM-S-312R1.1								WOS:000256553100002

To this end, a characterisation of acethylcholin (AChE), butyrylcholin (BChE) and propionylcholin (PrChE) esterases in L. pholis muscle was performed and the results indicated that AChE was predominant. Furthermore, the use of eserine sulphate and BW284c51 (0.64-800 mu M), and iso-OMPA (0.08-16 mM), confirmed the measurement of true cholinesterases (ChEs) as well as the presence of pseudocholinesterases. The field application of these markers to L. pholis, sampled in seven locations along the Portuguese coast, revealed that fish were likely to be affected by neurotoxic compounds. This was indicated by the significant depletion of AChE (p < 0.05) in animals collected at urban and industrialised sites, compared with those from reference locations. The inclusion of a marker of effect, measured as lipid peroxidation levels in muscle tissue, also revealed the existence of site differences. Overall, the study further validates the utility of L. pholis in pollution monitoring studies. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Geographic specificity of Aroclor 1268 in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) frequenting the Turtle/Brunswick River Estuary, Georgia (USA)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Coastal marine resources are at risk from anthropogenic contaminants, including legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPS) with half-lives of decades or more. To determine if polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) signatures can be used to distinguish among local populations of inshore bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) along the southeastern U.S. coast, blubber from free-ranging and stranded animals were collected along the Georgia coast in 2004 and analyzed for PCB congeners using gas chromatography with electron capture and negative chemical ionization mass spectrometric detection (GC-ECD and GC-NCI-MS). Mean total PCB concentrations (77 +/- 34 mu g/g lipid) were more than 10 fold higher and congener distributions were highly enriched in Cl-7-Cl-10 homologs in free-ranging animals from the Turtle/Brunswick River estuary (TBRE) compared with strandings samples from Savannah area estuaries 90 km to the north. Using principal components analysis (PCA), the Aroclor 1268 signature associated with TBRE animals was distinct from that observed in Savannah area animals, and also from those in animals biopsied in other southeastern U.S estuaries. Moreover, PCB signatures in dolphin blubber closely resembled those in local preferred prey fish species, strengthening the hypothesis that inshore T. truncatus populations exhibit long-term fidelity to specific estuaries and making them excellent sentinels for assessing the impact of stressors on coastal ecosystem health.

The aims of this study were to evaluate the bioavailability of metals in the Macaronesian endemic limpet Patella candei gomesii living close to shallow water hydrothermal vents, and the structural differences in their digestive gland as well as the levels of apoptosis in that organ. Limpets were sampled in four sites, two with the presence of hydrothermalism and the other two without it. Whole body concentrations of several metals (Ca, Cd, Cs, Co, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mg, Mn, Pb, Rb, Se, Sr, and Zn) were obtained, morphometry analysis of the digestive gland and TUNEL test for apoptosis were also performed. Results revealed that the presence of shallow water hydrothermal vents is a source of chronic metal stress to limpets, imposing modifications in the morphometry and cell composition of the digestive gland of those limpets that may constitute cell and tissue adaptations to the environment they live in. This study sets up new baseline data for further research on the influence of shallow water hydrothermal vents over communities living in these habitats. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Effects of climate change on Arctic marine mammal health	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												The lack of integrated long-term data on health, diseases, and toxicant effects in Arctic marine mammals severely limits our ability to predict the effects of climate change on marine mammal health. The overall health of an individual animal is the result of complex interactions among immune status, body condition, pathogens and their pathogenicity, toxicant exposure, and the various environmental conditions that interact with these factors. Climate change could affect these interactions in several ways. There may be direct effects of loss of the sea ice habitat, elevations of water and air temperature, and increased occurrence of severe weather. Some of the indirect effects of climate change on animal health will likely include alterations in pathogen transmission due to a variety of factors, effects on body condition due to shifts in the prey base/food web, changes in toxicant exposures, and factors associated with increased human habitation in the Arctic (e.g., chemical and pathogen pollution in the runoff due to human and domestic-animal wastes and chemicals and increased ship traffic with the attendant increased risks of ship strike, oil spills, ballast pollution, and possibly acoustic injury). The extent to which climate change will impact marine mammal health will also vary among species, with some species more sensitive to these factors than others. Baseline data on marine mammal health parameters along with matched data on the population and climate change trends are needed to document these changes.																	1051-0761					MAR	2008	18	2		S			S126	S134		10.1890/06-0553.1								WOS:000255381500008	18494366

Arctic marine mammals and climate change: Impacts and resilience	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Evolutionary selection has refined the life histories of seven species (three cetacean [narwhal, beluga, and bowhead whales], three pinniped [walrus, ringed, and bearded seals], and the polar bear) to spatial and temporal domains influenced by the seasonal extremes and variability of sea ice, temperature, and day length that define the Arctic. Recent changes in Arctic climate may challenge the adaptive capability of these species. Nine other species (five cetacean [fin, humpback, minke, gray, and killer whales] and four pinniped [harp, hooded, ribbon, and spotted seals]) seasonally occupy Arctic and subarctic habitats and may be poised to encroach into more northern latitudes and to remain there longer, thereby competing with extant Arctic species. A synthesis of the impacts of climate change on all these species hinges on sea ice, in its role as: (1) platform, (2) marine ecosystem foundation, and (3) barrier to non-ice-adapted marine mammals and human commercial activities. Therefore, impacts are categorized for: (1) ice-obligate species that rely on sea ice platforms, (2) ice-associated species that are adapted to sea ice-dominated ecosystems, and (3) seasonally migrant species for which sea ice can act as a barrier. An assessment of resilience is far more speculative, as any number of scenarios can be envisioned, most of them involving potential trophic cascades and anticipated human perturbations. Here we provide resilience scenarios for the three ice-related species categories relative to four regions defined by projections of sea ice reductions by 2050 and extant shelf oceanography. These resilience scenarios suggest that: (1) some populations of ice-obligate marine mammals will survive in two regions with sea ice refugia, while other stocks may adapt to ice-free coastal habitats, (2) ice-associated species may find suitable feeding opportunities within the two regions with sea ice refugia and, if capable of shifting among available prey, may benefit from extended foraging periods in formerly ice-covered seas, but (3) they may face increasing competition from seasonally migrant species, which will likely infiltrate Arctic habitats. The means to track and assess Arctic ecosystem change using sentinel marine mammal species are suggested to offer a framework for scientific investigation and responsible resource management.

The use of the shanny Lipophrys pholis for pollution monitoring: A new sentinel species for the northwestern European marine ecosystems	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL												The contamination of aquatic ecosystems by organic contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is a matter of great concern. Mussels have been extensively used as sentinel species in a large number of monitoring programs. However, the use of bivalves as the sole species has some limitations, because they are not as responsive as fish to Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor agonists. Hence, for many marine areas, there is the need to validate new sentinel fish species that can be used in the assessment of pollution by organic contaminants. The shanny Lipophrys pholis is an intertidal fish that combines many characteristics required in a sentinel species: is abundant and easy to catch, has a wide geographical distribution and restrict home range. After larvae recruitment to the intertidal rocky shores, they remain in the same area for the rest of the life-cycle, thus reflecting local pollutants exposure. In order to evaluate the species sensitivity to organic contaminants under field conditions, L. pholis were collected at six sites reflecting different degrees of anthropogenic contamination. The induction of two biomarkers extensively validated in the assessment of PAHs contamination ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity (EROD) and Fluorescent Aromatic Compounds (FACs) was evaluated. In parallel, mussels were collected at the same locations and levels of 16 PAHs and selected heavy metals determined. Overall, the specimens collected in the urban areas showed a significant induction of EROD and FACs (up to a six-fold induction) if compared with the reference sites. Additionally, a positive correlation was observed between the biomarkers and PAHs levels in mussel tissues. Even though further validation is currently in progress, the available data indicate that L. pholis is responsive to organic contaminants such as PAHs, suggesting its future integration in monitoring programmes designed to evaluate the presence of these contaminants in European marine ecosystems.

Fredrick			The coastal environment and human health: microbial indicators, pathogens, sentinels and reservoirs	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH					Meeting of the Centers for Oceans and Human Health Investigators	APR 24-27, 2007	Woods Hole, MA					Innovative research relating oceans and human health is advancing our understanding of disease-causing organisms in coastal ecosystems. Novel techniques are elucidating the loading, transport and fate of pathogens in coastal ecosystems, and identifying sources of contamination. This research is facilitating improved risk assessments for seafood consumers and those who use the oceans for recreation. A number of challenges still remain and define future directions of research and public policy. Sample processing and molecular detection techniques need to be advanced to allow rapid and specific identification of microbes of public health concern from complex environmental samples. Water quality standards need to be updated to more accurately reflect health risks and to provide managers with improved tools for decision-making. Greater discrimination of virulent versus harmless microbes is needed to identify environmental reservoirs of pathogens and factors leading to human infections. Investigations must include examination of microbial community dynamics that may be important from a human health perspective. Further research is needed to evaluate the ecology of non-enteric water-transmitted diseases. Sentinels should also be established and monitored, providing early warning of dangers to ecosystem health. Taken together, this effort will provide more reliable information about public health risks associated with beaches and seafood consumption, and how human activities can affect their exposure to disease-causing organisms from the oceans.

A review of subtidal benthic habitats and invertebrate biota of the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The initial phase of a collaborative ambient monitoring program (AMP) for the Strait of Georgia (SoG) (Marine Environmental Research, in press.) has focused on the benthos, sedimentary regimes, organic and contaminant cycling in subtidal regions of the strait. As part of that project, we review the primarily subtidal benthic invertebrate faunal communities found in the SoG, with particular reference to habitats and sediment conditions. This topic has not been addressed in the primary literature for over 20 years. Benthic biota are the baseline sentinels of the influence of natural and anthropogenic inputs to sediments. They are also a fundamental component of the food chain at the seafloor, and their community ecology must be clearly understood in order to predict how anthropogenic activities and climate change will affect our coastal oceans. The purpose of this review is to provide context on habitats and biota in the SoG, and to highlight topics and geographic areas where Our knowledge of the benthos is limited or lacking.

Green mussel (Perna viridis) samples collected from a total of 48 locations in India, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and the Philippines during 1994-1999 were analyzed for PAHs, EDCs including nonylphenol (NP), octylphenol (OP) and bisphenol A (BPA), and linear alkylbenzenes (LABs) as molecular markers for sewage. Concentrations of NP ranged from 18 to 643 ng/g-dry tissue. The highest levels of NP in Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, and Indonesia were comparable to those observed in Tokyo Bay. Elevated concentrations of EDCs were not observed in Vietnam and Cambodia, probably due to the lower extent of industrialization in these regions. No consistent relationship between concentrations of phenolic EDCs and LABs were found, suggesting that sewage is not a major source of EDCs. Concentrations of PAHs ranged from 11 to 1,133 ng/g-dry, which were categorized as "low to moderate" levels of pollution. The ratio of methylphenanthrenes to phenanthrene (MP/P ratio) was > 1.0 in 20 out of 25 locations, indicating extensive input of petrogenic PAHs. This study provides a bench-mark for data on the distribution of anthropogenic contaminants in this region, which is essential in evaluating temporal and spatial variation and effect of future regulatory measures.

J	Furness, RW				Furness, Robert W.			Responses of seabirds to depletion of food fish stocks	JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												Life history theory predicts that seabirds will respond to reduction in food abundance by changes in behaviour or breeding effort, buffering adult survival. Empirical data show some support for this but also sometimes indicate a trade-off in which survival of breeding seabirds may be reduced by food shortage. The sensitivity of seabird adult survival rates may be a feature of the detailed ecology of particular species and may be affected by ecological conditions such as the possibilities for prey switching. Fishery managers may set a lower limit biomass to protect fish stock recruitment, often at about 20% of predicted unfished stock biomass. It is unclear whether this threshold would also protect the needs of seabirds dependent on the fish stock. Time series of seabird breeding success and fish stock biomass may indicate minimum densities of food required. These are orders of magnitude more than the consumption by seabird populations. The critical prey density may also vary tremendously among seabird species and is clearly a function of the detailed ecology of each species. It is possible to predict which species will be most sensitive to reduced food supply. Sensitive species may be sentinels of the "health'' of the marine ecosystem. For example, in Shetland and elsewhere in the North Sea, breeding success of kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla is particularly sensitive to abundance and quality of sandeels Ammodytes spp. However, seabird communities may be affected by a variety of interactions prompted by changes in fisheries; maintaining food fish levels may not alone be sufficient where communities have altered in composition over decades of fishing, as in the North Sea, and where predator-prey impacts induced by changes in fishery management may disrupt seabird communities.																	0021-8375	1439-0361				DEC	2007	148			2			S247	S252		10.1007/s10336-007-0152-2								WOS:000255199000013

Antioxidant defence enzymes play an important role in cellular antioxidant defence systems and protect from oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Indigenous mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis of the Saronikos Gulf of Greece were used for monitoring heavy metal pollution in three polluted sites in the area and in one unpolluted site. Seasonal variations of the activity of antioxidant defence enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), as well as lipid peroxidation (LP) were measured as biomarkers in a period of three years in relation to concentrations of trace metals in their gills and mantle and compared to mussels from an unpolluted sampling site. SOD activity increased at least 2 fold at the polluted sites when compared to the control site (the high activity was recorded in the spring time). CAT activity was increased 2-3 times at the polluted sites, with high activity in the winter and spring time, compared to the control site. LP concentration was twice higher at the polluted sites, following the same seasonal pattern. Trace metals contents in mussels collected at polluted sites were 3-4 fold higher compared to the control site and showed moderate variations along the months, with a winter maximum followed by a summer pre-spawning minimum matching the seasonal trends of temperature and salinity. Our results showed that metal pollution in the Elefsis Bay (the most polluted coastal area) causes relatively medium levels of oxidative stress in tissues of mussels due to cellular oxy-radical generation. This study, which is the first in the area, showed that seasonal variations of the activity of antioxidant defence enzymes and LP concentrations in mussels can be used as potential biomarkers of toxicity for long-term monitoring in marine coastal ecosystems.

Cadmium and mercury in Seine Estuary flounders and mussels: the results of two decades of monitoring	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												The flounder (Platichthys flesus) is a flatfish that inhabits marine coastal environments, especially estuaries. It is an alternative quantitative biological indicator to the common marine mussel (Mytilus spp.), which is currently used as a sentinel species to monitor chemical contamination in numerous monitoring programmes. Findings from two decades of monitoring cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg) using both sentinel species in the Seine Estuary (France) are reported. For comparison, time-series of water concentrations for the same two metals at the mouth of the River Seine are given. Cd concentrations in the liver of the fish and in the soft tissue of mussels show similar temporal trends, consistent with the major temporal variations of Cd concentrations recorded in river water and with changes in industrial discharge of Cd (phosphogypsum waste) within the Seine Estuary. On the other hand, Hg concentrations in the muscles of flounders show temporal variations with no link to that observed in mussels or fluvial Hg contributions, which are in fact nearly covariant. It is concluded that optimization of the use of flounders as sentinel organisms for monitoring temporal trends of metal contamination in estuarine environments requires in-depth knowledge of its ecology within the area studied. An adapted sampling strategy based on this knowledge should provide results that are easier to interpret.																	1054-3139					JUL	2007	64	5					929	938		10.1093/icesjms/fsm031								WOS:000247991500008

AChE specific activity in brain varied from 145 to 530U/g of proteins and the Michaelis-Menten constant (K-M) for acetylthiocholine varied from 104 to 291 mu M among the 20 species studied. The enzyme sensitivity to methyl paraoxon, evaluated by the inhibition kinetic constants, shows that some species (Paralonchurus brasiliensis and Genidens genidens) are more sensitive (IC50-30min = 455 and 468 nM, respectively). The less sensitive Merluccius hubbsi and Percophis brasiliensis (IC50-30 min = 3339 and 3259nM, respectively) belong to the super-order Paracanthopterygii, which includes the more ancient species. On the other hand, more susceptible species belong to the super-order Acanthopterygii, which includes more recent species. These results suggest a possible evolutionary linkage for AChE sensitivity to methyl paraoxon. The application of inhibition kinetic constants for fish brain AChE in phylogenetic studies is still being investigated. The results have shown that a fish sentinel species should have the highest brain AChE level among the more sensitive ones. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The study of different systems related to oxidative stress in these organisms can give important information about their physiological status and also about environmental health. Bivalves have been proposed as good sentinel organisms in pollution monitoring studies through the analysis of biochemical biomarkers, and most of the biomarkers analyzed are those related to oxidative stress. However, it is very important to know how other environmental factors not associated to the presence of pollutants might affect these parameters. We have studied a series of mechanisms related to oxidative stress in mussels which inhabit the Brazilian coast, especially in Perna perna species, subjected to different stress conditions, such as the exposure to different contaminants in the laboratory and in the field, the exposure of mussels to air and re-submersion, simulating the tidal oscillations, and in mussels collected at different seasons. Both oxidative damage levels and antioxidant defense systems were strongly affected by the different environmental stress.

Development of an expert system for the integration of biomarker responses in mussels into an animal health index	BIOMARKERS												Biomarkers on sentinel organisms are utilised worldwide in biomonitoring programs. However, the lack of effective interpretational capacity has hampered their uptake for use for assessment of risk in environmental management. The aim of the present study was to develop and test an objective decision-support or expert system capable of integrating biomarker results into a five-level health-status index. The expert system is based on a set of rules derived from available data on responses to natural and contaminant-induced stress of marine mussels. Integration of parameters includes: level of biological organization; biological significance, mutual interrelationship; and qualitative trends in a stress gradient. The system was tested on a set of biomarker data obtained from the field and subsequently validated with data from previous studies. The results demonstrate that the expert system can effectively quantify the biological effects of different levels of pollution. The system represents a simple tool for risk assessment of the harmful impact of contaminants by providing a clear indication of the degree of stress syndrome induced by pollutants in mussels.

In 1906, a presently ongoing controversy started, with Plehn's independent characterization of rodlet cells as endogenous glandular cells, and a prompt refutation by Laguesse (1906). Both maintained their position, and during the following century both views continued to coexist with varying popularity, while additional interpretations of rodlet cell function were proposed. Here I present observations of live rodlet cells from the olfactory epithelium of the marine teleost Isacia conceptionis. Rodlet ejection was monitored and the fate of rodlet cells and ejected rodlets was tracked for up to 12 It. While rodlet cells died within a few hours, usually after rodlet expulsion, the rodlets remained stable over the observation period. These results are discussed in the light of the current hypotheses regarding rodlet cell function.																	0716-078X					MAR	2007	80	1					55	62										WOS:000245580300005

Reversible alterations in epithelial cell turnover in digestive gland of winkles (Littorina littorea) exposed to cadmium and their implications for biomarker measurements	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												In marine molluscs, the epithelium of the digestive gland is composed of two cell types, namely, digestive and basophilic cells. Under normal physiological conditions digestive cells outnumber basophilic cells, but under different stress situations the composition of the epithelium changes, basophilic cells apparently replace digestive cell. Winkles, Littorina littorea, were exposed to 1.25 mg/l Cd for 20 days to provoke cell type replacement. Then, animals were depurated in clean seawater for 10 days to determine whether cell type replacement was reversible. Digestive a glands were fixed in Carnoy and paraffin embedded for histological analysis. The volume densities of basophilic cells (Vv(BAS)) and digestive cells (Vv(DIG)) were calculated by stereology on hematoxylin-eosin stained sections. Vv(BAS) increased and Vv(DIG) decreased in Cd-exposed animals. After estimation of cell size and absolute cell numbers, these changes were attributed to digestive cell loss and concomitant basophilic cell hypertrophy but not to increased numbers of basophilic cells. Cell type composition and cell size almost fully returned to normal values after 10-day depuration. Accordingly, PCNA immunohistochemistry demonstrated that proliferating digestive cells were more abundant in winkles exposed to Cd and after 10-day depuration than in control specimens, suggesting that net digestive cell loss was accompanied by increased digestive cell proliferation. Thus, Cd-exposure seems to provoke an enhanced digestive cell turnover in order to cope with Cd detoxification. Intralysosomal accumulation of metals (autometallographied black silver deposits; BSD) was used as a biomarker of exposure to Cd and lysosomal structural changes as an effect biomarker to see whether cell type composition might have any effect on these endpoints. BSD formed around Cd ions, in digestive cell lysosomes of Cd-exposed winkles whereas basophilic cells appeared devoid of them. After depuration, BSD were less conspicuous. Enlarged lysosomes were observed in Cd-exposed winkles, lysosome size returning to control levels after 10-day depuration. Changes in digestive cell proliferation, digestive cell loss and basophilic cell hypertrophy did not apparently affect the biomarkers investigated herein. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

J	Soin, T; Smagghe, G				Soin, Thomas; Smagghe, Guy			Endocrine disruption in aquatic insects: a review	ECOTOXICOLOGY												There is mounting evidence that a wide variety of compounds can have endocrine disrupting effects on humans and wildlife. However, investigations so far have focused primarily on exposure to human and other vertebrates, with invertebrate findings largely restricted to marine mollusks or to the ecdysteroid and juvenile hormone agonists as purposely synthesized endocrine disrupters for the pest management of insects. This article provides a brief description of the insect hormone system, a short sum-up of the relevant insect groups with aquatic life stages, and an overview of the additional evidence for endocrine disruption in aquatic insects from laboratory and field studies since 1999. In addition, the suitability of insects as sentinels for endocrine disrupting chemicals in aquatic ecosystems is discussed. Conclusions are drawn and research needs are defined.

In spite of this potential, available data in literature are still rather limited, particularly with regard to the possible effects of endocrine disrupter compounds (EDCs). This review presents echinoderms as useful models for ecotoxicological tests and gives a brief overview of the most significant results obtained in recent years, particularly in the context of the COMPRENDO EU project. In this research project two different aspects of echinoderm physiology, plausibly regulated by humoral mechanisms, were investigated: reproductive biology and regenerative development. Selected EDCs suspected for their androgenic or antiandrogenic action were tested at low concentrations. The results obtained so far showed that different parameters such as regenerative growth, histological pattern, egg diameter and gonad maturation were affected by the exposure to the selected compounds. These results substantiate that reproductive and regenerative phenomena of echinoderms can be considered valuable alternative models for studies on EDCs and confirm that these compounds interfere with fundamental physiological processes, including growth, development and reproductive competence.

The protocol is based on applying liquid chromatography ( LC) coupled with two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) to analyze changes in the protein expression pattern after exposure to marine pollution. The digestive gland of the sentinel "blue mussel" ( Mytilus edulis) was batch-processed through a simple cell fractionation followed by ion-exchange chromatography and 2-DE. The selection of ligands, elution method, and small volume design was carefully considered to define a protocol that could be mainly robotized. A pilot study with samples collected from different Gothenburg harbor areas indicated that the clean area could be distinguished from the polluted ones based on a protein expression pattern ( PES) composed of 13 proteins. Principal component analysis ( PCA) and hierarchical clustering confirmed that the PES was sufficient to discriminate polluted and unpolluted areas and to provide a spatial gradient from the polluted source. Several proteins from the PES were identified by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry ( ESI-MS/MS), and they are involved in,beta-oxidation, amino acid metabolism, detoxification, protein degradation, organelle biogenesis, and protein folding. In the near future, this methodology could show potential advantages to assess marine pollution and could become a stable platform to elucidate ecotoxicological questions.

A total of 3619 mortality events was documented for aquatic birds, involving at least 633 708 dead birds from 158 species belonging to 23 families. Environmental causes accounted for the largest proportion of mortality events (1737 or 48%) and dead birds (437 258 or 69%); these numbers increased between 1971 and 2000, with biotoxin mortalities due to botulinum intoxication (Types C and E) being the leading cause of death. Infectious diseases were the second leading cause of mortality events (20%) and dead birds (20%), with both viral diseases, including duck plague (Herpes virus), paramyxovirus of cormorants (Paramyxovirus PMV1) and West Nile virus (Flavivirus), and bacterial diseases, including avian cholera (Pasteurella multocida), chlamydiosis (Chalmydia psittici), and salmonellosis (Salmonella sp.), contributing. Pelagic, coastal marine birds and species that use marine and freshwater habitats were impacted most frequently by environmental causes of death, with biotoxin exposure, primarily botulinum toxin, resulting in mortalities of both coastal and freshwater species. Pelagic birds were impacted most severely by emaciation and starvation, which may reflect increased anthropogenic pressure on the marine habitat from over-fishing, pollution, and other factors. Our study provides important information on broad trends in aquatic bird mortality and highlights how long-term wildlife disease studies can be used to identify anthropogenic threats to wildlife conservation and ecosystem health. In particular, mortality data for the past 30 yr suggest that biotoxins, viral, and bacterial diseases could have impacted >5 million aquatic birds.				daszak, peter/U-4588-2017	daszak, peter/0000-0002-2046-5695; Patel, Nikkita/0000-0001-6300-6731												0171-8630						2007	352						299	309		10.3354/meps07076								WOS:000252795600028

Feminisation of male clams Scrobicularia plana from estuaries in Southwest UK and its induction by endocrine-disrupting chemicals	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The risk of endocrine disruption in the marine environment is unclear and is often overlooked in invertebrates. We show that disruption to the 'normal' gonadal development of male estuarine clams Scrobicularia plana is occurring extensively at sites in Southwest UK, with populations exhibiting varying degrees of intersex (ovotestis), This is one of the few studies to have examined the extent of the condition in mollusc populations. Intersex was present in more than two-thirds of the populations screened from the Avon, Southampton Water, Bristol Channel/Severn, Erme, Plym, Fal, Tamar and Lynher Estuaries; severity varied, with between 0 and 60% of males exhibiting the condition. Prevalence of intersex tended to peak as gonads reached maturity in July, and was highest in clams from the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary, coinciding with an increase in oocyte size in both the female gonad and in the ovotestis of affected males. Experimental exposures to sediment spiked with mixtures of 17 beta-oestradiol (E2), 17 alpha-ethinyloestradiol (EE2), octylphenol (OP) and nonylphenol (NP) indicated that (xeno)estrogens could be a contributory factor in the induction of intersex and increased oocyte size. It is plausible, therefore, that the incidence of ovotestis may be linked to urban, industrial and agricultural influences, or a combination thereof, although the relative importance of these sources has yet to be determined. S. plana offers potential as a sentinel species for screening and investigation of endocrine disruption in the estuarine environment, helping to focus remediatory strategy where it would be most beneficial,																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2007	333						173	184		10.3354/meps333173								WOS:000245557100016

A global crisis for seagrass ecosystems	BIOSCIENCE												Seagrasses, marine flowering plants, have a long evolutionary history but are now challenged with rapid environmental changes as a result of coastal human population pressures. Seagrasses provide key ecological services, including organic carbon production and export, nutrient cycling, sediment stabilization, enhanced biodiversity, and trophic transfers to adjacent habitats in tropical and temperate regions. They also serve as "coastal canaries," global biological sentinels of increasing anthropogenic influences in coastal ecosystems, with large-scale losses reported worldwide. Multiple stressors, including sediment and nutrient runoff, physical disturbance, invasive species, disease, commercial fishing practices, aquaculture, overgrazing, algal blooms, and global warming, cause seagrass declines at scales of square meters to hundreds of square kilometers. Reported seagrass losses have led to increased awareness of the need for seagrass protection, monitoring, management, and restoration. However, seagrass science, which has rapidly grown, is disconnected from public awareness of seagrasses, which has lagged behind awareness of other coastal ecosystems. There is a critical need for a targeted global conservation effort that includes a reduction of watershed nutrient and sediment inputs to seagrass habitats and a targeted educational program informing regulators and the public of the value of seagrass meadows.

Determination of uptake of metals and hypothesis testing for differences that could be attributed to contamination required the establishment of baseline metal concentrations in P. walkeri. Baseline metal concentrations from two reference locations in the Windmill lslands are presented here. P. walkeri was a found to be a sensitive bioaccumulating organism that recorded spatial and temporal variability at the reference sites. Measurement of metals in P. walkeri required the development of a simple digestion procedure that used concentrated nitric acid. For the first time, rare earth metals were determined with additional clean procedures required to measure ultra low concentrations using magnetic sector ICP-MS. Certified and in-house reference materials were employed to ensure method reliability. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Newman, SJ; Smith, SA				Newman, S. J.; Smith, S. A.			Marine mammal neoplasia: A review	VETERINARY PATHOLOGY												A review of the published literature indicates that marine mammal neoplasia includes the types and distributions of tumors seen in domestic species. A routine collection of samples from marine mammal species is hampered, and, hence, the literature is principally composed of reports from early whaling expeditions, captive zoo mammals, and epizootics that affect larger numbers of animals from a specific geographic location. The latter instances are most important, because many of these long-lived, free-ranging marine mammals may act as environmental sentinels for the health of the oceans. Examination of large numbers of mortalities reveals incidental proliferative and neoplastic conditions and, less commonly, identifies specific malignant cancers that can alter population dynamics. The best example of these is the presumptive herpesvirus-associated metastatic genital carcinomas found in California sea lions. Studies of tissues from St. Lawrence estuary beluga whales have demonstrated a high incidence of neoplasia and produced evidence that environmental contamination with high levels of polychlorinated biphenols and dichlorophenyl trichloroethane might be the cause. In addition, viruses are suspected to be the cause of gastric papillomas in belugas and cutaneous papillomas in Florida manatees and harbor porpoises. While experimental laboratory procedures can further elucidate mechanisms of neoplasia, continued pathologic examination of marine mammals will also be necessary to follow trends in wild populations.

J	Machella, N; Battino, M; Pisanelli, B; Regoli, F				Machella, Nicola; Battino, Maurizio; Pisanelli, Barbara; Regoli, Francesco			Influence of the SCGE protocol on the amount of basal DNA damage detected in the Mediterranean Mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis	ENVIRONMENTAL AND MOLECULAR MUTAGENESIS												Genotoxicity studies using the single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay indicate that basal levels of DNA strand breaks (SBs) in marine invertebrates are higher and more variable than those in marine vertebrates. This elevated level of DNA damage was attributed to a large number of alkali-labile sites, which are characteristic of the tightly-packaged DNA in invertebrate cells. To investigate if altering the SCGE protocol can artificially modulate high levels of SBs, SCGE experiments were performed on hoemocytes from the Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) using proteinase K (PK) digestion in combination with assay buffers containing various concentrations of EDTA. In addition, the effects of Trolox((R)) (soluble antioxidant) and aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA; inhibitor of Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent nucleases) also were tested. The levels of SBs in M. galloprovicialis cells were compared with SBs in cells from a terrestrial mollusk (the snail Helix aspersa), and a teleost fish (the seabass Dicentrarchus lobrax). The integrity of M. galloprovincialis DNA isolated with phenol extractions using EDTA, Trolox, and ATA was further assayed by gel electrophoresis. High SBs in mussel cells were reduced by combining EDTA with PK digestion, or using Trolox((R)) or ATA during cell processing for the SCGE assay. Snails and seabass had lower levels of SBs in the SCGE assay, and the levels were not affected by the protocol modifications. Adding EDTA, Trolox((R)), or ATA to phenol extractions of M. galloprovincialis genomic DNA also reduced the extent of DNA fragmentation. These results suggest that the internal fluids of M. galloprovincialis may increase the basal levels of DNA SBs through oxidative and/or enzyme-mediated pathways. M. golloprovincialis is used extensively as a sentinel species for assessing the genotoxic hazard of marine pollutants. Our data suggest that the SCGE protocol should be carefully considered when assessing DNA damage in these species.

Environmental effects of the anti-sea lice (Copepoda : Caligidae) therapeutant emamectin benzoate under commercial use conditions in the marine environment	AQUACULTURE												Sea lice infestation can pose a particular problem to intensive cage aquaculture of salmonids. It is most often treated by therapeutants added to the water or incorporated into fish feed. This study investigated the environmental effects of one such in-feed treatment, emamectin benzoate, under commercial use conditions. Atlantic salmon were fed the commercial preparation of emamectin benzoate at a production fish farm on the west coast of Scotland. Sediment dwelling fauna, large mobile fauna and sentinel organisms were monitored for potential impacts over a 1 year post-treatment period (23 September 1997 to 23 September 1998). Additionally, sediment and water samples, transplanted blue mussels and captured large fauna were analysed for accumulated emamectin benzoate and its desmethylamino metabolite to investigate the long term environmental fate of emamectin benzoate. Results from analysis of sediments suggested that limited deposition of emamectin benzoate took place during and up to I week post-treatment, and may have continued up to 4 months of post-treatment. This was consistent with the release of the active ingredient from fish excretion and defecation after treatment. Quantifiable amounts of emamectin benzoate were found 10 in from the cages 12 months after treatment. However, clear reduction in overall sediment concentrations indicated that the deposited emamectin was degrading over time. Emamectin benzoate was not detected in water samples during the field trial. Quantifiable concentrations of emamectin benzoate were found in blue mussels deployed up to 100 in from the treatment cages at 1 week post treatment, but found only at 10 in from the cages at I month post-treatment. This suggests that while mussels were actively accumulating emamectin benzoate immediately after treatment by 1 month this had largely been depurated. Macrobenthic faunal analysis indicated that there was no evidence that the occurrence of emamectin benzoate, or its desmethylamino metabolite, in sediments around fish farm cages after treatment had any toxic impacts on organisms in either water column or sediments.

Variation in Serripes groenlandicus (Bivalvia) growth in a Norwegian high-Arctic fjord: evidence for local- and large-scale climatic forcing	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												We examined the growth rate of the circumpolar Greenland Cockle (Serripes groenlandicus) over a period of 20 years (1983-2002) from Rijpfjord, a high-Arctic fjord in northeast Svalbard (80 degrees 10 ' N, 22 degrees 15 ' E). This period encompassed different phases of large-scale climatic oscillations with accompanying variations in local physical variables (temperature, atmospheric pressure, precipitation, sea ice cover), allowing us to analyze the linkage between growth rate, climatic oscillations, and their local physical and biological manifestations. Standard growth index (SGI), an ontogenetically adjusted measure of annual growth, ranged from a low of 0.27 in 2002 up to 2.46 in 1996. Interannual variation in growth corresponded to the Arctic climate regime index (ACRI), with high growth rates during the positive ACRI phase characterized by cyclonic ocean circulation and a warmer and wetter climate. Growth rates were influenced by local manifestations of the ACRI: positively correlated with precipitation and to a lesser extent negatively correlated with atmospheric pressure. A multiple regression model explains 65% of the variability in growth rate by the ACRI and precipitation at the nearest meteorological station. There were, however, complexities in the relationship between growth and physical variables, including an apparent 1 year lag between physical forcing changes and biological response. Also, when the last 4 years of poor growth are excluded, there is a very strong negative correlation with ice cover on a pan-arctic scale. Our results suggest that bivalves, as sentinels of climate change on multi-decadal scales, are sensitive to environmental variations associated with large-scale changes in climate, but that the effects will be determined by changes in environmental parameters regulating marine production and food availability on a local scale.

Coherent assembly of phytoplankton communities in diverse temperate ocean ecosystems	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												The annual cycle of phytoplankton cell abundance is coherent across diverse ecosystems in the temperate North Atlantic Ocean. In Bedford Basin, on the Scotian Shelf and in the Labrador Sea, the numerical abundance of phytoplankton is low in spring and high in autumn, thus in phase with the temperature cycle. Temperature aligns abundance on a common basis, effectively adjusting apparent cell discrepancies in waters that are colder or warmer than the regional norm. As an example of holistic simplicity arising from underlying complexity, the variance in a community variable (total abundance) is explained by a single predictor (temperature) to the extent of 75% in the marginal seas. In the estuarine basin, weekly averages of phytoplankton and temperature computed from a 13 year time-series yield a predictive relationship with 91% explained variance. Temperature-directed assembly of individual phytoplankton cells to form communities is statistically robust, consistent with observed biomass changes, amenable to theoretical analysis, and a sentinel for long-term change. Since cell abundance is a community property in the same units for all marine microbes at any trophic level and at any phylogenetic position, it promises to integrate biological oceanography into general ecology and evolution.																	0962-8452	1471-2954				AUG 7	2006	273	1596					1953	1960		10.1098/rspb.2006.3529								WOS:000239240800015	16822757

Salmonella spp., Vibrio spp., Clostridium perfringens, and Plesiomonas shigelloides in marine and freshwater invertebrates from coastal California ecosystems	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The coastal ecosystems of California are highly utilized by humans and animals, but the ecology of fecal bacteria at the land-sea interface is not well understood. This study evaluated the distribution of potentially pathogenic bacteria in invertebrates from linked marine, estuarine, and freshwater ecosystems in central California. A variety of filter-feeding clams, mussels, worms, and crab tissues were selectively cultured for Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli-O157, Clostridium perfringens, Plesiomonas shigelloides, and Vibrio spp. A longitudinal study assessed environmental risk factors for detecting these bacterial species in sentinel mussel batches. Putative risk factors included mussel collection near higher risk areas for livestock or human sewage exposure, adjacent human population density, season, recent precipitation, water temperature, water type, bivalve type, and freshwater outflow exposure. Bacteria detected in invertebrates included Salmonella spp., C. perfringens, P. shigelloides, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Vibrio alginolyticus. Overall, 80 % of mussel batches were culture positive for at least one of the bacterial species, although the pathogens Campylobacter, E. coli-O157, and Salmonella were not detected. Many of the same bacterial species were also cultured from upstream estuarine and riverine invertebrates. Exposure to human sewage sources, recent precipitation, and water temperature were significant risk factors for bacterial detection in sentinel mussel batches. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that filter-feeding invertebrates along the coast concentrate fecal bacteria flowing from land to sea and show that the relationships between anthropogenic effects on coastal ecosystems and the environmental niches of fecal bacteria are complex and dynamic.

Endocrine disruptors in marine organisms: Approaches and perspectives	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY												Organic pollutants exhibiting endocrine disrupting activity (Endocrine Disruptors-EDs) are prevalent over a wide range in the aquatic ecosystems; most EDs are resistant to environmental degradation and are considered ubiquitous contaminants. The actual potency of EDs is low compared to that of natural hormones, but environmental concentrations may still be sufficiently high to produce detrimental biological effects. Most information on the biological effects and mechanisms of action of EDs has been focused on vertebrates. Here we summarize recent progress in studies on selected aspects of endocrine disruption in marine organisms that are still poorly understood and that certainly deserve further research in the near future. This review, divided in four sections, focuses mainly on invertebrates (effects of EDs and mechanisms of action) and presents data on top predators (large pelagic fish and cetaceans), a group of vertebrates that are particularly at risk due to their position in the food chain. The first section deals with basic pathways of steroid biosynthesis and metabolism as a target for endocrine disruption in invertebrates. In the second section, data on the effects and alternative mechanisms of action of estrogenic compounds in mussel immunocytes are presented, addressing to the importance of investigating full range responses to estrogenic chemicals in ecologically relevant invertebrate species. In the third section we review the potential use of vitellogenin (Vtg)-like proteins as a biomarker of endocrine disruption in marine bivalve molluscs, used worldwide as sentinels in marine biomonitoring programmes. Finally, we summarize the results of a recent survey on ED accumulation and effects on marine fish and mammals, utilizing both classical biomarkers of endocrine disruption in vertebrates and non-lethal techniques, such as non-destructive biomarkers, indicating the toxicological risk for top predator species in the Mediterranean. Overall, the reviewed data underline the potential to identify specific types of responses to specific groups of chemicals such as EDs in order to develop suitable biomarkers that could be useful as diagnostic tools for endocrine disruption in marine invertebrates and vertebrates.

At certain sites in the North and Irish Seas, the prevalence of macroscopic liver tumors can exceed 10%. The plasma proteome of these fish potentially contains reporter proteins or "biomarkers" that may enable development of diagnostic tests for liver cancer and further our understanding of the disease. Following selection of sample groups by quality-assured histopathology ("phenotype anchoring"), we used surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) time-of-flight mass spectrometry to produce proteomic profiles of plasma from 213 dab collected during the 2004 UK NMMP. The resulting protein profiles were compared between fish from the North and Irish Seas and between fish with liver neoplasia or nondiseased liver. Significant differences were found between the plasma proteomes of dab from the North Sea and Irish Sea, which in conjunction with artificial neural networks can correctly determine from which sea dab were captured in 85% of the cases. In addition, the presence of liver tumors is associated with significant changes in the plasma proteome. We conclude that SELDI-based plasma profiling is potentially of use in nonlethal marine monitoring using wild sentinels such as dab. Furthermore, accurate selection of sample groups is critical for avoiding effects of confounding factors such as age, gender, and geographic origin of samples.

This approach was used to evaluate the protein profile of crabs exposed to various pollutants. Two different exposure experiments were performed: spider crabs (Hyas araneus) were exposed for 3 weeks to diallyl phatalate (DAP), bisphenol A (BisA) and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE-47), while shore crabs (Carcinus maeanas) were exposed to crude oil, crude oil spiked with alkylphenols (APs) and 4-nonylphenol (NP). Gender and species-related protein pattern alterations were observed and compared to controls. Results showed different responses to pollutants by the two species. Major disruption in protein peak expression was observed in samples exposed to mixtures of pollutants, i.e. oil spiked with APs. Compared to shore crab, spider crab species showed a lower degree of response in terms of number of altered protein peaks following exposure. In general, female individuals of both species showed a larger number of significantly altered proteins compared to males. Data analysis by non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) was performed. Bi-dimesional-MDS plots revealed a good separation of groups for both spider and shore crabs. In some cases, a good discrimination can also be observed between the two genders within each treatment. Results highlight the potential of crabs as sentinel organisms for the aquatic environment. The results indicate that SELDI-ToF technology is a powerful tool to discover protein expression signatures for different pollutants and sex dependent responses. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Within this framework, common mesocosm exposures of organic pollutants relevant for marine ecosystems were conducted in the facilities of Akvamiljo a/s (Stavanger, Norway). In the first experiment, Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), turbot (Scohthalmus maximus) and shore crab (Carcinus maenas) were exposed to nonylphenol, North Sea crude oil and a combination of crude oil and alkylated phenols. Mussels (Mytilus edulis) were exposed to North Sea crude oil and a combination of crude oil. alkylated phenols and PAHs. In the second experiment, Atlantic cod, turbot, mussel and spider crab (Hyas araneus) were exposed to the plasticizers bisphenol A and diallyl phatalate and the brominated flame retardant BDE-47. The main purpose of the present study was to provide the 30 participating Institutes with samples which had been exposed to defined contaminant concentrations in a controlled laboratory exposure for 3 weeks.

Biological monitoring of polyfluoroalkyl substances: A review	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFSs) are used in industrial and commercial products and can degrade to persistent perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs) and perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs). Temporal trend studies using human, fish, bird, and marine mammal samples indicate that exposure to PFSs has increased significantly over the past 15-25 years. This review summarizes the biological monitoring of PFCAs, PFSAs, and related PFSs in wildlife and humans, compares concentrations and contamination profiles among species and locations, evaluates the bioaccumulation/biomagnification in the environment, discusses possible sources, and identifies knowledge gaps. PFSs can reach elevated concentrations in humans and wildlife inhabiting industrialized areas of North America, Europe, and Asia (2-30000 ng/mL or ng/g of wet weight (ww)). PFSs have also been detected in organisms from the Arctic and mid-ocean islands (<= 3000 ng/g ww). In humans, PFSAs and PFCAs have been shown to vary among ethnic groups and PFCA/PFSA profiles differ from those in wildlife with high proportions of perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate. The pattern of contamination in wildlife varied among species and locations suggesting multiple emission sources. Food web analyses have shown that PFCAs and PFSAs can bioaccumulate and biomagnify in marine and freshwater ecosystems. Knowledge gaps with respect to the transport, accumulation, biodegradation, temporal/spatial trends and PFS precursors have been identified. Continuous monitoring with key sentinel species and standardization of analytical methods are recommended.

In order to assess the impact of highly persistent pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), polychlorinated dibenzo-dioxins (PCDD), polychlorinated dibenzo-furans (PCDF), polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), tributyltin (TBT) and other toxic metals on the marine ecosystem a suite of biomarkers are being extensively used worldwide. Among the various types of biomarkers, the following have received special attention: cytochrome P4501A induction, DNA integrity, acetylcholinesterase activity and metallothionein induction. These biomarkers are being used to evaluate exposure of various species of sentinel marine organisms (e.g. mussels, clams, oysters, snails, fishes, etc.) to and the effect of various contaminants (organic xenobiotics and metals) using different molecular approaches [biochemical assays, enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assays (ELISA), spectrophotometric, fluorometric measurement, differential pulsed polarography, liquid chromatography, atomic absorption spectrometry]. The induction of the biotransformation enzyme, cytochrome P4501A in fishes (Callionymus lyra, Limanda limanda, Serranus sp., Mullus barbatus) and mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) by various xenobiotic contaminants such as PCBs, PAHs, PCDs is used as a biomarker of exposure to such organic pollutants. The induction of cytochrome P4501A is involved in chemical carcinogenesis through catalysis of the covalent bonding of organic contaminants to a DNA strand leading to formation of DNA adduct. Measurement of the induction of cytochrome P4501A in terms of EROD (7-ethoxy resorufin O-deethylase) activity is successfully used as a potential biomarker of exposure to xenobiotic contaminants in marine pollution monitoring. In order to assess the impact of neurotoxic compounds on marine environment the evaluation of acetylcholinesterase activity in marine organisms is used as a biomarker of exposure to neurotoxic agents such as organophosphorus, carbamate pesticides etc. Metallothioneins (MTs) are induced by toxic metals such as Cd, Hg, and Cu by chelation through cysteine residues and are used in both vertebrates and invertebrates as a biomarker of metal exposure. The measurement of the levels of DNA integrity in marine organisms such as Sea stars (Asterias rubens) from the North Sea and the marine snails (Planaxis sulcatus) from the Arabian Sea along the Goa coast exposed to environmental xenobiotic contaminants clearly indicated the extent and the nature of pollution at the sampling sites along coastal environment.

Gender and species differences in sentinel crabs (Macrophthalmus) feeding on an Indonesian mudflat	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY												This study investigates the influence of gender on feeding and habitat niches in the ocypodid sentinel crabs Macrophthalmus convexus and M. definitus feeding on a mudflat in the Wakatobi Marine National Park, Indonesia. Male M. convexus possess sub-equal chelae that are considerably larger than those of females and of those of both genders of M. definitus. Habitat location, food (Chl a) biomass index in microalgae and seagrass mats on muddy sediments, faecal material, and feeding rates were analysed in females and males of both species throughout the lunar cycle in July and August 2002. Food biomass content was significantly higher in the upper than in the lower mudflat (P = 0.008). The particle size of faecal material did not vary between species or between genders of M. definitus. but the faeces contained larger particles in males of M. convexus compared with females and both gender of M. definitus. Macrophthalmus convexus predominantly inhabited pools on the upper and mid mudflats, whereas M. definitus was found in muddy sea-grass substrates on the mid and lower mudflats. Crabs were observed to emerge for feeding only on ebb tide during daylight. Macrophthalmus convexus showed significantly higher scoop rates than M. definitus (P < 0.05) during full and new moon. Feeding rates in male M. convexus were also significantly lower than of females (P < 0.001) throughout the lunar cycle. In contrast, feeding motions in M. definitus were generally variable and not gender-specific. However, males showed significantly reduced scoop rates in this species on the lower mudflat during the first quarter moon (P < 0.001). Scoop rate is not the only process affecting potential ingestion rate, however, in that several 'pinches' of sediment may be made by the chela before it is lifted towards the mouthparts.

Damage can be assessed using biomarkers, such as the degree of genotoxic impact following in vivo exposure to contaminants. Genotoxic damage, expressed as single- strand DNA breaks, was measured in cells isolated from haemolymph/ blood, gill and digestive gland/ liver from the clam Tapes semidecussatus and turbot Scophthalmus maximus, using the single cell gel electrophoresis ( Comet Assay). Both animals were exposed for three weeks to sediment samples collected from a polluted site and a ` clean' reference site. The level of DNA damage was assessed using an image analysis package and expressed as % tail DNA. Throughout the study, significant differences in DNA damage were recorded for each tissue type, in both species, between animals exposed to the two sediment samples. However, turbot appeared to be a more sensitive indicator species, because, due to lower background levels, they were able to detect a significant difference between reference site and background values. This suggests that turbot, rather than clams, are more suitable as a sentinel species for the assessment of genotoxic impact of low- level contamination in aquatic sediments and highlights the need for a two- or multi- species approach.

J	Ortiz-Zarragoitia, M; Cajaraville, MP				Ortiz-Zarragoitia, M; Cajaraville, MP			Biomarkers of exposure and reproduction-related effects in mussels exposed to endocrine disruptors	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Biomarkers are useful tools to study the health of estuarine and marine ecosystems. Biomarkers can be measured in different organisms, but mussels have acquired a global importance as sentinels in marine pollution-monitoring programs. In the present work, we aimed to determine the effects of different endocrine disruptors in mussels by using peroxisome proliferation as a biomarker of exposure to organic pollutants and the levels of vitellogenin (Vtg)-like proteins as biomarker of endocrine disruption. In experiment 1, mussels Mytilus edulis were exposed for 3 weeks to North Sea crude oil (NSO 0.5 ppm) and a mixture of 0.5 ppm NSO, 0.1 ppm alkylphenol mix, and 0.1 ppm extra polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (MIX). In experiment 2, mussels were exposed for 3 weeks to diallylphthalate (DAP 50 ppb), bisphenol-A (BPA 50 ppb), and tetrabromodiphenylether (TBDE 5 ppb). Peroxisome proliferation was assessed by measuring acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX) activity and peroxisomal volume density (V-Vp) in digestive gland. Vtg-like protein levels were measured in gonads by the alkali-labile phosphate (ALP) method. Gonad was also analyzed histologically, and the gonad index (GI) calculated. Mussels exposed to NSO and MIX showed significantly increased AOX activities and V-VP compared with control animals. Significantly higher V-VP was also found in DAP- and TBDE-exposed mussels. Effects on ALP and GI depended significantly on sex and time of year. In female mussels, ALP levels and GI were lower in the NSO group. In male mussels, ALP levels were significantly increased in the MIX group. The volume density of athretic oocytes was higher in the NSO and MIX exposure groups than in controls, and gonad resorption was observed in the BPA exposure group. Our results confirm the usefulness of peroxisome proliferation as a biomarker of exposure to organic contaminants in mussels and indicate that changes in Vtg-like proteins could be used as potential indicator of pollutant effects on mussel reproduction.

Following electroacoustic and magnetometric surveys of the CWA dumping area, an integrated ecotoxicological approach was used. This approach was based on analysis of CWA residues and their metabolites, including arsenic, in sediment and organisms, as well as multimarker methodology including the Health Assessment Index, histological lesion analysis and enzyme assays. Two sentinel species were selected, the blackbelly rosefish [Helicolenus dactylopterus (Delaroche, 1809)] and the European conger ( Conger conger L., 1758). Sediment analysis revealed the presence of CWA degradation products, including 1-4-thioxane and 1-4-dithiane. Tissues of fish from the CWA dumping site showed higher levels of arsenic than those from the reference site. Neither CWAs nor their metabolites were detected in fish tissues. Arsenic levels recorded in blackbelly rosefish were well above those reported for other fish species from the southern Adriatic, much higher than the FDA limit for food (2.6 mg kg(-1)) and close to the LD50 calculated for mammals ( 20 mg kg(-1) body weight). The presence of pollutants in the CWA dumping site was also confirmed by pathological lesions in both species and EROD activity, two to three times higher than in fish from the reference site (16.45 +/- 8.08 and 8.05 +/- 5.87 pmol min(-1) mg protein(-1) in blackbelly rosefish and 269 +/- 24.92 and 78.71 pmol min(-1) mg protein(-1) in European conger, respectively). Cholinesterase activity seemed unaffected in muscle of both species, whereas in brain they were one-third of those recorded in fish from the reference site (14.22 +/- 10.05 and 72.87 nmol min(-1) mg protein(-1), respectively). This suggests that acetylcholinesterase is sensitive to CWAs. In conclusion, the agreement of all the chemical and biological parameters investigated suggests that the integrated ecotoxicological approach used is appropriate to reveal the presence and biological effects of CWAs in the marine ecosystem.

The differences in delta C-13 and delta N-15 values observed in organisms from both areas suggest that this benthic invertebrate could be a potential biomonitor for sewage-derived nutrients in coastal seas. Both nitrogen and carbon were enriched in heavy isotopes in organisms collected in Pirovac Bay, as well as in those from the area around the fish farm at Vrgada Island. These point toward an increased input of N-15 and C-13 enriched anthropogenic and/or aquaculture derived nitrogen and carbon into the local marine ecosystem. It is suggested that benthic filter feeders, such as B. perforatus, could be useful sentinels for detecting anthropogenically-derived inputs of nutrients into the coastal marine ecosystems. However, to get a better insight into the transfer rates of anthropogenic C and N into the food web, more extended research on a larger population is needed, as well as a detailed investigation of seasonal variation of abundance and isotopic composition of particulate organic matter as their presumed food source.

CA plays a fundamental role in a number of physiological processes, Such as respiration, ionic transport, acid-base regulation, and calcification. The aim of the present work was to investigate the sensitivity of this enzyme to heavy metals with a view to possible future applications of CA activity inhibition measurement in biomonitoring as either an in vitro bioassay or a biomarker. CA activity was determined by modifying a previously described electrometric method: briefly, CA activity units were calculated from the rate of H+ production in the reaction mixture (where CO2 was present as a substrate) against a blank containing the specific CA inhibitor acetazolamide. As regards the possible application as an in vitro bioassay, the sensitivity to heavy metals (cadmium, mercury, and copper) of the commercially available purified carbonic anhydrase (isozyme II) from bovine erythrocyte was tested in vitro. In Our experimental set-up, bovine CA activity was significantly inhibited by micromolar concentrations of heavy metals, showing a dose-response behaviour. As regards the possible application as biomarkers, CA was investigated in the filter-feeding Mytilus galloprovincialis, widely used in pollution-monitoring programmes as a sentinel organism. Following in vitro and in vivo exposure to 1.785 mu M cadmium chloride as a reference toxicant, mantle CA activity was significant inhibited. In conclusion. the sensitivity to chemical pollutants and low cost and simplicity of the assay method make CA activity measurement suitable for in vitro bioassay of the toxicity of environmental samples and for field biomarker applications in the sentinel organism M. galloprovincialis.				lionetto, maria giulia/H-1356-2011	caricato, roberto/0000-0002-7928-4573; Lionetto, Maria Giulia/0000-0003-3752-0192												0275-7540	1029-0370					2006	22			1			119	125		10.1080/02757540600670661								WOS:000241198700008

Although guidelines indicate limits for several parameters, the real toxicologic impacts remain largely unexplored in field conditions. In this study our aim was to validate an ecotoxicologic approach to evaluate both bioaccumulation and toxicologic effects caused by airborne pollutants. Specimens of the land snail Helix aspersa were caged in five sites in the urban area of Ancona, Italy. After 4 weeks, trace metals (cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, manganese, nickel, lead, and zinc) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH[s) were measured and these data integrated with the analyses of molecular and biochemical responses. Such biomarkers reflected the induction of detoxification pathways or the onset of cellular toxicity caused by pollutants. Biomarkers that correlated with contaminant accumulation included levels of metallothioneins, activity of biotransformation enzymes (ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase, ethoxycoumarin O deethylase), and peroxisomal proliferation. More general responses were investigated as oxidative stress variations, including efficiency of antioxidant defenses (catalase, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferases, glutathione peroxidases, and total glutathione) and total oxy-radical scavenging capacity toward peroxyl and hydroxyl radicals, onset of cellular damages (i.e., lysosomal destabilization), and loss of DNA integrity. Results revealed a marked accumulation of metals and PAHs in digestive tissues of organisms maintained in more traffic-congested sites. The contemporary appearance of several alterations confirmed the cellular reactivity of these chemicals with toxicologic effects of potential concern for human health. The overall results of this exploratory study suggest the utility of H. aspersa as a sentinel organism for biomonitoring the biologic impact of atmospheric pollution in urban areas.

Variation in life-history strategies among conspecific populations indicates the action of local selective pressures; recently, parasitism has been suggested as one of these local forces. 2. Effects of trematode infections on reproductive effort, juvenile growth, size at maturity and susceptibility were investigated among different natural populations of the marine gastropod Zeacumantus subcarinatus, Sowerby 1855. 3. Reproductive effort was not higher in uninfected snails from populations experiencing a high trematode prevalence, but females from high prevalence populations produced significantly larger offspring compared with their conspecifics from other populations. 4. Juvenile growth rate was significantly higher in laboratory-raised snails originating from females in a high prevalence population compared with other populations. 5 Size at maturity, determined by the appearance of functional gonads, was significantly and negatively related to trematode prevalence, and positively related to mean snail size, across 10 populations in the study area. 6. There was no evidence of different host resistance against trematodes in sentinel snails from high and low prevalence populations exposed to the same infection pressure in the field. 7. Our results strongly indicate that Z. subcarinatus adapt to trematodes by reaching maturity early, thereby maximizing their chance of reproducing in populations experiencing a high prevalence of infection by castrating trematodes.

An evaluation of the relative sensitivity of two marine bivalve mollusc species using the Comet assay	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH					13th International Symposium on Pollutant Responses in Marine Organisms (PRIMO 13)	JUN 19-23, 2005	Alessandria, ITALY					The aim of this study was to (a) evaluate the potential for the 'Comet assay' to be used as a method for detecting genetic damage in the common cockle Cerastoderma edule; and (b) to compare the relative sensitivity with Mytilus edulis as the bivalve widely used as a sentinel species in biomonitoring studies. In vitro validation studies were carried out on haemocytes from each species using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a known oxidant and the induced DNA damage was measured using the Comet assay. On exposure to 0, 100, 500 and 1000 mu M H2O2, a significant concentration-dependent increase was observed in both species. Use of an additional concentration of 5000 mu M H2O2 showed that while DNA damage could be assessed in M. edulis at this concentration, only a few cells from C edule were amenable to measurements owing to extensive DNA damage ("hedgehog cells"). The evidence also suggested that the cells from C edule are more sensitive to oxidative damage induced by H2O2 when compared with M. edulis. Bearing in mind that sediments are the ultimate sink for many contaminants, this study demonstrates the potential application of sediment-dwelling C edule as a useful biomonitoring species.

J	Feldstein, T; Nelson, N; Mokady, O				Feldstein, Tamar; Nelson, Nathan; Mokady, Ofer			Cloning and expression of MDR transporters from marine bivalves, and their potential use in biomonitoring	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH					13th International Symposium on Pollutant Responses in Marine Organisms (PRIMO 13)	JUN 19-23, 2005	Alessandria, ITALY					Multidrug resistance transporters (MDRs) are excellent candidates for molecular-level biomonitoring - they function in exporting xenobiotic compounds and their expression is inducible. However, currently available MDR sequence information from aquatic invertebrates is partial and mostly biased towards the conserved ATPase domain. In the present study, two genes belonging to the MDR/TAP (ABCB) family were cloned and characterized from the bivalve Brachidontes pharaonis, which thrives in rocky environments along the Israeli Mediterranean coast. One of these is a complete sequence of a 'half' ABCB, probably belonging to the ABCB10 subfamily, while the second is a 'full' ABCB1 transporter. A quantitative RT-PCR protocol for biomonitoring was tested in laboratory experiments. Bivalves exposed to diesel showed significant increase in B1 expression levels, while the expression of B10 was suppressed. These results suggest that B. pharaonis features an MDR1 homologue that is induced by pollution and may serve as a sentinel organism for routine biomonitoring programs. However, our findings also exemplify that not all MDRs are equally suitable for this purpose and sequence information must be expanded beyond the ATPase domain for correct classification of cloned genes.

J	Cravo, A; Bebianno, MJ				Cravo, A; Bebianno, MJ			Bioaccumulation of metals in the soft tissue of Patella aspera: Application of metal/shell weight indices	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Patella aspera limpets were taken from a marine clean site (MCS) and an estuarine contaminated site (ECS). The concentrations of Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Cd, Ni and Co were determined individually over the available size range. Since there were significant differences in the soft tissue weight between populations, but shell characteristics were similar (length and weight), metal/shell weight indices (MSI) were calculated in order to compare populations. For both populations iron, zinc and manganese/shell weight indices were consistently higher, in the order Fe >> Zn >> Mn than those of Cu, Ni, Co and Cd. The results exhibited a marked intra- and interpopulation variability. The highest intra-variability was observed at ECS, particularly where a strong effect of shell weight upon the metal accumulation in the soft tissue was evident. Due to this effect, the comparison of populations was carried out between three selected shell weight ranges representative of light shells (0.45-1.95 g), intermediate shells (2.95-4.45 g) and heavy shells (5.45-7.33 g). The results indicate that, in general, MSI at ECS (a sewage contaminated site), except for Cd, was higher than at MCS possibly reflecting a higher environmental bioavailability of these metals. The resolution between populations was higher when the smallest range of limpets was considered and it decreased with the increase of shell weight. The highest discrimination amongst populations was found for zinc/shell weight index that showed much higher values than those of Mn, Cu, Cd, Ni and Co/shell weight indices, and spatial differentiation between populations persisted amongst the selected shell weight ranges.

Toxoplasmosis is a major cause of mortality and contributor to the slow rate of population recovery for southern sea otters in California. An updated seroprevalence analysis showed that 52% of 305 freshly dead, beachcast sea otters and 38% of 257 live sea otters sampled along the California coast from 1998 to 2004 were infected with T. gondii. Areas with high T gondii exposure were predominantly sandy bays near urban centres with freshwater runoff. Genotypic characterisation of 15 new T. gondii isolates obtained from otters in 2004 identified only X alleles at B1 and SAG1. A total of 38/50 or 72% of all otter isolates so far examined have been infected with a Type X strain. Type X isolates were also obtained from a Pacific harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) and California sea lion (Zalophus californianus). Molecular analysis using the C8 RAPD marker showed that the X isolates were more genetically heterogeneous than archetypal Type I, II and III genotypes of T gondii. The origin and transmission of the Type X T gondii genotype are not yet clear. Sea otters do not prey on known intermediate hosts for T gondii and vertical transmission appears to play a minor role in maintaining infection in the populations. Therefore, the most likely source of infection is by infectious, environmentally resistant oocysts that are shed in the feces of felids and transported via freshwater runoff into the marine ecosystem. As nearshore predators, otters serve as sentinels of protozoal pathogen flow into the marine environment since they share the same environment and consume some of the same foods as humans. Investigation into the processes promoting T gondii infections in sea otters will provide a better understanding of terrestrial parasite flow and the emergence of disease at the interface between wildlife, domestic animals and humans.

In a previous study, 138 of 141 (97.8%) bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from the coasts of Florida and California had antibodies to T gondii by the modified agglutination test (MAT). Although the MAT has been found to be highly sensitive and specific for T. gondii antibodies from several species of terrestrial animals, it has not yet been validated for T. gondii infections in marine mammals. Furthermore, T. gondii has yet not been isolated from dolphins. In the present study, sera from 146 (60 from the 2004 samples and 86 from the 2003 samples) T truncatus from the coastal areas of South Carolina and Florida were tested for antibodies to T. gondii. Sera from 2004 were tested by the MAT, the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), the Sabin-Feldman dye test (DT), an indirect henagglutination test (IHAT), an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and Western blot. All 60 dolphins were seropositive, with MAT titers of 1:20 in 3, 1:40 in 19, 1:80 in 29, 1:160 in 2, 1:1,280 in 3, 1:2,560 in 2, and 1:5,120 or higher in 2, and these results were confirmed in another laboratory. The DT titers of these dolphins were < 1: 10 in 53, 1:800 in 3, 1:1,600 in 2, and 1:3,200 in 2. The IHAT titers were <1:64 in 52, 1:128 in 1, 1:512 in 2, and 1:2,048 in 5. The IFAT titers were <1:20 in 3, 1:20 in 11, 1:40 in 36, 1:80 in 2, 1:160 in 1, and 1:320 or higher in 7. All 7 DT-positive dolphins had high MAT titers, but 2 were negative by the IHAT. Western blot results closely followed MAT results; ELISA results matched MAT results, which were 1:40 or higher. In sera from the 2003 samples, MAT antibodies were found in 86 of 86 dolphins with titers of 1:25 in 29, 1:50 in 23, 1:100 in 27, 1:200 in 3, 1:1,600 in 1, and 1:3,200 in 3; these sera were not tested by other means. Overall, MAT antibodies were found in all 146 dolphin sera tested. Because marine mammals are considered sentinel animals indicative of contamination of the coastal and marine waters by T. gondii oocysts, serologically positive infections need to be validated by the detection of T. gondii organisms in the tissues of seropositive animals.

Different biological features such as the variability of the local assemblages, population density, species diversity, age population structure and polymorphism, coupled with the favourable results of recently developed bioassays, suggest that these microorganisms may be included between the most promising sentinel groups in both brackish and marine areas. In meiofaunal studies, these microcrustaceans show high sensitivity to heavy-metal pollution, oil discharges and anoxic conditions. In specific investigations based on surveys of recent populations or stratigraphic box-core analysis, both ostracod densities and species diversities decrease remarkably near sources of pollution after a period of pollutant discharge, with a lesser impact in distant or protected areas. Strong heavy metal pollution or frequent oil spills may cause the disappearance of these organisms or a strong reduction in the number of individuals in a relatively short time period, whereas total or partially untreated urban wastes or agricultural discharges causing eutrophication effects lead to the dominance of distinctive species that are adapted to hypoxic conditions. The environmental improvement derived from the recent implementation of legal regulations in some countries has also been documented in the changes in ostracod assemblages back to pre-disturbed conditions. In addition to population and community changes, morphological and geochemical changes can also be detected in the ostracod carapace, which serves as a tracer of the water quality during the moulting processes.

Haemolymph samples from 4680 mussels (Mytilus spp.) were tested for Cryptosporidium genotypes using PCR amplification and DNA sequence analysis. Our hypotheses were that mussels collected from sites near livestock runoff or human sewage outflow would be more likely to contain the faecal pathogen Cryptosporidium than mussels collected distant to these sites, and that the prevalence would be greatest during the wet season when runoff into the nearshore marine environment was highest. To test these hypotheses, 156 batches of sentinel mussels were collected quarterly at nearshore marine sites considered at higher risk for exposure to livestock runoff, higher risk for exposure to human sewage, or lower risk for exposure to both faecal sources. Cryptosporidium genotypes detected in Haemolymph samples from individual mussels included Cryptosporidium parvum, Cryptosporidium felis, Ctyptosporidium andersoni, and two novel Cryptosporidium spp. Factors significantly associated with detection of Cryptosporidium spp. in mussel batches were exposure to freshwater outflow and mussel collection within a week following a precipitation event. Detection of Cryptosporidium spp. was not associated with higher or lower risk status for exposure to livestock faeces or human sewage sources. This study showed that mussels can be used to monitor water quality in California and suggests that humans and animals ingesting faceal-contaminated water and shellfish may be exposed to both host-specific and anthropozoonotic Cryptosporidium genotypes of public health significance.

The National Marine Monitoring Programme (NMMP) provides information to the U. K. Government on the health status of marine fish stocks. An aspect of this work relates to the presence of tumors and other pathologies in the liver of the offshore sentinel flatfish species, dab (Limanda limanda). Using internationally agreed quality assurance criteria, tumors and pre-tumors are diagnosed using histopathology. The current study has expanded upon this work by integrating these traditional diagnostic approaches with ones utilizing modern technologies for analysis of proteomic and metabolomic profiles of selected lesions. We have applied SELDI and FT-ICR technologies (for proteomic and metabolomic analyses, respectively) to tumor and non-tumor samples resected from the liver of dab. This combined approach has demonstrated how these technologies are able to identify protein and metabolite profiles that are specific to liver tumors. Using histopathology to classify "analysis groups" is key to the success of such an approach since it allows for elimination of spurious samples (e.g., those containing parasite infections) that may confuse interpretation of "omic" data. As such, the pathology laboratory plays a central role in collating information relating to particular specimens and in establishing sampling groups relative to specific diagnostic questions. In this study, we present pilot data, which illustrates that proteomics and metabolomics can be used to discriminate fish liver tumors and suggest future directions for work of this type.

The samples were analyzed for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) by high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC-HRMS) to elucidate bioaccumulation of persistent organic pollutants in benthon. Residue levels of Sigma PCBs and Sigma PCDD/Fs were in the ranges of 66.1 to 583.6 ng/g and 0.9 to 15317 pg/g on a lipid-weight basis, respectively, The pollution source was identified using principal component analysis (PCA) in some coastal areas. It indicated that the typical pollution sources were characterized by PCB3, which was one Chinese technical product of PCBs. PCA also revealed the similarity patterns of PCBs between identical species collected from the different sites. The higher gastropod PCB concentrations were related to a former capacitor factory and the paint factories in some coastal areas, but this was not the case with the bivalves. The results of this study suggest that some gastropod species may be a potential bioindicator or "sentinel" organism for marine PCBs monitoring.																	0090-4341					AUG	2005	49	2					178	185		10.1007/s00244-004-0130-0								WOS:000231938400006	16001155					
J	Hedgecock, D; Gaffney, PM; Goulletquer, P; Guo, XM; Reece, K; Warr, GW				Hedgecock, D; Gaffney, PM; Goulletquer, P; Guo, XM; Reece, K; Warr, GW			The case for sequencing the Pacific oyster genome	JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH												An international community of biologists presents the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas as a candidate for genome sequencing. This oyster has global distribution and for the past several years the highest annual production of any freshwater or marine organism (4.2 million metric tons, worth $3.5 billion US). Economic and cultural importance of oysters motivates a great deal of biologic research, which provides a compelling rationale for sequencing an oyster genome. Strong rationales for sequencing the oyster genome also come from contrasts to other genomes: membership in the Lophotrochozoa, an understudied branch of the Eukaryotes and high fecundity, with concomitantly high DNA sequence polymorphism and a population biology that is more like plants than any of the model animals whose genomes have been sequenced to date. Finally, oysters play an important, sentinel role in the estuarine and coastal marine habitats, where most humans live, environmental degradation is substantial, and oysters suffer intense fishing pressures and natural mortalities from disease and stress. Consumption of contaminated oysters can pose risks to human health from infectious diseases. The genome of the Pacific oyster, at IC = 0.89 pg or similar to 824 Mb, ranks in the bottom 12% of genome sizes for the Phylum Mollusca. The biologic and genomic resources available for the Pacific oyster are unparalleled by resources for any other bivalve mollusc or marine invertebrate. Inbred lines have been developed for experimental crosses and genetics research. Use of DNA from inbred lines is proposed as a strategy for reducing the high nucleotide polymorphism, which can interfere with shotgun sequencing approaches. We have moderately dense linkage maps and various genomic and expressed DNA libraries. The value of these existing resources for a broad range of evolutionary and environmental sciences will be greatly leveraged by having a draft genome sequence.

A bunker oil spill occurred in the harbor in July 2003, thereby further exasperating the situation for marine life. Eelpout, Zoarces viviparus, was used as a sentinel species to monitor the impact of these events. Here, we have investigated the effects on two liver parameters, lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation, which can serve as biomarkers for oxidative stress. Lipid peroxidation data, measured as TBARS, in eelpout from the field study showed no significant differences between reference and polluted sites, at any of the time points. These results are mirrored in a laboratory exposure to the bunker oil where no differences were seer. between the control and the exposure groups. A trend towards a seasonal cycle in TBARS levels in eelpout liver was observed, with highest amounts measured during the warmer months, 97.08 +/- 14.45 nmol/g liver in the harbor in July compared to 41.20 +/- 2.66 mnol/g liver in November 2001. Protein carbonylation, measured using an ELISA method, did, however, show differences between the reference and polluted sites in the field, as well as differences between time periods (before and during dredging and following the oil spill). The laboratory exposure indicated that the formation and/or accumulation of protein carbonyls is greatly affected by exposure to this PAH rich oil. Levels in the control group were 1.76 +/- 0.13 nmol/mg protein while those fish exposed to the high dose had 6.23 +/- 0.17 nmol/mg protein. We concluded that TBARS is not an appropriate biomarker for pollutant mediated oxidative damage in eelpout while protein carbonyl formation does appear to be affected by xenobiotic exposure.

Organisms from Terra Nova Bay also are exposed to a natural enrichment of cadmium, but to our knowledge, whether such environmental conditions influence biological responses to anthropogenic pollutants has never been considered. In the present study, the Antarctic rock cod (Trematomus bernacchii) was exposed to model chemicals, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (benzo[a]pyrene), persistent organic pollutants (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin [TCDD]), cadmium, and a combination of cadmium and TCDD. Analyzed parameters included chemical bioaccumulation, activity, and levels of biotransformation enzymes (cytochrome P4501A); metallothioneins and the efficiency of the antioxidant system measured as individual defenses (catalase, glutathione, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferases, and glutathione peroxidases); and total scavenging capacity toward peroxyl and hydroxyl radicals. Reciprocal interactions between metabolism of inorganic and organic pollutants were demonstrated. Dioxin enhanced the accumulation of cadmium, probably stored within proliferating endoplasmic reticulum, and cadmium suppressed the inducibility of cytochrome P4501A, allowing us to hypothesize a posttranscriptional mechanism as the depletion of heme group availability. Clear evidence of oxidative perturbation was provided by the inhibition of antioxidants and enhanced sensitivity to oxyradical toxicity in fish exposed to organic chemicals. Exposure to cadmium revealed counteracting responses of glutathione metabolism; however, these responses did not prevent a certain loss of antioxidant capacity toward peroxyl radicals. The pattern of antioxidant responses exhibited by fish coexposed to cadmium and TCDD was more similar to that observed for cadmium than to that observed for TCDD. The overall results suggest that elevated natural levels of cadmium in Antarctic organisms from Terra Nova Bay can limit biotransformation capability of polycyclic (halogenated) hydrocarbons, thus influencing the bioaccumulation and biological effects of these chemicals in key sentinel species.

Questions concerning the pace and impacts of climate change are thus central to many ecological and biogeochemical studies, and addressing the consequences of climate change is now high on the list of priorities for funding agencies. Here, we review the interactions between climate change and plankton communities, focusing on systematic changes in plankton community structure, abundance, distribution and phenology over recent decades. We examine the potential socioeconomic impacts of these plankton changes, such as the effects of bottom-up forcing on commercially exploited fish stocks (i.e. plankton as food for fish). We also consider the crucial roles that plankton might have in dictating the future pace of climate change via feedback mechanisms responding to elevated atmospheric CO2 levels. An important message emerges from this review: ongoing plankton monitoring programmes worldwide will act as sentinels to identify future changes in marine ecosystems.

The harbor seal population of the San Francisco Bay (SFB), California, has suffered habitat loss and degradation, including decades of environmental contamination. To explore the possibility of contaminant-induced health alterations in this population, blood levels of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were quantified in free-ranging seals; relationships between contaminant exposure and several key hematological parameters were examined; and PCB levels in the present study were compared with levels determined in SFB seals a decade earlier. PCB residues in harbor seal blood decreased during the past decade, but remained at levels great enough that adverse reproductive and immunological effects might be expected. Main results included a positive association between leukocyte counts and PBDEs, PCBs, and DDE in seals, and an inverse relationship between red blood cell count and PBDEs. Although not necessarily pathologic, these responses may serve as sentinel indications of contaminant-induced alterations in harbor seals of SFB, which, in individuals with relatively high contaminant burdens, might include increased rates of infection and anemia.																	1528-7394					APR 23	2005	68	8					617	633		10.1080/15287390590921748								WOS:000228621400002	15901091					
J	Toth, E; Duffy, JE				Toth, E; Duffy, JE			Coordinated group response to nest intruders in social shrimp	BIOLOGY LETTERS												A key characteristic of highly social animals is collective group response to important stimuli such as invasion by enemies. The marine societies of social snapping shrimp share many convergences with terrestrial eusocial animals, including aggressive reaction to strangers, but no group actions have yet been observed in shrimp. Here we describe 'coordinated snapping', during which a sentinel shrimp reacts to danger by recruiting other colony members to snap in concert for several to tens of seconds. This distinctive behaviour is a specific response to intrusion by strange shrimp into the colony's sponge and is highly successful at repelling these intruders. Although coordinated snapping apparently functions analogously to alarm responses in other social animals, colony members in social shrimp do not rush to the site of the attack. Coordinated snapping appears instead to be a warning signal to would-be intruders that the sponge is occupied by a cooperative colony ready to defend it. This is the first evidence for coordinated communication in social shrimp and represents yet another remarkable convergence between social shrimp, insects and vertebrates.																	1744-9561					MAR	2005	1	1					49	52		10.1098/rsbl.2004.0237								WOS:000232135300013	17148125

Specimens presenting the condition were collected from the North Dogger Bank in the North Sea during the United Kingdom National Marine Monitoring Programme in 2003. Two of the individuals collected (14.3 % of the males sampled) presented externally as males but upon histological examination were seen to contain both male and female gonadal tissues. Previtellogenic oocytes were suspended within a matrix of spermatogonia and spermatocytes. One of the specimens also presented dilated testicular follicles filled with masses of mature spermatozoa. The significance of this finding in the United Kingdom's sentinel offshore monitoring species is discussed with relation to potential offshore effects of exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs).

Ecological, physiological, biochemical and environmental chemistry data were collected in separate projects. When the National Marine Monitoring Programme was revised in 1992, a new strategy was introduced for assessments of long-term trends in coastal fish communities. Annual integrated monitoring of contaminants, biomarkers and population and community indicators of ecosystem health was started in selected areas using common sentinel species. Data from one monitoring area at the coast of the Baltic proper are analyzed in this paper. The results have shown a shift in fish community structure indicating changes in ecosystem productivity. Trends have been detected in growth rate (positive) and relative gonad size (negative) in perch (Perca fluviatilis), suggesting a metabolic disturbance according to the predictive response model developed for interpretations. One factor which may have contributed to the reduced GSI was a decrease in mean age of sampled fish during the period of study. Chemical exposure was indicated by a 3-fold increase of EROD activity during the monitored 15-year period. However, concentrations of most measured contaminants in perch have decreased during the same period. The experience of the integrated approach has shown that a tentative analysis of cause and environmental significance could be made, improving the assessment, but there still remain unsolved questions to be answered in follow-up studies. The analysis has also shown the importance of long-term monitoring at several levels of biological organization to distinguish between natural variation and low-level effects on ecosystems.																	1201-3080						2005	40	3					233	250										WOS:000233644500002

During the ice-free season (May to November) of 2002, 4123 adult mummichogs (>30 mm TL) were captured, by beach seine and minnow trap, biweekly from four sites within the estuary. Fish were marked intramuscularly using Visible Implant Elastomer (Northwest Marine Technologies, Inc., Shaw Island, Wash., U.S.). Recaptures were made at the marking sites and elsewhere during this period and again during the ice-free season of April to November 2003. A total of 639 (15.5% of those marked) mummichogs were recaptured with 617 (96.6%) found within 200 m of the point of initial release. Twenty-nine of the 617 were recaptured 2 or 3 times at sites of original marking. The remaining 22 recaptured fish moved distances ranging from 600 to 3600 m up- and downstream of initial marking sites. Eighty-two percent of recaptures were made within 12 weeks of the start Of marking with the remainder recovered up to 72 weeks later. These findings are consistent with results from studies of mummichog movement in smaller water bodies and other parts of the species' range. With regard to mobility, these results add to the growing body of literature supporting the usefulness of mummichogs as a sentinel species in environmental monitoring programs for point-source impacts in Atlantic Canadian estuaries.																	1201-3080						2005	40	3					288	298										WOS:000233644500006

J	Moore, MN; Depledge, MH; Readman, JW; Leonard, DRP				Moore, MN; Depledge, MH; Readman, JW; Leonard, DRP			An integrated biomarker-based strategy for ecotoxicological evaluation of risk in environmental management	MUTATION RESEARCH-FUNDAMENTAL AND MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF MUTAGENESIS												Environmental impacts by both natural events and man-made interventions are a fact of life; and developing the capacity to minimise these impacts and their harmful consequences for biological resources, ecosystems and human health is a daunting task for environmental legislators and regulators. A major challenge in impact and risk assessment, as part of integrated environmental management (IEM), is to link harmful effects of pollution (including toxic chemicals) in individual sentinel animals to their ecological consequences. This obstacle has resulted in a knowledge-gap for those seeking to develop effective policies for sustainable use of resources and environmental protection. Part of the solution to this problem may lie with the use of diagnostic clinical-type laboratory-based ecotoxicological tests or biomarkers, utilising sentinel animals as integrators of pollution, coupled with direct immunochemical tests for contaminants. These rapid and cost-effective ecotoxicological tools can provide information on the health status of individuals and populations based on relatively small samples of individuals. In the context of ecosystem status or health of the environment, biomarkers are also being used to link processes of molecular and cellular damage through to higher levels (i.e., prognostic capability), where they can result in pathology with reduced physiological performance and reproductive success. Complex issues are involved in evaluating environmental risk, such as the effects of the physico-chemical environment on the speciation and uptake of pollutant chemicals and inherent inter-individual and inter-species differences in vulnerability to toxicity; and the toxicity of complex mixtures. Effectively linking the impact of pollutants through the various hierarchical levels of biological organisation to ecosystem and human health requires a pragmatic integrated approach based on existing information that either links or correlates processes of pollutant uptake, detoxication and pathology with each other and higher level effects. It is further proposed here that this process will be facilitated by pursuing a holistic or whole systems approach with the development of computational simulation models of cells, organs and animals in tandem with empirical data (i.e., the middle-out approach). In conclusion, an effective integrated environmental management strategy to secure resource sustainability requires an integrated capability for risk assessment and prediction. Furthermore, if such a strategy is to influence and help in the formulation of environmental policy decisions, then it is crucial to demonstrate scientific robustness of predictions concerning the long-term consequences of pollution to politicians, industrialists and environmental managers; and also increase stakeholder awareness of environmental problems.

Mussels were exposed to two oil volumetric ratios (1:500 and 2:500) for 12 days. Great concentrations of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (TPAH) have been obtained, being in general higher in the samples from the dose of 1:500, both in sea water (55.14 vs. 41.96 g/l) and mussel tissue (16,993.80 vs. 17,033.00 mug/kg), probably due to the great tendency of these compounds to link to particles in water. Comet assay results reflected an increase in the DNA damage associated to oil exposure, higher in the mussels exposed to the higher aqueous TPAH content. In the view of our results, the importance of the evaluation of biodisponibility, bioaccumulation and DNA damage in the assessment of the effects of xenobiotic pollutants to marine environments could be highlighted.

J	Fisher, WS				Fisher, WS			Antimicrobial activity of copper and zinc accumulated in eastern oyster amebocytes	JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH												The distribution of eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica near terrestrial watersheds has led to a general impression that low or variable salinity is imperative for survival. However, freshwater runoff contains numerous mineral elements from geologic deposits that could play significant roles in oyster physiology. Two metals of terrestrial origin, copper and zinc, are accumulated to extremely high concentrations in eastern oysters, even in the absence of anthropogenic sources. As yet, there has been no defendable demonstration of a physiologic function for such high concentrations. Both copper and zinc, however, are accumulated almost exclusively in the amebocytes and calcareous shell of oysters, a unique distribution that implicates a role in the functions of amebocytes. Amebocytes are migratory, diapedetic cells generally recognized to provide nutriment and defense through phagocytosis, killing, and digestion of invading or ingested microorganisms. There is sufficient evidence in existing literature to suggest that copper and zinc directly contribute to these antimicrobial activities. This review presents historical and recent findings that demonstrate a strong affinity of oyster amebocytes for copper and zinc (even in low ambient concentrations), prolonged retention of the metals despite a potential route of elimination, and strong circumstantial evidence of antimicrobial activity by accumulated copper and zinc. It is proposed that oysters actively concentrate copper and zinc as antimicrobial agents to be used in intracellular and extracellular killing (direct toxicity) as well as extracellular clot formation (precipitation of hemolymph). This potential, combined with evidence of amebocyte involvement in deposition of oyster shell, provides an alternative framework for understanding amebocyte functions, defense activities, and coastal distributions of oyster populations. It also affords some resolution to the apparent contradiction of eastern oysters thriving at seemingly polluted locations.																	0730-8000	1943-6319				AUG	2004	23	2					321	351										WOS:000223925100001

The Gulf of Mexico has a tremendous ecological importance because of its biological diversity. Baseline levels of blood metabolites and immune components were defined for wild tropical populations of Litopenaeus setiferus, an important shrimp species of the Gulf of Mexico. Osmotic pressure, oxy hemocyanin (OxyHc), glucose, proteins, cholesterol, lactate, and triacylglycerols (TAG) were used as indicators of physiological status; pro phenoloxydase (proPO) and phenoloxydase (PO) quantification of hemocytes, as well as respiratory burst, were used to assess the immunological status. Significant differences were observed in live weight of juveniles, males, and females of L. setiferus with mean values of 10.54, 35.05, and 40.33) g, respectively. A value of 460 mOsm/kg was recorded in the water where Juveniles were sampled and 1,000 mOsm/kg in adult sampling zones. Consequently, the osmotic pressure of L. setiferus juveniles (718.02 mOsm/kg) was 22% lower than in adults (925 mOsm/kg); there were no differences between sexes. A significantly lower value in Juvenile OxyHc was observed. This value was 24 and 16% lower than that observed in males and females, respectively. Hemolymph glucose, cholesterol, and triacylglycerol levels were not statistically different between shrimp stages, showing median values of 0.19, 0.32, and 0.39 mg/ml of glucose, cholesterol, and triacylglycerols, respectively. Hemocyanin was distributed normally in the juvenile male population but not in females. A proportion between 52 to 81% of OxyHc of the total protein (OxyHc/Prot) was obtained for all stages. Digestive gland glycogen showed no normal distribution in juveniles and adults. Digestive gland glycogen was significantly higher in Juveniles (median value of 2.64 mg/g) than in adults (median value of 1.58 mg/g). A higher value of lactate (0.11 mg/ml) was observed in juveniles than in males (0.09 mg/ml) and females (0.04 mg/ml). Granular cells (GC) corresponded to 36, 44, and 39% of the total hemocytes (TH) observed in Juveniles, males, and females. ProPO showed no normal distribution in all stages. A high proPO activity was recorded in L. setiferus females that was 95% higher than in the juvenile-male group. Respiratory burst was divided into two groups, juveniles-males and females, and was distributed normally in both. Female respiratory burst values were 40 and 45% higher than those observed in the juvenile and male groups, respectively. There was an increment in OxyHc, proteins, PO, hemocytes, and respiratory burst with an increase in body weight. In contrast, the relationship of live weight to glucose, TAG, and proPO revealed no significant regressions. A significant decrease in cholesterol, glycogen, and lactate with an increase in body weight was also observed. We now have indicators of nutritional and immune status of juveniles and adults that can reveal changes in trophic relations and health at the population level. This will serve as a basis for using L. setiferus as environmental sentinels, as non-controversial and inexpensive models to evaluate the potential changes that human activities could exert on this important marine ecosystem.

The aim of the project is to develop a suite of easy to use, cost effective and environmentally valid biological responses (biomarkers) to assess the general health of coastal systems, including estuaries. To achieve this aim, various sublethal endpoints are being measured and evaluated from a range of common coastal organisms showing different feeding types (filter feeding, grazing and predation) and habitat requirements (estuary and rocky shore) and at different levels of biological response (cellular, physiological and behavioural). This holistic integrated approach is essential to identify the full impact of chemical contamination on organisms, and enables the sensitivity of organisms to be ranked and key sentinel species for specific habitats to be identified.

The digestive gland, gills and adductor muscle were investigated for substrate specificity and inhibitors sensitivity using acetylthiocholine iodide (ASCh) and butyrylthiocholine iodide (BSCh) as substrates and tetra (monoisopropyl)pyrophosphor-tetramide (Iso-OMPA), 1,5-bis(4-allyldimethylammoniumphenyl)-penthan-3-one dibromide (BW284c51) and the insecticide chlorpyrifos as inhibitors. Effect of in vivo exposure to ZnCl2 was also investigated. All the tissues expressed ChE activity (gill > adductor muscle > digestive gland) and low substrates specificity throughout the hydrolysis of both ASCh and BSCh substrates. Partial (25-29%) and total inhibition (100%) of ChE activity in gills was demonstrated following in vitro incubation with Iso-OMPA and BW284c51 (3 mM), respectively. Concentration-dependent inhibition was also evident with chlorpyrifos in the range 10(-4)-10(-10) M (IC50 10(-6)) while in vivo exposure to ZnCl2 did not seem to affect ChE activity in the scallop. The potential use of ChE in the A. colbecki as biomarker for monitoring water contamination in the marine Antarctic environment is discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To assess if these strains had the ability to infect, cause clinical disease, or persist in a terrestrial host, sheep were inoculated during pregnancy, or before breeding, with porpoise, seal or dolphin marine-mammal isolates. Three groups of sheep were inoculated with representative Brucella isolates. Non-infected sheep (sentinels) were housed with these experimentally infected (transmission control) to assess the transmissibility of the marine strains between animals. There were no clinical signs of disease and the seroconversion rates were low. This indicates low pathogenicity of the three marine-mammal Brucella strains for sheep. In addition, a group of sheep were infected with the challenge strain of B. melitensis (H38) as a treatment standard. The likelihood of natural transmission of marine-mammal Brucella strains to sheep is discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, few studies have systematically used multiple biomarkers in more than a single species to determine the variability of sublethal effects of a particular contaminant. In this study, three marine invertebrates, the shore crab Carcinus maenas, the common limpet Patella vulgata and the blue mussel Mytilus edulis, were, exposed over 7 days in the laboratory to environmentally realistic concentrations of the priority pollutant copper. A combination of molecular, cellular and physiological biomarkers was measured in each organism to detect the toxic effects of copper. Biomarkers included lysosomal stability (neutral red retention), neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase activity), metabolic impairment (total haemolymph protein), physiological status (heart rate) and induction of protective metallothionein proteins. P. vulgata was the most sensitive to copper with significant effects measured in all biomarkers at concentrations of 6.1 mug Cu l(-1). In C maenas, cellular and neurotoxic endpoints were affected significantly only at 68.1 mug Cu l(-1). Exposure to copper also induced metallothionein production in crabs. Over a 7-day exposure period, M. edulis was the most tolerant species to copper with significant effects being observed at the cellular level only at 68.1 mug Cu l(-1). In all three species, cellular and neurotoxic pathways were more sensitive to disruption than physiological processes (protein and heart rate). Results illustrate how a suite of biomarkers applied to different sentinel species can provide a 'diagnosis of stress', whereby, effects at the molecular level can be used to interpret the level of physiological impairment of the organism.

J	Farina, JM; Castilla, JC; Ojeda, FP				Farina, JM; Castilla, JC; Ojeda, FP			The "idiosyncratic" effect of a "sentinel" species on contaminated rocky intertidal communities	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Depending on their biological characteristics, some species can exert strong (idiosyncratic) effects on ecosystem process. Human impacts on biological communities are related to biodiversity declines but also with species shifts and replacements. In northern Chile, the occurrence of copper mine-tailings in seawater is associated with a decrease in the number of sessile species and with rocky intertidal substrate monopolization by. one sentinel species, the green ephemeral-opportunistic algae Entermorpha compressa. In spite of these changes, several consumer species persist on the contaminated sites. In this study, we test the hypothesis that changes in benthic species dominance and composition is associated with an increase in productivity, which affects intertidal consumer abundance, biomass, and/or diversity. We compare benthic species richness, composition, and productivity as well as the abundance, diversity, and diet of consumer species on contaminated and noncontaminated sites. Our results show that changes in community structure at contaminated sites are related to increased primary productivity, the absence of birds, increased abundance of reptiles and crustaceans, and larger body sizes and biomass of some intertidal fishes. The simplified organization of contaminated communities allowed us to demonstrate the importance of species composition in determining the relationship between species richness and productivity in marine systems. The special characteristics of dominance, persistence, and productivity of Enteromorpha compressa.(the sentinel species on the contaminated sites) are a clear example of the idiosyncratic effect that some species could have in biological communities.																	1051-0761					DEC	2003	13	6					1533	1552		10.1890/02-5216								WOS:000187616400005

Bivalve molluscs are common sentinels used in invertebrate immunotoxicology, however, to date, studies have been restricted to a few resilient species. This present study is a comparative investigation into the effects of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, phenanthrene, on the immuno-competence of three bivalve species. The commonly-studied marine mussel, Mytilus edulis. was compared with two species that have never been studied with respect to immunomodulation, namely. the edible cockle, Cerastoderma edule and the razor shell, Ensis siliqua. Animals were exposed to a range of phenanthrene concentrations (50, 100. 200 or 400 mug 1(-1)) and haemocyte immune parameters, including haemocyte counts, phagocytosis, superoxide generation, lysosomal enzymes and lectin-binding, were monitored. Aims were not only to extend existing knowledge of bivalve immunotoxicology, but also to establish whether contaminant-induced immunomodulation in the sentinel species. M. edulis, is comparable to that observed in other bivalves. Results showed that the immune response of the three species was differentially affected by phenanthrene exposure, with immunomodulation in M. edulis not reflecting the immunological changes observed in the other two species. This suggests M. edulis may not be a suitable sentinel bivalve, and that other species, such as C edule, may more accurately reflect the general immunological response of this group of marine animals.

Here, red foxes were collected in the municipal territory of Ziirich, Switzerland, and their perirenal adipose tissue was examined for persistent organochlorine residues. This pilot study revealed an unexpected pattern of contamination by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), with significantly higher levels of the predominant congeners PCB-138, PCB-153, and PCB-180 in juvenile foxes relative to adult animals. Further data analysis demonstrated that the observed difference was attributable to an age-dependent reduction of PCB concentrations in females, whereas male foxes retained approximately the same PCB burden throughout their life span. A similar sex-related bias between population members has been observed, primarily in marine mammals. Interestingly, the reduction of organochlorine contents with progressive age is reminiscent of human studies, where an extensive maternal transfer of xenobiotics to the offspring has been shown to result in increased exposure levels of infants relative to adults. To our knowledge, this is the first example of an urban wildlife species that faithfully reflects the dynamic distribution of toxic contaminants in the corresponding human population. Suburban and urban foxes occupy habitats in close proximity to humans, depend on anthropogenic food supplies, are relatively long-lived and readily available for sampling, can be easily aged and sexed, have a limited home range, and, therefore, meet several important requirements to serve as a surrogate species for the assessment of toxic health hazards.																	0091-6765					OCT	2003	111	13					1608	1612		10.1289/ehp.6226								WOS:000185940800026	14527839

In this study, immune responses were recorded as indicators of sublethal chronic effects of contaminants, in addition to measurement of the induction of mono-oxygenase ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) in liver cells, the inhibition of acetylcholin esterase (AChE) in muscle and a quantification of grossly visible diseases and parasites. In total, 336 dab were analysed from five sampling areas in the North Sea, including the German Bight, the Dogger Bank, the Firth of Forth, and two locations close to oil and gas platforms (Ekofisk and Danfield). When considering plasma lysozyme levels, pinocytosis and respiratory burst activity of head kidney leucocytes, a clear gradient could be observed with decreased levels in individuals collected from the Firth of Forth and locations near the oil or gas platforms compared with dab from the Dogger Bank or the German Bight. Individuals with induced EROD activity displayed reduced lysozyme and respiratory burst activities. Lysozyme levels were also reduced in dab with lymphocystis or with nematodes. The data obtained indicate that the assessment of innate immune parameters in a monitoring programme provides supplementary information about immunomodulatory effects associated with the exposure of fish to contaminants. In particular, concentrations of plasma lysozyme, which can be analysed in an easy and inexpensive assay, are considered to be an appropriate parameter for use in a battery of other bioindicators.

The host factors that are critical to consider during all phases of bioavailability studies are age, gender, size, genetic characteristics, behavior (food chain considerations), and interactions between all of them. Some of these vulnerabilities are unique to individuals, populations, species, or communities. There are many interactions between and among metals, the species of metals, and the physical environment (pH, salinity). Some factors enhance uptake and absorption, whereas others moderate it. Moreover, some metals have greater effects on invertebrate organisms, whereas other metals (or species thereof) affect vertebrates more strongly. Fish and wildlife are useful as sentinel species and bioindicators because they can help us understand the risk to the organisms themselves, to the ecosystem, and to humans. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Here we provide an example of such integration from our exploration of effects of the Exxon Valdez oil spill (EVOS) on river otters (Lontra canadensis) inhabiting the terrestrial-marine interface in Prince William Sound, Alaska, USA. Our research was divided into 2 phases: an early phase (1989-92) immediately following the oil spill; and a late phase (1996-99), which focused on potential chronic effects of oil contamination in the Sound. We used a variety of measurements that considered the physiological status and health of individual river otters, as well as aspects of their ecology, behavior, and demography. We then conducted meta-analysis to explore interactions between individual-based and population-level data in demonstrating injury and subsequent recovery of otters from ill effects of EVOS. During both phases of our studies, we first conducted intensive research at 2 study sites, which we believed to be oiled and nonoiled, and then expanded our investigations throughout similar areas of Prince William Sound. Nonetheless, our data are best interpreted as differences between heavily oiled areas and lightly oiled sites because later information indicated that our reference sites were lightly oiled. Thus we refer to heavily oiled sites as oiled and lightly oiled sites as "nonoiled." In the later phase, we were part of a broader ecosystem-based project (Nearshore Vertebrate Predators) designed to assess long-term effects of EVOS on a suite of key organisms, and to determine whether those species had recovered from that catastrophic accident. We used radiotelemetry to locate carcasses of animals that died from natural causes, and documented that searching beaches immediately following the spill was not a reliable method for locating dead river otters. Our early research (1989-92) demonstrated that river otters living in oiled areas had lower body mass (P < 0.04) and elevated biomarkers (P < 0.05) in their blood (e.g., haptoglobin [Hp], interleukin-6 immunoreactive [IL-6 ir], aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) than otters inhabiting "nonoiled" areas. Likewise, otters from oiled areas had higher levels of fecal porphyrins (P < 0.001), ate a less-diverse diet (P < 0.001), had larger home ranges (P < 0.05), and selected habitats differently (P < 0.01) than otters living in areas that were not heavily oiled. A mark-recapture analysis based on radiotracers in otter feces during 1990 indicated no difference (P > 0.10) between density of otters in Herring Bay (oiled) or Esther Passage ("nonoiled"), but no prespill data were available. Likewise, by 1992, biomarkers (Hp, IL-6 ir, AST) did not differ (P > 0.05) between oiled and "nonoiled" areas. During the later phase of research, hydrocarbons on the pelage of river otters and the elevation of endothelial P450-1A, a biomarker sensitive to hydrocarbon exposure, indicated that river otters were exposed to oil still present in Prince William Sound. Nonetheless, body mass of otters continued to increase on oiled areas over tune (P < 0.05), and eventually did not differ from otters living in "nonoiled" sites (P > 0.05). All blood biomarkers (Hp, IL-6 ir, AST) were markedly reduced from the early phase of our research, and no longer differed (P > 0.10) between oiled and "nonoiled" sites. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to determine that few differences existed in an array of blood characteristics for otters inhabiting oiled and "nonoiled" sites, and those differences that did exist likely were related to diet. Corpoporphyrin III, a key biomarker in home synthesis, was reduced (P = 0.008) from post-spill collections made in 1990 in the oiled area, and no longer differed (P > 0.05) between oiled and "nonoiled" areas in 1996. We used stable isotope analysis to investigate differences in diet of river otters inhabiting oiled and "nonoiled" areas in 1996-97. When we controlled for otters inhabiting extensive freshwater habitats (which did not occur in our early studies), no differences in diet or the trophic level of otters were identified (P > 0.20) for otters living in oiled versus "nonoiled" sites. Similarly, density of marine fishes (greater than or equal to8 con in total length) on underwater transects did not differ (P = 0.97) between oiled and "nonoiled" areas, although an area by year interaction occurred (P = 0.01). Habitat selection by otters also was altered from the early phase; river otters on both study areas selected vegetated slopes that were not steep, and selected sites with more understory (brush) and greater exposure; selection for those characteristics was more pronounced in the oiled area. Otters on both sites avoided (use < availability) gravel and small rocks. Although selected variables differed between oiled and "nonoiled" sites (P < 0.001), the direction of selection did not differ between areas. Moreover, tidal slope did not enter any of the models, in contrast to our early studies, indicating that differences in selection were not related to avoidance of oiled shores. Hone-range size declined (P < 0.05) for otters living in oiled areas, and no longer differed (P > 0.7) from animals inhabiting "nonoiled" sites. We enumerated populations from oiled and "nonoiled" areas using a combination of live-captured individuals and DNA fingerprinting using microsatellite from otter feces at latrines. We also performed a conventional reconstruction based on age structure to calculate population size in 1997. Those methods indicated that most animals in the population were recruited following the oil spill and both methods characterized slowly (lambda = 1.03-1.06) growing or stable population in the oiled area. Age structure of river otters in the Sound differed neither between oiled and "nonoiled" areas (P > 0.36), nor from a harvested population of river otters in Maine (P > 0.49). Finally, survivorship of river otters did not differ (P > 0.2) between oiled and "nonoiled" areas of Prince William Sound and was high compared with data on other otter populations in North America. Our data indicate that although river otters continued to be exposed to low levels of crude oil, effects of that exposure were no longer sufficient to cause obvious injury. We cautiously conclude that river otters have recovered from the more pernicious effects of EVOS. Based on our experiences in this research, we provide theoretical considerations for use of biomarkers in wildlife studies and describe statistical approaches, including principal component analysis of blood variables, which may assist researchers with interpreting complicated results of multiple variables and datasets. Likewise, we describe how dose-response curves should be used in understanding population-level responses to pollutants. We hope that this monograph will provide valuable insights for other wildlife biologists on the process of integration of toxicological data with that of ecological data useful for studying effects of pollution on wildlife populations and their habitats.																	0084-0173	1938-5455				JUL	2003		153					1	53										WOS:000184304100001

Both butyltin and phenyltin species were measured in biota samples from four countries in this region. With tributyltin (TBT) concentrations up to 60 ng Sn g(-1), some sediments could be classified as contaminated (i.e. TBT > 1.3 ng Sn g(-1)), namely Dukhan (Qatar), the BAPCO industrial complex and Askar (Bahrain), and Hilf and the Raysut Port Area (Oman). Higher concentrations of total butyltins were found in oysters relative to fish, but ranging from 6.5 to 48 8 ng Sn g(-1) dry weight they are nonetheless relatively low. Diphenyltin and triphenyltin were found in some fish and bivalves from the Gulf, but not in biota from the Gulf of Oman. The environmental levels of organotin species are comparatively low by global standards and pose no immediate public health problems. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this study, S9, cytosolic fractions (CF), and microsomal fractions (MF) prepared from unexposed clams and clams exposed to model pollutants were used to activate 2-aminoanthracene (2-AA) and 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) to mutagens in Salmonella typhimurium strain BA149, which overexpresses O-acetyltransferase. Arylamine activation was similar with subcellular fractions from unexposed and Aroclor 1 254-exposed clams, but decreased with fractions from As(III)- and Cu(II)-exposed clams. Bioactivation of arylamines by CF was higher than by MF, and higher with NADH than with NADPH as the reducing agent. a-Naphthoflavone inhibited AAF activation by CF and MF, but increased 2-AA activation nearly twofold. In contrast to the results with arylamine activation, benzo[a]pyrene hydrox-ylase (BPH) activity increased twofold in fractions from Aroclor 1254- and Cu(II)-exposed clams. Activation of 2-AA was also evaluated using S9 fractions from clams sampled at littoral sites with different pollutant levels. Compared to a reference site, lower 2-AA bioactivation and higher BPH activity were found in clams containing high levels of copper and organic contaminants, although the differences were not statistically significant. While these findings agree with the results of the model Cu(II) exposure, the effects of other pollutants cannot be ruled out. The results of the study demonstrate that arylamine activation by clams is not preferentially catalyzed by microsomal monooxygenases but by unknown cytosolic system(s), and that bioactivation of 2-AA and AAF appears to occur by different pathways.

US EPA, Off Res & Dev EMAP				Molecular methods, including DNA probes, were used to identify and enumerate pathogenic Vibrio species in the Chesapeake Bay; our data indicated that Vibrio vulnificus exhibits seasonal fluctuations in number. Our work included a characterization of total microbial communities from the Bay; development of microarrays that identify and quantify the diversity of those communities; and observation of temporal changes in those communities. To identify members of the microbial community, we amplified the 16S rDNA gene from community DNA isolated from a biofilm sample collected from the Chesapeake Bay in February, 2000. The resultant 75 sequences were 95% or more similar to 7 species including two recently described Shewanella species, baltica and frigidimarina, that have not been previously isolated from the Chesapeake. When the genera of bacteria from biofilm after culturing are compared to those detected by subcloning amplified 16S fragments from community DNA, the cultured sample exhibited a strong bias. In oysters collected in February, the most common bacteria were previously unknown. Based on our 16S findings, we are developing microarrays to detect these and other microbial species in these estuarine communities. The microarrays will detect each species using four distinct loci, with the multiple loci serving as an internal control. The accuracy of the microarray will be measured using sentinel species such as Aeromonas species, Escherichia coli, and Vibrio vulnificus. Using microarrays, it should be possible to determine the annual fluctuations of bacterial species ( culturable and non-culturable, pathogenic and non-pathogenic). The data may be applied to understanding patterns of environmental change; assessing the "health" of the Bay; and evaluating the risk of human illness associated with exposure to and ingestion of water and shellfish.																	0167-6369					JAN-FEB	2003	81	1-3					327	336		10.1023/A:1021353814020								WOS:000179560300028	12620025

The most prominent VOCs are the BTEX and a number of chlorinated compounds such as chloroform and tetrachloroethene. The observed concentrations which, typically, were in the low ng/g wet weight range, could be linked to the major emission sources and the present study gives new evidence that combustion of fossil fuels is a major source of BTEX in the environment. The concentration levels in eels seem to be a reflection of the actual concentrations in their environment. For eels from the same location similar patterns and concentrations were observed, and the concentrations agree with what can be expected from those of the water column. Generally speaking, the observed concentrations do not seem to pose a threat for organisms. More definite statements will, however, require a larger dataset. The study suggests that the yellow eel can possibly be used as a biomonitor or sentinel organism for VOCs.

They may be offensive in certain concentrations and attractive at others (e.g. dimethyl sulfide in cooking clams). Quality grading, safety, and regulatory inspections are factors often in use before consumers ever see foods. The frequent use of petroleum hydrocarbons in our world has led to reports of environmental contamination, and mussels were selected as very convenient bioconcentrators for helping to identify organic pollutants in marine waters. Low-boiling petroleum fractions have alkane profiles similar to the C10-C24 n-alkanes present as a natural background from algal hydrocarbons and are almost always present in ocean water. This review suggests that the ratio of two common isoprenoid hydrocarbons, pristane and phytane, may be important in distinguishing the profiles of biogenic and abiogenic hydrocarbons. General problems with mussels, used as sentinels for examining this range of hydrocarbons, are briefly reviewed.																	0097-6156		0-8412-3821-9				2003	848						69	82										WOS:000183307100006

Their trophic status in the marine food web and wide-spread distribution make seals useful sentinels of arctic environmental change. The purpose of this investigation is to document the levels and bioaccumulation potential of radiocaesium in high latitude seal species for which data have not previously been available. The study was carried out on harp, ringed, and bearded seals caught north of the island archipelago of Svalbard (82degreesN) in 1999. The results are then compared with previous studies in order to elucidate factors responsible for bioaccumulation in Arctic seals. Concentrations of Cs-137 were determined in muscle, liver and kidney samples from a total of 10 juvenile and one adult seal. The mean concentration in muscle samples for all animals was 0.23 +/- 0.045 Bq/kg f.w. Cs-137 concentrations in both liver and kidney samples were near detection limits (approximate to0.2 Bq/kg f.w.). The results are consistent with previous studies indicating low levels of radiocaesium in Arctic seals in response to a long term trend of decreasing levels of Cs-137 in the Barents Sea region. Bioconcentration factors (BCFs) estimated for seals from NE Svalbard are low, ranging from 34 to 130. Comparing these values with reported BCFs for Greenland seals from other sectors of the European Arctic, we suggest that the combination of physiological and ecological factors on radiocaesium bioaccumulation is comparable among different Arctic seal populations. The application of this work to Arctic monitoring and assessment programs is discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

These species are all important representatives of different trophic levels of the North Sea food web. All six major PBDE congeners detected (BDEs 28, 47, 99, 100, 1,53, and 154) are most prevalent in the commercial Penta-BDE formulation. There is no evidence for the occurrence of-the Octa-BDE formulation in the North Sea food web, since its dominant congener, BDE183, was never detected. BDE209, the main congener (>97%) in the Deca-BDE formulation, was detected only in a minority of the samples and always in concentrations around the limit of detection. Since BDE209 is often the major BDE congener in sediment's from the area, the main reason for its low concentrations in biota from the North Sea seems to be a relatively low bioaccumulation potential. This can either-be due to a low uptake rate of the very large molecule or a relatively rapid excretion after biotransformation. Since all invertebrates investigated are sentinel species,they are highly representative for the area of capture. The highest lipid-normalized concentrations of PBDEs in the invertebrates' occurred near the mouth of the river Tees at the East coast of the U.K. The geographical distribution, of the PBDEs can be explained by the residual currents in the area. The direction of these currents differs between the summer and the winter season as a result of the presence or absence of vertical summer stratification of the deeper waters north of the Dogger Bank. Summer stratification results in the development of a density-driven bottom water current formed after the onset of vertical stratification of the water column in May leaving the UK coast near Flamborough Head toward the Dogger Bank. In winter, the residual currents run in a more southerly,direction and follow the UK coastline. The distribution pattern of the PCBs and p,p'-DDE in the invertebrates was entirely different from that of the PBDEs, which could be expected, since the use of these organochlorines in western Europe peaked in the 1960s and 1970s but has been forbidden more than two decades ago whereas the production and Use of the penta-BDE formulation is of a more recent origin. The higher trophic levels of the North Sea food web were represented by the predatory gadoid fish species whiting and cod and the marine mammal species p Seal and harbor porpoise. The lipid-normalized levels of the six major PBDE congeners in fish were similar to the levels in the invertebrates, but a biomagnification step in concentrations of generally more than an order of magnitude occurred from gadoid fish to marine mammals; Based on the limited number of samples, no differences could be observed between harbor seal and harbor porpoise. In summary, the results in three species of sentinel invertebrates from a network of stations covering a major part of the North Sea basin showed that the estuary of the river Tees at,the UK. East coast is a major source for tri- to hexa-PBDEs. Throughout the food-chain, the most marked increase in, (lipid-normalized): levels of all six PBDE congeners occurred from predatory (gadoid) fish to marine mammals, agreeing with the transition from gill-breathing to lung-breathing animals. This has serious consequences for the route of elimination of POPs, since their elimination from the blood into the ambient seawater via the gill-membrane is no longer possible.				de Boer, Jacob/L-5094-2013	de Boer, Jacob/0000-0001-6949-4828												0013-936X					OCT 1	2002	36	19					4025	4032		10.1021/es0158298								WOS:000178351800017	12380070

These sediments contain elevated levels of both PAHs and PCBs. Uncontaminated beach sand was used as control sediments. After a period of 4 weeks, each species of bivalves were sampled and hemocyte phagocytic activity was monitored by flow cytometry. While phagocytosis by hemocytes from M. polytiyma was significantly suppressed, those from M. arenaria were not different from beach sand-exposed controls. At the end of the exposure period, the phagocytic activity of hemocytes from both species was suppressed. Physiological parameters such as mantle proteins or malondialdehyde levels, total protein and total glycogen levels in the digestive gland were not affected by exposure to contaminated sediments. Moreover, the suppression of phagocytosis was well correlated with the transfer of contaminants from the sediments to the bivalves and their subsequent bioaccumulation, as demonstrated by the PCB body burden. These results support the use of bivalves as good sentinel species to survey sediment contamination and the usefulness of hemocyte phagocytic activity as a sensitive biomarker of exposure to organic contaminants.

At 10 muM TBT, the viability of coelomocytes, measured by Trypan Blue dye exclusion test, was 70%, so that concentrations in the range 0.01-10 muM were considered to be sublethal. At 10 muM TBT, cytolysis of haeerythrocytes was also observed. After TBT exposure, the cell spreading index, i.e., percentage of coelomocytes with amoeboid shape, and the endocytotic index, i.e., percentage of coelomocytes with ingested Neutral Red dye, were significantly (p<0.001) inhibited even at 1 muM TBT. The apoptotic index, i.e., percentage of coelomocytes with chromatin condensation detected with Acridine Orange, showed a significant (p<0.001) increase at 1muM after 60 min exposure to the xenobiotic. The lysosozyme activity index, was significantly (p<0.05) reduced at 0.05 muM TBT. All these indexes may be proposed as biomarkers, being sensitive, rapid, reproducible, and useful tools for monitoring TBT contaminated marine sediments.

During the last decade, studies in sentinel species, such as the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, or the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, have revealed that immunosuppressive responses can be related to xenobiotic exposure, in the laboratory and in the field. In the present study, European flat oysters were experimentally exposed to heavy metals, to investigate possible alterations of their immune function. Several hematological and functional parameters of hemocytes were measured by flow cytometry, a technique allowing rapid, sensitive, cell-by-cell measurements in large cell populations. Results reveal a depression of phagocytosis and several subcellular, physiological changes in oysters exposed to cadmium alone or to cadmium and copper, suggesting an overall alteration of the phagocytic function.

In the marine environment the eelpout (Zoarces viviparus) was selected as sentinel species. The three spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and perch (Perca fluviatilis) were chosen at freshwater locations. Histopathology of the testis revealed the presence of intersexuality in specimens of all three species. The intersex condition was defined by the simultaneous presence of primary oocytes within the apparently normal testis tissue. In comparison to stickleback and perch the eelpout exhibited the highest intersex prevalence and the most severe histological alterations. Fish with intersex were found at contaminated marine and freshwater stations as well as at sites with apparently little pollution. The findings suggest that feminised male fish were exposed to endocrine disrupting substances in the aquatic environment. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The red mullet (Mullus barbatus) was used as a bioindicator species for monitoring the biological impact of these discharges on a geographical and temporal scale. Organisms were sampled over three years (1998-2000) at different stations and several biomarkers, both of exposure and effect, were analyzed. Bioavailability of specific classes of pollutants was evaluated by analyzing levels of metallothioneins, the activity of cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) and of glutathione S-transferases. Among biomarkers of effect, special attention was paid to the balance between prooxidant challenge and antioxidant defenses, and to the appearance of damage caused by oxidative stress. The analyses of the main components of the antioxidant system included superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidases, glutathione reductase, glyoxalase I and 11, and total glutathione. These data were integrated with the measurement of total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC) as an indication of the overall biological resistance to toxicity of different forms of oxyradicals (peroxyl radicals, hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrite). Results indicated a biological impact in organisms sampled near the disposal site; the impact was particularly evident during 1999 and mainly related to organic chemicals such as PAH. Exposure to these pollutants also caused variations in the levels and activity of several antioxidants. The analysis of TOSC, however, revealed that the overall capacity of specific tissues of organisms to absorb various oxidants was not seriously compromised when challenged with increased prooxidant pressures. Variations of single antioxidants were useful in revealing early warning "biological responses", while integration with TOSC analyses indicated if such changes also reflect a more integrated and functional "biological effect" with possible consequences at the organisms level. The red mullet appears to be a useful sentinel species for a biomarker approach to monitoring impact caused by dredged materials. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, degenerate primers and RACE technology were used to amplify near-full-length (MhcZaca-DQB) and full-length (MhcZaca-DQA) expressed class II MHC gene products from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of two California sea lions in rehabilitation. Five unique Zaca-DQA sequences and eight unique Zaca-DQB sequences, all encoding functional proteins, were identified in the two animals, indicating the presence of multiple DQ-loci in this species. An additional three Zaca-DQB sequences containing features compatible with pseudogenes or null alleles were also identified. Despite the identification of multiple DQA and DQB sequences, the degree of heterogeneity between them was extremely low. To confirm the limited degree of Zaca-DQ nucleotide variation between individuals, we used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis to examine putative peptide binding region sequences from the peripheral blood leukocyte-derived RNAs of 19 wild-caught California sea lions from physically distinct populations. The pattern of Zaca-DQ sequence migration was identical between individuals and independent of geographical region. This apparent Zaca-DQ sequence identity between sea lions was confirmed by direct sequencing of individual bands. In combination, these findings raise important questions regarding immunogenetic diversity within this thriving species, and should prompt further research into the existence of a highly polymorphic sea lion class II MHC molecule with sequence features that support traditional peptide binding functions.

J	Verity, PG; Smetacek, V; Smayda, TJ				Verity, PG; Smetacek, V; Smayda, TJ			Status, trends and the future of the marine pelagic ecosystem	ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION												Globally, humans impact environments and ecosystems faster than they become aware of their effects. The marine pelagic ecosystem includes a tremendously large and diverse environment, which might accordingly be considered to be resilient to externally forced changes, whether from humans or climate. This review considers that general hypothesis by pursuing two objectives. The first is to document the current status of and recent anthropogenic impacts on the marine pelagic ecosystem, with emphasis on the epipelagic zone (0-200 m) where organisms are concentrated and human impacts have been greatest. It shows that humans have proven capable of assuming the role of top carnivore in pelagic ecosystems where living resources are attractive and financially amenable to exploitation, and that overexploitation is the rule under such circumstances. Other anthropogenic activities associated with changes in various marine pelagic ecosystems, such as increased diseases, mortalities, extinctions, habitat invasions, and species replacements, function as sentinels and indicate that portions of the pelagic ecosystem are under considerable stress. It is argued that, without attention, these problems can be expected to worsen up to the year 2025 and beyond. In addition to a comprehensive evaluation of status and trends relating to conservation of the marine pelagic ecosystem, a second major objective is to evaluate whether current paradigms of ecosystem function are sufficient to improve the ability of the scientific community to predict future changes and to recommend relevant management strategies. This review differs from previous ones by proposing that current conceptual models have failed to provide the basis for accurately predicting patterns and features of pelagic communities, notably why specific organisms occur where and when they do. It is argued that predation pressure is shaped by natural selection in the sea as on land, and that it influences organism behaviour, life history strategy and morphology, all of which determine marine pelagic ecosystem structure, and therefore should be used to interpret function. From this perspective, attempting to understand present patterns and predict the future of marine pelagic ecosystems, without understanding the intertwined roles of evolution and predation in forging contemporary pelagic communities, is a hopeless endeavour. It is proposed that both perspectives, resource availability and predation pressure, be incorporated into a revised paradigm of pelagic ecosystem structure and function, a necessity if policies are to predict anthropogenic impacts and environmental conservation is to be effective.																	0376-8929	1469-4387				JUN	2002	29	2					207	237		10.1017/S0376892902000139								WOS:000178121600006						
J	Pruski, AM; Dixon, DR				Pruski, AM; Dixon, DR			Effects of cadmium on nuclear integrity and DNA repair efficiency in the gill cells of Mytilus edulis L	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												Although the effects of heavy metals on marine invertebrate species are well studied in term of their toxicity and bioaccumulation, less is known about their genotoxicity. The aim of this investigation was to assess the DNA damaging potential of cadmium (Cd) in an important pollution sentinel organism, the mussel Mytilus edulis. Cadmium is one of the most toxic and widespread heavy metals found in the marine environment, and is a recognised carcinogen in mammals. Based on the results of the comet assay (alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis), Cd was found not to be genotoxic in mussel gill cells under acute and chronic exposure conditions, whereas pre-exposure to low concentrations of Cd was found to enhance the genotoxicity of another mutagen, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), The effects of H2O2 were normally reversible when cells were transferred to clean saline buffer. However, in cells that had been pre-treated with Cd, in vivo or in vitro, we observed a decrease in this post-treatment DNA repair. The effects of Cd were reversed by zinc which suggests that the inhibitory effect of Cd on DNA repair was due to the displacement of zinc ions from active sites on proteins involved in the repair process (a property already described for mammals). Moreover, since Cd inhibits or delays the onset of apoptosis (programmed cell death), this removes one of the main defence mechanisms responsible for protecting the organism against neoplasia. There appears to be a close similarity between the effects of Cd on marine molluscs and mammals. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Regoli, F; Nigro, M; Chiantore, M; Winston, GW				Regoli, F; Nigro, M; Chiantore, M; Winston, GW			Seasonal variations of susceptibility to oxidative stress in Adamussium colbecki, a key bioindicator species for the Antarctic marine environment	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The area of free radical biology is of increasing interest for marine organisms since the enhanced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a common pathway of toxicity induced by stressful environmental conditions. In polar environments responses of the antioxidant system could be useful as an early detection biomarkers of unforeseen effects of human activities which are progressively increasing in these remote areas. However, the characterization of antioxidant defences in appropriate sentinel species is of particular value also in terms of a possible adaptation to this extreme environment. The scallop, Adamussium colbecki, is a key species for monitoring the Antarctic environment and, besides single antioxidants, the total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC) assay has been recently used for quantifying the overall ability of this organism to neutralize peroxyl radicals (ROO.), hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-.) and peroxynitrite (HOONO). The aim of this work was to obtain a better characterization of these biological responses which can indicate the occurrence of biological disturbance; in this study the total oxyradical scavenging capacity was further analyzed to assess the presence of seasonal fluctuations in the susceptibility to oxidative stress in this species. The capability to neutralize peroxyl radicals and hydroxyl radicals increased at the end of December, while resistance towards peroxynitrite did not show any significant variations during the Antarctic summer. These results suggest the occurrence of metabolic changes which mainly influence intracellular formation of ROO. and .H-O, with more limited effects on HOONO. Despite the limited time window analyzed, as a typical constraint in Antarctic research at Terra Nova Bay, an increased resistance to these specific oxyradicals might be related to the period of highest feeding activity, or to other intrinsic factors in the animals' physiology such as the phase of reproductive cycle.

Mussel-Mytilus edulis-and fish-Platichthys flesus-were used as sentinel organisms. The bioaccumulation patterns of butyltin and phenyltin compounds varied substantially. Butyltins were detected in mussel tissue from all the sampled stations. Among them, organisms from the Gulf of Gdansk showed the highest residues (68 ng/g w.w. as Sn) in conjunction with elevated TBT/DBT ratios, which suggest recent inputs of TBT in the area. Additionally, flatfish were sampled in the Gulf of Gdansk, and different tissues (liver, digestive tube and gills) were analyzed separately. TPT, although undetected in mussels, was always present in fish. The highest organotin concentration was observed in the liver (369 ng/g w.w. as Sri) of fish caught near Gdansk port. Relatively high concentrations were observed in digestive tube, which points out the ingestion of organotin contaminated food as an important uptake route of those compounds in P. flesus.

As one component of the EEM, mills measure indices of growth, survival and reproduction in wild-caught fish exposed to effluent and compare them with fish not exposed to effluent. A review of the first round of Fish Surveys (Cycle 1: 1993-1996) indicated that they contributed useful data in the freshwater receiving environments for which they had been designed, but performed poorly in the more complex marine and estuarine environments. The most prevalent and serious problems were that insufficient fish were caught and the degree of exposure to effluent could not be quantified. Recommendations to address these problems in Cycle 2 (1997-2000) included selection of small-bodied, presumably more sedentary, fish and studies on the alternative approaches: caged bivalves and onshore bioassays (mesocosms). Difficulties encountered in Cycle 1 studies which could not be resolved became reasons to exclude the Fish Survey from 12 of 28 marine EEM studies in Cycle 2. Six marine mills completed the standard Fish Survey with finfish. Three of these used small-bodied fish successfully, though further information will be required on their range of movement and technical guidance on appropriate sampling. Six studies examined wild bivalves or snails in place of one or both finfish sentinels. None of the invertebrate studies provided all of the information required by the Fish Survey, with only two studies providing age information required to assess growth, only one study reporting gender, and none of the studies reporting measures of reproduction. Six mills conducted or participated in developing alternative approaches for fish surveys: two caged bivalve studies, three mesocosm studies using fish, and one onshore bioassay using bivalves. While providing no direct measurements of effects on reproduction these tools evaluated potential impacts of effluent on survival and growth and supplied information helpful for subsequent investigations of the causes of effects observed in wild fish.

In a toxicokinetic study of lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane) in bullrout Myoxocephalus scorpius, metacercariae of B, gracilescens were found in the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, the metacercariae accumulated concentrations of lindane that were higher than in the surrounding CNS tissue. This is the first report of metacercariae of B, gracilescens in bullrout. In addition the present results contribute knowledge of the disposition of an important environmental contaminant in the metacercarial stage of a trematode that has been pointed out as a promising sentinel species of pollution in the marine environment.																	0177-5103					DEC 20	2001	48	1					75	77		10.3354/dao048075								WOS:000174168000009	11843143

Bivalves were exposed for 7 days to various concentrations Of CuCl2 . 2H(2)O (0, 10, 60, and 110 mug/L) and CdCl2 . H2O (0, 150, 300, and 450 mug/L). Hemocytes were collected from exposed clams, and the effects of Cu and Cd on phagocytosis, Neutral Red retention capacity, superoxide dismutase, and cytochrome oxidase activities were investigated. Hemocytes from animals exposed to Cu showed a significant decrease in phagocytic activity, whereas no inhibition was observed in cells from Cd-exposed animals. Diffusion of Neutral Red into the cytosol, an index of lysosomal membrane alteration, was enhanced by high concentrations of both metals. Different results in biochemical parameters were observed. Exposure to 60 and 110 mug Cu/L caused a significant reduction in hemocyte superoxide dismutase activity, whereas no changes resulted after Cd exposure. Increased cytochrome oxidase activity was observed in hemocytes from mollusks exposed to 60 mug Cu/L and 300 mug Cd/L; no significant differences were found in cells from bivalves exposed to 110 mug Cu/L and 450 mug Cd/L. These results suggest a relationship between heavy metal exposure and alterations in functional responses of hemocytes in T. philippinarum and indicate that the type of observed effects vary with the nature and concentration of heavy metals. Moreover, the data obtained in the analyzed clam support the possibility of using it as sentinel organism in biomonitoring studies, even if used biomarkers will be further evaluated in field conditions.

J	Reddy, ML; Reif, JS; Bachand, A; Ridgway, SH				Reddy, ML; Reif, JS; Bachand, A; Ridgway, SH			Opportunities for using Navy marine mammals to explore associations between organochlorine contaminants and unfavorable effects on reproduction	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT					Conference on Toxicology and Risk Assessment Approaches for the 21st Century	APR 10-13, 2000	KINGS ISL, OH	Tri Serv USAF, USA, USN Toxicol, Natl Ctr Environm Assessment, US EPA, ATSDR, Div Toxicol, Natl Inst Occupat Safety & Hlth, Natl Res Council, Natl Acad Sci				The Department of Defense (DoD) has a unique marine mammal program maintained by the US Navy that includes the largest force of bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, worldwide. In recent years, this population of cetaceans that lives in netted open water enclosures in San Diego Bay has been monitored for levels of organochlorine (OC) contaminants in blubber, blood and milk. Data generated from these studies have afforded insight into the fate and possible effects of OC contaminants in marine mammals. We now report preliminary findings on the effects of maternal OC exposure on pregnancy outcome. Blubber OC levels were compared between females whose calves survived beyond 6 months and females whose calves were stillborn or died within 12 days of birth. The mean concentration of Sigma DDT was more than 3 times as high among dolphins whose calves died as that among dolphins whose calves survived beyond 6 months (P = 0.002). Mean Sigma PCB was more than 2.5 times higher in females whose calves did not survive (P = 0.076). This population is a logical sentinel for the assessment of environmentally mediated disease. Biological tissues and fluids can be sampled on a regular basis from the dolphins for accumulation of tissue residues, facilitated by conditioned husbandry behaviors. These trained behaviors help preclude possible alterations in health measures resulting from capture stress. Animals' diets can be monitored for contaminant levels. With these data, the expertise and facilities available at the Navy laboratory and in collaboration with other experts in the field, controlled studies can be designed to monitor and assess dietary exposure, measurable immune and neurologic responses and assess reproductive and transgenerational effects of contaminants. Biomarkers can be developed to relate the health of individual animals relative to contaminant exposures. Such investigations of natural exposure and response scenarios are a logical adjunct to traditional laboratory toxicity studies. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Although, part of this ecosystem received several types of pollutants which are discharged in the seawater without any treatment. In previous studies, in which acetylcholinesterase and glutathione S-transferase activities were used as biomarkers of pollution in Agadir Bay, we demonstrated that marine organisms (Donax trunculus, Mytilus galloprovincialis, Perna perna) living at the sites receiving domestic and industrial wastewater were affected (Najimi et al. 1997; Kaaya et al. 1999; Lagbouri, 1997). The study of these organism's biology showed many perturbations in the reproductive cycle and growth (Id-Halla et al. 1997; Lagbouri, 1997). In order to determinate whether metallic pollution was responsible for these perturbations, three heavy metals (zinc as essential metal, cadmium and copper known to have toxic effects) were analyzed in mussels. In fact, heavy metals were waste products of many industrial processes and were important causes of environmental pollution (Viarengo, 1985; Viarengo, 1989). Data about heavy metals in marine organisms from Moroccan coasts were rare and limited to the north Atlantic coasts (El Hraiki et al. 1994, Cheggour et al. 1999). The purpose of the present study was to assess the trace-metal content (Cd, Cu and Zn) in two species of mussels, the Mediterranean mussel M. galloprovincialis and the Africans mussel P. perna, collected in the Agadir bay (South of Morocco). The accumulation and transformation capabilities of pollutants make these sentinel organisms suitable for marine pollution monitoring (Lower and Kendall, 1990). The choice of Cd, Cu and Zn in this study, resided in the fact that they were the most heavy metals present in the wastewater in the area studied (Bari, 1994). Otherwise, this work constituted also a contribution in the assessment of the heavy metal level in the African North-West coasts which were characterized by an important upwelling. It completes the studies realized in the Mauritanian part of these coasts, by Romeo and Gnassia-Barelli (1988) and Sidoumou et al. (1992, 1999). Considering that many factors could affect the trace metals bioaccumulation in mollusks, e.g. physiological state, size and season (Romeo and Gnassia-Barelli 1988), our study investigated the metallic concentrations according to the season, animal size and distribution in organs. It was realized in two different sites of the Agadir bay.																	0007-4861					OCT	2000	65	4					478	485		10.1007/s001280000149                                                           								WOS:000089262600010	10960139

A time-course study was performed for both biomarkers and their potential use for marine biomonitoring discussed for the sentinel species studied. In gills, B[a]P-related DNA adducts were positively correlated with B[ a] P concentration in whole mussel, and were produced in a time-dependent manner relative to exposure. Comparison of adduct levels recorded in this paper in gills (0.149 +/- 0.079 (standard deviation) to 0.480 +/- 0.139 adduct per 10(8) normal nucleotides) with previous measures carried out in the digestive gland of the same animals (0.010 +/- 0.005 to 0.251 +/- 0.062 adduct per 10(8) normal nucleotides) (Akcha et al. in press) showed higher levels in the former tissue (p < 0. 001). As gills appeared more sensitive to B[a]P effects than the digestive gland, applying the post-labelling technique in gill DNA may allow an earlier detection of pollutant genotoxic effects. 8-OxodGuo formation was assessed as a measure of oxidative DNA damage. No increase in the level of 8-oxodGuo by B[a]P exposure was recorded in gill DNA. A methodological study clearly demonstrated the effect of DNA extraction procedure on 8-oxodGuo measurement. No difference in 8-oxodGuo levels was observed between the chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and the phenol/chloroform DNA extraction protocols for digestive gland (34.8 +/- 9.3 and 25.6 +/- 4.8 8-oxodGuo per 10(5) dGuo) and gill (6.6 +/- 0.8 and 7.3 +/- 2.4 8-oxodGuo per 10(5) dGuo) tissues (p > 0.05), whereas by the chaotropic method lower 8-oxodGuo levels (0.02 p < 0.05) were measured for both tissue (8.3 +/- 2.0 and 4.8 +/- 1.1 8-oxodGuo per 10(5) dGuo respectively). Contributory factors to the lack of observed increase in gill 8-oxodGuo level by B[ a] P exposure could be due to the selected way of exposure (via the feed supply) for which gills were not the target tissue of exposure and artifactual DNA oxidation during sample processing that could have masked the possible B[a]P oxidative DNA damage.																	1354-750X					SEP-OCT	2000	5	5					355	367										WOS:000089575300003
