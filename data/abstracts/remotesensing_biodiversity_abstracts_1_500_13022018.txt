Most studies have used normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to estimate tree species diversity on the basis that it is sensitive to primary productivity which defines spatial variation in plant diversity. The NDVI signal is influenced by photosynthetically active vegetation which, in the savannah, includes woody canopy foliage and grasses. The question is whether the relationship between NDVI and tree species diversity in the savanna depends on the woody cover percentage. This study explored the relationship between woody canopy cover (WCC) and tree species diversity in the savannah woodland of southern Africa and also investigated whether there is a significant interaction between seasonal NDVI and WCC in the factorial model when estimating tree species diversity. To fulfil our aim, we followed stratified random sampling approach and surveyed tree species in 68 plots of 90 m x 90 m across the study area. Within each plot, all trees with diameter at breast height of > 10 cm were sampled and Shannon index a common measure of species diversity which considers both species richness and abundance was used to quantify tree species diversity. We then extracted WCC in each plot from existing fractional woody cover product produced from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Factorial regression model was used to determine the interaction effect between NDVI and WCC when estimating tree species diversity. Results from regression analysis showed that (i) WCC has a highly significant relationship with tree species diversity (r(2) = 0.21; p < 0.01), (ii) the interaction between the NDVI and WCC is not significant, however, the factorial model significantly reduced the error of prediction (RMSE = 0.47, p < 0.05) compared to NDVI (RMSE = 0.49) or WCC (RMSE = 0.49) model during the senescence period. The result justifies our assertion that combining NDVI with WCC will be optimal for biodiversity estimation during the senescence period.																	0303-2434					APR	2018	66						106	115		10.1016/j.jag.2017.11.005								WOS:000423650500010

To protect these species, habitat suitability evaluation plays a central role. Hence, an attempt is made in this study to evaluate the suitability of sand cat's habitat in a sand dune-dominated landscape in Iran. Four Landsat-derived indices including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Weighted Difference Vegetation Index, Brightness Index (BI) and Salinity Index were combined to characterize sand cat's habitat requirements through a land use land cover (LULC) map. Furthermore, a set of landscape metrics were employed to explore the spatial pattern LULC classes. Sand cat's habitat suitability map was generated by linear combination of the standardized and relatively weighted NDVI and BI indices and then categorized into five classes of most suitable, highly suitable, moderately suitable, least suitable and not suitable. The results showed that about 75% of the total area is suitable for sand cat. Although this region is rich in biodiversity, it has not yet been subject to any conservation planning and should be granted more conservation attentions.																	2366-3286	2366-3294				FEB	2018	26	1					11	20		10.1007/s41324-017-0152-0								WOS:000423844500002

Building essential biodiversity variables (EBVs) of species distribution and abundance at a global scale	BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS												Much biodiversity data is collected worldwide, but it remains challenging to assemble the scattered knowledge for assessing biodiversity status and trends. The concept of Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) was introduced to structure biodiversity monitoring globally, and to harmonize and standardize biodiversity data from disparate sources to capture a minimum set of critical variables required to study, report and manage biodiversity change. Here, we assess the challenges of a Big Data' approach to building global EBV data products across taxa and spatiotemporal scales, focusing on species distribution and abundance. The majority of currently available data on species distributions derives from incidentally reported observations or from surveys where presence-only or presence-absence data are sampled repeatedly with standardized protocols. Most abundance data come from opportunistic population counts or from population time series using standardized protocols (e.g. repeated surveys of the same population from single or multiple sites). Enormous complexity exists in integrating these heterogeneous, multi-source data sets across space, time, taxa and different sampling methods. Integration of such data into global EBV data products requires correcting biases introduced by imperfect detection and varying sampling effort, dealing with different spatial resolution and extents, harmonizing measurement units from different data sources or sampling methods, applying statistical tools and models for spatial inter- or extrapolation, and quantifying sources of uncertainty and errors in data and models. To support the development of EBVs by the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON), we identify 11 key workflow steps that will operationalize the process of building EBV data products within and across research infrastructures worldwide. These workflow steps take multiple sequential activities into account, including identification and aggregation of various raw data sources, data quality control, taxonomic name matching and statistical modelling of integrated data. We illustrate these steps with concrete examples from existing citizen science and professional monitoring projects, including eBird, the Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring network, the Living Planet Index and the Baltic Sea zooplankton monitoring. The identified workflow steps are applicable to both terrestrial and aquatic systems and a broad range of spatial, temporal and taxonomic scales. They depend on clear, findable and accessible metadata, and we provide an overview of current data and metadata standards. Several challenges remain to be solved for building global EBV data products: (i) developing tools and models for combining heterogeneous, multi-source data sets and filling data gaps in geographic, temporal and taxonomic coverage, (ii) integrating emerging methods and technologies for data collection such as citizen science, sensor networks, DNA-based techniques and satellite remote sensing, (iii) solving major technical issues related to data product structure, data storage, execution of workflows and the production process/cycle as well as approaching technical interoperability among research infrastructures, (iv) allowing semantic interoperability by developing and adopting standards and tools for capturing consistent data and metadata, and (v) ensuring legal interoperability by endorsing open data or data that are free from restrictions on use, modification and sharing. Addressing these challenges is critical for biodiversity research and for assessing progress towards conservation policy targets and sustainable development goals.

Using soundscapes to detect variable degrees of human influence on tropical forests in Papua New Guinea	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												There is global concern about tropical forest degradation, in part, because of the associated loss of biodiversity. Communities and indigenous people play a fundamental role in tropical forest management and are often efficient at preventing forest degradation. However, monitoring changes in biodiversity due to degradation, especially at a scale appropriate to local tropical forest management, is plagued by difficulties, including the need for expert training, inconsistencies across observers, and lack of baseline or reference data. We used a new biodiversity remote-sensing technology, the recording of soundscapes, to test whether the acoustic saturation of a tropical forest in Papua New Guinea decreases as land-use intensity by the communities that manage the forest increases. We sampled soundscapes continuously for 24 hours at 34 sites in different land-use zones of 3 communities. Land-use zones where forest cover was fully retained had significantly higher soundscape saturation during peak acoustic activity times (i.e., dawn and dusk chorus) compared with land-use types with fragmented forest cover. We conclude that, in Papua New Guinea, the relatively simple measure of soundscape saturation may provide a cheap, objective, reproducible, and effective tool for monitoring tropical forest deviation from an intact state, particularly if it is used to detect the presence of intact dawn and dusk choruses.																	0888-8892	1523-1739				FEB	2018	32	1					205	215		10.1111/cobi.12968								WOS:000419240100020	28612939

Recognizing the rapid expansion of rubber plantation - a threat to native forest in parts of northeast India	CURRENT SCIENCE												With the current trend of land use/land cover (LULC) change taking place globally, several parts of northeast India are also showing signs of change in LULC pattern leading to forest loss. This study focusses on the expansion of monoculture rubber plantation (Hevea brasiliensis) in selected sub-watersheds in northeast India, and distributed in parts of north Tripura, Mizoram and a major portion in the Karimganj district of Assam. Remote sensing and GIS technique has been used to map and analyse the extent of rubber plantation using temporal IRS LISS III satellite data from 1997 to 2013. It has been observed that rubber plantation increased from 4.47 sq. km to 28.42 sq. km in various parts of the study area. The expansion was more rapid during recent times, i.e. during 2010 to 2013. The plantation took place in dense forest, open forest and degraded forest areas. The spread of the plantation was also observed in one reserved forest located within the study area. There are several instances of negative impacts of rubber plantation expansion in Southeast Asia. Similar expansion of rubber plantation has been observed in northeast India as well. Further spread of rubber plantations in the region needs to be regulated to avoid conversion of dense and reserved forest areas by fostering use of mixed cropping methods instead of rubber monocultures, and by adopting more sustainable land use and management practices.																	0011-3891					JAN 10	2018	114	1					207	213		10.18520/cs/v114/i01/207-213								WOS:000419728500042

Efficient quantification of biomass provides important information about forest quality and health. With the rising awareness of sustainable development, the ecological benefits of forest biomass attract more attention compared to traditional wood supply function. In this study, two nonparametric modeling approaches, random forest (RF) and support vector machine were adopted to estimate above ground biomass (AGB) using widely used Landsat imagery in the region, especially within the ecological forest of Fuyang District in Zhejiang Province, China. Correlation analysis was accomplished and model parameters were optimized during the modeling process. As a result, the best performance modeling method RF was implemented to produce an AGB estimation map. The predicted map of AGB in the study area showed obvious spatial variability and demonstrated that within the current ecological forest zone, as well as the protected areas, the average of AGB were higher than the ordinary forest. The quantification of AGB was proven to have a close relationship with the local forest policy and management pattern, which indicated that combining remote-sensing imagery and forest biophysical property would provide considerable guidance for making beneficial decisions.																	1007-662X	1993-0607				JAN	2018	29	1					151	161		10.1007/s11676-017-0404-9								WOS:000419916000015

Combining Remote Sensing and Field Mapping Methods to Study the Vegetation Dynamics within a Coastal Wetland and Determine the Habitat Effects of a Threatened Bird Species (Emberiza schoeniclus witherbyi)	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Coastal wetlands are highly dynamic changing ecosystems because of the effects of meteorology, wildlife interactions and human activities. They are one of the world's most threatened ecosystems, and threats to them drive the most specialist species to unfavorable conservation status and population trends. Therefore, it is important to frequently monitor the coverage changes of the different vegetation types to understand these species' population dynamics. However, frequent and detailed cartography entails costly efforts. Here, satellite images with field mapping were combined to create vegetation classification maps for past years from SPOT-5 images in the Pego-Oliva coastal wetland (Spain) and obtained classification accuracies above 85%. Together with habitat selection models, this information was used to understand the changes in the habitat of a threatened bird species, the Eastern Iberian reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus witherbyi), whose population has sharply declined in recent decades in Spain. A statistically significant reduction in reed-rush patches (positively selected habitat) and an increase in homogeneous reed patches (negatively selected habitat) were observed in those areas where the species disappeared as breeders. This study shows the potential of remote sensing and GIS techniques for the a posteriori monitoring of variation in the habitats available for threatened species to set up management and conservation measures.

Habitat degradation leads to biodiversity loss and concomitant changes in ecosystem processes. Tropical river floodplains are highly threatened by land cover changes and support high biodiversity and important ecosystem services, but the extent to which changes in floodplain land cover affect fish biodiversity remains unknown. 2. We combined fish and environmental data collected in situ and satellite-mapped landscape features to evaluate how fish species with different ecological strategies and assemblage structures respond to deforestation in floodplains of the Amazon River. We surveyed 462 floodplain habitats distributed along a gradient of land cover, from largely forested to severely deforested. Rather than analyse only taxonomic metrics, we employed an integrative approach that simultaneously considers different aspects of fish biodiversity (i.e. beta diversity and taxonomic and functional assemblage structure) to facilitate mechanistic interpretations of the influence of land cover. 3. Spatial patterns of fish biodiversity in the Amazon River floodplain were strongly associated with forest cover as well as local environmental conditions linked to landscape gradients. Several species and functional groups defined by life-history, feeding, swimming/microhabitat-use strategies were positively associated with forest cover. Other species, including some that would usually be considered habitat generalists and species directly dependent on autochthonous resources (e.g. planktivores), were most common in areas dominated by herbaceous vegetation or open water habitats associated with the opposite extreme of the forest cover gradient. beta diversity and the degree of uniqueness of species combinations within habitats were also positively associated with forest cover. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrating that spatial patterns of fish biodiversity are associated with forest cover, indicate that deforestation of floodplains of the Amazon River results in spatial homogenization of fish assemblages and reduced functional diversity at both local and regional scales. Floodplains world-wide have undergone major land cover changes, with forest loss projected to increase during the next decades. Conserving fish diversity in these ecosystems requires protecting mosaics of both aquatic habitats and floodplain vegetation, with sufficient forest cover being critically important.

ACTA GEOGRAPHICA SLOVENICA-GEOGRAFSKI ZBORNIK												Agriculture plays an important role in both protecting and developing farmland. In Slovenia, the main reasons for this loss are urbanization and the implementation of large development projects that require the destruction of fertile farmland. About 3000ha of farmland has been lost each year since Slovenia's independence. The importance of agriculture and farmland is touched upon in this special issue of Acta geographica Slovenica. The authors focus on management of farmland, analyse the development potential for agriculture, observe the changes in the landscape by remote sensing, soil quality and its pollution, and land cover as an element of biodiversity. They draw attention to the lack of participation in spatial planning procedures and the question of the importance of agriculture and jobs in this sector in national economy. This introductory paper brings a short analysis of how the issue of farms' spatial constraints and moving farm structures to new locations is perceived by municipal offices, nature parks, and the Slovenian Chamber of Agriculture and Forestry and its regional offices.																	1581-6613	1854-5106					2018	58	1					51	57		10.3986/AGS.5170								WOS:000415133800004

Earlier, the area was densely forested, rich in biodiversity and home to various tribal communities. In the last decade, the area has been exploited by the private sector for setting up large scale power generation plants. The land use and its pattern and land surface temperature (LST) were studied for the Sasan Ultra Mega Thermal Power Plant covering an area of 10 km(2) for 3 years-2005, 2010 and 2015, respectively. Chronologically, the year 2005 is the phase of pre-establishment of the thermal power plant; the year 2010 specifies the construction phase and 2015 is the operational phase. Landsat ETM and Landsat 8 data of remote sensing system were used for this study. The land use/cover (LULC) study shows a significant decrease in the forest cover and barren rocky land, and a dramatic expansion in vegetation and wastelands. These changes in LULC have together widened the range of LST with an overall rise of 6.69 degrees C and an overall decline in the NDVI value from the year 2005 to 2015. The results of Pearson's correlation analysis depict an inverse co-relationship between LST and NDVI for the study area. Therefore, LST and NDVI are two important parameters to study the metropolitan ecosystem and can be used as an effective tool for evaluating environmental influence on ecosystems.																	2366-3286	2366-3294				DEC	2017	25	6					769	777		10.1007/s41324-017-0142-2								WOS:000423843900004

This paper analyzes the dynamic transitions among identified land use and land cover (LULC) types in the Bosomtwe district of Ghana, from 1986 to 2014. An integrated approach of geo-information tools of satellite remote sensing in Earth Resource Data Analysis System (ERDAS) Imagine 13 and ArcMap 10.2 Geographic Information System (GIS), with Markov chain analytical techniques were used to examine the combined forest land cover transitions, relative to build-up, recent fallows and grasslands and projected possible factors influencing the transitions under business as usual and unusual situations. Statistical analyses of the classified Landsat TM, ETM+ and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIS) indicated that over the period of 24 years, the Bosomtwe district has undergone a series of land use conversions with remarkable forest losses especially between 2002 and 2010. In 2010 dense forest cover was degraded to low forest by 4040 ha indicating 0.40% transition probability in the future. There was a remarkable increase of built-up/bare and concrete area with a 380% increment in the 1986-2002 transition periods. The application of the Markov futuristic land use dynamics by the years 2018 and 2028, projected from the 2014 LULC indicated a future steady decline in the area coverage of the dense forest to low forest category. This is currently being driven (as at the 2017 LULC trends), by the combined effects of increasing build up bare and concrete surface land uses as well as the expanding recent fallows and grassland. The paper concluded that the health of the ecosystem and biodiversity of the lake Bosomtwe need to be sustainably managed by the Bosomtwe district assembly.																	2076-3263					DEC	2017	7	4							UNSP 125	10.3390/geosciences7040125								WOS:000419192500034

Developing such maps has been traditionally performed using Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) methods, which usually reach good accuracies, but require a high human supervision and the best configuration for one image often cannot be extrapolated to a different image. Recently, deep learning Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown outstanding results in object recognition in computer vision and are offering promising results in land cover mapping. This paper analyzes the potential of CNN-based methods for detection of plant species of conservation concern using free high-resolution Google Earth (TM) images and provides an objective comparison with the state-of-the-art OBIA-methods. We consider as case study the detection of Ziziphus lotus shrubs, which are protected as a priority habitat under the European Union Habitats Directive. Compared to the best performing OBIA-method, the best CNN-detector achieved up to 12% better precision, up to 30% better recall and up to 20% better balance between precision and recall. Besides, the knowledge that CNNs acquired in the first image can be re-utilized in other regions, which makes the detection process very fast. A natural conclusion of this work is that including CNN-models as classifiers, e.g., ResNet-classifier, could further improve OBIA methods. The provided methodology can be systematically reproduced for other species detection using our codes available through (https://github.com/EGuirado/CNN-remotesensing).

Collaborative Research on the Ecology and Management of the 'Wulo' Monsoon Rainforest in Wunambal Gaambera Country, North Kimberley, Australia	LAND												Indigenous groups are increasingly combining traditional ecological knowledge and Western scientific approaches to inform the management of their lands. We report the outcomes of a collaborative research project focused on key ecological questions associated with monsoon vine thickets in Wunambal Gaambera country (Kimberley region, Western Australia). The study mapped monsoon rainforests and analysed the environmental correlates of their current distribution, as well as the historical drivers of patch dynamics since 1949. Remote sensing was used to chart the effectiveness of an intervention designed to re-instate Aboriginal fire regimes according to customary principles. We identified the most vulnerable patches based on size, distance from neighbouring patches, and fire frequency. More than 6000 rainforest patches were mapped. Most were small (<1 ha), occurring predominantly on nutrient-rich substrates (e.g., basalt) and fire-sheltered topographic settings (e.g., slopes and valleys). Rainforests with low fire frequency and no cattle were more likely to expand into surrounding long-unburnt savannas. Frequent fires and cattle did not cause substantial contraction, although the latter affected rainforest understories through trampling. Fire management performed by Aboriginal rangers effectively shifted fire regimes from high-intensity late dry season fires to early dry season fires, particularly in areas with clusters of vulnerable rainforests. The remote sensing methods developed in this project are applicable to the long-term monitoring of rainforest patches on Aboriginal-managed land in North Kimberley, providing tools to evaluate the impacts of fire management, feral animal control, and climate change. The study confirmed the importance of the cattle-free and rarely burnt Bougainville Peninsula as one of the most important rainforest areas in Western Australia.

Paul; Saito, Yoshiki; Van Lap Nguyen			Recent evolution of the Mekong Delta and the impacts of dams	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												As the world's third largest delta and one of the world's most important biodiversity hotspots, the Mekong Delta provides both ecological and food security for its inhabitants. Nevertheless, the delta has been threatened by climate change and human activities, particularly the proliferation of hydropower development across the Mekong Basin since the 1990s. However, compared to the well-studied Holocene Mekong Delta, our understanding of the recent 50-year evolution of the Mekong Delta is not sufficient to address these threats. In this study, we used 43-year Landsat images from 1973 to 2015 to investigate the entirety of the Mekong Delta's shoreline, land area and geomorphological changes. We compiled a new and comprehensive GIS database of the dams and irrigations of the Mekong Basin. The goal was to improve our knowledge of the recent evolution of the Mekong Delta and to link the potential impacts of dams and other factors. Our results show that the Mekong Delta is experiencing a significant decrease in the shoreline progradation rate. Currently, 66% of the entire delta shoreline is under erosion. The erosion segments are mainly located on the eastern side of the Ca Mau Peninsula and northwestern side of the delta in the Gulf of Thailand (GoT). Most parts of the shorelines in the estuarine area are still growing, although river sediment continues to decrease. Geomorphological asymmetries, discontinuous shoreline shifts, and sandy beach-ridge sets can be observed in multitemporal images. The entire Mekong Delta experienced a shift from growing to shrinking around 2005 with the gradual increase of the total accumulated installed capacity of the dams over the entire river basin. In the near future, the realization of planned dams, extension of irrigation, groundwater withdrawal, uncontrolled riverbed mining, delta subsidence, sea level rise, and other factors will accelerate the ongoing delta erosion.

A large number of active and passive sensors are observing in optical and microwave spectral regions, providing valuable data at different spatial resolutions for land ocean and atmospheric applications, as per application requirements. Satellite Observations during natural and human-induced hazards have become crucial for protecting the global environment, reducing disaster losses, and achieving sustainable development. Today, India has the world's largest constellation of remote sensing satellites in operation which is being extensively used for resource management and integrated planning for national development. The paper discusses the evolution and functioning of both Optical and Microwave Earth Observations Remote Sensing Sensors developed in India.																	0369-8203	2250-1762				DEC	2017	87	4					473	486		10.1007/s40010-017-0429-7								WOS:000418819200002

Krishna			Sustainable Biodiversity Management in India: Remote Sensing Perspective	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES												Remote sensing, a state of art technology has gained significance due to its capability to map and monitor compositional, structural and functional biodiversity. Remote sensing data provides a perspective on how ecosystems and species are being affected by the multiple disturbances. This paper presents consolidated information of earth observation based biodiversity research and conservation applications in India. Progress achieved for understanding essential biodiversity variables with reference to species populations, species traits, community composition, ecosystem function and ecosystem structure have been reviewed. Studies mostly focused on remote sensing based biodiversity indicators in understanding of land cover, forest cover, forest type, fragmentation, biological richness, carbon stocks, fires and protected area monitoring at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Fine resolution understanding with reference to vegetation structure, function, distribution of threatened, endemic and invasive species is required for effective conservation strategies. The declining trend of deforestation and effectiveness of protected area network indicates India's commitment towards the global conservation targets. Ensured continuity of remote sensing can support in near real monitoring of habitats and achieving conservation effectiveness.																	0369-8203	2250-1762				DEC	2017	87	4					617	627		10.1007/s40010-017-0438-6								WOS:000418819200011

The congruence between plant and animal biological richness (BR) was studied by extending the scope of methodology from past studies in order to understand the question; does higher plant richness encourages higher animal richness? Using satellite images, 16 forest vegetation classes to integrate BR attributes for 85 plants and 271 animal species were derived. Plant BR analysis linked six biodiversity attributes (i.e., spatial, phytosociological, social, physical, economic and ecological) together based on their relative importance. The information of four terrestrial animal taxa (i.e., mammal, bird, reptile and amphibian) from various resources was utilized over five surrogates of biological richness (habitat suitability, spatial heterogeneity, eco-climatic stability, plant structural properties, and forage). A methodological basis of spatial enumeration of animal richness was provided in one of the most biologically rich landscapes of India, forming part of Indian Gangetic plains. It was observed that positive congruence between BR of plant and animal with a spatial overlap of 82.23% for the inclusive BR. Significant positive correlation (R-2 : 0.7) was observed for high BR values (7-9) of animal and plant. Authors believe the strengths of our study are (i) translation of animal characterization onto a spatial map, (ii) collection and utilization of scattered data of animals from varied resources for Indian region where proper documentation is lacking (iii) generation of an inclusive BR map having higher conservation potential, and (iv) creation of a database having retrieval and future modification capability. This methodology has the potential for inclusive plant and animal biological richness for effective conservation implications with more site-specific data of a wider range of animals.																	0369-8203	2250-1762				DEC	2017	87	4					911	925		10.1007/s40010-017-0459-1								WOS:000418819200033

Using 891 geo-tagged ground sampled point collected for the Western Ghats, India from a national level study on biodiversity characterization. We analyzed the distribution of plant species with respect to the satellite derived vegetation indices. The moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer derived vegetation products, i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR), leaf area index (LAI), and surface reflectance (SR-645nm and SR-858nm) were fitted to suitable regression curves with respect to plant species richness where NDVI demonstrated the best fit (R-2 = 0.07); while fPAR showed (R-2 = 0.08) better relation with woody species richness. We observed positive but weak correlation for all the biophysiological proxies with species richness in the forests of Western Ghats. The annual pattern of correlation faired than seasonal (i.e., post-monsoon) between biophysical variables and species richness, while the woody subset of the species richness demonstrated marginally better relation at annual scale. The range of each biophysical proxy varied from medium to high, indicating higher vegetation strength. The species richness trend increased linearly for NDVI and EVI. The positive correlation showed by fPAR and LAI could be due to varied canopy architecture of the Western Ghats forests. Utility of fine resolution spatio-temporal data could render better understanding of species richness pattern using biophysical proxies, and thereby, help in long-term biodiversity monitoring.																	0369-8203	2250-1762				DEC	2017	87	4					927	939		10.1007/s40010-017-0460-8								WOS:000418819200034

Mapping coral reef environments: A review of historical methods, recent advances and future opportunities	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Coral reef environments support high levels of marine biodiversity, they are important sites for coastal habitation and they provide a range of goods and ecosystem services such as nearshore fisheries, economic revenue from tourism and breeding sites for seabirds and turtles. Mapping is a fundamental activity that underpins our understanding of coral reef environments and helps to shape policies in resource management and conservation. This is particularly the case for quantifying the area of landcover types associated with reef environments, including coral patches, seagrasses and mangroves, but also for monitoring how these change over time and modelling how spatial patterns apparent on reefs are related to environmental drivers. Field techniques and aerial photography have historically played a crucial role in mapping coral reef environments, which has recently seen a transition toward the processing of satellite remote sensing images. This paper examines a series of maps produced of Low Isles, the most mapped island on the Great Barrier Reef, to review historical methods for mapping coral reefs because of the critical importance of understanding how past maps were made, which determines appropriate uses to which they can be put. Recent advances and future opportunities for the application of mapping technologies to coral reefs are also evaluated, including the use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms for airborne surveys, delivery of information through web-based platforms and improvements in the quality of information for making and presenting maps. Maps have transformed the way we have responded to both historic and contemporary coral reef problems. This timely review communicates how maps, and the fast growing technologies that are employed to produce them, are central to our understanding of coral reef environments. Recent advances that may drive exciting new environmental management tools are identified.																	0309-1333	1477-0296				DEC	2017	41	6					803	833		10.1177/0309133317744998								WOS:000418042100006

However, the applicability of this information might differ among taxa and diversity measures. We compared the ability of indicators developed from texture analysis of remotely sensed images to predict species richness and species turnover of six taxa (trees, pyraloid moths, geometrid moths, arctiinae moths, ants, and birds) in a megadiverse Andean mountain rainforest ecosystem. Partial least-squares regression models were fitted using 12 predictors that characterize the habitat and included three topographical metrics derived from a high-resolution digital elevation model and nine texture metrics derived from very high-resolution multi-spectral orthophotos. We calculated image textures derived from mean, correlation, and entropy statistics within a relatively broad moving window (102 m x 102 m) of the near infra-red band and two vegetation indices. The model performances of species richness were taxon dependent, with the lowest predictive power for arctiinae moths (4%) and the highest for ants (78%). Topographical metrics sufficiently modeled species richness of pyraloid moths and ants, while models for species richness of trees, geometrid moths, and birds benefited from texture metrics. When more complexity was added to the model such as additional texture statistics calculated from a smaller moving window (18 m x 18 m), the predictive power for trees and birds increased significantly from 12% to 22% and 13% to 27%, respectively. Gradients of species turnover, assessed by non-metric two-dimensional scaling (NMDS) of Bray-Curtis dissimilarities, allowed the construction of models with far higher predictability than species richness across all taxonomic groups, with predictability for the first response variable of species turnover ranging from 64% (birds) to 98% (trees) of the explained change in species composition, and predictability for the second response variable of species turnover ranging from 33% (trees) to 74% (pyraloid moths). The two NMDS axes effectively separated compositional change along the elevational gradient, explained by a combination of elevation and texture metrics, from more subtle, local changes in habitat structure surrogated by varying combinations of texture metrics. The application of indicators arising from texture analysis of remote sensing images differed among taxa and diversity measures. However, these habitat indicators improved predictions of species diversity measures of most taxa, and therefore, we highly recommend their use in biodiversity research. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

But the valuable landscape undergoes a radical change in its form over the decades. This study uses past and recent satellite data to evaluate the typical landscape change over the decades. Both pre-classification and post classification change detection approach was used to assess the change result from 1980 to 2010. In pre-classification approach CVA, NDVI and NDWI analysis were implemented to assess the change scenario. Maximum likelihood supervised classification technique was performed to create the signature class of significant land cover category (deep water, shallow water, vegetation, and settlement). After ensuring satisfactory accuracy value for each classified image a detail post classification change detection analysis was executed. Image differencing, statistical change detection techniques (transition probability matrix), change dynamics analysis was also operated to evaluate the statistics of past change relative to present. This study illustrated that, about 40% land cover of the total study area has been converted over 30 years period. Forested and high land vegetation's are disappearing rapidly, deep water bodies consist of large lakes are becoming the rare feature of the study area. Widespread development of settlement and dominant shallow water feature are converting the natural wetland a permanent low lying agricultural land.

However, monitoring the ecological outcomes of these large-scale endeavours is challenging, and as a result, the factors and processes likely to shape their effectiveness remain poorly identified and understood. To address this knowledge gap, we tested three hypotheses pertaining to natural vegetation loss across the W-Arly-Pendjari protected area complex, a key biodiversity hotspot in West Africa. Using a new methodology to compare land cover change across large remote areas where independent validation data is unevenly distributed across time, we demonstrate widespread agricultural expansion outside protected areas over the past 13years. Protected areas with high protection status appear considerably more effective at preventing land conversion than other protected areas. We moreover report marked differences in cropland expansion rates between countries, which we suggest may be linked to differences in rural population growth. Altogether, our results suggest that there can be considerable spatial heterogeneity in anthropogenic pressure across transboundary protected area complexes and call for more comprehensive assessments that capitalize on the current availability of remote sensing information.																	2056-3485					DEC	2017	3	4					190	201		10.1002/rse2.47								WOS:000417252400002

Review of native vegetation condition assessment concepts, methods and future trends	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION												The main aim of this review paper is to evaluate and make recommendations on how current and emerging remote sensing (RS) technology might be best used to improve vegetation condition assessment and monitoring. This research reviews the vegetation attributes used in various approaches to vegetation condition assessment, the most efficient and rapid techniques to assess those attributes, and proposes applicable suggestions for future vegetation condition assessment using fusion and ensemble techniques. The attributes are those that have strong correlations with components of vegetation condition and are expected to produce trustable indications of change. Further to this, it aims to identify those vegetation attributes that can be best assessed using field survey and those that can be remotely measured world-wide. Vegetation has various structural, functional and compositional characteristics. To measure specific vegetation characteristics, the suitable type of RS sensor is required. Multi-spectral, hyperspectral, Radio Detection And Ranging (RADAR) and Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) are the main types of RS sensors, and each type has a range of applications. A variety of automated and repeatable methods are provided by RS technology to monitor the indicators of vegetation condition. However, dependency on site-based data remains. Further work is essential to find a rapid, cost effective and transferable RS method to map and monitor vegetation condition. Moreover, near future improvements in RS, such as Sentinel products, are expected to ease the process of vegetation condition assessment and enhance the outcomes.

A national-scale model of linear features improves predictions of farmland biodiversity	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Modelling species distribution and abundance is important for many conservation applications, but it is typically performed using relatively coarse-scale environmental variables such as the area of broad land-cover types. Fine-scale environmental data capturing the most biologically relevant variables have the potential to improve these models. For example, field studies have demonstrated the importance of linear features, such as hedgerows, for multiple taxa, but the absence of large-scale datasets of their extent prevents their inclusion in largescale modelling studies. 2. We assessed whether a novel spatial dataset mapping linear and woody-linear features across the UK improves the performance of abundance models of 18 bird and 24 butterfly species across 3723 and 1547 UK monitoring sites, respectively. 3. Although improvements in explanatory power were small, the inclusion of linear features data significantly improved model predictive performance for many species. For some species, the importance of linear features depended on landscape context, with greater importance in agricultural areas. 4. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that a national-scale model of the extent and distribution of linear features improves predictions of farmland biodiversity. The ability to model spatial variability in the role of linear features such as hedgerows will be important in targeting agri-environment schemes to maximally deliver biodiversity benefits. Although this study focuses on farmland, data on the extent of different linear features are likely to improve species distribution and abundance models in a wide range of systems and also can potentially be used to assess habitat connectivity.

Its vast region concentrates also a large number of small farmers, who historically have been practicing swidden-fallow cultivation. Globally, there is contradictory evidence of the current fate of this traditional, integrated agricultural system, and the new land uses may have a strong impact on farmers' livelihoods and ecosystem conservation. In this study, we assessed the land cover and land use change in a watershed where slash-and-burn cultivation was prevalent, aiming at understanding the drivers of change and discussing past and possible future impacts, including the perception of farmers on the drivers of land use change. We combined information gathered from interviews with 15 key informant farmers and from the analysis of remote sensing images for the years 1957, 1978 and 2011. Swidden-fallow cultivation has declined steadily since the 1950s. Part of the land was abandoned and forest succession was allowed to occur, increasing the total forest area; an apparently positive outcome. However, conversion to pastures and Eucalyptus plantations not only used much of the open land but also converted successional forests through deforestation, based on remote sensing. The willingness of farmers to grow more Eucalyptus and raise more cattle further increases concerns about the prospect for conservation. Our approach, combining remote sensing-based land change quantification and interviews, revealed to be complementary, allowing a better understanding of the past and possible future scenarios for the land use dynamics.																	0264-8377	1873-5754				DEC	2017	69						417	426		10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.09.039								WOS:000414881200041

Heterogeneity indices based on land-use/land-cover maps typically do not integrate ecological dissimilarity between land-use/land-cover types. Here, we applied the concept of functional diversity to an existing land-use/land-cover diversity index (Satoyama index) to incorporate ecological dissimilarity and proposed a new index called the dissimilarity-based Satoyama index (DSI). Using Japan as a case study, we calculated the DSI for three land-use/land-cover maps with different spatial resolutions and derived similarity information from normalized difference vegetation index values. The DSI showed better performance in the prediction of Japanese damselfly species richness than that of the existing index, and a higher correlation between the index and species richness was obtained for higher resolution maps. Thus, our approach to improve the land-use/land-cover diversity index holds promise for future development and can be effective for conservation and monitoring efforts.																	0044-7447	1654-7209				DEC	2017	46	8					894	906		10.1007/s13280-017-0925-7								WOS:000412998600006	28573598

Flowers Analyzed by Using An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)	REMOTE SENSING												Tree flowers are important for flower-insect relationships, seeds, fruits, and honey production. Flowers are difficult to analyze, particularly in complex ecosystems such as forests. However, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enable detailed analyses with high spatial resolution, and avoid destruction of sensitive ecosystems. In this study, we hypothesize that UAVs can be used to estimate the number of existing flowers, the quantity of nectar, and habitat potential for honeybees (Apis mellifera). To test this idea, in 2017 we combined UAV image analysis with manual counting and weighing of the flowers of eight-year-old black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) trees to calculate the number of flowers, their surface area, and their volume. Estimates of flower surface area ranged from 2.97 to 0.03% as the flying altitude above the crowns increased from 2.6 m to 92.6 m. Second, for the horizontal analysis, a 133 m(2) flower area at a one-hectare black locust plantation was monitored in 2017 by a UAV. Flower numbers ranged from 1913 to 15,559 per tree with an average surface area of 1.92 cm(2) and average volume of 5.96 cm(3). The UAV monitored 11% of the total surface and 3% of the total volume. Consequently, at the one-hectare black locust study area we estimate 5.3 million flowers (69 kg honey), which is sufficient for one bee hive to survive for one year.

The NDVI exploits spectral information from red and near infrared bands of Landsat images and it does not consider canopy background conditions hence it is affected by soil brightness which lowers its sensitivity to vegetation. As such NDVI may be insufficient in explaining tree species diversity. Meanwhile, the Landsat program also collects essential spectral information in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) region which is related to plant properties. The study was intended to: (i) explore the utility of spectral information across Landsat-8 spectrum using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and estimate alpha diversity (alpha-diversity) in the savannah woodland in southern Africa, and (ii) define the species diversity index (Shannon (H'), Simpson (D-2) and species richness (S) - defined as number of species in a community) that best relates to spectral variability on the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager dataset. We designed 90 m x 90 m field plots (n = 71) and identified all trees with a diameter at breast height (DbH) above 10 cm. H', D-2 and S were used to quantify tree species diversity within each plot and the corresponding spectral information on all Landsat-8 bands were extracted from each field plot. A stepwise linear regression was applied to determine the relationship between species diversity indices (H', D-2 and S) and Principal Components (PCs), vegetation indices and Gray Level Co occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture layers with calibration (n = 46) and test (n = 23) datasets. The results of regression analysis showed that the Simple Ratio Index derivative had a higher relationship with H', D-2 and S (r(2) = 0.36; r(2) = 0.41; r(2) = 0.24 respectively) compared to NDVI, EVI, SAVI or their derivatives. Moreover the Landsat-8 derived PCs also had a higher relationship with H' and D-2 (r(2) of 0.36 and 0.35 respectively) than the frequently used NDVI, and this was attributed to the utilization of the entire spectral content of Landsat-8 data. Our results indicate that: (i) the measurement scales of vegetation indices impact their sensitivity to vegetation characteristics and their ability to explain tree species diversity; (ii) principal components enhance the utility of Landsat-8 spectral data for estimating tree species diversity and (iii) species diversity indices that consider both species richness and abundance (H' and D-2) relates better with Landsat-8 spectral variables.

The eDNA technique is based on the analysis of DNA fragments in sampled water; thus, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV; drone) would be a useful way of collecting water for eDNA sampling, and may consequently allow us to extend eDNA surveys both spatially and temporally. Here, we developed a new method of water collection by using UAV with bleachable equipment, to avoid DNA contamination. To test the performance and contamination risk of UAV water sampling in eDNA surveys, we sampled water from a dam reservoir, detected eDNA from two fish species, and compared the water samples obtained by UAV with those obtained by boat. Additionally, we investigated contamination using blank samples. The results revealed that our UAV water sampling method performed similar to the boat sampling method. No positive signals were detected in the blank samples, including those used for UAV sampling, transportation, filtering, and PCR blanks. Our UAV method can be used to investigate species distributions using eDNA. Combinations of UAV technologies, including remote and thermal sensing, will enable efficient environmental monitoring in various waterbodies.

With increasing commercial agriculture and biodiversity conservation efforts in forested tropical regions, many shifting cultivation systems are being intensified and their extent restricted. Studies examining the consequences of such pressures commonly overlook the diminishing role of wild food. Using a combination of collection diaries, participant observation, remote sensing, and interviews, we examined the role of agriculture-forest landscapes in the provision of wild food in rapidly transforming shifting cultivation communities in northern Laos. We found that wild food contributed less to human diets in areas where pressure on land from commercial agriculture and conservation efforts was more intense. Our results demonstrate that increasing pressure on land creates changes in the shifting cultivation landscape and people's use thereof with negative effects on the quality of nutrition, including protein deficiency, especially in communities adjacent to core conservation areas. Our study shows the importance of adopting a more nutrition-sensitive approach to the linkages between commercial agriculture and biodiversity conservation (and the policies that promote them), wild food provisioning, and food security.

During the past two decades, however, severe grassland degradations of this region has been considered as the major ecological concern. In this study we took an interdisciplinary approach to investigate the impact of the historical land-use regimes to the observed degradation, by conducting an in-depth case study in a local pastoral village in the Nyanpo Yutse region. Firstly, we mapped historical land-use intensities (LUIs) of the study area at land-use transition time points of 1970s, 1984, 1994 and 2015 with oral history and participatory GIS (PGIS) approaches. Secondly, we conducted Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series analysis to detect the temporal and spatial patterns of the degradation. Thirdly, we discussed the causal relations between the land-use and land-cover changes. Livestock and pasture privatization from 1984 to 1994 created the land-use regime shift which resulted in a marked increase in LUIs and decreased pastoral mobility. The LUI increase in this transition period fostered the establishment of short-grass vegetation which facilitated the spreading of plateau pikas. The installment of iron fences as private pasture borders from 2004 to 2007 eventually started the onset of degradation. Our case study illustrates that the past land-use regime shift triggered the recent ecological regime shift in Nyanpo Yutse. Severe grassland degradation occurred with a time lag during which cumulative LUIs surpassed the vulnerability threshold of the biophysical system.

Improving models of urban greenspace: from vegetation surface cover to volumetric survey, using waveform laser scanning	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Urban greenspace has a major impact on human health and quality of life, and thus the way in which such green infrastructure is constructed, managed and maintained is of critical importance. A range of studies have demonstrated the relationship between the areal coverage and distribution of vegetation and the provision of multiple urban ecosystem services. It is not known how sensitive findings are to the spatial resolution of the underlying data relative to the grain size of urban land cover heterogeneity. Moreover, little is known about the three-dimensional (3D) structure of urban vegetation and delivery of services, and addressing such questions is limited by the availability of data describing canopy structure from the tree tops to the ground. Waveform airborne laser scanning (lidar) offers a new way of capturing 3D data describing vegetation structure. We generated voxels (volumetric pixels) from waveform lidar (1.5m resolution), differentiated vegetation layers using height as a determinant, and computed statistics on surface cover, volume and volume density per stratum. We then used a range of widely available remote sensing products with varying spatial resolution (1 to 100m) to map the same greenspace, and compared results to those from the waveform lidar survey. We focused on data from three urban zones in the UK with distinct patterns of vegetation cover. We found -3%, +7.5% and +26.1% differences in green surface cover compared with, respectively, town planning maps (<10m resolution), national land cover maps (25m) and European land cover maps (100m). There were differences of -59.1%, +12.4% and -2.4% in tree cover compared with global (30m resolution), European (25m) and national (1m) estimates. Waveform lidar captured sub-canopy structure and detected empty spaces in the understorey which contributed a 16% bias in the total green volume derived from non-waveform lidar observations. We conclude that waveform lidar has a key role to play in estimating important quantitative metrics of urban green infrastructure, which is important because urban greenspace is highly fragmented and shows high levels of spatial and volumetric heterogeneity.																	2041-210X	2041-2096				NOV	2017	8	11					1443	1452		10.1111/2041-210X.12794								WOS:000414701900006

A method for the objective selection of landscape-scale study regions and sites at the national level	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Ecological processes operating on large spatio-temporal scales are difficult to disentangle with traditional empirical approaches. Alternatively, researchers can take advantage of natural' experiments, where experimental control is exercised by careful site selection. Recent advances in developing protocols for designing these pseudo-experiments' commonly do not consider the selection of the focal region and predictor variables are usually restricted to two. Here, we advance this type of site selection protocol to study the impact of multiple landscape scale factors on pollinator abundance and diversity across multiple regions. Using datasets of geographic and ecological variables with national coverage, we applied a novel hierarchical computation approach to select study sites that contrast as much as possible in four key variables, while attempting to maintain regional comparability and national representativeness. There were three main steps to the protocol: (i) selection of six 100x100km(2) regions that collectively provided land cover representative of the national land average, (ii) mapping of potential sites into a multivariate space with axes representing four key factors potentially influencing insect pollinator abundance, and (iii) applying a selection algorithm which maximized differences between the four key variables, while controlling for a set of external constraints. Validation data for the site selection metrics were recorded alongside the collection of data on pollinator populations during two field campaigns. While the accuracy of the metric estimates varied, the site selection succeeded in objectively identifying field sites that differed significantly in values for each of the four key variables. Between-variable correlations were also reduced or eliminated, thus facilitating analysis of their separate effects. This study has shown that national datasets can be used to select randomized and replicated field sites objectively within multiple regions and along multiple interacting gradients. Similar protocols could be used for studying a range of alternative research questions related to land use or other spatially explicit environmental variables, and to identify networks of field sites for other countries, regions, drivers and response taxa in a wide range of scenarios.

In order to address these declines, decision-makers need accurate assessments of the status of and pressures on biodiversity. However, these are heavily constrained by incomplete and uneven spatial, temporal and taxonomic coverage. For instance, data from regions such as Europe and North America are currently used overwhelmingly for large-scale biodiversity assessments due to lesser availability of suitable data from other, more biodiversity-rich, regions. These data-poor regions are often those experiencing the strongest threats to biodiversity, however. There is therefore an urgent need to fill the existing gaps in global biodiversity monitoring. Here, we review current knowledge on best practice in capacity building for biodiversity monitoring and provide an overview of existing means to improve biodiversity data collection considering the different types of biodiversity monitoring data. Our review comprises insights from work in Africa, South America, Polar Regions and Europe; in government-funded, volunteer and citizen-based monitoring in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. The key steps to effectively building capacity in biodiversity monitoring are: identifying monitoring questions and aims; identifying the key components, functions, and processes to monitor; identifying the most suitable monitoring methods for these elements, carrying out monitoring activities; managing the resultant data; and interpreting monitoring data. Additionally, biodiversity monitoring should use multiple approaches including extensive and intensive monitoring through volunteers and professional scientists but also harnessing new technologies. Finally, we call on the scientific community to share biodiversity monitoring data, knowledge and tools to ensure the accessibility, interoperability, and reporting of biodiversity data at a global scale.

Joseph; Weisrock, David W.; Jacobsen, Dean			Climate change and alpine stream biology: progress, challenges, and opportunities for the future	BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS												In alpine regions worldwide, climate change is dramatically altering ecosystems and affecting biodiversity in many ways. For streams, receding alpine glaciers and snowfields, paired with altered precipitation regimes, are driving shifts in hydrology, species distributions, basal resources, and threatening the very existence of some habitats and biota. Alpine streams harbour substantial species and genetic diversity due to significant habitat insularity and environmental heterogeneity. Climate change is expected to affect alpine stream biodiversity across many levels of biological resolution from micro- to macroscopic organisms and genes to communities. Herein, we describe the current state of alpine stream biology from an organism-focused perspective. We begin by reviewing seven standard and emerging approaches that combine to form the current state of the discipline. We follow with a call for increased synthesis across existing approaches to improve understanding of how these imperiled ecosystems are responding to rapid environmental change. We then take a forward-looking viewpoint on how alpine stream biologists can make better use of existing data sets through temporal comparisons, integrate remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) technologies, and apply genomic tools to refine knowledge of underlying evolutionary processes. We conclude with comments about the future of biodiversity conservation in alpine streams to confront the daunting challenge of mitigating the effects of rapid environmental change in these sentinel ecosystems.

J	Marechaux, I; Chave, J				Marechaux, Isabelle; Chave, Jerome			An individual-based forest model to jointly simulate carbon and tree diversity in Amazonia: description and applications	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Forest dynamic models predict the current and future states of ecosystems and are a nexus between physiological processes and empirical data, forest plot inventories and remote-sensing information. The problem of biodiversity representation in these models has long been an impediment to a detailed understanding of ecosystem processes. This challenge is amplified in species-rich and high-carbon tropical forests. Here we describe an individual-based and spatially explicit forest growth simulator, TROLL, that integrates recent advances in plant physiology. Processes (carbon assimilation, allocation, reproduction, and mortality) are linked to species-specific functional traits, and the model was parameterized for an Amazonian tropical rainforest. We simulated a forest regeneration experiment from bare soil, and we validated it against observations at our sites. Simulated forest regeneration compared well with observations for stem densities, gross primary productivity, aboveground biomass, and floristic composition. After 500years of regrowth, the simulated forest displayed structural characteristics similar to observations (e.g., leaf area index and trunk diameter distribution). We then assessed the model's sensitivity to a number of key model parameters: light extinction coefficient and carbon quantum yield, and to a lesser extent mortality rate, and carbon allocation, all influenced ecosystem features. To illustrate the potential of the approach, we tested whether variation in species richness and composition influenced ecosystem properties. Overall, species richness had a positive effect on ecosystem processes, but this effect was controlled by the identity of species rather by richness per se. Also, functional trait community means had a stronger effect than functional diversity on ecosystem processes. TROLL should be applicable to many tropical forests sites, and data requirement is tailored to ongoing trait collection efforts. Such a model should foster the dialogue between ecology and the vegetation modeling community, help improve the predictive power of models, and eventually better inform policy choices.

J	Richards, DR; Friess, DA				Richards, Daniel R.; Friess, Daniel A.			Characterizing Coastal Ecosystem Service Trade-offs with Future Urban Development in a Tropical City	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												With rapid urbanization in the coastal zone and increasing habitat losses, it is imperative to understand how urban development affects coastal biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. Furthermore, it is important to understand how habitat fragments can best be incorporated into broader land use planning and coastal management, in order to maximize the environmental benefits they provide. In this study, we characterized the trade-offs between (a) urban development and individual mangrove environmental indicators (habitat quality and ecosystem services), and (b) between different environmental indicators in the tropical nation of Singapore. A range of biological, biophysical, and cultural indicators, including carbon, charcoal production, support for offshore fisheries, recreation, and habitat quality for a threatened species were quantified using field-based, remote sensing, and expert survey methods. The shape of the trade-off Pareto frontiers was analyzed to assess the sensitivity of environmental indicators for development. When traded off individually with urban development, four out of five environmental indicators were insensitive to development, meaning that relatively minor degradation of the indicator occurred while development was below a certain threshold, although indicator loss accelerated once this threshold was reached. Most of the pairwise relationships between the five environmental indicators were synergistic; only carbon storage and charcoal production, and charcoal production and recreational accessibility showed trade-offs. Trade-off analysis and land use optimization using Pareto frontiers could be a useful decision-support tool for understanding how changes in land use and coastal management will impact the ability of ecosystems to provide environmental benefits.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				NOV	2017	60	5					961	973		10.1007/s00267-017-0924-2								WOS:000412755900012	28835991

Pelagic bioregionalisation using open-access data for better planning of marine protected area networks	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Systematic conservation planning (SCP) to design marine protected areas (MPAs) has traditionally focused on species distributions or benthic habitat features that drive the determination of conservation priorities. Pelagic ecosystem protection is usually incidental because these ecosystems are often data poor and are difficult to visualize in a planning context. Pelagic ecosystems, however, face increasing and cumulative impacts from threats such as overfishing and climate change, and a precautionary approach is required to protect both known and unknown biodiversity patterns and ecosystem processes. Data-driven pelagic habitat classifications are important when planning for habitat protection in the absence of sufficient in-situ data. In this study, we describe a method for creating a bioregional map of the upper-mixed layer of South Africa's pelagic realm. We selected relevant variables and parameters that best reflect key ecosystem properties at broad, meso, and local scales. We conducted a hierarchal cluster analysis using open-access sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll-a (chl-a), net primary productivity (NPP), mean sea level anomalies (MSLA), and seabed slope and depth data. The resulting map delineates three bioregions subdivided into seven biozones and sixteen pelagic habitats within South Africa's continental Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). This habitat map was incorporated into SCP of a proposed expanded MPA network that includes offshore protected areas and meets National objectives. The proposed network will increase protection of the pelagic realm (>30 m depth) of the EEZ from 0.002% to 6.0%. We contend that bioregional analyses based on publicly available remote-sensing data are useful for identification of offshore habitats, especially when robust biological data are unavailable, as a framework for ecosystem reporting, and for inclusion in a systematic design for a representative offshore MPA network. Further research should focus on modelling and mapping the permanence of pelagic habitats and different spatio-temporal scales of variability, validating habitat boundaries with biological data, and understanding the threats and efficacy of achieving pelagic protection through management mechanisms like MPAs.

In floodplain forests, historical pressures interplay with the complex multiscale dynamics of fluvial systems and require integrative approaches to pinpoint drivers for their deterioration and ecosystem services loss. Combining a conceptual framework such as the Driver Pressure -State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) with the development of valid biological indicators can contribute to the analysis of the driving forces and their effects on the ecosystem in order to formulate coordinated conservation measures. In the present study, we evaluate the initial results of a decade (2004-2014) of floodplain forest monitoring. We adopted the DPSIR framework to summarize the main drivers in land use and environmental change, analyzed the effects on biological indicators of foundation trees and compared the consistency of the main drivers and their effects at two spatial scales. The" monitoring program was conducted in one of the largest and best preserved floodplain forests in SW Europe located within Dofiana National Park (Spain) which is dominated by Salix atrocinerea and Fraxinus angustifolia. The program combined field (in situ) surveys on a network of permanent plots with several remote sensing sources. The accuracy obtained in spectral classifications allowed shifts in species cover across the whole forest to be detected and assessed. However, remote sensing did not reflect the ecological status of forest populations. The field survey revealed a general decline in Salix populations, especially in the first five years of sampling a factor probably associated with a lag effect from past human impact on the hydrology of the catchment and recent extreme climatic episodes (drought). In spite of much reduced seed regeneration, a resprouting strategy allows long-lived Salix individuals to persist in complex spatial dynamics. This suggests the beginning of a recovery resulting from recent coordinated societal responses to control excessive water extraction in the catchment, highlighting the need for continuing long-term monitoring. The DPSIR framework proved useful as a conceptual tool in analyzing the entire environmental system, while both field and remote sensing approaches complemented each other in quantifying indicator trends, improving the monitoring design and informing conservation plans.

Novel fine-scale aerial mapping approach quantifies grassland weed cover dynamics and response to management	PLOS ONE												Invasive weeds threaten the biodiversity and forage productivity of grasslands worldwide. However, management of these weeds is constrained by the practical difficulty of detecting small-scale infestations across large landscapes and by limits in understanding of landscape- scale invasion dynamics, including mechanisms that enable patches to expand, contract, or remain stable. While high-end hyperspectral remote sensing systems can effectively map vegetation cover, these systems are currently too costly and limited in availability for most land managers. We demonstrate application of a more accessible and cost-effective remote sensing approach, based on simple aerial imagery, for quantifying weed cover dynamics over time. In California annual grasslands, the target communities of interest include invasive weedy grasses (Aegilops triuncialis and Elymus caput-medusae) and desirable forage grass species (primarily Avena spp. and Bromus spp.). Detecting invasion of annual grasses into an annual-dominated community is particularly challenging, but we were able to consistently characterize these two communities based on their phenological differences in peak growth and senescence using maximum likelihood supervised classification of imagery acquired twice per year (in mid-and end-of season). This approach permitted us to map weed-dominated cover at a 1-m scale (correctly detecting 93% of weed patches across the landscape) and to evaluate weed cover change over time. We found that weed cover was more pervasive and persistent in management units that had no significant grazing for several years than in those that were grazed, whereas forage cover was more abundant and stable in the grazed units. This application demonstrates the power of this method for assessing fine-scale vegetation transitions across heterogeneous landscapes. It thus provides means for small-scale early detection of invasive species and for testing fundamental questions about landscape dynamics.

Modelling patterns of pollinator species richness and diversity using satellite image texture	PLOS ONE												Assessing species richness and diversity on the basis of standardised field sampling effort represents a cost-and time-consuming method. Satellite remote sensing (RS) can help overcome these limitations because it facilitates the collection of larger amounts of spatial data using cost-effective techniques. RS information is hence increasingly analysed to model biodiversity across space and time. Here, we focus on image texture measures as a proxy for spatial habitat heterogeneity, which has been recognized as an important determinant of species distributions and diversity. Using bee monitoring data of four years (2010-2013) from six 4 x 4 km field sites across Central Germany and a multimodel inference approach we test the ability of texture features derived from Landsat-TM imagery to model local pollinator biodiversity. Textures were shown to reflect patterns of bee diversity and species richness to some extent, with the first-order entropy texture and terrain roughness being the most relevant indicators. However, the texture measurements accounted for only 3-5% of up to 60% of the variability that was explained by our final models, although the results are largely consistent across different species groups (bumble bees, solitary bees). While our findings provide indications in support of the applicability of satellite imagery textures for modeling patterns of bee biodiversity, they are inconsistent with the high predictive power of texture metrics reported in previous studies for avian biodiversity. We assume that our texture data captured mainly heterogeneity resulting from landscape configuration, which might be functionally less important for wild bees than compositional diversity of plant communities. Our study also highlights the substantial variability among taxa in the applicability of texture metrics for modelling biodiversity.

Satellite imagery is useful for assessing particle transport from land to sea. However, in the oligotrophic and shallow waters of tropical lagoons, the bottom reflection of downwelling light usually hampers the use of classical optical algorithms. In order to address this issue, a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model was developed and tested. The proposed application concerns the lagoon of New Caledoniathe second longest continuous coral reef in the worldwhich is frequently exposed to river plumes from ultramafic watersheds. The SVR model is based on a large training sample of in-situ turbidity values representative of the annual variability in the Voh-Kone-Pouembout lagoon (Western Coast of New Caledonia) during the 2014-2015 period and on coincident satellite reflectance values from MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). It was trained with reflectance and two other explanatory parametersbathymetry and bottom colour. This approach significantly improved the model's capacity for retrieving the in-situ turbidity range from MODIS images, as compared with algorithms dedicated to deep oligotrophic or turbid waters, which were shown to be inadequate. This SVR model is applicable to the whole shallow lagoon waters from the Western Coast of New Caledonia and it is now ready to be tested over other oligotrophic shallow lagoon waters worldwide.

In order to understand what physical geographers can do to enhance sustainability, this paper describes a systematic review of peer-reviewed research on sustainability published in three physical geography journals. The results show that physical geographers are active in sustainability research in terms of a spatial perspective, an understanding of human interactions with the environment, and an ability to recognize, interpret, and project environmental change and its impacts. The depth of this understanding is facilitated by a physical geographers' understanding of the natural world, process and system concepts, the ways that systems are linked and interact, and a willingness to deploy a wide range of methodologies to secure that knowledge.

Mapping and Attributing Normalized Difference Vegetation Index Trends for Nepal	REMOTE SENSING												Global change affects vegetation cover and processes through multiple pathways. Long time series of surface land surface properties derived from satellite remote sensing give unique abilities to observe these changes, particularly in areas with complex topography and limited research infrastructure. Here, we focus on Nepal, a biodiversity hotspot where vegetation productivity is limited by moisture availability (dominated by a summer monsoon) at lower elevations and by temperature at high elevations. We analyze the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from 1981 to 2015 semimonthly, at an 8 km spatial resolution. We use a random forest (RF) of regression trees to generate a statistical model of the NDVI as a function of elevation, land use, CO2 level, temperature, and precipitation. We find that the NDVI increased over the studied period, particularly at low and middle elevations and during the fall (post-monsoon). We infer from the fitted RF model that the NDVI linear trend is primarily due to CO2 level (or another environmental parameter that is changing quasi-linearly), and not primarily due to temperature or precipitation trends. On the other hand, interannual fluctuation in the NDVI is more correlated with temperature and precipitation. The RF accurately fits the available data and shows promise for estimating trends and testing hypotheses about their causes.																	2072-4292					OCT	2017	9	10							986	10.3390/rs9100986								WOS:000414650600016

The Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH) assumes that the Spectral Heterogeneity (SH) measured from remote sensing data can be used as a proxy for species diversity. Here, we argue the hypothesis that the grassland's species differ in their phenology and, hence, that the temporal variations can be used in addition to the spectral variations. The purpose of this study is to attempt verifying the SVH in grasslands using the temporal information provided by dense Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) with a high spatial resolution. Our method to assess the spectro-temporal heterogeneity is based on a clustering of grasslands using a robust technique for high dimensional data. We propose new SH measures derived from this clustering and computed at the grassland level. We compare them to the Mean Distance to Centroid (MDC). The method is experimented on 192 grasslands from southwest France using an intra-annual multispectral SPOT5 SITS comprising 18 images and using single images from this SITS. The combination of two of the proposed SH measures-the within-class variability and the entropy-in a multivariate linear model explained the variance of the grasslands' Shannon index more than the MDC. However, there were no significant differences between the predicted values issued from the best models using multitemporal and monotemporal imagery. We conclude that multitemporal data at a spatial resolution of 10 m do not contribute to estimating the species diversity. The temporal variations may be more related to the effect of management practices.																	2072-4292					OCT	2017	9	10							993	10.3390/rs9100993								WOS:000414650600023						
J	Mulatu, KA; Mora, B; Kooistra, L; Herold, M				Mulatu, Kalkidan Ayele; Mora, Brice; Kooistra, Lammert; Herold, Martin			Biodiversity Monitoring in Changing Tropical Forests: A Review of Approaches and New Opportunities	REMOTE SENSING												Tropical forests host at least two-thirds of the world's flora and fauna diversity and store 25% of the terrestrial above and belowground carbon. However, biodiversity decline due to deforestation and forest degradation of tropical forest is increasing at an alarming rate. Biodiversity dynamics due to natural and anthropogenic disturbances are mainly monitored using established field survey approaches. However, such approaches appear to fall short at addressing complex disturbance factors and responses. We argue that the integration of state-of-the-art monitoring approaches can improve the detection of subtle biodiversity disturbances and responses in changing tropical forests, which are often data-poor. We assess the state-of-the-art technologies used to monitor biodiversity dynamics of changing tropical forests, and how their potential integration can increase the detail and accuracy of biodiversity monitoring. Moreover, the relevance of these biodiversity monitoring techniques in support of the UNCBD Aichi targets was explored using the Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) as a framework. Our review indicates that although established field surveys were generally the dominant monitoring systems employed, the temporal trend of monitoring approaches indicates the increasing application of remote sensing and in -situ sensors in detecting disturbances related to agricultural activities, logging, hunting and infrastructure. The relevance of new technologies (i.e., remote sensing, in situ sensors, and DNA barcoding) in operationalising EBVs (especially towards the ecosystem structure, ecosystem function, and species population classes) and the Aichi targets has been assessed. Remote sensing application is limited for EBV classes such as genetic composition and species traits but was found most suitable for ecosystem structure class. The complementarity of remote sensing and emerging technologies were shown in relation to EBV candidates such as species distribution, net primary productivity, and habitat structure. We also developed a framework based on the primary biodiversity attributes, which indicated the potential of integration between monitoring approaches. In situ sensors are suitable to help measure biodiversity composition, while approaches based on remote sensing are powerful for addressing structural and functional biodiversity attributes. We conclude that, synergy between the recent biodiversity monitoring approaches is important and possible. However, testing the suitability of monitoring methods across scales, integrating heterogeneous monitoring technologies, setting up metadata standards, and making interpolation and/or extrapolation from observation at different scales is still required to design a robust biodiversity monitoring system that can contribute to effective conservation measures.

J	Akinyemi, FO				Akinyemi, Felicia O.			Land change in the central Albertine rift: Insights from analysis and mapping of land use-land cover change in north-western Rwanda	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Land change was assessed in the Albertine rift region (ARR) using its central section of north-western Rwanda as case study. This region is one of Africa's most ecologically sensitive environments under severe pressure from human activities. The study maps and quantifies the spatial extent of land use-land cover (LULC) changes between 1987 and 2016 from Landsat images. Transitions between five major land classes were identified in order to understand the trajectory of observed changes. In terms of gains, the forest class, the urban built-up and bare land class increased by 9% and 4% respectively over the study period. The gains of forest were mainly derived from the afforestation of some agricultural lands in the southern part, whereas the gains of built-up and bare lands were mostly from cultivated land which was a net losing class. Forest increase is in line with government's policy to increase the national forest cover to 30% by 2020. Forest losses occurred mostly outside protected areas due to land conversion for settlement and agricultural purposes. Much needed information about changes in LULC over the last three decades is provided. This study demonstrates in a timely manner how to analyse and monitor LULC change and the drivers in an environment where field based research is a challenge due to the mountainous terrain. The ecological richness of the region, which coincides with heightened human population pressure, necessitates the monitoring of land change as input for improving land use planning with focus on conserving biodiversity.

Sites were selected to be homogeneous at a coarse remote sensing resolution (10-100m) in apparent color, morphology, moisture, and grain size, with best-effort realism in numbers of locations and replicates. Three different biomarker assays (counting of nucleic-acid-stained cells via fluorescent microscopy, a luciferin/luciferase assay for adenosine triphosphate, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to detect DNA associated with bacteria, archaea, and fungi) were characterized at four nested spatial scales (1m, 10m, 100m, and >1km) by using five common metrics for sample site representativeness (sample mean variance, group F tests, pairwise t tests, and the distribution-free rank sum H and u tests). Correlations between all assays were characterized with Spearman's rank test. The bioluminescence assay showed the most variance across the sites, followed by qPCR for bacterial and archaeal DNA; these results could not be considered representative at the finest resolution tested (1m). Cell concentration and fungal DNA also had significant local variation, but they were homogeneous over scales of >1km. These results show that the selection of life detection assays and the number, distribution, and location of sampling sites in a low biomass environment with limited a priori characterization can yield both contrasting and complementary results, and that their interdependence must be given due consideration to maximize science return in future biomarker sampling expeditions.

J	Naumov, V; Angelstam, P; Elbakidze, M				Naumov, Vladimir; Angelstam, Per; Elbakidze, Marine			Satisfying rival forestry objectives in the Komi Republic: effects of Russian zoning policy change on wood production and riparian forest conservation	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												Spatial segregation of different forest landscape functions can accommodate rival forestry objectives more comprehensively than integrated approaches. Russia has a unique history of forest zoning separating production and environmental functions. However, the Russian Forest Code of 2006 increased the focus on wood production. We reviewed the history of zoning policy in Russia and assessed if the recent policy change affected logging rates and conservation of riparian forests. Using Russia's Komi Republic as a case study, we specifically assessed (i) if policy change led to increased logging near streams, (ii) if logging rates were different in headwaters vs. main rivers, and (iii) how logging changed among catchments with different accessibility to logging. Using a global open-access remote sensing dataset, we compared mean annual forest loss as a proxy of logging rates in 10 large forested catchments in the Komi Republic in one period with strict zoning policy (2000-2006) and one with moderate zoning policy (2007-2014). Harvesting rate was positively related to the distance from streams. On the other hand, it increased after the policy change in the buffer zone but decreased outside it. Forests were harvested more in headwater buffers than along larger rivers, and harvest in the catchments near industries was higher and increasing; remote catchments had low forest loss. We discuss the opportunity for adopting forest zoning policy in different governance contexts.																	0045-5067	1208-6037				OCT	2017	47	10					1339	1349		10.1139/cjfr-2016-0516								WOS:000413923400004						
J	Liu, J; Skidmore, AK; Heurich, M; Wang, TJ				Liu, Jing; Skidmore, Andrew K.; Heurich, Marco; Wang, Tiejun			Significant effect of topographic normalization of airborne LiDAR data on the retrieval of plant area index profile in mountainous forests	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												As an important metric for describing vertical forest structure, the plant area index (PAI) profile is used for many applications including biomass estimation and wildlife habitat assessment. PAI profiles can be estimated with the vertically resolved gap fraction from airborne LiDAR data. Most research utilizes a height normalization algorithm to retrieve local or relative height by assuming the terrain to be flat. However, for many forests this assumption is not valid. In this research, the effect of topographic normalization of airborne LiDAR data on the retrieval of PAI profile was studied in a mountainous forest area in Germany. Results show that, although individual tree height may be retained after topographic normalization, the spatial arrangement of trees is changed. Specifically, topographic normalization vertically condenses and distorts the PAI profile, which consequently alters the distribution pattern of plant area density in space. This effect becomes more evident as the slope increases. Furthermore, topographic normalization may also undermine the complexity (i.e., canopy layer number and entropy) of the PAI profile. The decrease in PAI profile complexity is not solely determined by local topography, but is determined by the interaction between local topography and the spatial distribution of each tree. This research demonstrates that when calculating the PAI profile from airborne LiDAR data, local topography needs to be taken into account. We therefore suggest that for ecological applications, such as vertical forest structure analysis and modeling of biodiversity, topographic normalization should not be applied in non-flat areas when using LiDAR data.

Since human activities as well as natural disturbances pose major threats to the coral reefs, these livelihoods may also be at risk. Currently, no comprehensive information on the status and condition of coral reefs in this area is available for this resource management. We determined the changes of coral reef habitat over a period of 20 years from 1994 to 2014 using a satellite Landsat multi-temporal image substantiated with in situ measurement data collected in 2014. The spectral value of coral reefs was extracted from multi-temporal Landsat imagery data, while the diffuse attenuation coefficient of water was obtained by using statistical analysis between the ratio of live coral cover and the spectral value of the visible bands. By using the unsupervised classification integrated with the data ground truth, it is stated that there has been a decline in live coral cover over a period of 20 years from 7716 ha in 1994 to 4236 ha in 2014, with a degradation rate of 174 ha/year. Based on the results, the ratio of the coral cover in the coral reef transects varied from the average of 24% for live corals to 96% for coral rubbles, implying the degraded status of coral reefs in the study area.																	0916-8370	1573-868X				OCT	2017	73	5					623	645		10.1007/s10872-017-0422-4								WOS:000412313300008

Development of National Database on Long-term Deforestation in Sri Lanka	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Sri Lanka is one of the biodiversity hotspots of the world. This study has utilized satellite remote sensing and GIS techniques to generate a nation-wide database on forests, forest types and land use/land cover of Sri Lanka. Spatial assessment of forest cover changes was carried out for the periods 1976-1985, 1985-1994, 1994-2005 and 2005-2014. The landscape fragmentation analysis has carried out to calculate the spatial and temporal patterns of forest. Land use/land cover map was prepared representing seven classes in 2014. The plantations occupy a large area (34.2%) followed by forests (33.4%) and agriculture (26.1%) in 2014. During the period of 1976-2014, the forest has been decreased by 5.5%. From 1976 to 1985 forest recorded a loss at an annual rate of 0.49%. This annual rate decreased to 0.01% during 2005-2014 indicates declining trend of deforestation and effective conservation measures. The study found deforestation hotspots in south east and northern most parts of the Sri Lanka. Total number of patches estimated has increased from 15193 in 1976 to 16136 in 2014. The study has found that main causes of deforestation in Sri Lanka were due to expansion of agriculture and plantations. The extent of change detected in the study through geospatial techniques has significance to the forest ecology and management of natural landscapes in Sri Lanka.																	0255-660X	0974-3006				OCT	2017	45	5					825	836		10.1007/s12524-016-0636-8								WOS:000413689600010

Fungi are a megadiverse taxonomic group where lack of knowledge impedes sufficient conservation focus. Inventories of fungi require a high level of expertise and are difficult and expensive due to seasonal variation and fluctuation in sporocarp formation. Lidar offers objective, fine-resolution and potentially cheap and broad scale data for representing vegetation structure and has proven useful for prediction of the diversity of plant and animal species. In this study, we used lidar-derived variables as explanatory variables in models of fungal species richness and controlling gradients of species composition, represented by three ordination axes derived from multidimensional scaling. The fungal data comprised a data set of 1527 species recorded in three inventories of 121 sites covering all major terrestrial habitat types across Denmark. We compared the performance of lidar-derived explanatory variables with two field inventory-based sets of variables: 1) lists of vascular plants and 2) recordings of soil, microclimate and vegetation structure. Lidar-derived variables performed best in predicting fungal richness and the first ordination axis, interpreted as a gradient from low and open herb-dominated communities over Closed swards and scrubs to closed-canopy forests (cross validated r(2) of 0.50 and 0.81, respectively). The number of red-listed species and the second ordination axis were poorly predicted by lidar, and the third ordination axis was equally well detected by the three explanatory sets of variables (cross validated r(2) of 0.38). From a fungal conservation perspective, it is promising that lidar-based variables hold information suitable for detecting major gradients in fungal richness and composition.

J	Andrew, ME; Warrener, H				Andrew, Margaret E.; Warrener, Haylea			Detecting microrefugia in semi-arid landscapes from remotely sensed vegetation dynamics	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Microrefugia are sites with stable, high quality habitat within landscapes characterized by dynamic environmental conditions driven by climate variability or ecological disturbances. There is considerable interest in the potential of microrefugia to provide climate change resilience to landscapes and to biodiversity conservation. Although attractive conceptually, there is yet little guidance on how to identify climate change microrefugia in order to study and protect them, and the data required to do so are often lacking. This study demonstrates how time series remote sensing, using all available Landsat images of a study area, can be used to directly detect microrefugia maintained by water subsidies in a semi-arid landscape in southwest Western Australia. Microrefugia were identified as pixels with abundant vegetation and consistent vegetation dynamics between wet and dry years. At every pixel, a harmonic model was fit to the intra-annual time series of vegetation index values compiled from the wettest years in the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) archive. This model was then used to predict the phenological cycle of the driest years at that pixel. Candidate microrefugia were defined to be those pixels with (1) high vegetation activity in dry years and (2) highly predictable phenologies that are consistent regardless of the weather conditions experienced in a given year. Spatial relationships between candidate microrefugia and landscape features associated with elevated moisture availability (thought to drive climate microrefugia in these semi-arid landscapes) were assessed. The candidate microrefugia show great promise. Evaluations against high-resolution imagery reveal that candidate microrefugia most likely buffer against drought, although refugia from other disturbances, especially fire, were also detected. In contrast, spatial proxies of the physical features expected to maintain microrefugia failed to adequately represent the distribution of microrefugia across the landscape, likely due to data quality and the heterogeneity of microrefugia. Direct detection of microrefugia with Earth observation data is a promising solution in data limited regions. Landsat time series analyses are well suited to this application as they can characterize both the habitat quality and stability aspects of microrefugia.																	0034-4257	1879-0704				OCT	2017	200						114	124		10.1016/j.rse.2017.08.005								WOS:000412607600009						
J	Liu, LX; Coops, NC; Aven, NW; Pang, Y				Liu, Luxia; Coops, Nicholas C.; Aven, Neal W.; Pang, Yong			Mapping urban tree species using integrated airborne hyperspectral and LiDAR remote sensing data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Mapping tree species within urban areas is essential for sustainable urban planning as well as to improve our understanding of the role of urban vegetation as an ecological service. Urban trees contribute significantly in mitigating the urban heat island effect and supporting biodiversity. However, accurate and up-to-date mapping of urban tree species is difficult because of the time-consuming nature of field sampling, fine-scale spatial variation, and potentially high species diversity. Advanced remote sensing data such as airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) with high pulse density (25 point/m(2)) and hyperspectral imagery offer two different yet complementary approaches to estimating crown structure and canopy physiological information at the individual crown scale, which can be useful for mapping tree species. In this paper, we evaluate the potential of these technologies to map 15 common urban tree species using a Random Forest (RF) classifier in the City of Surrey, British Columbia, Canada. LiDAR-derived crown structural information was combined with hyper spectral-derived spectral vegetation indices for species classification. Results indicate an overall accuracy of 51.1%, 61.0%, and 70.0% using hyperspectral, LiDAR and the combined data respectively. The overall accuracy for the two most important and iconic native coniferous species improved markedly from 78.3% up to 91% using the combined data. The results of this research highlight that (1) the combination of structural and spectral information provided an improved classification accuracy than when used separately, and variables derived from LiDAR data contributed more to the accurate prediction of species than hyperspectral features; (2) higher classification accuracies were observed for evergreen species, species with distinguishable crown structure, and species undergoing flowering; (3) and finally the anthocyanin content index and photochemical reflectance index were the most important hyperspectral features for the discrimination of tree species in the spring bud burst stage.																	0034-4257	1879-0704				OCT	2017	200						170	182		10.1016/j.rse.2017.08.010								WOS:000412607600013

Prioritizing landscapes for restoration based on spatial patterns of ecosystem controls and plant-plant interactions	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. The widespread degradation of natural ecosystems requires cost-efficient restoration techniques that minimize risk and consider context-specific restoration conditions. However, meeting these demands can be difficult because information on ecosystem-level factors controlling vegetation and continuous spatial data on species interactions are often lacking. 2. Using airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data from a Hawaiian dry forest, we delineated crowns and assessed the 3D structure of more than 700 000 shrubs and trees. We used Random Forest machine learning to assess the relative importance of resource availability, environmental conditions, and disturbance regimes on canopy density. We then modelled and scaled up plant-plant interactions (i.e. potential nursery effects) to landscape units using a LiDAR-derived Canopy Coalescence (CC) index. We used the relative importance of ecosystem factors, canopy cover, and CC index to prioritize landscapes for restoration. 3. Here, we demonstrate a methodological framework that prioritizes landscapes in need of restoration (i.e. planting woody species) using two ecological perspectives: (i) ecosystem-level controls on remnant woody vegetation, and (ii) potential interactions between established canopies and seedlings (e.g. nursery effect, competition). 4. Our results highlight the heterogeneous nature of ecosystem-level drivers affecting forest structure along elevation gradients. Consequently, the degree of potential nursery interactions between established canopies and seedlings at the landscape-scale was context-specific. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our study provides a methodological approach that prioritizes landscapes for restoration by identifying the main controls on tree spatial distribution and by inferring the favourable conditions for seedlings. This approach can guide land managers to define cost-efficient restoration strategies for large ecological areas.

Should I stay or should I go? Modelling year-round habitat suitability and drivers of residency for fin whales in the California Current	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim: Understanding the spatial ecology of endangered species is crucial to predicting habitat use at scales relevant to conservation and management. Here, we aim to model the influence of biophysical conditions on habitat suitability for endangered fin whales Balaenoptera physalus, with a view to informing management in a heavily impacted ocean region. Location: We satellite-tracked the movements of 67 fin whales through the California Current System (CCS), a dynamic eastern boundary upwelling ecosystem in the Northeast Pacific. Methods: We use a multi-scale modelling framework to elucidate biophysical influences on habitat suitability for fin whales in the CCS. Using generalized additive mixed models, we quantify the influence of a suite of remotely sensed variables on broad-scale patterns of occupancy and present the first year-round, high-resolution predictions of seasonal habitat suitability. Further, we model the influence of contemporaneous biophysical conditions on individual-level residence times in high-use habitat. Results: We present evidence of year-round habitat suitability in the southern California Current System, robust to interannual variability, establishing that North Pacific fin whales do not follow the canonical baleen whale migration model. Within the high-use habitat in the Southern California Bight (SCB), individual-level residency in localized areas (n = 16 for > 30 days; n = 4 for > 6 months) was associated with warm, shallow, nearshore waters (> 18 degrees C, < 500 m), with cool waters (14-15 degrees C) occurring over complex seafloor topographies and with convergent (sub) mesoscale structures at the surface. Main Conclusions: Biophysical conditions in the southern CCS generate productive foraging habitats that can support the fin whale population year-round and allow for extended periods of residency in localized areas. High-use habitats for fin whales are colocated with areas of intense human use, including international shipping routes and a major naval training range. Seasonal habitat suitability maps presented here could inform the management of anthropogenic threats to endangered baleen whales in this globally significant biodiversity hotspot.

J	Cao, S; Sanchez-Azofeifa, A				Cao, Sen; Sanchez-Azofeifa, Arturo			Modeling seasonal surface temperature variations in secondary tropical dry forests	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Secondary tropical dry forests (TDFs) provide important ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, and nutrient cycle regulation. However, their biogeophysical processes at the canopy atmosphere interface remain unknown, limiting our understanding of how this endangered ecosystem influences, and responds to the ongoing global warming. To facilitate future development of conservation policies, this study characterized the seasonal land surface temperature (LST) behavior of three successional stages (early, intermediate, and late) of a TDF, at the Santa Rosa National Park (SRNP), Costa Rica. A total of 38 Landsat-8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) data and the Surface Reflectance (SR) product were utilized to model LST time series from July 2013 to July 2016 using a radiative transfer equation (RTE) algorithm. We further related the LST time series to seven vegetation indices which reflect different properties of TDFs, and soil moisture data obtained from a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Results showed that the LST in the dry season was 15-20 K higher than in the wet season at SRNP. We found that the early successional stages were about 6-8 K warmer than the intermediate successional stages and were 9-10 K warmer than the late successional stages in the middle of the dry season; meanwhile, a minimum LST difference (0-1 K) was observed at the end of the wet season. Leaf phenology and canopy architecture explained most LST variations in both dry and wet seasons. However, our analysis revealed that it is precipitation that ultimately determines the LST variations through both biogeochemical (leaf phenology) and biogeophysical processes (evapotranspiration) of the plants. Results of this study could help physiological modeling studies in secondary TDFs.																	0303-2434					OCT	2017	62						122	134		10.1016/j.jag.2017.06.008								WOS:000408787100012						
J	Lin, ZH; Qi, JG				Lin, Zihan; Qi, Jiaguo			Hydro-dam - A nature-based solution or an ecological problem: The fate of the Tonle Sap Lake	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Recent proliferation of hydro-dams was one of the nature-based solutions to meet the increasing demand for energy and food in the Lower Mekong River Basin (LMRB). While construction of these hydro-dams generated some hydropower and facilitated expansion of irrigated lands, it also significantly altered the basin-wide hydrology and subsequently impacted wetland ecosystems. Unintended adverse consequences of ecosystem services from lakes and wetlands offset the intended gains in hydroelectricity and irrigated agriculture. The trade-offs between gains in energy and food production and losses in aquatic ecosystem services were perceived to be significant but knowledge of the magnitude, spatial extent, and type of ecosystem services change is lacking and, therefore, the question whether the hydro-dam is an optimized solution or a potential ecological problem remains unanswered. In this study, as the first step to answer this question and using the Tonle Sap Lake as an example, we quantified one of the impacts of hydro-dams on lake ecosystem's phenology in terms of open water area, a critical ecological characteristic that affects lake systems' fish production, biodiversity, and livelihoods of the local communities. We used the MODIS-NDVI time series, forecast function and the Mann-Kendall trend test method to first quantify the open water area, analyzed its changes over time, and then performed correlation analysis with climate variables to disentangle dam impacts. The results showed reduced hydro-periods, diminishing lake seasonality and a declining trend in Tonle Sap Lake open water area over the past 15 years. These changes were insignificantly related to climatic influence during the same period. It is concluded that basin-wide hydro-dam construction and associated agricultural irrigation were deemed to be the primary cause of these ecological changes. Further analyses of changes in the lake's ecosystem services, including provision and cultural services, need to be carried out in order to have a holistic understanding of the trade-offs brought by the hydro dam proliferation as a solution to the emerging energy and food demand in the LMRB.																	0013-9351	1096-0953				OCT	2017	158						24	32		10.1016/j.envres.2017.05.016								WOS:000408184700004	28595042

Consequences of these socio-economic and political changes on ecosystems are largely uncertain, but there is growing concern about derived increases in environmental degradation. Here, we review the capacity of Colombia to monitor the state of its ecosystems and their rate of change over time. We found several important programs currently set in place by different institutions as well as by independent groups of scientists that address different aspects of environmental monitoring. However, most of the current initiatives could be improved in terms of data coverage, quality and access, and could be better articulated among each other. We propose a set of activities that would increase the capacity of Colombia to monitor its ecosystems, provide useful information to policy makers, and facilitate scientific research. These include: 1) the establishment of a national center for ecological synthesis that focuses on analyzing existing information; 2) the establishment of an ecological observatory system that collects new information, integrates remote sensing products, and produces near real-time products on key ecological variables; and 3) the creation of new platforms for dialog and action within existing scientific and policy groups.				anaya acevedo, jesus adolfo/J-3679-2016	anaya acevedo, jesus adolfo/0000-0001-8242-5712; Feilhauer, Hannes/0000-0001-5758-6303; Posada, Juan M./0000-0001-7794-9300; Reu, Bjorn/0000-0001-5271-6420; JIMENEZ, Rodrigo/0000-0002-8665-9484; Armenteras, Dolors/0000-0003-0922-7298												1462-9011	1873-6416				OCT	2017	76						40	49		10.1016/j.envsci.2017.06.011								WOS:000407981300005

Impacts of ocean climate variability on biodiversity of pelagic forage species in an upwelling ecosystem	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Monitoring essential marine biodiversity variables is an effective means for assessing impacts of climate change and human-related stressors such as pollution, overfishing and habitat destruction. Yet little is known about the natural variability of biodiversity in pelagic upwelling marine ecosystems, which are often subject to substantial interannual and decadal variability of ocean climate conditions. Using data from a pelagic midwater trawl survey, we quantified diversity indices of epipelagic forage species collected over 26 yr (1990 to 2015) to determine the natural variability and environmental determinants of biodiversity within the California Current upwelling ecosystem. Biodiversity time series indicate there are 2 alternate forage species assemblages that relate to differences in cool/strong and warm/weak upwelling years that vary in 3 to 5 yr cycles. Cooler years are associated with increased biodiversity of juvenile groundfish, whereas warm years coincide with increased biodiversity of coastal and mesopelagic fishes and species originating from southern and subtropical waters. During 2015, a year of anomalous warm surface ocean conditions, we observed unprecedented high levels of biodiversity and attribute it to high abundance of juvenile groundfish combined with an unusually high transport of subtropical and offshore species into neritic waters. Using a combination of remote sensing and in situ hydrographic data, we compare 2015 to previous anomalous ocean climate conditions and discuss how biodiversity of forage species may impact trophodynamics of upwelling ecosystems and predator-prey interactions. Attributing changes in marine biodiversity to productivity cycles and anomalous climate events, and detecting long-term biodiversity trends, provides a critical index toward understanding climate forcing on upwelling ecosystems.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				SEP 29	2017	580						205	220		10.3354/meps12278								WOS:000419091500013

Mapping and assessing crop diversity in the irrigated Fergana Valley, Uzbekistan	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Crop diversity (e.g. the number of agricultural crop types and the level of evenness in area distribution) in the agricultural systems of arid Central Asia has recently been increased mainly to achieve food security of the rural population, however, not throughout the irrigation system. Site-specific factors that promote or hamper crop diversification after the dissolvent of the Soviet Union have hardly been assessed yet. While tapping the potential of remote sensing, the objective was to map and explain spatial patterns of current crop diversity by the example of the irrigated agricultural landscapes of the Fergana Valley, Uzbekistan. Multi-temporal Landsat and RapidEye satellite data formed the basis for creating annual and multi-annual crop maps for 2010-2012 while using supervised classifications. Applying the Simpson index of diversity (SID) to circular buffers with radii of 1.5 and 5 km elucidated the spatial distribution of crop diversity at both the local and landscape spatial scales. A variable importance analysis, rooted in the conditional forest algorithm, investigated potential environmental and socioeconomic drivers of the spatial patterns of crop diversity. Overall accuracy of the annual crop maps ranged from 0.84 to 0.86 whilst the SID varied between 0.1 and 0.85. The findings confirmed the existence of areas under monocultures as well as of crop diverse patches. Higher crop diversity occurred in the more distal parts of the irrigation system and sparsely settled areas, especially due to orchards. In contrast, in water-secure and densely settled areas, cotton-wheat rotations dominated due to the state interventions in crop cultivation. Distances to irrigation infrastructure, settlements and the road network influenced crop diversity the most. Spatial explicit information on crop diversity per se has the potential to support policymaking and spatial planning towards crop diversification. Driver analysis as exemplified at the study region in Uzbekistan can help reaching the declared policy to increase crop diversity throughout the country and even beyond. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Mapping of biotopes between Amasra and Inkum (Bartin), Western Black Sea Region of Turkey	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Aim: The aim of the study was to identify and map the biotope areas located between Amasra and Inkum settlements of Bartin Province, an important coastal province in the northwest of Black Sea Region in Turkey. This region represents the onshore Euxin part of Euro-Siberian phytogeographical province. Flora, abiotic characteristics, actual vegetation and land uses were taken into account for identification of biotopes found in the research area, which has a rich ecological and floristic diversity. Methodology: Remote sensing and GIS were effectively used for preparation and interpretation of data, and necessary satellite images, digital maps and databases for analysis were also generated. Composition of species belonging to plant cover was used as an indicator in addition to other factors for distinguishing different biotopes. Vegetation surveys were carried out and inventories were made in selected 156 sample plots that represent various ecological and floristic characteristics. Results: Eleven main biotopes were identified viz., deciduous forest lands, afforestation areas, agricultural lands, shrublands, cliffs, Inkum Dune area, Bartin Riverside, roadsides, degraded lands, urban settlements and rural settlements. These biotopes may be divided into 30 sub-biotopes. In other words, a total number of 41 biotopes were classified and mapped during the research. Interpretation: With the mapping of the biotopes covering species that have a special importance in the area, a base has been achieved to manage the formation of aims and the conservation status of the ecosystems special to the Black Sea at landscape level.																	0254-8704					SEP	2017	38	5			SI		1033	1042		10.22438/jeb/38/5(S1)/GM-20								WOS:000413107700020						
J	Zhang, ZN; Cao, L; She, GH				Zhang, Zhengnan; Cao, Lin; She, Guanghui			Estimating Forest Structural Parameters Using Canopy Metrics Derived from Airborne LiDAR Data in Subtropical Forests	REMOTE SENSING												Accurate and timely estimation of forest structural parameters plays a key role in the management of forest resources, as well as studies on the carbon cycle and biodiversity. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is a promising active remote sensing technology capable of providing highly accurate three dimensional and wall-to-wall forest structural characteristics. In this study, we evaluated the utility of standard metrics and canopy metrics derived from airborne LiDAR data for estimating plot-level forest structural parameters individually and in combination, over a subtropical forest in Yushan forest farm, southeastern China. Standard metrics, i.e., height-based and density-based metrics, and canopy metrics extracted from canopy vertical profiles, i.e., canopy volume profile (CVP), canopy height distribution (CHD), and foliage profile (FP), were extracted from LiDAR point clouds. Then the standard metrics and canopy metrics were used for estimating forest structural parameters individually and in combination by multiple regression models, including forest type-specific (coniferous forest, broad-leaved forest, mixed forest) models and general models. Additionally, the synergy of standard metrics and canopy metrics for estimating structural parameters was evaluated using field measured data. Finally, the sensitivity of vertical and horizontal resolution of voxel size for estimating forest structural parameters was assessed. The results showed that, in general, the accuracies of forest type-specific models (Adj-R-2 = 0.44-0.88) were relatively higher than general models (Adj-R-2 = 0.39-0.77). For forest structural parameters, the estimation accuracies of Lorey's mean height (Adj-R-2 = 0.61-0.88) and aboveground biomass (Adj-R-2 = 0.54-0.81) models were the highest, followed by volume (Adj-R-2 = 0.42-0.78), DBH (Adj-R-2 = 0.48-0.74), basal area (Adj-R-2 = 0.41-0.69), whereas stem density (Adj-R-2 = 0.39-0.64) models were relatively lower. The combination models (Adj-R-2 = 0.45-0.88) had higher performance compared with models developed using standard metrics (only) (Adj-R-2 = 0.42-0.84) and canopy metrics (only) (Adj-R-2 = 0.39-0.83). The results also demonstrated that the optimal voxel size was 5 x 5 x 0.5 m(3) for estimating most of the parameters. This study demonstrated that canopy metrics based on canopy vertical profiles can be effectively used to enhance the estimation accuracies of forest structural parameters in subtropical forests.																	2072-4292					SEP	2017	9	9							940	10.3390/rs9090940								WOS:000414138700070						
J	Brunner, P; Therrien, R; Renard, P; Simmons, CT; Franssen, HJH				Brunner, Philip; Therrien, Rene; Renard, Philippe; Simmons, Craig T.; Franssen, Harrie-Jan Hendricks			Advances in understanding river-groundwater interactions	REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS												River-groundwater interactions are at the core of a wide range of major contemporary challenges, including the provision of high-quality drinking water in sufficient quantities, the loss of biodiversity in river ecosystems, or the management of environmental flow regimes. This paper reviews state of the art approaches in characterizing and modeling river and groundwater interactions. Our review covers a wide range of approaches, including remote sensing to characterize the streambed, emerging methods to measure exchange fluxes between rivers and groundwater, and developments in several disciplines relevant to the river-groundwater interface. We discuss approaches for automated calibration, and real-time modeling, which improve the simulation and understanding of river-groundwater interactions. Although the integration of these various approaches and disciplines is advancing, major research gaps remain to be filled to allow more complete and quantitative integration across disciplines. New possibilities for generating realistic distributions of streambed properties, in combination with more data and novel data types, have great potential to improve our understanding and predictive capabilities for river-groundwater systems, especially in combination with the integrated simulation of the river and groundwater flow as well as calibration methods. Understanding the implications of different data types and resolution, the development of highly instrumented field sites, ongoing model development, and the ultimate integration of models and data are important future research areas. These developments are required to expand our current understanding to do justice to the complexity of natural systems.

The forest-savanna ecotone of the Eastern Central African Republic (CAR) is one such poorly studied area. Using camera traps, transect walks and collected fecal samples, we provide the first quantitative survey of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in this region previously classified as a highly important chimpanzee conservation unit. In contrast to species distribution models and expert predictions, we did not find any evidence of chimpanzees in the large and remote forest blocks west of the Chinko River despite considerable search effort. Our study thus highlights the limitations of relying solely on remote sensing data to predict the presence or absence of endangered species and illustrates the necessity of extensive field surveys to accurately assess occurrence and density in remote areas. However, we did discover a sizeable and reproducing population of chimpanzees east of the Chinko River. Based on a density of 0.81 chimpanzees/km(2) in closed canopy forest that we inferred from nest count data, we estimate 910 weaned chimpanzees to inhabit the Chinko Nature Reserve (CNR) and further predict additional 2700 individuals in adjacent, unmanaged hunting zones and reserves. According to microsatellite data, these chimpanzees genetically cluster with P.t. schweinfurthii populations in East Africa. Conservation action and appropriate management plans are urgently needed to protect this important population and to prevent heavily-armed nomadic pastoralists from the Sahel, illegal miners, as well as elephant and meat poachers, from irretrievably destroying the natural vegetation and local biodiversity of the area.

Evapotranspiration by remote sensing: An analysis of the Colorado River Delta before and after the Minute 319 pulse flow to Mexico	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The unique hydrologic conditions characterizing riparian ecosystems in dryland (arid and semi-arid) areas help maintain high biodiversity and support high levels of primary productivity compared to associated uplands. In western North America, many riparian ecosystems have been damaged by altered flow regimes (e.g., impoundments and diversions) and over utilization of water resources (e.g., groundwater pumping for agriculture and human consumption). This has led some state and national governments to provide occasional environmental flows to address the declining condition of such riparian systems. In a historic agreement between the United States and Mexico, 130 million cubic meters (mcm) of water was released to the lower Colorado River Delta in Mexico, with the intent to evaluate the hydrological and biological response of the ecosystem. We used the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) to estimate long term (2000-2014) and short term (pre- and post-pulse; 2013 and 2014) evapotranspiration (ET; used herein as an indicator of plant health) of the delta's riparian corridor. We found the pulse flow helped reverse a decline in ET from 2011 to 2013, with a small, but statistically significant increase in 2014 (P < 0.05). ET was greater than 100 mcm in all years analyzed (even in years without surface flows) and exceeded surface flows in all years except 2000 (result of excess flows following an El Nino cycle in 1997) and 2014 (year of the pulse flow). Based on groundwater salinities and MODIS ET estimates, we estimated groundwater flow into the delta to be 103 mcm. Shallow groundwater salinities in the riparian zone increased from 1.30 g L-1 in the most upstream reach to 2.77 g L-1 in the most downstream reach we measured, partly due to uptake of water by riparian vegetation and partly to intrusion of saline agricultural return flows. The disparity between surface flows and ET can likely be explained by the predominantly phreatophytic plants characterizing the area, which draw water from the aquifer. These results also suggest that the deteriorated condition of vegetation within the riparian zone might not be reversed by a single pulse event and could instead require subsequent pulse flows as a long term strategy to restore vegetation in this riparian ecosystem.

Protected areas buffer the Brazilian semi-arid biome from climate change	BIOTROPICA												The Caatinga is a botanically unique semi-arid ecosystem in northeast Brazil whose vegetation is adapted to the periodic droughts that characterize this region. However, recent extreme droughts events caused by anthropogenic climate change have challenged its ecological resilience. Here, we evaluate how deforestation and protection status affect the response of the Caatinga vegetation to drought. Specifically, we compared vegetation responses to drought in natural and deforested areas as well as inside and outside protected areas, using a time-series of satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and climatic data for 2008-2013. We observed a strong effect of deforestation and land protection on overall vegetation productivity and in productivity dynamics in response to precipitation. Overall, deforested areas had significantly lower NDVI and delayed greening in response to precipitation. By contrast, strictly protected areas had higher productivity and considerable resilience to low levels of precipitation, when compared to sustainable use or unprotected areas. These results highlight the importance of protected areas in protecting ecosystem processes and native vegetation in the Caatinga against the negative effects of climate change and deforestation. Given the extremely small area of the Caatinga currently under strict protection, the creation of new conservation areas must be a priority to ensure the sustainability of ecological processes and to avoid further desertification.

Field-measured variables outperform derived alternatives in Maryland stream biodiversity models	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim: In order to map patterns of biodiversity in support of conservation efforts, statistical models require environmental variables with full coverage across the study area, typically in the form of gridded surfaces derived from GIS, remote sensing or via interpolation. However, derived variables may not be as physiologically relevant or as representative of on-the-ground conditions as field-measured variables. Here, we examine differences in the abilities of derived and field-measured variables to explain and predict biogeographical patterns of freshwater fish and benthic invertebrate communities. Location: Maryland first-through fourth-order streams, USA. Methods: We fit generalized dissimilarity models to fish and benthic invertebrate occurrence data (n = 2,165 site-years sampled over 18 years) using one set of field-measured predictors collected concurrent and collocated with faunal sampling, two sets of derived predictors (one representing local and one representing upstream conditions) or a combination. We then compared how well models explained and predicted spatial turnover in taxonomic composition (beta diversity). Results: For all regions (four physiographic regions and the state as a whole) and for both fish and benthic invertebrates, models fit with field-measured variables were more explanatory and usually more predictive than models fit with derived variables. Within the category of derived predictors, those accounting for upstream conditions were more explanatory and predictive than local-scale versions. Main conclusions: Although derived variables are most commonly used to describe and map biodiversity, they may be broadly inferior to field-measured variables as predictors in low-order stream biodiversity models. Collection of field-measured data and development of derived data that consider upstream conditions and capture physiologically relevant environmental characteristics are likely to improve our capability to predict and explain spatial patterns of low-order stream biodiversity.

Vegetation response to invasive Tamarix control in southwestern US rivers: a collaborative study including 416 sites	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Most studies assessing vegetation response following control of invasive Tamarix trees along southwestern U.S. rivers have been small in scale (e.g., river reach), or at a regional scale but with poor spatial-temporal replication, and most have not included testing the effects of a now widely used biological control. We monitored plant composition following Tamarix control along hydrologic, soil, and climatic gradients in 244 treated and 172 reference sites across six U.S. states. This represents the largest comprehensive assessment to date on the vegetation response to the four most common Tamarix control treatments. Biocontrol by a defoliating beetle (treatment 1) reduced the abundance of Tamarix less than active removal by mechanically using hand and chain-saws (2), heavy machinery (3) or burning (4). Tamarix abundance also decreased with lower temperatures, higher precipitation, and follow-up treatments for Tamarix resprouting. Native cover generally increased over time in active Tamarix removal sites, however, the increases observed were small and was not consistently increased by active revegetation. Overall, native cover was correlated to permanent stream flow, lower grazing pressure, lower soil salinity and temperatures, and higher precipitation. Species diversity also increased where Tamarix was removed. However, Tamarix treatments, especially those generating the highest disturbance (burning and heavy machinery), also often promoted secondary invasions of exotic forbs. The abundance of hydrophytic species was much lower in treated than in reference sites, suggesting that management of southwestern U. S. rivers has focused too much on weed control, overlooking restoration of fluvial processes that provide habitat for hydrophytic and floodplain vegetation. These results can help inform future management of Tamarix-infested rivers to restore hydrogeomorphic processes, increase native biodiversity and reduce abundance of noxious species.

Climate and landscape drive the pace and pattern of conifer encroachment into subalpine meadows	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Mountain meadows have high biodiversity and help regulate stream water release following the snowmelt pulse. However, many meadows are experiencing woody plant encroachment, threatening these ecosystem services. While there have been field surveys of individual meadows and remote sensing-based landscape-scale studies of encroachment, what is missing is a broad-scale, ground-based study to understand common regional drivers, especially at high elevations, where land management has often played a less direct role. With this study, we ask: What are the climate and landscape conditions conducive to woody plant encroachment at the landscape scale, and how has historical climate variation affected tree recruitment in subalpine meadows over time? We measured density of encroaching trees across 340 subalpine meadows in the central Sierra Nevada, California, USA, and used generalized additive models (GAMs) to determine the relationship between landscape-scale patterns of encroachment and meadow environmental properties. We determined ages of trees in 30 survey meadows, used observed climate and GAMs to model the relationship between timing of recruitment and climate since the early 1900s, and extrapolated recruitment patterns into the future using downscaled climate scenarios. Encroachment was high among meadows with lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas ex Loudon var. murrayana (Balf.) Engelm.) in the immediate vicinity, at lower elevations, with physical conditions favoring strong soil drying, and with maximum temperatures above or below average. Climatic conditions during the year of germination were unimportant, with tree recruitment instead depending on a 3-yr seed production period prior to germination and a 6-yr seedling establishment period following germination. Recruitment was high when the seed production period had high snowpack, and when the seedling establishment period had warm summer maximum temperatures, high summer precipitation, and high snowpack. Applying our temporal model to downscaled output from four global climate models indicated that the average meadow will shift to forest by the end of the 21st century. Sierra Nevada meadow encroachment by conifers is ubiquitous and associated with climate conditions increasingly favorable for tree recruitment, which will lead to substantial changes in subalpine meadows and the ecosystem services they provide.																	1051-0761	1939-5582				SEP	2017	27	6					1876	1887		10.1002/eap.1574								WOS:000408814800014	28482135					
J	Asner, GP; Tupayachi, R				Asner, Gregory P.; Tupayachi, Raul			Accelerated losses of protected forests from gold mining in the Peruvian Amazon	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Gold mining in Amazonia involves forest removal, soil excavation, and the use of liquid mercury, which together pose a major threat to biodiversity, water quality, forest carbon stocks, and human health. Within the global biodiversity hotspot ofMadre de Dios, Peru, gold mining has continued despite numerous 2012 government decrees and enforcement actions against it. Mining is now also thought to have entered federally protected areas, but the rates of miner encroachment are unknown. Here, we utilize high-resolution remote sensing to assess annual changes in gold mining extent from 1999 to 2016 throughout theMadre de Dios region, including the high-diversity Tambopata National Reserve and buffer zone. Regionally, gold mining-related losses of forest averaged 4437 ha yr(-1). A temporary downward inflection in the annual growth rate of mining-related forest loss following 2012 government action was followed by a near doubling of the deforestation rate from mining in 2013-2014. The total estimated area of gold mining throughout the region increased about 40% between 2012 and 2016, including in the Tambopata National Reserve. Our results reveal an urgent need for more socio-environmental effort and law enforcement action to combat illegal gold mining in the Peruvian Amazon.

Objectives The objective of this study was to evaluate the information provided by a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image for landscape connectivity modeling compared to aerial photographs (APs). Methods We present a novel method that integrates habitat suitability derived from remote sensing imagery into a connectivity model to explain species abundance. More precisely, we compared how two resistance maps constructed using landscape and/or local metrics derived from AP or SAR imagery yield different connectivity values (based on graph theory), considering hedgerow networks and forest carabid beetle species as a model. Results We found that resistance maps using landscape and local metrics derived from SAR imagery improve landscape connectivity measures. The SAR model is the most informative, explaining 58% of the variance in forest carabid beetle abundance. This model calculates resistance values associated with homogeneous patches within hedgerows according to their suitability (canopy cover density and landscape grain) for the model species. Conclusions Our approach combines two important methods in landscape ecology: the construction of resistance maps and the use of buffers around sampling points to determine the importance of landscape factors. This study was carried out through an interdisciplinary approach involving remote sensing scientists and landscape ecologists. This study is a step forward in developing landscape metrics from satellites to monitor biodiversity.																	0921-2973	1572-9761				SEP	2017	32	9					1867	1879		10.1007/s10980-017-0546-3								WOS:000406962100008

Determination of grassland use intensity based on multi-temporal remote sensing data and ecological indicators	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Grassland use intensity and its impact on biodiversity and water pollution is a topic of growing interest. In ecological studies, intensity of use has been assessed by means of three indicators: i) mowing frequency, ii) grazing intensity, and iii) fertilization input. A multidimensional approach is key for the understanding of intensification effects in terrestrial and water ecosystems. Remote sensing is a powerful tool to monitor management indicators. Nevertheless, interdependencies between remote sensing methods and between indicators require new approaches to assess intensity of use. The objective of this study is to monitor ecological indicators of land use intensity based on multispectral imagery using a multidimensional approach. We performed a multi-temporal analysis using a series of RapidEye images within a growing season in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland, in 2013. We defined mowing frequency classes distinguishing spectral changes between pairs of images. The analysis of the whole image sequence within the growing season helped differentiate grazing intensities. Furthermore, we analysed the suitability of modelled livestock density based on remote sensing derived products to determine fertilizer input. Three grassland management practices were distinguished: i) medium intensive (46%), ii) low intensive (37%), and iii) high intensive (17%). We discuss the combination of high mowing frequency and fields with high grazing intensity to define areas prone to nutrient surpluses. Finally, we demonstrate that the estimation of interrelated indicators of grassland use intensity could be carried out preserving independence between methods.

J	Liu, YQ; Song, W; Deng, XZ				Liu, Yaqun; Song, Wei; Deng, Xiangzheng			Spatiotemporal Patterns of Crop Irrigation Water Requirements in the Heihe River Basin, China	WATER												Agricultural expansion, population growth, rapid urbanization, and climate change have all significantly impacted global water supply and demand and have led to a number of negative consequences including ecological degradation and decreases in biodiversity, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. The agricultural sector consumes the most water globally; crop irrigation alone uses up more than 80% of available agricultural water. Thus, to maintain sustainable development of the global economy and ecosystems, it is crucial to effectively manage crop irrigation water. We focus on the arid and semi-arid Heihe River Basin (HRB), China, as a case study in this paper, extracting spatiotemporal information on the distribution of crop planting using multi-temporal Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (TM/ETM+) remote sensing (RS) images. We estimate the spatiotemporal crop irrigation water requirements (IWRc) using the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Penman-Monteith method and reveal variations in IWRc. We also analyze the impact of changes in crop planting structure on IWRc and discuss strategies for the rational allocation of irrigation water as well as policies to alleviate imbalance between water supply and demand. The results of this study show that effective rainfall (ER) decreases upstream-to-downstream within the HRB, while crop evapotranspiration under standard conditions (ETc) increases, leading to increasing spatial variation in IWRc from zero up to 150 mm and between 300 and 450 mm. Data show that between 2007 and 2012, annual mean ER decreased from 139.49 to 106.29 mm, while annual mean ETc increased from 483.87 to 500.38 mm, and annual mean IWRc increased from 339.95 to 370.11 mm. Data show that monthly mean IWRc initially increased before decreasing in concert with crop growth. The largest values for this index were recorded during the month of June; results show that IWRc for May and June decreased by 8.14 and 11.67 mm, respectively, while values for July increased by 5.75 mm between 2007 and 2012. These variations have helped to ease the temporal imbalance between water supply and demand. Mean IWRc values for oilseed rape, corn, barley, and other crops all increased over the study period, from 208.43, 349.35, 229.26, and 352.85 mm, respectively, in 2007, to 241.81, 393.10, 251.17, and 378.86 mm, respectively, in 2012. At the same time, the mean IWRc of wheat decreased from 281.53 mm in 2007 to 266.69 mm in 2012. Mainly because of changes in planting structure, the total IWRc for the HRB in 2012 reached 2692.58 x 10(6) m(3), an increase of 332.16 x 10(6) m(3) (14.07%) compared to 2007. Data show that 23.11% (76.77 x 10(6) m(3)) of this increase is due to crop transfers, while the remaining 76.89% (255.39 x 10(6) m(3)) is the result of the rapid expansion of cultivated land. Thus, to maintain both the sustainable development and ecological security of the HRB, it is crucial to efficiently manage and utilize agricultural water in light of spatiotemporal patterns in IWRc changes as well as IWRc variations between different crops. The cultivation of water-demanding crops and the further expansion of agricultural land should also be avoided.

Soil-dwelling arthropods are currently monitored manually. This method is invasive, and time- and labor-consuming. Here we describe an infrared opto-electronic sensor for detection of soil microarthropods in the size range of 0.4-10 mm. The sensor is built in a novel microarthropod trap designed for field conditions. It allows automated, on-line, in situ detection and body length estimation of soil microarthropods. In the opto-electronic sensor the light source is an infrared LED. Two plano-convex optical lenses are placed along the virtual optical axis. One lens on the receiver side is placed between the observation space at 0.5-1 times its focal length from the sensor, and another emitter side lens is placed between the observation space and the light source in the same way. This paper describes the setup and operating mechanism of the sensor and the control unit, and through basic tests it demonstrates its potential in automated detection of soil microarthropods. The sensor may be used for monitoring activities, especially for remote observation activities in soil and insect ecology or pest control.

We made use of Google Earth Engine to access the USGS Landsat data archive and to generate cloud-free seasonal composites. These enabled us to accurately differentiate between rainfed and irrigated cropland, which was important for assessing agricultural intensification. We developed three land cover and land use classifications using the random forest classifier, and assessed land cover and land use change by creating cross-tabulation matrices for the intervals from 1987 to 2002, 2002 to 2016, and 1987 to 2016 and calculating the net change. We then applied a landscape mosaic approach to each classification to identify landscape types categorized by land use intensity. We discuss the impacts of landscape changes on natural habitats, biodiversity, and water. Kappa accuracies for the three classifications lay between 78.3% and 82.1%. Our study confirms that rainfed and irrigated cropland expanded at the expense of natural habitats, including protected areas. Agricultural expansion took place mainly in the 1980s and 1990s, whereas agricultural intensification largely happened after 2000. Since then, not only large-scale producers, but also many smallholders have begun to practice irrigated farming. The spatial pattern of agricultural expansion and intensification in the study area is defined by water availability. Agricultural intensification and the expansion of horticulture agribusinesses increase pressure on water. Furthermore, the observed changes have heightened pressure on pasture and idle land due to the decrease in natural and agropastoral landscapes. Conflicts between pastoralists, smallholder farmers, large-scale ranches, and wildlife might further increase, particularly during the dry seasons and in years of extreme drought.

A Dynamic Landsat Derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Product for the Conterminous United States	REMOTE SENSING												Satellite derived vegetation indices (VIs) are broadly used in ecological research, ecosystem modeling, and land surface monitoring. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), perhaps the most utilized VI, has countless applications across ecology, forestry, agriculture, wildlife, biodiversity, and other disciplines. Calculating satellite derived NDVI is not always straight-forward, however, as satellite remote sensing datasets are inherently noisy due to cloud and atmospheric contamination, data processing failures, and instrument malfunction. Readily available NDVI products that account for these complexities are generally at coarse resolution; high resolution NDVI datasets are not conveniently accessible and developing them often presents numerous technical and methodological challenges. We address this deficiency by producing a Landsat derived, high resolution (30 m), long-term (30+ years) NDVI dataset for the conterminous United States. We use Google Earth Engine, a planetary-scale cloud-based geospatial analysis platform, for processing the Landsat data and distributing the final dataset. We use a climatology driven approach to fill missing data and validate the dataset with established remote sensing products at multiple scales. We provide access to the composites through a simple web application, allowing users to customize key parameters appropriate for their application, question, and region of interest.

Regional-Scale High Spatial Resolution Mapping of Aboveground Net Primary Productivity (ANPP) from Field Survey and Landsat Data: A Case Study for the Country of Wales	REMOTE SENSING												This paper presents an alternative approach for high spatial resolution vegetation productivity mapping at a regional scale, using a combination of Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) imagery and widely distributed ground-based Above-ground Net Primary Production (ANPP) estimates. Our method searches through all available single-date NDVI imagery to identify the images which give the best NDVI-ANPP relationship. The derived relationships are then used to predict ANPP values outside of field survey plots. This approach enables the use of the high spatial resolution (30 m) Landsat 8 sensor, despite its low revisit frequency that is further reduced by cloud cover. This is one of few studies to investigate the NDVI-ANPP relationship across a wide range of temperate habitats and strong relationships were observed (R-2 = 0.706), which increased when only grasslands were considered (R-2 = 0.833). The strongest NDVI-ANPP relationships occurred during the spring "green-up" period. A reserved subset of 20% of ground-based ANPP estimates was used for validation and results showed that our method was able to estimate ANPP with a RMSE of 15-21%. This work is important because we demonstrate a general methodological framework for mapping of ANPP from local to regional scales, with the potential to be applied to any temperate ecosystems with a pronounced green up period. Our approach allows spatial extrapolation outside of field survey plots to produce a continuous surface product, useful for capturing spatial patterns and representing small-scale heterogeneity, and well-suited for modelling applications. The data requirements for implementing this approach are also discussed.

The region had experienced severe degradation through karst rocky desertification (KRD) between the 1950s and 1990s. Starting in the late 1990s, various levels of the Chinese government conducted several ecological projects to recover degraded karst ecosystems. It was reported that the implementation of these projects had been successful in facilitating the recovery of karst vegetation in many areas. However, global climate changes may compromise the efficacy of recovery. Geospatial techniques had been employed to map and monitor karst ecosystem conditions during the recovery process. We examined the history and progress of the various geospatial techniques applied to monitor and evaluate karst vegetation conditions. In addition, we reviewed the techniques used to assess and monitor KRD, KRD influencing factors, vegetation community type, fractional vegetation cover, vegetation dynamics, vegetation productivity, ecosystem goods and services, vegetation biodiversity, ecosystem health and rural society changes. We also explored the potential to apply geospatial techniques for karst vegetation recovery in the future. It is projected that there will be more remotely sensed images for the vegetation dynamics monitoring at numerous scales. New techniques (e.g. image fusion and data assimilation) will be available to manage scale and heterogeneity issues in the karst landscape.																	0309-1333	1477-0296				AUG	2017	41	4					450	477		10.1177/0309133317714246								WOS:000408111600004

Predicting tree species richness in urban forests	URBAN ECOSYSTEMS												There has been an increasing interest in urban forests and the levels of biodiversity they contain. Currently there are no spatially explicit maps of tree species richness in urban areas. This research tests and identifies GIS and remote sensing metrics (climate, area, productivity, three-dimensional structure) hypothesized to be associated with species richness in native forests and identifies methods that can be applied to predict and map tree species richness in cities. We quantified tree species richness, floristic composition, and structure in 28 1-ha plots in the city of Los Angeles. Climate and remote sensing metrics from highresolution aerial imagery (10 cm), QuickBird (60 cm), Landsat (30 m), MODIS (250 m), and airborne lidar (2 m) were collected for each plot. There were 1208 individual stems and 108 trees identified to species. Species richness ranged from 2 to 31 species per ha and averaged 17 species per ha. Tree canopy cover from QuickBird explained the highest portion of variance (54%) in tree species richness followed by NDVI from Landsat (42%). Tree species richness can be higher in residential urban forests than native forests in the United States. Spatially explicit species richness maps at 1 ha can be created and tested for cities in order to identify both hotspots and coldspots of tree species richness and changes in species richness over time.																	1083-8155	1573-1642				AUG	2017	20	4					839	849		10.1007/s11252-016-0633-2								WOS:000406776700009

Canopy structure drives orangutan habitat selection in disturbed Bornean forests	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												The conservation of charismatic and functionally important large species is becoming increasingly difficult. Anthropogenic pressures continue to squeeze available habitat and force animals into degraded and disturbed areas. Ensuring the long-term survival of these species requires a well-developed understanding of how animals use these new landscapes to inform conservation and habitat restoration efforts. We combined 3 y of highly detailed visual observations of Bornean orangutans with high-resolution airborne remote sensing (Light Detection and Ranging) to understand orangutan movement in disturbed and fragmented forests of Malaysian Borneo. Structural attributes of the upper forest canopy were the dominant determinant of orangutan movement among all age and sex classes, with orangutans more likely to move in directions of increased canopy closure, tall trees, and uniform height, as well as avoiding canopy gaps and moving toward emergent crowns. In contrast, canopy vertical complexity (canopy layering and shape) did not affect movement. Our results suggest that although orangutans do make use of disturbed forest, they select certain canopy attributes within these forests, indicating that not all disturbed or degraded forest is of equal value for the long-term sustainability of orangutan populations. Although the value of disturbed habitats needs to be recognized in conservation plans for wide-ranging, large-bodied species, minimal ecological requirements within these habitats also need to be understood and considered if long-term population viability is to be realized.

In contrast with most previous tree ring/remote sensing studies that have focused on temperature-limited boreal and taiga environments, here we compare the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with a network of Pinus brutia tree ring width chronologies collected along ecological gradients in semiarid Cyprus, where both radial tree growth and broader vegetation activity are controlled by drought. We find that the interaction between precipitation, elevation, and land-cover type generate a relationship between radial tree growth and NDVI. While tree ring chronologies at higher-elevation forested sites do not exhibit climatedriven linkages with NDVI, chronologies at lower-elevation dry sites are strongly correlated with NDVI during the winter precipitation season. At lower-elevation sites, land cover is dominated by grasslands and shrublands and tree ring widths operate as a proxy for ecosystem-scale vegetation activity. Tree rings can therefore be used to reconstruct productivity in water-limited grasslands and shrublands, where future drought stress is expected to alter the global carbon cycle, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning in the 21st century.																	1748-9326					AUG	2017	12	8							084008	10.1088/1748-9326/aa7b26								WOS:000406664400001

PLANT ECOLOGY												The recovery of vegetation cover is a process that has important implications for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Generally, the recovery of vegetation cover is documented over large areas using remote sensing, and it is often assumed that ecosystem properties and processes recover along with remotely sensed canopy cover. Here we analyze and compare the structure, composition, and diversity of trees and shrubs among plots established in a stratified random sampling design over four remotely sensed canopy cover change (CCC) categories defined according to a gradient in the percent of canopy cover. Plots were located in the Lake Cuitzeo basin (Mexico), where canopy recovery associated with agricultural abandonment has occurred in recent decades (1975-2000). We found that diversity measures, basal area, tree and shrub density, ground-truthed canopy cover, and mean plant height increased with increasing CCC category. However, Shannon index (H') was lower in the CCC category with the most closed canopy cover category than in plots apparently not affected by agriculture. Furthermore, ordination analyses showed that composition of dominant species were not associated with CCC categories. Our results suggest that canopy closure in our study area is not associated with the recovery of species diversity, and does not result in similar species dominance as in sites not affected by agriculture.

Urban outdoor water use and response to drought assessed through mobile energy balance and vegetation greenness measurements	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Urban vegetation provides many highly valued ecosystem services but also requires extensive urban water resources. Increasingly, cities are experiencing water limitations and managing outdoor urban water use is an important concern. Quantifying the water lost via evapotranspiration (ET) is critical for urban water management and conservation, especially in arid or semi-arid regions. In this study, we deployed a mobile energy balance platform to measure evaporative fraction throughout Riverside, California, a warm, semi-arid, city. We observed the relationship between evaporative fraction and satellite derived vegetation index across 29 sites, which was then used to map whole-city ET for a representative mid-summer period. Resulting ET distributions were strongly associated with both neighborhood population density and income. By comparing 2014 and 2015 summer-period water uses, our results show 7.8% reductions in evapotranspiration, which were also correlated with neighborhood demographic characteristics. Our findings suggest a mobile energy balance measurement platform coupled with satellite imagery could serve as an effective tool in assessing the outdoor water use at neighborhood to whole city scales.

Yearly Landsat imagery from 1986 to 2015 of a typical plantation region in the northern Guangdong province of southern China was used as a case study. A Landsat time series stack (LTSS) was fed to the vegetation change tracker model (VCT) to map long-term changes in plantation forests' disturbance and recovery, followed by an intensive validation and a continuous 27-yr change analysis on disturbance locations, magnitudes and rates of plantations' disturbance and recovery. And the validation results of the disturbance year maps derived from five randomly identified sample plots with 25 km(2) located at the four corners and the center of the scene showed the majority of the spatial agreement measures ranged from 60% to 83%. A confusion matrix summary of the accuracy measures for all four validation sites in Fogang County showed that the disturbance year maps had an overall accuracy estimate of 71.70%. Forest disturbance rates' change trend was characterized by a decline first, followed by an increase, then giving way to a decline again. An undulated and gentle decreasing trend of disturbance rates from the highest value of 3.95% to the lowest value of 0.76% occurred between 1988 and 2001, disturbance rate of 4.51% in 1994 was a notable anomaly, while after 2001 there was a sharp ascending change, forest disturbance rate spiked in 2007 (5.84%). After that, there was a significant decreasing trend up to the lowest value of 1.96% in 2011 and a slight ascending trend from 2011 to 2015 (2.59%). Two obvious spikes in post-disturbance recovery rates occurred in 1995 (0.26%) and 2008 (0.41%). Overall, forest recovery rates were lower than forest disturbance rates. Moreover, forest disturbance and recovery detection based on VCT and the Landsat-based detections of trends in disturbance and recovery (LandTrendr) algorithms in Fogang County have been conducted, with LandTrendr finding mostly much more disturbance than VCT. Overall, disturbances and recoveries in northern Guangdong were triggered mostly by timber needs, policies and decisions of the local governments. This study highlights that a better understanding about plantations' changes would provide a critical foundation for local forest management decisions in the southern China.

Townsend			Planning for conservation and restoration under climate and land use change in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												AimTo propose and compare priority sites for conservation and restoration of woody plants under diverse climate and land use scenarios, considering socio-economic costs, presence of protected areas and distribution of forest remnants. LocationThe Atlantic Forest Biodiversity Hotspot, Brazil. MethodsWe used ecological niche modelling to estimate geographical distributions for 2,255 species under current and future climate scenarios, which we analysed in relation to spatially explicit land use projections, maps of forest remnants derived from remote sensing and socio-economic variables for each municipality within the Atlantic Forest region. We identified spatial priorities that complement the current network of protected areas under three different prioritization scenarios: (1) conservation of existing forest remnants only; (2) conservation of remnants followed by restoration of degraded habitat; and (3) unconstrained actions, in which management location is not defined a priori. We compared our results under different levels of land protection, with targets of 10%, 17% and 20% of the Atlantic Forest extent. ResultsCurrent forest remnants cover only 12% of the Atlantic Forest, so targets of 17% and 20% were achieved only through active restoration. Targets of 17% and 20% captured most species and represented on average 26%-34% of species' distributions. The spatial pattern of degraded habitats negatively affected representation of biodiversity and implied higher costs and reduced efficiency of planning. We did not observe major differences between conservation prioritizations based on contrasting climate change scenarios. Main conclusionsProtection of forest remnants alone will not suffice to safeguard woody plant species under climate and land use changes; therefore, restoration actions are urgently needed in the Atlantic Forest. With integrated management actions and multicriterion nationwide planning, reaching the 17% of land protection of Aichi biodiversity targets will constitute an important step towards protecting Atlantic Forest biodiversity.

In light of this importance, eight palm species were explored [Borassus aethiopum (L.) Mart, Eremospatha macrocarpa (G. Mann et H. Wendl.) H. Wendl., Laccosperma opacum (G. Mann et H. Wendl.) Drude, Hyphaene thebaica (L.) Mart, Phoenix reclinata Jacq., Raphia hookeri G. Mann et H. Wendl., R. sudanica A. Chev., and R. vinifera P. Beauv.] as targets for conservation, domestication, and cultivation in Benin. Cultivation potential was evaluated in a coarse-resolution, first-pass effort using ecological niche models to relate known occurrences of each species to vegetation indices (VEG), gross primary productivity (GPP), and soil characteristics (SOIL), and model outputs were related to human distribution and land-use patterns. Results showed that wild palms responded differentially to different suites of environmental factors: some species showed best model performance with VEG + GPP + SOIL, others with GPP + SOIL or VEG + GPP, or with a single factor. Two species had broad potential distributions across the country; others had potential areas in the north (2 species) or the south (4 species). Raphia hookeri and R. vinifera showed greatest overlap in terms of ecology and distribution, whereas L. opacum and R. sudanica had the lowest similarity. These models constitute initial steps toward a sustainable scheme for planning exploration of the possibility of cultivation of these species.																	0925-9864	1573-5109				AUG	2017	64	6					1383	1393		10.1007/s10722-016-0443-7								WOS:000404901300020

This study illustrates how the use of species distribution models that combine remote sensing data and information about biodiversity surrogates can contribute to develop a systematic protocol for monitoring PAs. In particular, we assessed the effectiveness of the Natura 2000 (N2000) network, for conserving and preserving the representativeness of seven raptor species in a highly-dynamic landscape in northwest Spain between 2001 and 2014. We also evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the N2000 network by using the total area under protection as a proxy for conservation costs. Overall, the N2000 network was found to poorly represent the habitats of the raptor species. Despite the low representativeness, this network showed a high degree of effectiveness due to increased overall habitat availability for generalist and forest specialist species between 2001 and 2014. Nevertheless, additional protected areas should be established in the near future to increase their representativeness, and thus ensure the protection of open-habitat specialist species and their priority habitats. In addition, proactive conservation measures in natural and semi-natural ecosystems (in particular, montane heathlands) will be essential for long-term protection of Montagu's harrier (species listed in the Annex I of the Bird Directive), and thus complying with the current European Environmental Legislation. This study sheds light on how the development and application of new protected area indices based on the combined use of freely-available satellite data and species distribution models may contribute substantially to the cost-efficiency of the PA monitoring systems, and to the 'Fitness Check' process of EU Nature Directives.

Deforesters may be purposively seeking out forests not monitored for enforcement. Addressing the problem would help Brazil maintain a cutting-edge forest governance model worthy of transfer to other nations. Two commentaries questioned our decision to investigate solely PRODES and not additional government monitoring systems. We focused on PRODES because it is the most salient deforestation monitoring system. Other key deforestation monitoring systems are all either limited to the same monitoring footprint as PRODES, not used for enforcement, or are rarely used for measuring forest loss in the Brazilian Amazon. We do agree with the commentaries that Brazil's new satellite monitoring protocol for greenhouse gas emissions estimation is critical progress of the type we were advocating in our original article.

Inventorying and Monitoring Nighttime Light Distribution and Dynamics in the Mediterranean Coast Network of Southern California	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Light pollution has been of increasing concern as it relates to protected areas. As such, natural resource managers need information on the distribution, intensity, and dynamics of nighttime lights in protected areas. We examine the extent of nighttime light brightness from 1992 to 2012 in the Mediterranean Coast Network (Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, Channel Islands National Park, and Cabrillo National Monument) using the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System, which has provided global annual nighttime light imagery at 0.9 km pixel resolution. Nighttime lights appeared stable in Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, decreased in Cabrillo National Monument, and are extremely low in Channel Islands National Park. However, the mean brightness values in Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area and Cabrillo National Monument were very high compared to all other National Parks. Indeed, both were comparable to the two National Parks in the USA with the highest mean brightness values (Cuyahoga Valley National Park, Hot Springs National Park). Monitoring night light extent, intensity, time series, and change detection using remote sensing should be a standard practice for all protected areas managed by the National Park Service due to the no-cost nature of the data and ease at which analyses can be undertaken. The DMSP data and calibrated products can be used to monitor long-term changes in light distribution and intensity while the higher-resolution Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite data can be used to show changes in light distribution and density throughout the year and can be used to test how policy or ordinance changes impact light pollution.

Mapping and exploring variation in post-fire vegetation recovery following mixed severity wildfire using airborne LiDAR	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												There is a public perception that large high-severity wildfires decrease biodiversity and increase fire hazard by homogenizing vegetation composition and increasing the cover of mid-story vegetation. But a growing literature suggests that vegetation responses are nuanced. LiDAR technology provides a promising remote sensing tool to test hypotheses about post-fire vegetation regrowth because vegetation cover can be quantified within different height strata at fine scales over large areas. We assess the usefulness of airborne LiDAR data for measuring post-fire mid-story vegetation regrowth over a range of spatial resolutions (10 x 10 m, 30 x 30 m, 50 x 50 m, 100 x 100 m cell size) and investigate the effect of fire severity on regrowth amount and spatial pattern following a mixed severity wildfire in Warrumbungle National Park, Australia. We predicted that recovery would be more vigorous in areas of high fire severity, because park managers observed dense post-fire regrowth in these areas. Moderate to strong positive associations were observed between LiDAR and field surveys of mid-story vegetation cover between 0.5-3.0 m. Thus our LiDAR survey was an apt representation of on-ground vegetation cover. LiDAR-derived mid-story vegetation cover was 22-40% lower in areas of low and moderate than high fire severity. Linear mixed-effects models showed that fire severity was among the strongest biophysical predictors of mid-story vegetation cover irrespective of spatial resolution. However much of the variance associated with these models was unexplained, presumably because soil seed banks varied at finer scales than our LiDAR maps. Dense patches of mid-story vegetation regrowth were small (median size 0.01 ha) and evenly distributed between areas of low, moderate and high fire severity, demonstrating that high-severity fires do not homogenize vegetation cover. Our results are relevant for ecosystem conservation and fire management because they: indicate that native vegetation are responsive and resilient to high-severity fire, and show the usefulness of remote sensing tools such as LiDAR to monitor post-fire vegetation recovery over large areas in situ.																	1051-0761	1939-5582				JUL	2017	27	5					1618	1632		10.1002/eap.1555/full								WOS:000405174300017	28390084

In this study, the landscape dynamics of wetlands upstream, midstream and downstream of the Tumen River Basin from 1960 to 2009 were investigated using remote sensing and geographic information systems. Analytical methods, such as dynamic degree, transfer matrix and indices, e.g., patch number (NP), area percentage of landscape patches, mean patch size, patch density, Shannon's diversity index (SHDI), and Shannon's evenness index (SHEI), were utilized to describe the landscape dynamics. The results showed that over the past 50 years, human-made wetlands, including paddy fields and reservoirs, increased, whereas natural wetlands, including marshes, lakes and rivers, decreased. In the study period, a large number of natural wetlands were converted by humans into other types of wetlands and non-wetlands. For wetland landscape changes, the NP, landscape fragmentation index, and SHEI increased, whereas the average patch area and SHDI decreased. In addition, we found that human factors were the main driving forces for the reduction of natural wetlands in this area, among which agricultural activities had the strongest impact. Great losses of natural wetlands have led to ecological problems in the region, such as a decline in biodiversity and soil degradation.																	1860-1871	1860-188X				JUL	2017	13	2					237	250		10.1007/s11355-016-0304-8								WOS:000404924200003						
J	Singh, M; Tokola, T; Hou, ZY; Notarnicola, C				Singh, Minerva; Tokola, Timo; Hou, Zhengyang; Notarnicola, Claudia			Remote sensing-based landscape indicators for the evaluation of threatened-bird habitats in a tropical forest	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Avian species persistence in a forest patch is strongly related to the degree of isolation and size of a forest patch and the vegetation structure within a patch and its matrix are important predictors of bird habitat suitability. A combination of space-borne optical (Landsat), ALOS-PALSAR (radar), and airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data was used for assessing variation in forest structure across forest patches that had undergone different levels of forest degradation in a logged forest-agricultural landscape in Southern Laos. The efficacy of different remote sensing (RS) data sources in distinguishing forest patches that had different seizes, configurations, and vegetation structure was examined. These data were found to be sensitive to the varying levels of degradation of the different patch categories. Additionally, the role of local scale forest structure variables (characterized using the different RS data and patch area) and landscape variables (characterized by distance from different forest patches) in influencing habitat preferences of International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red listed birds found in the study area was examined. A machine learning algorithm, MaxEnt, was used in conjunction with these data and field collected geographical locations of the avian species to identify the factors influencing habitat preference of the different bird species and their suitable habitats. Results show that distance from different forest patches played a more important role in influencing habitat suitability for the different avian species than local scale factors related to vegetation structure and health. In addition to distance from forest patches, LiDAR-derived forest structure and Landsat-derived spectral variables were important determinants of avian habitat preference. The models derived using MaxEnt were used to create an overall habitat suitability map (HSM) which mapped the most suitable habitat patches for sustaining all the avian species. This work also provides insight that retention of forest patches, including degraded and isolated forest patches in addition to large contiguous forest patches, can facilitate bird species retention within tropical agricultural landscapes. It also demonstrates the effective use of RS data in distinguishing between forests that have undergone varying levels of degradation and identifying the habitat preferences of different bird species. Practical conservation management planning endeavors can use such data for both landscape scale monitoring and habitat mapping.																	2045-7758					JUL	2017	7	13					4552	4567		10.1002/ece3.2970								WOS:000404645400004	28690786

Agricultural land-use change in Kerala, India: Perspectives from above and below the canopy	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Despite the availability of a wide range of tools, measuring and explaining changes in land cover and land use in tropical regions can be extremely challenging. Kerala, India, is a biodiversity hotspot with a high population density and a long history of complex agricultural land-use patterns. Some reports suggest that agriculture in Kerala, which historically is rice paddy-wetland and agroforestry-based, is on the decline. However, the evidence is often anecdotal, especially with regards to smallholding homegarden agriculture. In this study we employ mixed methods, including remote sensing, quantitative household surveys, and semi-structured interviews, to unravel the complex land-cover and land-use changes occurring in Kerala. Results indicate that, from a land-cover change perspective, agroforests are in dynamic equilibrium with other land covers, being cleared for roads and new buildings, but offset by the expansion of younger, less diverse agroforests into paddy wetlands. Yet beneath the canopy, agroforests are undergoing rapid land-use change not discernible using remote sensing. These changes include a reported decrease in the cultivation of 80% of Kerala's primary crop species during 2003-2013, alongside a dramatic decline in chickens (from 12.5 to 2.6 per homestead on average) and cows (from 1.7 to 0.8). Over this period, no crop increased in cultivation. According to farmers, the primary drivers of this shift were declining profitability of agriculture in Kerala, labour shortages, unreliable weather, unfamiliar pests and diseases, and government policy. Despite the undeniable move away from agricultural activity in homegardens, we conclude that these ecologically and culturally important systems are not disappearing, but rather evolving to meet the needs of a less agricultural Kerala. Our research highlights the value of using mixed methods for characterizing land-use and land-cover histories in tropical regions.																	0167-8809	1873-2305				JUL 1	2017	245						1	10		10.1016/j.agee.2017.05.002								WOS:000403988600001

To support decision making in IAPs monitoring, semi automated image classifiers which are capable. of extracting valuable information in remotely sensed data are vital. This study evaluated the mapping accuracies of supervised and unsupervised image classifiers for mapping Harrisia pomanensis (a cactus plant commonly known as the Midnight Lady) using two interlinked evaluation strategies i.e. point and area based accuracy assessment. Results of the point-based accuracy assessment show that with reference to 219 ground control points, the supervised image classifiers (i.e. Maxver and Bhattacharya) mapped H. pomanensis better than the unsupervised image classifiers (i.e. K-mediuns, Euclidian Length and Isoseg). In this regard, user and producer accuracies were 82.4% and 84% respectively for the Maxver classifier. The user and producer accuracies for the Bhattacharya classifier were 90% and 95.7%, respectively. Though the Maxver produced a higher overall accuracy and Kappa estimate than the Bhattacharya classifier, the Maxver Kappa estimate of 0.8305 is not significantly (statistically) greater than the Bhattacharya Kappa estimate of 0.8088 at a 95% confidence interval. The area based accuracy assessment results show that the Bhattacharya classifier estimated the spatial extent of H. pomanensis with an average mapping accuracy of 86.1% whereas the Maxver classifier only gave an average mapping accuracy of 65.2%. Based on these results, the Bhattacharya classifier is therefore recommended for mapping H. pomanensis. These findings will aid in the algorithm choice making for the development of a semi-automated image classification system for mapping IAPs.

The identification of priority areas for conservation is crucial for land use planning to ensure the protection of biodiversity and ecological function. Intact Forest Landscapes (IFLs), as defined by Greenpeace and World Resources Institute (WRI), are areas of the forest ecosystems not subjected to human activities. They have been identified by mapping human disturbances through remote sensing. Contrary to similar global-scale concepts, IFLs have been integrated into the standards of the certification body Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and therefore have practical implications for forest management policies. The Motion 65, approved in the general assembly of FSC in 2014, mandates the protection of IFLs located in FSC certified logging concessions. Until the implementation of national standards, forestry operations are banished from 80% of the IFL area within each forest management unit. To trace the history and evaluate the suitability of IFLs in the Central African context, we searched for documents related to the IFL method, and related approaches focusing on the identification of areas devoid of human disturbances. The IFL method is simple and cost-effective and allows for a global assessment of the influence of human infrastructures and industrial exploitation on forests. However, the method does not consider the situation below the canopy and those forest components not visible by satellites. For example, hunting, one of the main threats faced by wildlife in Central African forests today, cannot be detected with satellite imagery. On the other hand, other anthropogenic activities which remote sensing may detect may be compatible with forest ecosystem conservation. To better tailor the IFL approach to Central African forests, we recommend (i) the consideration of wildlife communities in the intactness analysis, (ii) a thorough evaluation of the impacts of human activities on forest ecosystems, and (iii) the integration of local stakeholders and governments in the design of land management strategies to respond to social, economic and environmental needs.

J	Huber, N; Kery, M; Pasinelli, G				Huber, Nica; Kery, Marc; Pasinelli, Gilberto			Occupancy dynamics of the Wood Warbler Phylloscopus sibilatrix assessed with habitat and remote sensing data	IBIS												The study of population dynamics and species-habitat interactions is important for many ecological and conservation issues. We analysed the occupancy dynamics of the Wood Warbler Phylloscopus sibilatrix, a forest interior passerine that has suffered long-term declines in many European countries. Considering a broad range of habitat descriptors, including LiDAR-based variables characterizing forest structure, we identified environmental factors influencing the probabilities of occupancy, colonization, extinction and detection, and mapped these probabilities at a landscape scale. We used presence-absence data collected between 1999 and 2013 in a robust-design protocol with replicated surveys within each primary sampling season (i.e. breeding season). To analyse occupancy dynamics, we fitted dynamic occupancy models with covariates describing topography, forest extent and structure, soil, seed masting (as a proxy for rodent abundance) and weather conditions during settlement. Initial occupancy was positively related to slope, forest cover and the proportion of broadleaf forest, and negatively related to forest edge length, canopy height variation and soil nutrients. Colonization probability was positively associated with slope and negatively with canopy height variation and soil nutrients. Extinction probability was negatively related to slope, positively related to forest edge length and was lowest at intermediate vegetation heights. Detection probability decreased during the season and was positively related to forest cover. This study provides insights into the settlement dynamics of a declining forest species by identifying potential drivers of the processes underlying occupancy dynamics, instead of simply modelling species abundance or occurrence. Forest-related covariates were of overwhelming importance for the settlement dynamics of the Wood Warbler. Conservation measures should focus on providing and maintaining the species' preferred forest structure, specifically in extended forests. In Switzerland, forests located on slopes and on nutrient-poor soils should be prioritized for conservation. Finally, comparing findings derived from the relatively coarse scale of this study with those from the small scale of individual territories suggests that conservation recommendations deduced from large-scale monitoring schemes alone may be incomplete, and vice versa.																	0019-1019	1474-919X				JUL	2017	159	3					623	637		10.1111/ibi.12472								WOS:000403102000014

Hence, measuring ecological complexity over space becomes crucial in macroecology and geography. Many geospatial tools have been advocated in spatial ecology to estimate ecosystem complexity and its changes over space and time. Among these tools, free and open source options especially offer opportunities to guarantee the robustness of algorithms and reproducibility.

Linkages between benthic assemblages and physical environmental factors: The role of geodiversity in Eastern Gulf of Finland ecosystems	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												We analyzed hydrology, geology and benthic species composition to determine benthic habitat distribution patterns in a geologically complex area of the Gulf of Finland, Northern Baltic Sea. The analysis included several datasets describing coastal influence and geodiversity at multiple spatial scales. Geodiversity in this context refers to variation and/or patchiness of benthic substrates and seabed features. Multivariate statistical methods including BEST and LINKTREE routines were used to identify correlative relationships between different ecological variables. Environmental variables (e.g. water depth, Secchi depth, salinity) were either measured by sampling and remote sensing methods or parameterized from geographic and oceanographic data. Benthic assemblages were assayed by both video recordings and zoobenthic sampling (benthic grabs). Statistical analyses identified correlations between benthic datasets and environmental variables, but correlation parameters were not consistent especially with respect to differing zoobenthic and video-based estimates of benthic diversity. The ratio of Secchi depth to water depth showed strong correlation with species distributions observed in video recordings (rho = 0.56) whereas variables describing broad-scale geodiversity and archipelago gradient (the abundance of islands, ratio of land and sea area) correlated with zoobenthic sample data (generally rho > 0.30). A model that included independent variables of Secchi depth and terrain roughness within a 20 km radius explained the greatest proportion of spatial variation in zoobenthic sample data (rho = 0.69). Secchi depth and roughness values were positively correlated with species richness. We designated nine benthic marine landscapes on the basis of these two variables. Linkage tree statistical analysis (LINKTREE) routine utilized zoobenthic sample data as these offered better regional coverage and therefore effectively tracked relationships with other environmental variables. The benthic marine landscapes found in topographically complex seabed areas possessed higher species diversity than flatter areas with fewer seabed features. Our results indicate that on broad spatial scales, geodiversity and archipelago gradient directly influence benthic assemblages by providing a range of different habitats. These factors also indirectly influence benthic assemblages by channeling water movement and thereby distributing hydrologic conditions. This study demonstrates that broad-scale geodiversity should be considered in regional and mesoscale habitat mapping, maritime spatial planning and conservation policies.

A comparison of Dynamic Habitat Indices derived from different MODIS products as predictors of avian species richness	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Understanding past and current patterns of species richness is essential for predicting how these patterns may be affected by future global change. The species energy hypothesis predicts that higher abundance and richness of animal species occur where available energy is higher and more consistently available. There is a wide range of remote sensing proxies for available energy, such as vegetation productivity, but it is not clear which best predict species richness. Our goal here was to evaluate different proxies for annual plant productivity from Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) as input for the Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs), and to determine how well they predict the richness of breeding bird species in six functional guilds across the conterminous United States. The DHIs are measures of vegetation productivity over the course of a year and consist of three components: (1) cumulative productivity (DHI Cum), (2) minimum productivity (DHI Min), and (3) intra-annual variation of productivity (DHI Var). We hypothesized that increases in cumulative and minimum productivity and reductions in intra-annual variation will be associated with higher species richness. We calculated the DHIs from a range of MODIS 1000-m vegetation productivity data sets for 20032014, i.e., the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Fraction of absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP). We summarized bird species richness of different guilds within ecoregions (n = 85) based on abundance maps derived from the >3000 routes of the North American Breeding Bird Survey for 2006 to 2012. Generally, we found all the DHI5 had high explanatory power for predicting breeding bird species richness. However, the strength of the associations between the DHI5 and bird species richness depended on habitat, nest placement, and migratory behavior. We found highest correlations for habitat-based guilds, such as grassland breeding species (R-adj(2) 0.66-0.73 for the multiple DHI regression model; R-adj(2) 0.41-0.61 for minimum DHI) and woodland breeding species (R-adj(2), 0.34-0.60 for the multiple DHI regression model; R-adj(2), 0.26-0.51 for cumulative DHI). The strong relationship between the DHI5 and bird species richness reinforces the importance of vegetation productivity as a determinant of species diversity patterns, and the usefulness of satellite data for applying the species energy hypothesis to predictions in service to conservation.

J	Nuchel, J; Svenning, JC				Nuchel, Jonas; Svenning, Jens-Christian			Recent tree cover increases in eastern China linked to low, declining human pressure, steep topography, and climatic conditions favoring tree growth	PLOS ONE												Globally, the extent of forest continues to decline, however, some countries have increased their forest extent in recent years. China is one of these countries and has managed to increase their tree cover through huge reforestation and afforestation programs during recent decades as well as land abandonment dynamics. This study investigates tree cover change in the eastern half of China between 2000 and 2010 on three different scales, using random forest modeling of remote sensing data for tree cover in relation to environmental and anthropogenic predictor variables. Our results show that between the years 2000 and 2010 2,667,875 km 2 experienced an increase in tree cover while 1,854,900 km(2) experienced a decline in tree cover. The area experiencing >= 10% increase in tree cover is almost twice as large as the area with >= 10% drop in tree cover. There is a clear relation between topography and tree cover change with steeper and mid-elevation areas having a larger response on tree cover increase than other areas. Furthermore, human influence, change in population density, and actual evapotranspiration are also important factors in explaining where tree cover has changed. This study adds to the understanding of tree cover change in China, as it has focus on the entire eastern half of China on three different scales and how tree cover change is linked to topography and anthropogenic pressure. Though, our results show an increase in tree cover in China, this study emphasizes the importance of incorporating anthropogenic factors together with biodiversity protection into the reforestation and afforestation programs in the future.																	1932-6203					JUN 7	2017	12	6							e0177552	10.1371/journal.pone.0177552								WOS:000402880700010	28591146

Remote sensing combined with social-ecological data: The importance of diverse land uses for ecosystem service provision in north-eastern Madagascar	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES												Through ongoing deforestation in the tropics, forest-related ecosystem services are declining, while ecosystem services provided by agricultural land uses are on the increase. Land system science provides a framework for analysing the links between land use change and the resulting socio-environmental trade-offs. However, the evidence base to support the navigation of such trade-offs is often lacking, as information on land use cannot directly be obtained through remote sensing and census data is often unavailable at sufficient spatial resolution. The global biodiversity hotspot of north-eastern Madagascar exemplifies these challenges. Combining land use data obtained through remote sensing with social-ecological data from a regional level household survey, we attempt to make the links between land use and ecosystem service benefits explicit. Our study confirmed that remotely sensed information on landscapes reflects households' involvement in rice production systems. We further characterized landscapes in terms of "ecosystem service bundles" linked to specific land uses, as well as in terms of ecosystem service benefits to households. The map of landscape types could help direct future conservation and development efforts towards places where there is potential for success. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A complete understanding of the relationship between biodiversity and carbon storage and sequestration across spatiotemporal scales relevant for climate change mitigation needs three approaches: empirical, remote sensing and ecosystem modelling. We review individual approaches and show that biodiversity has short-term and long-term benefits across spatial scales. We argue that enhanced understanding is obtained by combining approaches and, especially, integrating approaches through using 'boundary objects' that can be understood and measured by all approaches, such as diversity of leaf traits of the upper canopy. This will lead to better understanding of biodiversity effects on climate change mitigation, which is crucial for making sound policy decisions.																	1877-3435	1877-3443				JUN	2017	26-27		2				69	76		10.1016/j.cosust.2017.01.016								WOS:000417390100011						
J	Tran, LX; Fischer, A				Tran, Loi X.; Fischer, Andrew			Spatiotemporal changes and fragmentation of mangroves and its effects on fish diversity in Ca Mau Province (Vietnam)	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												Mangroves are important economically and ecologically, however mangrove cover has declined dramatically leading to habitat fragmentation and biodiversity loss. Information on mangrove cover change, fragmentation and impacts on fish diversity is poorly understood. The aims of this study are to detect spatiotemporal changes and mangrove status, examine fragmentation changes and associated effects on fish diversity. Landsat images in1989, 2000, and 2013 were used to classify mangrove cover in Ca Mau Province (Vietnam) and validated against high resolution Pleiades imagery. Fragmentation changes in mangrove cover were examined using series of landscape metrics evaluated against fish diversity indices (Simpson's index, Jaccard's coefficient and relative abundance). Results show that mangrove cover has declined 24.6% in the province. Currently, high and moderately dense mangroves distribute in southern half of the region while the low density mangroves occurs in the northern half. Over the 24 year study periods, the number of patches and edge density has increased 58% and 53.9%, respectively, while the mean patch size and mean patch edge has decreased 52.3% and 26.6%. Fish diversity in the more highly fragmented mangrove area was 1.78 times lower than the less fragmented mangrove. The study illustrates the applicability of using Landsat satellite imagery for use in mangrove fragmentation studies as well as the impact of fragmentation.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				JUN	2017	21	3					355	368		10.1007/s11852-017-0513-9								WOS:000404531100005

The Laguna de Bay is the largest lake in the Philippines and an important natural resource for the population in/around Metro Manila. The LULC around the lake is rapidly changing due to urban sprawl, so local and national government agencies situated in the area need an understanding of the future (likely) LULC changes and their associated hydrological impacts. The spatial modeling approach involved three main steps: (1) mapping the locations of past LULC changes; (2) identifying the drivers of these past changes; and (3) identifying where and when future LULC changes are likely to occur. Utilizing various publically-available spatial datasets representing potential drivers of LULC changes, a LULC change model was calibrated using the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network algorithm. After calibrating the model, future LULC changes were modeled and mapped up to the year 2030. Our modeling results showed that the 'built-up' LULC class is likely to experience the greatest increase in land area due to losses in 'crop/grass' (and to a lesser degree 'tree') LULC, and this is attributed to continued urban sprawl.																	2073-445X					JUN	2017	6	2							26	10.3390/land6020026								WOS:000404633800005						
J	Batar, AK; Watanabe, T; Kumar, A				Batar, Amit Kumar; Watanabe, Teiji; Kumar, Ajay			Assessment of Land-Use/Land-Cover Change and Forest Fragmentation in the Garhwal Himalayan Region of India	ENVIRONMENTS												The Garhwal Himalaya has experienced extensive deforestation and forest fragmentation, but data and documentation detailing this transformation of the Himalaya are limited. The aim of this study is to analyse the observed changes in land cover and forest fragmentation that occurred between 1976 and 2014 in the Garhwal Himalayan region in India. Three images from Landsat 2 Multispectral Scanner System (MSS), Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) were used to extract the land cover maps. A cross-tabulation detection method in the geographic information system (GIS) module was used to detect land cover changes during the 1st period (1976-1998) and 2nd period (1998-2014). The landscape fragmentation tool LFT v2.0 was used to construct a forest fragmentation map and analyse the forest fragmentation pattern and change during the 1st period (1976-1998) and 2nd period (1998-2014). The overall annual rate of change in the forest cover was observed to be 0.22% and 0.27% in the 1st period (1976-1998) and 2nd period (1998-2014), respectively. The forest fragmentation analysis shows that a large core forest has decreased throughout the study period. The total area of forest patches also increased from 1976 to 2014, which are completely degraded forests. The results indicate that anthropogenic activities are the main causes of the loss of forest cover and forest fragmentation, but that natural factors also contributed. An increase in the area of scrub and barren land also contributed to the accumulation of wasteland or non-forest land in this region. Determining the trend and the rate of land cover conversion is necessary for development planners to establish a rational land use policy.																	2076-3298					JUN	2017	4	2							34	10.3390/environments4020034								WOS:000404540600010

However, the spatiotemporal patterns of forest in the TACM have been poorly understood across the whole region. The objectives of this study were to quantify the spatiotemporal patterns of forest in the TACM from 1977 to 2015, investigate the causes of forest dynamics, and assess the impacts of forest dynamics on habitat quality. To do this, we first extracted the forest in the TACM from Landsat images acquired in 1977, 1988, 1999, 2007, and 2015 using visual interpretation. Then, we analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of forest in the TACM from 1977 to 2015 using landscape metrics and compared the dynamics of forest between the area in China and the area in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). After that, we investigated the driving forces of forest dynamics and the impacts of forest dynamics on habitat quality. We found that the TACM experienced a noticeable forest decrease-from 1.57 million ha in 1977 to 1.48 million ha in 2015, a decline of 5.78%-and underwent a forest fragmentation process. In particular, the sub-region in the DPRK had a much larger decrease (17.75%) than the sub-region in China (2.86%). We found that timber harvesting, urban expansion, agricultural reclamation, and typhoon disasters were the main driving forces behind forest decreases in the TACM. Specifically, agricultural reclamation was the most important factor in the DPRK sub-region, while urban expansion was the dominant factor in the Chinese sub-region. Furthermore, such forest loss and fragmentation has resulted in declines in habitat quality across both sides of the TACM. Thus, we suggest that more effective forest management with cooperation between China and DPRK is needed to maintain and improve forest coverage in the TACM.																	2071-1050					JUN	2017	9	6							1054	10.3390/su9061054								WOS:000404133200177

Mapping major land cover types and retrieving the age of secondary forests in the Brazilian Amazon by combining single-date optical and radar remote sensing data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Secondary forests play an important role in restoring carbon and biodiversity lost previously through deforestation and degradation and yet there is little information available on the extent of different successional stages. Such knowledge is particularly needed in tropical regions where past and current disturbance rates have been high but regeneration is rapid. Focusing on three areas in the Brazilian Amazon (Manaus, Santarem, Machadinho d'Oeste), this study aimed to evaluate the use of single-date Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data in the 2007-2010 period for i) discriminating mature forest, non-forest and secondary forest, and ii) retrieving the age of secondary forests (ASF), with 100 to x 100 m training areas obtained by the analysis of an extensive time-series of Landsat sensor data over the three sites. A machine learning algorithm (random forests) was used in combination with ALOS PALSAR backscatter intensity at HH and HV polarizations and Landsat 5 TM surface reflectance in the visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared spectral regions. Overall accuracy when discriminating mature forest, non-forest and secondary forest is high (95-96%), with the highest errors in the secondary forest class (omission and commission errors in the range 4-6% and 12-20% respectively) because of misclassification as mature forest. Root mean square error (RMSE) and bias when retrieving ASF ranged between 4.3-4.7 years (relative RMSE = 25.5-32.0%) and 0.04-0.08 years respectively. On average, unbiased ASF estimates can be obtained using the method proposed here (Wilcoxon test, p-value > 0.05). However, the bias decomposition by 5-year interval ASF classes showed that most age estimates are biased, with consistent overestimation in secondary forests up to 10-15 years of age and underestimation in secondary forests of at least 20 years of age. Comparison with the classification results obtained from the analysis of extensive time-series of Landsat sensor data showed a good agreement, with Pearson's coefficient of correlation (R) of the proportion of mature forest, non-forest and secondary forest at 1-km grid cells ranging between 0.97-0.98, 0.96-0.98 and 0.84-0.90 in the 2007-2010 period, respectively. The agreement was lower (R = 0.82-0.85) when using the same dataset to compare the ability of ALOS PALSAR and Landsat 5 TM data to retrieve ASF. This was also dependent on the study area, especially when considering mapping secondary forest and retrieving ASF, with Manaus displaying better agreement when compared to the results at Santarem and Machadinho d'Oeste.

Other states of protection like the UNESCO world heritage sites, for example, are created for maintaining culturally important places or lifestyles. In the Matobo Hills (Zimbabwe) both states of protection are present, a national park and a world heritage site. In addition, the land outside the National Park belongs to two different systems of ownership, namely "common" (i.e. community-owned) and "not-common" (privately or governmentally owned) land. In this paper, we investigated how the state of protection and the ownership affected the land use and land cover. We derived maps using Landsat images from 1989, 1998 and 2014 by supervised classification with Random Forests. To compensate for the lack of ground data we inferred past land use and land cover from recent observations combining photographs, Google Earth images and change detection. We could identify four classes, namely shrub land, forest, patchy vegetation and agricultural area. The Matobo National Park showed a stable composition of land cover during the study period and the main changes were observable in the surroundings. Outside the national park, forest increased by about 7%. The common lands have changed substantially and their agricultural area decreased. We attribute this development to the Fast Track Land Reform, which took place in the early 2000s. Our approach shows that combining information on recent land cover with change detection allows to study the, temporal development of protected areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we evaluated biomass estimation from L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data acquired by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle SAR (UAVSAR) and the improvement of accuracy by adding canopy height information derived from stereo imagery acquired by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Panchromatic Remote Sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping (PRISM) on-board the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS). Various models for prediction of forest biomass from UAVSAR data were investigated at pixel sizes of 1/4 ha (50 m x 50 m) and 1 ha. The variance inflation factor (VIF) was calculated for each of the explanatory variables in multivariable regression models to assess the multi-collinearity between explanatory variables. In addition, the t- and p-values were used to interpret the significance of the coefficients of each explanatory variables. The R-2, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), bias and Akaike information criterion (AIC), and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) and bootstrapping were used to validate models. At 1/4-ha scale, the R-2 and RMSE of biomass estimation from a model using a single track of polarimetric UAVSAR data were 0.59 and 52.08 Mg/ha. With canopy height from PRISM as additional independent variable, R-2 increased to 0.76 and RMSE decreased to 39.74 Mg/ha (28.24%). At 1-ha scale, the RMSE of biomass estimation based on UAVSAR data of a single track was 39.42 Mg/ha with a R-2 of 0.77. With the canopy height from PRISM, R-2 increased to 0.86 and RMSE decreased to 29.47 Mg/ha (20.18%). The models using UAVSAR data alone underestimated biomass at levels above similar to 150 Mg/ha showing the saturation phenomenon. Adding canopy height from PRISM stereo imagery significantly improved the biomass estimation and elevated the saturation level in estimating biomass. Combined use of UAVSAR data acquired from opposite directions (odd and even tracks) slightly improved the biomass estimation. Combined use of UAVSAR data acquired from opposite directions (odd and even tracks) slightly improved the biomass estimation at 1/4-ha scale, R-2 increased from 0.59 to 0.66 and RMSE reduced from 52.08 to 48.57 Mg/ha. Averaging multiple acquisitions of UAVSAR data from the same look azimuth direction did not improve biomass estimation. A biomass map derived from NASA's LVIS (Laser Vegetation Imaging System) waveform data was used as a reference for evaluation of the biomass maps from these models. The study has also shown that the errors decreased when deciduous, evergreen, and mixed forests were modeled separately but the improvement was not significant.

Drivers of bird diversity in an understudied African centre of endemism: The Angolan Central Escarpment Forest	BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL												Natural habitats are being rapidly lost due to human activities. It is therefore vital to understand how these activities influence biodiversity so that suitable guidelines can be established for conservation. This is particularly important in understudied, high biodiversity, areas such as the Angolan Escarpment. Here we examine which habitat characteristics drive bird diversity and endemic species presence at Kumbira Forest, a key site in the Central Escarpment Forest. Bird diversity was sampled by 10 min bird point counts, whereas habitat characteristics were measured by a combination of ground-based vegetation surveys and remotely sensed data modelling of Landsat images. GLM, multi-model inference and model averaging were used to determine the most important variables driving species richness and the presence of endemics. The remote sensing variables performed poorly in predicting presence of Red-crested Turaco Tauraco erythrolophus and Gabela Bushshrike Laniarius amboimensis but they contributed significantly to explain species richness and Gabela Akalat Sheppardia gabela presence, both of which were associated with greater canopy cover. Liana density and elevation were also important explanatory variables in certain cases.

LocationTin Toumma desert, Niger MethodsIntegrating field surveys, collected over a 7-year period (2008-2014), with remote sensing-derived measures of vegetation productivity (NDVI) and surface roughness, we fit models in a generalized linear regression framework to predict and evaluate the occurrence of addax and dorcas gazelle. ResultsAddax declined significantly over the course of the study, strongly affecting the outcomes of our regression models. Other factors, namely surface roughness and the occurrence of the perennial grass Stipagrostis acutiflora, were important in predicting addax occurrence. Dorcas gazelle, inhabiting areas further to the south of our study area, were more positively associated with increases in vegetation productivity than addax. Both species were observed to have a strong negative response to human disturbance. Predictive models, relying only on remotely sensed derived variables, provided insight into areas of habitat suitability and highlighted niche partitioning across the Sahelo-Saharan biome. Main conclusionsOur results provide improved insight into the factors contributing to the occurrence of this critically endangered (addax) and vulnerable (dorcas gazelle) species and may help guide future field surveys across the region to locate small and geographically isolated populations. Developing statistically based ecological habitat models provide a first-step towards improved management and policy development for the long-term conservation of these species and complement field surveys conducted across the region to monitor species that are increasingly being pushed to extinction.

Decline of a giant salamander assessed with historical records, environmental DNA and multi-scale habitat data	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Freshwater species are declining rapidly but more complete data are needed for determining the extent and cause(s) of population declines and extirpations. Integrating newer survey techniques, freely available data, and traditional field work may allow for more effective assessment of population decline. We used detailed historical species records and environmental DNA (eDNA) survey methods to identify changes in population distribution of a long-lived, imperiled stream salamander, the eastern hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis: Cryptobranchidae). We used logistic regression with Bayesian inference to test whether selected environmental variables may be good predictors of hellbender population persistence and extirpation. Hellbenders persisted in only 42% of the 24 historical record sites. The best fit model indicated electrical conductivity (EC) was the strongest predictor of hellbender population persistence (EC<278S/cm) and extirpation. Conductivity was strongly negatively correlated with canopy cover within the total watershed (r=-0.83, n=21, p<0.001) and riparian buffer of the watershed (r=-0.77, n=21, p<0.001). Electrical conductivity tends to increase following deforestation, and may inhibit sperm motility and thus limit recruitment of hellbenders and other aquatic vertebrate species with external fertilisation. By integrating historical data, eDNA, field data, and freely available high resolution remote sensing data, our study design allowed for rapid assessment of predictors of and changes in hellbender distribution over a relatively broad geographic area. This cost- and time-effective approach may be used for evaluating other rare aquatic species.																	0046-5070	1365-2427				JUN	2017	62	6					967	976		10.1111/fwb.12917								WOS:000400571200001

Energy Development in Colorado's Pawnee National Grasslands: Mapping and Measuring the Disturbance Footprint of Renewables and Non-Renewables	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												This paper examines the pattern and extent of energy development in steppe landscapes of northeast Colorado, United States. We compare the landscape disturbance created by oil and gas production to that of wind energy inside the Pawnee National Grasslands eastern side. This high-steppe landscape consists of a mosaic of federal, state, and private lands where dominant economic activities include ranching, agriculture, tourism, oil and gas extraction, and wind energy generation. Utilizing field surveys, remote sensing data and geographic information systems techniques, we quantify and map the footprint of energy development at the landscape level. Findings suggest that while oil and gas and wind energy development have resulted in a relatively small amount of habitat loss within the study area, the footprint stretches across the entire zone, fragmenting this mostly grassland habitat. Futhermore, a third feature of this landscape, the non-energy transportation network, was also found to have a significant impact. Combined, these three features fragment the entire Pawnee National Grasslands eastern side, leaving very few large intact core, or roadless areas. The primary objective of this ongoing work is to create a series of quantifiable and replicable surface disturbance indicators linked to energy production in semi-arid grassland environments. Based on these, and future results, we aim to work with industry and regulators to shape energy policy as it relates to environmental performance, with the aim of reducing the footprint and thus increasing the sustainability of these extractive activities.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				JUN	2017	59	6					995	1016		10.1007/s00267-017-0846-z								WOS:000400444100010	28374225

Woodland expansion in South African grassy biomes based on satellite observations (1990-2013): general patterns and potential drivers	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Increases in woody plant cover in savanna grassland environments have been reported on globally for over 50 years and are generally perceived as a threat to rangeland productivity and biodiversity. Despite this, few attempts have been made to estimate the extent of woodland increase at a national scale, principally due to technical constraints such as availability of appropriate remote sensing products. In this study, we aimed to measure the extent to which woodlands have replaced grasslands in South Africa's grassy biomes. We use multiseason Landsat data in conjunction with satellite L-band radar backscatter data to estimate the extent of woodlands and grasslands in 1990 and 2013. The method employed allows for a unique, nationwide measurement of transitions between grassland and woodland classes in recent decades. We estimate that during the 23-year study period, woodlands have replaced grasslands over similar to 57 000 km(2) and conversely that grasslands have replaced woodlands over similar to 30 000 km(2), a net increase in the extent of woodland of similar to 27 000 km(2) and an annual increase of 0.22%. The changes varied markedly across the country; areas receiving over 500 mm mean annual precipitation showed higher rates of woodland expansion than regions receiving <500 mm (0.31% yr(-1) and 0.11% yr(-1), respectively). Protected areas with elephants showed clear loss of woodlands (-0.43% yr(-1)), while commercial rangelands and traditional rangelands showed increases in woodland extent (>0.19% yr(-1)). The woodland change map presented here provides a unique opportunity to test the numerous models of woody plant encroachment at a national/regional scale.

Biodiversity mapping can benefit from multi-spectral instruments such as WorldView-2 with very high spatial resolution and a spectral configuration encompassing important spectral regions not previously available for vegetation mapping. This study investigated i) the benefits of the eight-band WorldView-2 (WV-2) spectral configuration for discriminating tree species in Southern African savannah and ii) if multiple-images acquired at key points of the typical phenological development of savannahs (peak productivity, transition to senescence) improve on tree species classifications. We first assessed the discriminatory power of WV-2 bands using interspecies-Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) via Band Add-On procedure and tested the spectral capability of WorldView-2 against simulated IKONOS for tree species classification. The results from interspecies-SAM procedure identified the yellow and red bands as the most statistically significant bands (p = 0.000251 and p = 0.000039 respectively) in the discriminatory power of WV-2 during the transition from wet to dry season (April). Using Random Forest classifier, the classification scenarios investigated showed that i) the 8-bands of the WV-2 sensor achieved higher classification accuracy for the April date (transition from wet to dry season, senescence) compared to the March date (peak productivity season) ii) the WV-2 spectral configuration systematically outperformed the IKONOS sensor spectral configuration and iii) the multi-temporal approach (March and April combined) improved the discrimination of tress species and produced the highest overall accuracy results at 80.4%. Consistent with the interspecies-SAM procedure, the yellow (605 nm) band also showed a statistically significant contribution in the improved classification accuracy from WV-2. These results highlight the mapping opportunities presented by WV-2 data for monitoring the distribution status of e.g. species often harvested by local communities (e.g. Sclerocharya birrea), encroaching species, or species-specific tree losses induced by elephants.

Specifically, plant invasions in understory tropical forests are detrimental to the persistence of healthy ecosystems. Monitoring such invasions using Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite remote sensing has been shown to be valuable in designing management interventions for conservation of native habitats. Object-based classification methods are very helpful in identifying invasive plants in various habitats, by their inherent nature of imitating the ability of the human brain in pattern recognition. However, these methods have not been tested adequately in dense tropical mixed forests where invasion occurs in the understorey. This study compares a pixel-based and object-based classification method for mapping the understorey invasive shrub Lantana camara (Lantana) in a tropical mixed forest habitat in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot in India. Overall, a hierarchical approach of mapping top canopy at first, and then further processing for the understorey shrub, using measures such as texture and vegetation indices proved effective in separating out Lantana from other cover types. In the first method, we implement a simple parametric supervised classification for mapping cover types, and then process within these types for Lantana delineation. In the second method, we use an object-based segmentation algorithm to map cover types, and then perform further processing for separating Lantana. The improved ability of the object-based approach to delineate structurally distinct objects with characteristic spectral and spatial characteristics of their own, as well as with reference to their surroundings, allows for much flexibility in identifying invasive understorey shrubs among the complex vegetation of the tropical forest than that provided by the parametric classifier. Conservation practices in tropical mixed forests can benefit greatly by adopting methods which use high resolution remotely sensed data and advanced techniques to monitor the patterns and effective functioning of native ecosystems by periodically mapping disturbances such as invasion.																	1664-462X					MAY 31	2017	8								892	10.3389/fpls.2017.00892								WOS:000402385000001	28620400

Remote sensing-derived spectral vegetation indices and forest carbon: testing the validity of models in mountainous terrain covered with high biodiversity	CURRENT SCIENCE												Sequestration of carbon through forests is an important aspect in global climate change mitigation. Assessment of carbon in forests using remote sensing and GIS tools is one of the most important aspects of rapid and verifiable methodologies. A number of studies have shown the utility of spectral (vegetation) indices like NDVI in the assessment of forest carbon. However, there are limitations to this approach. The mountainous topography and high biodiversity affect the spectral values in pixels in multiple ways. The present article aims to test the validity of use of vegetation indices in high-biodiversity forests in mountains by modelling the ground based forest carbon measurement with vegetation indices of NDVI, EVI, SAVI and MSAVI in a multi-sensor, multi-season data environment with multiple regression methods like linear, power, logarithmic, polynomial and exponential. It is found that all the regressions have a poor coefficient of determination not even exceeding 0.2. It is concluded that the remote sensing-based spectral vegetation indices alone cannot be a proxy for forest carbon calculators in high biodiversity mountain forests.																	0011-3891					MAY 25	2017	112	10					2043	2050		10.18520/cs/v112/i10/2043-2050								WOS:000401737600024

Hydrology of inland tropical lowlands: the Kapuas and Mahakam wetlands	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Wetlands are important reservoirs of water, carbon and biodiversity. They are typical landscapes of lowland regions that have high potential for water retention. However, the hydrology of these wetlands in tropical regions is often studied in isolation from the processes taking place at the catchment scale. Our main objective is to study the hydrological dynamics of one of the largest tropical rainforest regions on an island using a combination of satellite remote sensing and novel observations from dedicated field campaigns. This contribution offers a comprehensive analysis of the hydrological dynamics of two neighbouring poorly gauged tropical basins; the Kapuas basin (98 700 km(2)) in West Kalimantan and the Mahakam basin (77 100 km(2)) in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Both basins are characterised by vast areas of inland lowlands. Hereby, we put specific emphasis on key hydrological variables and indicators such as discharge and flood extent. The hydroclimatological data described herein were obtained during fieldwork campaigns carried out in the Kapuas over the period 2013-2015 and in the Mahakam over the period 2008-2010. Additionally, we used the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) rainfall estimates over the period 1998-2015 to analyse the distribution of rainfall and the influence of El-Nino -Southern Oscillation. Flood occurrence maps were obtained from the analysis of the Phase Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) images from 2007 to 2010. Drought events were derived from time series of simulated groundwater recharge using time series of TRMM rainfall estimates, potential evapotranspiration estimates and the threshold level approach. The Kapuas and the Mahakam lake regions are vast reservoirs of water of about 1000 and 1500 km(2) that can store as much as 3 and 6.5 billion m(3) of water, respectively. These storage capacity values can be doubled considering the area of flooding under vegetation cover. Discharge time series show that backwater effects are highly influential in the wetland regions, which can be partly explained by inundation dynamics shown by flood occurrence maps obtained from PALSAR images. In contrast to their nature as wetlands, both lowland areas have frequent periods with low soil moisture conditions and low groundwater recharge. The Mahakam wetland area regularly exhibits low groundwater recharge, which may lead to prolonged drought events that can last up to 13 months. It appears that the Mahakam lowland is more vulnerable to hydrological drought, leading to more frequent fire occurrences than in the Kapuas basin.

Contemporary Remotely Sensed Data Products Refine Invasive Plants Risk Mapping in Data Poor Regions	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Invasive weeds are a serious problem worldwide, threatening biodiversity and damaging economies. Modeling potential distributions of invasive weeds can prioritize locations for monitoring and control efforts, increasing management efficiency. Forecasts of invasion risk at regional to continental scales are enabled by readily available downscaled climate surfaces together with an increasing number of digitized and georeferenced species occurrence records and species distribution modeling techniques. However, predictions at a finer scale and in landscapes with less topographic variation may require predictors that capture biotic processes and local abiotic conditions. Contemporary remote sensing (RS) data can enhance predictions by providing a range of spatial environmental data products at fine scale beyond climatic variables only. In this study, we used the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and empirical maximum entropy (MaxEnt) models to model the potential distributions of 14 invasive plant species across Southeast Asia (SEA), selected from regional and Vietnam's lists of priority weeds. Spatial environmental variables used to map invasion risk included bioclimatic layers and recent representations of global land cover, vegetation productivity (GPP), and soil properties developed from Earth observation data. Results showed that combining climate and RS data reduced predicted areas of suitable habitat compared with models using climate or RS data only, with no loss in model accuracy. However, contributions of RS variables were relatively limited, in part due to uncertainties in the land cover data. We strongly encourage greater adoption of quantitative remotely sensed estimates of ecosystem structure and function for habitat suitability modeling. Through comprehensive maps of overall predicted area and diversity of invasive species, we found that among lifeforms (herb, shrub, and vine), shrub species have higher potential invasion risk in SEA. Native invasive species, which are often overlooked in weed risk assessment, may be as serious a problem as non-native invasive species. Awareness of invasive weeds and their environmental impacts is still nascent in SEA and information is scarce. Freely available global spatial datasets, not least those provided by Earth observation programs, and the results of studies such as this one provide critical information that enables strategic management of environmental threats such as invasive species.																	1664-462X					MAY 15	2017	8								770	10.3389/fpls.2017.00770								WOS:000401316500001	28555147

One example is the red deer (Cervus elaphus), which was able to expand its range and is now found in half the areas it inhabited in the beginning of the 19 th century. Herbivores are important ecosystem engineers, influencing e.g. vegetation. Knowledge on their habitat selection and their influence on ecosystems might be crucial for future landscape management, especially for hybrid and novel ecosystems emerging in post-industrial landscapes. In this study, red deer habitat selection was studied in a former brown-coal mining area in Denmark. Here, natural settings were severely changed during the mining activity and its current landscape is in large parts managed by hunters as suitable deer habitat. We assessed red deer habitat preferences through feces presence and camera traps combined with land cover data from vegetation sampling, remote sensing and official geographic data. Red deer occurrence was negatively associated with human disturbance and positively associated with forage availability, tree cover and mean terrain height. Apparently, red deer are capable of recolonizing former industrial landscapes quite well if key conditions such as forage abundance and cover are appropriate. In the absence of carnivores, human disturbance, such as a hunting regime is a main reason why deer avoid certain areas. The resulting spatial heterogeneity red deer showed in their habitat use of the study area might be a tool to preserve mosaic landscapes of forest and open habitats and thus promote biodiversity in abandoned post-industrial landscapes.																	1932-6203					MAY 15	2017	12	5							e0177431	10.1371/journal.pone.0177431								WOS:000401473500021	28505192

This paper seeks to contribute knowledge regarding the use of these technologies by studying randomly dispersed native palm tree. Here, we analyze the automatic detection of large circular crown (LCC) palm tree using a high spatial resolution panchromatic GeoEye image (0.50 m) taken on the area of a community of small agricultural farms in the Brazilian Amazon. We also propose auxiliary methods to estimate the density of the LCC palm tree Attalea speciosa (babassu) based on the detection results. We used the "Compt-palm" algorithm based on the detection of palm tree shadows in open areas via mathematical morphology techniques and the spatial information was validated using field methods (i.e. structural census and georeferencing). The algorithm recognized individuals in life stages 5 and 6, and the extraction percentage, branching factor and quality percentage factors were used to evaluate its performance. A principal components analysis showed that the structure of the studied species differs from other species. Approximately 96% of the babassu individuals in stage 6 were detected. These individuals had significantly smaller stipes than the undetected ones. In turn, 60% of the stage 5 babassu individuals were detected, showing significantly a different total height and a different number of leaves from the undetected ones. Our calculations regarding resource availability indicate that 6870 ha contained 25,015 adult babassu palm tree, with an annual potential productivity of 27.4 t of almond oil. The detection of LCC palm tree and the implementation of auxiliary field methods to estimate babassu density is an important first step to monitor this industry resource that is extremely important to the Brazilian economy and thousands of families over a large scale.

We produced consistent Central Asia forest cover (CAFC) maps based on a cost-efficient approach using multi-resolution satellite imagery from Landsat and MODIS during 2009-2011. The spectral-temporal metrics derived from 2009-2011 Landsat imagery (overall accuracy of 0.83) was used to predict sub-pixel forest cover on the MODIS scale for 2010. Accuracy assessment confirmed the validity of MODIS-based forest cover map with a normalized root-mean-square error of 0.63. A general paucity of forest resources in post-Soviet Central Asia was indicated, with 1.24% of the region covered by forest. In comparison to the CAFC map, a regional map derived from MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields tended to underestimate forest cover, while the Global Forest Change product matched well. The Global Forest Resources Assessments, based on individual country reports, overestimated forest cover by 1.5 to 147 times, particularly in the more arid countries of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Multi-resolution imagery contributes to regionalized assessment of forest cover in the world's drylands while developed CAFC maps (available at https://data.zef.de/) aim to facilitate decisions on biodiversity conservation and reforestation programs in Central Asia.

Implications of land use transitions on soil nitrogen in dynamic landscapes in Tanzania	LAND USE POLICY												Land use transitions are rated among the leading sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the tropics. They significantly challenge the functioning of ecosystems and affect multi-temporal stability of greenhouse gases such as N2O and soil properties. Studies on dynamics in nitrogen balances are essential in understanding greenhouse gas emissions such as N2O and to manage their impacts on productivity. In this study, multi-temporal Landsat images (1975, 1995 and 2012) were classified to determine land use transitions and potential drivers. The classified images were categorized into degraded and non-degraded lands and eighty sampling plots generated within the entire study area. Soil samples were then collected at 0-15, 15-30 and 30-60 cm depths on each plot and soil nitrogen determined. A regression analysis was developed to determine the influence of forest and grassland degradation on soil nitrogen. Results indicated a significant change in major land use and land cover types. Specifically, there was a decrease in areas covered by forests, woodland and grassland, however, area covered by less dense forest increased. Results also indicated variability in mean nitrogen content between degraded and non-degraded areas and depths. Furthermore, levels of degradation influence nitrogen content up to a soil depth of 30 cm. The present study is relevant in the detailed assessment of the extent of damage and threats posed to biodiversity hotspots in sub-Saharan Africa. These results are transferable to other parts of the world characterized by dynamic ecological transformation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Estimating the degree of ecosystem response attributable specifically to eradication of exotic herbivores versus restoration of native herbivores is often difficult and is complicated by concurrent temporal changes in other factors, especially climate. We investigated the interactive impacts of native mega-herbivores (giant tortoises) and the eradication of large alien herbivores (goats) on vegetation productivity across the Galapagos Archipelago. We examined archipelago-wide patterns of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a proxy for vegetation productivity between 2001 and 2015 and evaluated how goat and historical and current tortoise occurrence influenced productivity. We used a breakpoint analysis to detect change in trends in productivity from five targeted areas following goat eradication. We found a positive association between tortoise occurrence and vegetation productivity and a negative association with goat occurrence. We also documented an increase in plant productivity following goat removal with recovery higher in moister regions than in arid region, potentially indicating an alternate stable state has been created in the latter. Climate variation also contributed to the detected improvement in productivity following goat eradication, sometimes obscuring the effect of eradication but more usually magnifying it by up to 300%. Our work offers perspectives regarding the effectiveness and outcomes of eradicating introduced herbivores and re-introducing native herbivores, and the merits of staging them simultaneously in order to restore critical ecosystem processes such as vegetation productivity.

J	Zhang, F; Kung, HT; Johnson, VC				Zhang, Fei; Kung, Hsiang-te; Johnson, Verner Carl			Assessment of Land-Cover/Land-Use Change and Landscape Patterns in the Two National Nature Reserves of Ebinur Lake Watershed, Xinjiang, China	SUSTAINABILITY												Land-cover and land-use change (LCLUC) alters landscape patterns and affects regional ecosystems. The objective of this study was to examine LCLUC and landscape patterns in Ebinur Lake Wetland National Nature Reserve (ELWNNR) and Ganjia Lake Haloxylon Forest National Nature Reserve (GLHFNNR), two biodiversity-rich national nature reserves in the Ebinur Lake Watershed (ELW), Xinjiang, China. Landsat satellite images from 1972, 1998, 2007 and 2013 were used to calculate the dynamics of a land-cover and land-use (LCLU) transition matrix and landscape pattern index using ENVI 5.1 and FRAGSTATS 3.3. The results showed drastic land use modifications have occurred in ELWNNR during the past four decades. Between 1972 and 1998, 1998 and 2007, and 2007 and 2013, approximately 251.50 km(2) (7.93%), 122.70 km(2) (3.87%), and 195.40 km(2) (6.16%) of wetland were turned into salinized land. In GLHFNNR both low and medium density Haloxylon forest area declined while high density Haloxylon forest area increased. This contribution presents a method for characterizing LCLUC using one or more cross-tabulation matrices based on Sankey diagrams, demonstrating the depiction of flows of energy or materials through ecosystem network. The ecological landscape index displayed that a unique landscape patches have shrunk in size, scattered, and fragmented. It becomes a more diverse landscape. Human activities like farming were negatively correlated with the landscape diversity of wetlands. Furthermore, evidence of degraded wetlands caused by air temperature and annual precipitation, was also observed. We conclude that national and regional policies related to agriculture and water use have significantly contributed to the extensive changes; the ELWNNR and GLHFNNR are highly susceptible to LCLUC in the surrounding Ebinur Lake Watershed.																	2071-1050					MAY	2017	9	5							724	10.3390/su9050724								WOS:000404127800049						
J	Bonnema, M; Hossain, F				Bonnema, Matthew; Hossain, Faisal			Inferring reservoir operating patterns across the Mekong Basin using only space observations	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												This study explores the operating pattern of artificial reservoirs by examining their impact on streamflow through two parameters, residence time and flow alteration, using a purely satellite-based technique for the Mekong Basin. Overall residence times of individual reservoirs ranged from 0.09 to 4.04 years, while streamflow was altered between 11 and 130% of its natural variability. The current set of reservoirs appears to have increased the residence time of the entire Mekong basin by about 1 month. However, if subbasin variability is considered, the satellite-based method depicts a different picture. Residence time increases to 4 months when only regulated flows are considered. If low residence time reservoirs on major rivers are excluded and reservoirs on higher stream-order rivers considered, residence time increases to 1.3 years. Predictable strong seasonal patterns emerged in residence time, where reservoirs experience higher residence time in the dry season and lower residence time in the wet season and residence time varies inversely with precipitation. High variability in reservoir effects on streamflow between reservoirs could not be explained by any reservoir properties (e.g., size, use, location, etc.), highlighting the variability in the human decisions operating these reservoirs. The take-home message of this study is that satellite observations, in combination with physical models forced with satellite data, can elucidate the spatiotemporal variability of reservoir behavior in ungauged basins of the developing world. We demonstrate in this study that the requirement for ground data to monitor current or historical behavior of dams is not necessary. Plain Language Summary The key take home message of our study is that satellites can now see the diverse variability of surface water residence time due to reservoir construction in ungauged and international river basins that is otherwise intractable. As satellite observations become increasingly more widespread in the near future, the scientific community will be able to rely on space observations to understand the potential impact of extensive reservoir development planned by each riparian nation of major river basins in the developing world. Such an ability will improve water management, inform planning decisions, and better reservoir operations. Such an understanding can also counter the secrecy or the lack of capacity that is common among nations, and result in a more cooperative environment for the benefit of all the stakeholders of the basin.

Currently, there is insufficient information on the magnitude of human pressure affecting one such important forest community, namely Sand Forest, particularly in communal areas. The temporal monitoring of the spatial structures of forest areas, such as Sand Forest, within landscapes has been recommended in order to detect and model deteriorating trends in the forest structures and functioning. Remote sensing is critical in the generation of data that enables the identification and quantification of degraded and deforested areas. The constrained distribution and fragmented patches associated with Sand Forest, and the effects of a declining canopy closure, resulting from selective wood harvesting, requires the use of remote sensing techniques and procedures that could potentially account for these characteristics. A spectral index that has been widely successful in monitoring disturbances in forests is the Disturbance Index. The success of the Disturbance Index in detecting changes could be attributed to the components that comprise the Disturbance Index, in that it takes into account the relationship that exists between soil; vegetation; and canopy & soil moisture. The suitability of determining changes could also be attributed to the approach taken by the Disturbance Index i.e. monitoring disturbance versus a component of vegetation, such as the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (biomass). The rates of change derived for the study period (1998 to 2014) provided quantified information on the magnitude of human pressure affecting Sand Forest throughout Maputaland. The rates of change showed that the accumulated total loss in the extent of Sand Forest, across the South African section of Maputaland, was 15.53 km(2) over a period of 16 years.

To assess whether we could use hyperspectral visible near-infrared (VNIR) spectra to estimate species diversity, we examined the correlations between species diversity and spectral diversity in early-successional abandoned agricultural fields in the Ridge and Valley ecoregion of north-central Virginia at the Blandy Experimental Farm. We established plant community plots and collected vegetation surveys and ground-level hyperspectral data from 350 to 1,025 nm wavelengths. We related spectral diversity (standard deviations across spectra) with species diversity (Shannon-Weiner index) and evaluated whether these correlations differed among spectral regions throughout the visible and near-infrared wavelength regions, and across different spectral transformation techniques. We found positive correlations in the visible regions using band depth data, positive correlations in the near-infrared region using first derivatives of spectra, and weak to no correlations in the red-edge region using either of the two spectral transformation techniques. To investigate the role of pigment variability in these correlations, we estimated chlorophyll, carotenoid, and anthocyanin concentrations of five dominant species in the plots using spectral vegetation indices. Although interspecific variability in pigment levels exceeded intraspecific variability, chlorophyll was more varied within species than carotenoids and anthocyanins, contributing to the lack of correlation between species diversity and spectral diversity in the red-edge region. Interspecific differences in pigment levels, however, made it possible to differentiate these species remotely, contributing to the species-spectral diversity correlations. VNIR spectra can be used to estimate species diversity, but the relationships depend on the spectral region examined and the spectral transformation technique used.

Based on land use pattern and benefit transfer method, this research estimated value of ecosystem services in Taiwan. Scientific information of land use and land cover change is accessed through multi-year satellite imagery moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), and geographic information system (GIS) technology. Combined with benefit transfer method, this research estimated the ecosystem service valuation of forest, grassland, cropland, wetland, water, and urban for the period of 2000 to 2015 in Taiwan. It is found that forest made the greatest contribution and the significant increasing area of wetland has huge potential benefit for environmental conservation in Taiwan. We recommend placing maintaining wetland ecosystem in Taiwan with higher priority. This research also compared ecosystem service value with natural capital consumption which would essentially facilitate policy makers to understand the relationship between benefits gained from natural capital and the loss from human-made capital.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				MAY	2017	24	13					12144	12154		10.1007/s11356-017-8795-x								WOS:000400765500029	28349311

Based on these data, we tested whether patterns in macroalgal diversity and distribution along European intertidal rocky shores could be explained by a set of meteo-oceanographic variables. The variables considered were salinity, sea surface temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, significant wave height and tidal range and were compiled from three different sources: remote sensing, reanalysis technique and in situ measurement. These variables were parameterized to represent average conditions (mean values), variability (standard deviation) and extreme events (minimum and maximum values). The results obtained in this study contribute to reinforce the EMBOS network approach and highlight the necessity of considering meteo-oceanographic variables in long-term assessments. The broad spatial distribution of pilot sites has allowed identification of latitudinal and longitudinal gradients manifested through species composition, diversity and dominance structure of intertidal macroalgae. These patterns follow a latitudinal gradient mainly explained by sea surface temperature, but also by photosynthetically active radiation, salinity and tidal range. Additionally, a longitudinal gradient was also detected and could be linked to wave height.

However, the comprehensive understanding of urban environmental change in China based on multi-source remote sensing data remains inadequate because current studies have mainly focused on a single aspect of the urban environment using a specific source of remote sensing data. In this study, we developed a comprehensive evaluation index (CEI) combining the remote sensing data of the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration, land surface temperature (1ST) and vegetation cover (VC) to assess the urban environmental change in China at the national scale, among urban agglomerations and across the rapidly urbanized regions. We found a trend of environmental degradation in the urban areas of China between 2000 and 2012. Environmentally degraded and moderately degraded urban areas accounted for 48.14% of the total urban area in China. In particular, the expanded urban areas exhibited the most extensive environmental degradation, with 52.33% of the total expanded urban areas from 1992 to 2012 exhibiting environmental degradation or moderately environmental degradation. The increase in the PM2.5 concentration was one of the main manifestations of the environmental degradation in the expanded urban areas. We suggest that more attention should be paid to urban environmental issues during future urban development in China. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, the current regional scale hard coral distribution of geomorphic and ecological zones, essential for reefs management in the context of global warming and ocean acidification, is not well documented. We analyzed data from field surveys, Landsat-8 and GF-1 images to map the distribution of hard coral within geomorphic zones and reef flat ecological zones. In situ surveys conducted in June 2014 on nine reefs provided a complete picture of reef status with regard to live coral diversity, evenness of coral cover and reef health (live versus dead cover) for the Xisha Islands. Mean coral cover was 12.5% in 2014 and damaged reefs seemed to show signs of recovery. Coral cover in sheltered habitats such as lagoon patch reefs and biotic dense zones of reef flats was higher, but there were large regional differences and low diversity. In contrast, the more exposed reef slopes had high coral diversity, along with high and more equal distributions of coral cover. Mean hard coral cover of other zones was < 10%. The total Xisha reef system was estimated to cover 1 060 km(2), and the emergent reefs covered similar to 787 m(2). Hard corals of emergent reefs were considered to cover 97 km(2). The biotic dense zone of the reef flat was a very common zone on all simple atolls, especially the broader northern reef flats. The total cover of live and dead coral can reach above 70% in this zone, showing an equilibrium between live and dead coral as opposed to coral and algae. This information regarding the spatial distribution of hard coral can support and inform the management of Xisha reef ecosystems.																	0254-4059	1993-5005				MAY	2017	35	3					501	514		10.1007/s00343-017-5336-x								WOS:000399168400004

However, the planning of land management interventions is hindered by the lack of information at relevant spatial resolution. We examined predictive models for mapping various tree, soil and species diversity attributes with a comparison of RapidEye and Landsat imagery. The field data was collected in the vicinity of the community-managed forest in southern Burkina Faso, where the main environmental threats are agricultural expansion and fuelwood extraction. The modelling was done using Random Forest algorithm. According to our results, tree crown cover and correlated attributes, such as basal area and tree species richness, were predicted most accurately. High spatial resolution RapidEye imagery provided the best accuracy but difference to medium resolution Landsat imagery was negligible for most attributes. Burn scar masked Landsat time series performed similar to dry season single date Landsat imagery, but the former avoids image selection and mosaicking, and could be less sensitive to artifacts due to the burn scars. The presented approach provides valuable information on important tree, soil and species diversity attributes for spatial planning of land management interventions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Response diversity, nonnative species, and disassembly rules buffer freshwater ecosystem processes from anthropogenic change	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Integrating knowledge of environmental degradation, biodiversity change, and ecosystem processes across large spatial scales remains a key challenge to illuminating the resilience of earth's systems. There is now a growing realization that the manner in which communities will respond to anthropogenic impacts will ultimately control the ecosystem consequences. Here, we examine the response of freshwater fishes and their nutrient excretion -a key ecosystem process that can control aquatic productivity -to human land development across the contiguous United States. By linking a continental-scale dataset of 533 fish species from 8100 stream locations with species functional traits, nutrient excretion, and land remote sensing, we present four key findings. First, we provide the first geographic footprint of nutrient excretion by freshwater fishes across the United States and reveal distinct local-and continental-scale heterogeneity in community excretion rates. Second, fish species exhibited substantial response diversity in their sensitivity to land development; for native species, the more tolerant species were also the species contributing greater ecosystem function in terms of nutrient excretion. Third, by modeling increased land-use change and resultant shifts in fish community composition, land development is estimated to decrease fish nutrient excretion in the majority (63%) of ecoregions. Fourth, the loss of nutrient excretion would be 28% greater if biodiversity loss was random or 84% greater if there were no nonnative species. Thus, ecosystem processes are sensitive to increased anthropogenic degradation but biotic communities provide multiple pathways for resistance and this resistance varies across space.																	1354-1013	1365-2486				MAY	2017	23	5					1871	1880		10.1111/gcb.13536								WOS:000397800600010	27761971

In contrast to field-based measurements, remote sensing techniques offer a cost-efficient opportunity to collect area-wide information about forest stand structure with high spatial and temporal resolution. Especially Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), which facilitates worldwide acquisition of 3d information independent from weather conditions and illumination, is convenient to capture forest stand structure. This study purposes an unsupervised two-stage clustering approach for forest structure classification based on height information derived from interferometric X-band SAR data which was performed in complex temperate forest stands of Traunstein forest (South Germany). In particular, a four dimensional input data set composed of first-order height statistics was non-linearly projected on a two-dimensional Self-Organizing Map, spatially ordered according to similarity (based on the Euclidean-distance) in the first stage and classified using the k-means algorithm in the second stage. The study demonstrated that X-band InSAR data exhibits considerable capabilities for forest structure classification. Moreover, the unsupervised classification approach achieved meaningful and reasonable results by means of comparison to aerial imagery and LiDAR data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Potential of satellite-derived ecosystem functional attributes to anticipate species range shifts	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												In a world facing rapid environmental changes, anticipating their impacts on biodiversity is of utmost relevance. Remotely-sensed Ecosystem Functional Attributes (EFAs) are promising predictors for Species Distribution Models (SDMs) by offering an early and integrative response of vegetation performance to environmental drivers. Species of high conservation concern would benefit the most from a better ability to anticipate changes in habitat suitability. Here we illustrate how yearly projections from SDMs based on EFAs could reveal short-term changes in potential habitat suitability, anticipating mid-term shifts predicted by climate-change-scenario models. We fitted two sets of SDM5 for 41 plant species of conservation concern in the Iberian Peninsula: one calibrated with climate variables for baseline conditions and projected under two climate-change-scenarios (future conditions); and the other calibrated with EFAs for 2001 and projected annually from 2001 to 2013. Range shifts predicted by climate-based models for future conditions were compared to the 2001-2013 trends from EFAs-based models. Projections of EFAs-based models estimated changes (mostly contractions) in habitat suitability that anticipated, for the majority (up to 64%) of species, the mid-term shifts projected by traditional climate-change scenario forecasting, and showed greater agreement with the business-as-usual scenario than with the sustainable-development one. This study shows how satellite-derived EFAs can be used as meaningful essential biodiversity variables in SDM5 to provide early-warnings of range shifts and predictions of short-term fluctuations in suitable conditions for multiple species.

Land occupation and transformation impacts of soybean production in Southern Amazonia, Brazil	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Since 2000, soybean production has gained increasing importance in Brazil, particularly in Southern Amazonia and the state of Mato Grosso, the largest producer in the country. This expansion has taken place through cropland extensification into natural ecosystems in the Amazon (tropical forest) and Cerrado (savanna) biomes with land transformation and occupation activity well documented by remote sensing. Guidelines from the UNEP/SETAC Life Cycle Initiative now allow for impact assessment of land transformation and occupation within a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to estimate potential impacts to biodiversity and ecosystem services. In this study, we apply these guidelines to soybean produced in 2010 in order to complement more traditional soybean LCAs with mid- and end-point impact assessment on biodiversity, erosion potential, water purification, groundwater recharge, biotic production and climate regulation potential in each of the Amazon and Cerrado biomes. In addition to providing regionalized characterization factors of land transformation and occupation in both Mato Grosso biomes, we estimate that one tonne of soybean produced in 2010 in the Amazon had greater impacts than when produced in the Cerrado. For the Amazon, total land transformation and occupation damage was estimated at $ 532 ton(-1) and $ 260 ton(-1) respectively, with estimates of $ 231 ton(-1) and $ 153 ton(-1) for the Cerrado. The largest contributors to these damage estimates came from the change in mechanical filtration properties of the soil followed by the land's climate regulation and biotic production potentials. The impact allocation to pasture as a transitional landscape in the establishment of cropland onto natural ecosystems diminished the soybean contribution through allocation of pasture to the beef production system, further adding to the land sparing argument for future cropland expansion in the region.

Nationwide assessment of forest burnt area in India using Resourcesat-2 AWiFS data	CURRENT SCIENCE												This study provides application of Resourcesat-2 AWiFS satellite imagery for forest burnt area assessment in India. AWiFS datasets covering peak forest fire months of 2014 have been analysed. The total burnt area under vegetation cover (forest, scrub and grasslands) of India was estimated as 57,127.75 sq. km. In 2014, 7% of forest cover of India was affected by fires. Of the major forest types, dry deciduous forests are affected by the highest burnt area, followed by moist deciduous forests. Among the biogeographic zones, the highest forest burnt area was recorded in Deccan followed by North East and Western Ghats. The highest burnt area was recorded in Odisha followed by Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Jharkhand, Manipur and Karnataka. Spatial analysis shows that 232 grid cells in India have a burnt area greater than 20 sq. km. The database generated would be useful in ecological damage assessment, fire risk modelling, carbon emissions accounting and biodiversity conservation.

Their aim is to provide a small but comprehensive set of monitoring variables that would give a balanced picture of the development of biodiversity and the reaching of international and national biodiversity targets. Globally, GEO BON (Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network) has suggested 22 candidate EBVs to be monitored. In this article we regard EBVs as a conceptual tool that may help in making national scale biodiversity monitoring more robust by pointing out where to focus further development resources. We look at one country-Finland-with a relatively advanced biodiversity monitoring scheme and study how well Finland's current biodiversity state indicators correspond with EBVs. In particular, we look at how national biodiversity monitoring could be improved by using available remote sensing (RS) applications. Rapidly emerging new technologies from drones to airborne laser scanning and new satellite sensors providing imagery with very high resolution (VHR) open a whole new world of opportunities for monitoring the state of biodiversity and ecosystems at low cost. In Finland, several RS applications already exist that could be expanded into national indicators. These include the monitoring of shore habitats and water quality parameters, among others. We hope that our analysis and examples help other countries with similar challenges. Along with RS opportunities, our analysis revealed also some needs to develop the EBV framework itself.

Using the city of Leipzig as a case study, we assess the effect of urban gardening type and intensity of management on ecosystem services and biodiversity by comparing allotment and community gardens. Employing a stratified sampling design, we assessed 30 allotment plots of different management intensity, including vacant plots, and six adjacent community gardens along a gradient of urbanity, using in-depth field surveys, remote sensing analyses and interviews. Our results show a bimodal relationship of overall vascular plant species richness with management intensity with highest species richness in medium intensively-managed plots, as they provide space for both cultivated edible and ornamental species as well as native, spontaneous species. In comparison to allotment gardens, community gardens provide a higher ratio of permeable soil surface and a slightly higher microbial soil activity, implying important differences in water regulation and nutrient cycling properties. With regard to climate regulation, old mature trees make a considerable contribution to above ground carbon storage, but are largely restricted to communal areas of the allotment estates due to code regulation. Based on our results, we discuss the impact of allotment gardening association codes and garden type and ways forward for gardeners and urban planners to promote biodiversity and ecosystem services provision.

Remote sensing data have been developed to provide information at different scales for surveys of forest ecosystems, but obtaining information about the understorey remains a challenge. As rapid and efficient tools for forest structure attribute estimation, Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) and Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) have attracted much attention. We examine the relationship between ALS and TLS data and detect changes in the forest understorey caused by forest-tending events in the study area. We conducted trials in five plots within a young Khasi pine (Pinus kesiya Royle ex Gord.) plantation in Yunnan province, China, before and after forest tending. We collected bi-temporal ALS data in this area and TLS data from 10 scanning stations. Canopy height profiles were retrieved from ALS and TLS data, and understorey material volume retrieved from filled TLS voxels volume agreed well with the understorey point clouds percentile distribution (PD) obtained from ALS data. The PD value for the understorey from ALS multiplied by the percentage of ALS return points in the overstorey had a stronger correlation (R-2 = 0.90) with the TLS- derived understorey material volume than did the ALS PD value for the understorey only (R-2 = 0.71). Taking the effect of the overstorey into consideration will improve evaluations of forest understorey parameters from ALS data. This study confirmed the potential of TLS as a validation tool to assess the accuracy of forest understorey material volume estimation at large scales using ALS data.

They play a key role in alleviating floods and filtering polluted water and also provide habitats for many plants and animals. Wetlands also interact with climate change. Over the past 50 years, wetlands have been polluted and declined dramatically as land cover has changed in some regions. Remote sensing has been the most useful tool to acquire spatial and temporal information about wetlands. In this paper, seven types of sensors were reviewed: aerial photos coarse-resolution, medium-resolution, high-resolution, hyperspectral imagery, radar, and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. This study also discusses the advantage of each sensor for wetland research. Wetland research themes reviewed in this paper include wetland classification, habitat or biodiversity, biomass estimation, plant leaf chemistry, water quality, mangrove forest, and sea level rise. This study also gives an overview of the methods used in wetland research such as supervised and unsupervised classification and decision tree and object-based classification. Finally, this paper provides some advice on future wetland remote sensing. To our knowledge, this paper is the most comprehensive and detailed review of wetland remote sensing and it will be a good reference for wetland researchers.

Farmland habitat diversity in Ireland	LAND USE POLICY												While appreciation of the fundamental role biodiversity plays in underpinning the long-term sustainability of agricultural systems is growing, international commitments to preserve and protect this natural resource have not yet been achieved. Loss and degradation of farmland habitats are an important contributor to the continued decline of biodiversity. Despite this, little information is available regarding the diversity and ecological condition of farmland habitats in Europe. Indeed, where habitat data are available, this is usually at a very broad landscape scale rather than farm scale. Coupled with this, strategies to increase agricultural output in response to growing global population, will likely place increasing pressure on farmland biodiversity. Knowledge and ongoing monitoring of farmland habitat type and extent is a prerequisite for the future protection of much of Europe's biodiversity. Here we report the findings of a national scale survey of farmland habitat diversity in Ireland. Detailed surveys of farm habitats and management practices (system, stocking rate agri-environment scheme participation status and organic N and P inputs) were undertaken on 118 farms in three regions of the Republic of Ireland (RoI). Recorded farm habitats were subsequently digitised on orthophotography. The resulting ground truthed data from the total surveyed area of 3688 ha, were then used, together with satellite imagery, to classify the habitat composition of a further approximately 87,000 ha of the surrounding landscape. Results revealed that at individual farm scale, an average of 73% of the land surveyed comprised agriculturally productive (mainly improved grassland) habitats. Marginally productive habitats (mainly extensively managed grasslands) accounted for an average of 11% of farm area, while other semi-natural habitats (mainly hedgerows) accounted for an average of 13%, with the remaining ca. 3% under build ground. Results from the classification at the wider landscape scale showed a similarly substantial incidence of non-intensively managed habitats. However, at both farm and landscape scales, habitat diversity was found to vary markedly between different regions and farming systems. This study represents one of a very small number that currently exist, where farm scale habitat and management data have been collected. From the few that are available, semi-natural habitat cover has been found to account for an average farm area of 1-12%. Therefore, our data present a relatively positive picture in terms of the intensity, scale and impact of Irish farming on landscape heterogeneity. However, as in other parts of the world, agricultural expansion and intensification to meet increased global food supply will necessitate careful monitoring of the impact of these changes on the structure of farmed landscapes. This study provides a novel approach for the collection of such monitoring data at farm scale, and illustrates how such data can be reliably up-scaled to landscape level. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Under the National Biological Corridor Program, the long-running Payment for Environmental Services Program was newly prioritized into biological corridors throughout the country. The National Biological Corridor Program caused a nationwide spatial shift in placement of payments for environmental services throughout Costa Rica. We classified ASTER 15-m resolution imagery in a central Costa Rica corridor connecting the eastern and western protected areas networks to analyze the change in forests during the National Biological Corridor Program with its targeted payments for environmental services effort. We used object-based classification methods, and compared land cover changes over an initial four-year period of corridor policy enactment. We calculated the changes within PES properties and outside of PES regions, and we also calculated forest patch metrics during the same time period. Results indicate a decline in forest cover over the study period, along with an increase in urban and pasture land. covers, with higher change and loss of forest centered inside of the biological corridor, near the construction area for the new San Carlos highway, and within eastern pasture areas. We also saw a higher percentage of forest loss inside of the biological corridor area as compared to areas outside of the biological corridor. Forest loss was drastically less within current and historic PES properties, as compared to the overall study region. Across the entire study region, patch metrics show a decrease in the number of patches and a slight decrease in average patch size. These results suggest that current and past designation of PES prevents forest loss within PES properties while the current designation of priority conservation status via the National Biological Corridor Program is not increasing connectivity and forest conservation. This is shown by increased land use change and a decrease in forest associated with biological corridor designation. These results are antithetical to the goals of the National Biological Corridor Program. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Such changes have strongly affected grassland areas which are seen as hotspots of biodiversity in Europe. In this study we have investigated the changes in grassland cover as well as the causal mechanism of those changes in a selected region in Northern Croatia during the post-socialist transition. By using the mixed methods approach we combined remote sensing, statistical modelling and a household-based questionnaire (n = 285) to map the changes in the grassland cover and to assess the socio-economic and bio-physical contributing factors of the documented changes. The results demonstrate that areas seeing general depopulation trends and population ageing, along with increases in the amount of educated people are characterized by shrub encroachment and farmland abandonment, while flatlands and lowland areas are seeing higher rates of grassland to farmland conversion. The results also show that the partial de-agrarization characteristic for the socialist period has become a full de-agrarization in the post-socialist period, with the main impetus being education, rather than employment, as was the case during socialism.

Unravelling the response of diurnal raptors to land use change in a highly dynamic landscape in northwestern Spain: an approach based on satellite earth observation data	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH												Land use and land cover change (LULCC) is one of the main components of current anthropogenic global change. Unravelling the ecological response of biodiversity to the combined effect of land use change and other stressors is essential for effective conservation. For this purpose, we used co-inertia analysis to combine LULCC analysis of earth observation satellite data-derived maps and raptor data obtained from road censuses conducted in 2001 and 2014 at sampling unit level (10 km(2) spatial resolution), in northwestern Spain (province of Ourense, c. 7281 km(2)). In addition, habitat suitability models were also computed using ten widely used single-modelling techniques providing an ensemble of predictions at landscape level (four spatial resolutions: 500-m, 1-km, 2-km and 5-km radius around each sighting) for each year and raptor species to analyse the habitat suitability changes in the whole study area through three niche overlap indices. The models revealed an increase in occurrence and habitat suitability of forest raptor species coupled with a strong decrease in species associated with open habitats, mainly heaths and shrub formations. Open-habitat specialist species were negatively affected by the concomitant effects of intensive forest management and a long-lasting trend of rural abandonment coupled with an unusually high frequency of wildfires. Sustainable forest management and agricultural practices should be encouraged by both public and private sectors, through, e.g. policies related to European funds for rural and regional development (FEDER and FEADER programs) to effectively protect threatened habitats and species, and to comply with current environmental legislation. The combined use of satellite imagery and ground-level biodiversity data proved to be a cost-effective and systematic method for monitoring priority habitats and their species in highly dynamic landscapes.

Our knowledge on the spatial patterns of deforestation and its proximate drivers remains partial though. We used the full Landsat image archive to reconstruct deforestation and post-deforestation dynamics between 1987 and 2012 for the entire Paraguayan Chaco, where deforestation has been rampant recently. Our classification resulted in reliable land-use change maps (86.16%), highlighting drastic forest losses of almost 44,000 km(2) between 1987 and 2012, equaling a deforestation rate of 27% and about 1% yearly, predominantly for grasslands. These likely represented new pastures, making pasture expansion the dominant proximate cause of deforestation. Cropland expansion, in contrast, only played a minor role as a proximate deforestation cause in the Paraguayan Chaco. Deforestation more than doubled between 2001 and 2012 (similar to 29,000 km(2)) compared to 1987-2000 (similar to 14,000 km(2)), due to leakage effects from the deforestation ban in the Paraguayan Atlantic Forests in 2004. Interestingly, while grasslands expanded in the Paraguayan Chaco between 1987 and 2000, cattle numbers decreased during the same time period, though strongly increased since. This apparent decoupling of area change and land-use intensity may indicate that the Paraguayan Chaco experienced an amplification period during the 1990s followed by an intensification period since 2001. Thus, our results highlight the need for both, a more detailed monitoring of post-deforestation dynamics and a land systems perspective in order to understand deforestation frontiers and thus ultimately to identify strategies to better balance production and conservation goals.

Such study can have many implications on people-forest interactions in the sanctuary and promote symbiotic approach in dealing with biodiversity conservation in protected area. Marat Longri WLS is indispensable to forest dwellers for subsistence and livelihoods. The result of pair-wise ranking revealed jhum (3160) is the major threat to forest cover followed by illegal felling (2850), agricultural expansion (2346), encroachment (2211) and collection pressure (2080).

The trajectory of land cover change is not a simple difference between two conditions, but a continuous process. Therefore, there is a need to integrate multiple time periods to identify slow and rapid transformations over time. We mapped land cover composition and configuration changes using time series of Landsat TM/ETM+ images (1985-2011) in Southern Chile to understand the transformation process of a temperate rainforest relict and biodiversity hotspot. Our analysis builds on 28 Landsat scenes from 1985 to 2011 that have been classified using a random forests approach. Base on the high temporal data set we quantify land cover change and fragmentation indices to fully understand landscape transformation in this area. Our results show a high deforestation process for old growth forest strongest at the beginning of the study period (1985-1986-1998-1999) followed by a progressive slowdown until 2011. Within different study periods deforestation rates were much larger than the average rate over the complete study period (0.65%), with the highest annual deforestation rate of 1.2% in 1998-1999. The deforestation resulted in a low connectivity between native forest patches. Old-growth forest was less fragmented, but was concentrated mainly in two large regions (the Andes and Coastal mountain range) with almost no connection in between. Secondary forest located in more intensively used areas was highly fragmented. Exotic forest plantation areas, one of the most important economic activities in the area, increased sevenfold (from 12,836 to 103,540 ha), especially during the first periods at the expense of shrubland, secondary forest, grassland/arable land and old grown forest. Our analysis underlines the importance of expanding temporal resolution in land cover/use change studies to guide sustainable ecosystem management strategies as increase landscape connectivity and integrate landscape planning to economic activities. The study is highlighting the key role of remote sensing in the sustainable management of human influenced ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Remote sensing allows wall-to-wall assessments and provides pixel data for a flexible composition of the management units. The purpose of this study was to incorporate models of ES provisioning potential in a spatial prioritization framework and to assess the pixel-level allocation of the land use. We tessellated the forested area in a landscape of altogether 7500 ha to 27,595 pixels of 48 x 48 m(2) and modeled the potential of each pixel to provide biodiversity, timber, carbon storage, and recreational amenities as indicators of supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural ESs, respectively. We analyzed spatial overlaps between the individual ESs, the potential to provide multiple ESs, and tradeoffs due to production constraints in a fraction of the landscape. The pixels considered most important for the individual ESs overlapped as much as 78% between carbon storage and timber production and up to 52.5% between the other ESs. The potential for multiple ESs could be largely explained in terms of forest structure as being emphasized to sparsely populated, spruce-dominated old forests with large average tree size. Constraining the production of the ESs in the landscape based on the priority maps, however, resulted in sub-optimal choices compared to an optimized production. Even though the land-use planning cannot be completed without involving the stakeholders' preferences, we conclude that the workflow described in this paper produced valuable information on the overlaps and tradeoffs of the ESs for the related decision support.

Deforestation risk due to commodity crop expansion in sub-Saharan Africa	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Rapid integration of global agricultural markets and subsequent cropland displacement in recent decades increased large-scale tropical deforestation in South America and Southeast Asia. Growing land scarcity and more stringent land use regulations in these regions could incentivize the offshoring of export-oriented commodity crops to sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We assess the effects of domestic-and export-oriented agricultural expansion on deforestation in SSA in recent decades. Analyses were conducted at the global, regional and local scales. We found that commodity crops are expanding in SSA, increasing pressure on tropical forests. Four Congo Basin countries, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Cte d ' Ivoire were most at risk in terms of exposure, vulnerability and pressures from agricultural expansion. These countries averaged the highest percent forest cover (58% +/- 17.93) and lowest proportions of potentially available cropland outside forest areas (1% +/- 0.89). Foreign investment in these countries was concentrated in oil palm production (81%), with a median investment area of 41 582 thousand ha. Cocoa, the fastest expanding export-oriented crop across SSA, accounted for 57% of global expansion in 2000-2013 at a rate of 132 thousand ha yr(-1). However, cocoa only amounted to 0.89% of foreign land investment. Commodity crop expansion in SSA appears largely driven by small-and mediumscale farmers rather than industrial plantations. Land-use changes associated with large-scale investments remain to be observed in many countries. Although domestic demand for commodity crops was associated with most agricultural expansion, we provide evidence of a growing influence of distant markets on land-use change in SSA.																	1748-9326					APR	2017	12	4							044015	10.1088/1748-9326/aa6509								WOS:000398370600004						
J	Takahashi, R; Todo, Y				Takahashi, Ryo; Todo, Yasuyuki			Coffee Certification and Forest Quality: Evidence from a Wild Coffee Forest in Ethiopia	WORLD DEVELOPMENT												Shade coffee certification programs that aim to conserve the forest and to prevent forest degradation have attracted an increasing amount of attention. However, such programs' impact on forest degradation remains unclear because of the absence of empirical evidence. In addition, there is heated debate about whether certification programs create an incentive for producers to expand their coffee-growing areas, which may accelerate forest degradation in the surrounding natural forest. This study, which was conducted in Ethiopia, aimed to evaluate the impact of a shade coffee certification program on forest degradation. Additionally, to provide empirical evidence for the debate, we examined the spillover effects of certification to surrounding forest areas and used remote sensing data of 2005 and 2010 to classify forest areas based on their density. We applied matching methods, such as the propensity score matching with different algorithms, to compare forest coffee areas with and without the certification. We found that the certified forest coffee areas slightly increased in forest density. By contrast, we observed drastic forest degradation in the forest coffee areas without certification. We checked the sensitivity of our results and found that our results are robust to potential hidden bias. Furthermore, our empirical results revealed that the natural forest areas within a 100-m radius from the forest coffee boundary area exhibited significantly reduced forest degradation compared with forest areas under similar environmental conditions but that such positive and significant impact diminished after 100-m distance. These results indicate that the certification program is effective in alleviating forest degradation in the certified area and in the surrounding natural forest. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

In addressing this challenge, we propose a remote sensing-based approach to forecast the future habitat quality for European badger, a species not abundant and at risk of local extinction in the arid environments of southeastern Spain, by incorporating environmental variables related with the ecosystem functioning and correlated with climate and land use. Using ensemble prediction methods, we designed global spatial distribution models for the distribution range of badger using presence-only data and climate variables. Then, we constructed regional models for an arid region in the southeast Spain using EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) derived variables and weighting the pseudo-absences with the global model projections applied to this region. Finally, we forecast the badger potential spatial distribution in the time period 2071-2099 based on IPCC scenarios incorporating the uncertainty derived from the predicted values of EVI-derived variables. By including remotely sensed descriptors of the temporal dynamics and spatial patterns of ecosystem functioning into spatial distribution models, results suggest that future forecast is less favorable for European badgers than not including them. In addition, change in spatial pattern of habitat suitability may become higher than when forecasts are based just on climate variables. Since the validity of future forecast only based on climate variables is currently questioned, conservation policies supported by such information could have a biased vision and overestimate or underestimate the potential changes in species distribution derived from climate change. The incorporation of ecosystem functional attributes derived from remote sensing in the modeling of future forecast may contribute to the improvement of the detection of ecological responses under climate change scenarios.

J	Middinti, S; Jha, CS; Reddy, TB				Middinti, Suresh; Jha, Chandra Shekhar; Reddy, Thatiparthi Byragi			Forest type classification with combination of advanced polarimetric decompositions and textures of L-band synthetic aperture radar data	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Information on distribution of forest types and land cover classes is essential for decision making and significant in climate regulation, biodiversity conservation, and societal issues. An approach for the combination of advanced polarimetric decompositions and textures of Advanced Land Observing Satellite Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar full polarimetric data for the purpose of forest type classification is proposed. Using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, we classified forest types over a selected Indian region. Further, we tested the classification performance of the Wishart method for the same forest types. The classified results were assessed with confusion matrix-based statistics. The results suggest that incorporation of various polarimetric decompositions features into gray-level co-occurrence matrix textures refines the SVM classification overall accuracy (OA) from 73.82% (k = 0.69) to 76.34% (k = 0.72). The Wishart supervised classification algorithm has the OA of 73.38% (kappa = 0.68). We observed that integration of polarimetric information with textures can give complimentary information in forest type discrimination and produce high accuracy maps. Further, this approach overcomes the limitations of optical remote sensing data in continuous cloud coverage areas. (C) 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

The climatic variables considered were precipitation, Land Surface Temperature (LST), and evapotranspiration (ET), whereas the topographic factors considered were elevation and aspect. The dataset consisted of MODIS NDVI data, satellite-delivered precipitation, ET, and the LST. A 2014 Landsat 8 OLI image was used to produce a vegetation map of the study area, while DEM was used to derive the elevation attributes and to calculate the aspect angles. Moran's I and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) Model was used to analyze the relationships between the climatic factors and NDVI changes over elevation and aspect. The results indicated that among the nine vegetation types inventoried in the area, the Mean NDVI varied from 0.33 to 0.59 and the optimal vegetation growth was found at an elevation between 2000 and 3900 m, with mean NDVI values larger than 0.50. The peak mean NDVI value of 0.59 was found at the elevation from 2100 to 2800 m. Vegetation growth was found to be more sensitive to elevation, as NDVI values were more varied at a lower elevation (<4000 m) than at a higher elevation (>4000 m). Considering the aspect, the greater vegetation growth was found in SE (132 degrees, 148 degrees), SW (182 degrees, 186 degrees), and NW (309.5 degrees -337.5 degrees), with mean NDVI values larger than 0.56. This indicated that vegetation was susceptible to better growth conditions in the lower elevation ranges and in shady areas. The vegetation NDVI in this study area was mostly uncorrelated with precipitation (R-2 = 0.34), but was strongly correlated with LST (R-2 = 0.99) and ET (R-2 = 98). LST (>= 18 degrees C) and ET (1286 mm/year(-1)) were found to provide optimal conditions for vegetation growth in the Virunga Volcanoes Massif. Empirically, the results concluded that elevation, aspect, LST, and ET are the main factors controlling the spatial distribution and vegetation growth in this area. This information is significantly helpful for biodiversity conservation and constitutes a valuable input to environmental and ecological research.																	2076-3263					MAR	2017	7	1							UNSP 17	10.3390/geosciences7010017								WOS:000410163000015

Conditions influencing the adoption of effective anti-deforestation policies in South America's commodity frontiers	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS												Reducing large-scale deforestation in commodity frontiers remains a key challenge for climate change mitigation and the conservation of biodiversity. Public and private anti-deforestation policies have been shown to effectively reduce forest loss, but the conditions under which such policies get adopted are rarely examined. Here we propose a set of conditions that we expect to be associated with the adoption of effective anti-deforestation policies in commodity frontiers. We then examine whether these conditions have influenced policy adoption in South America's major soy-and-cattle frontiers: the Brazilian Amazon, the Cerrado, the Chaco, the Chiquitano, and Paraguay's Atlantic Forest. By collating empirical data from diverse sources, including literature review, extensive expert interviews, and analysis of primary and secondary data, we show that the Cerrado, the Chaco, and the Chiquitano differ from the Brazilian Amazon in multiple ways that might have inhibited adoptions of effective anti-deforestation instruments. These conditions include: a higher importance of the agricultural sector within the respective countries, lower carbon stocks and species richness, higher prevalence of private land tenure, and higher baseline compliance with forest reserve regulations on private lands. We also observe that the adoption of the most effective private anti-deforestation instrument, commodity moratoria, may respond to similar conditions as those influencing the adoption of public instruments. Incentivizing public and private actors to adopt effective anti-deforestation policies in the Cerrado, Chaco, and the Chiquitano will likely be more challenging than it has been in the Brazilian Amazon.

J	d'Andrimont, R; Marlier, C; Defourny, P				d'Andrimont, Raphael; Marlier, Catherine; Defourny, Pierre			Hyperspatial and Multi-Source Water Body Mapping: A Framework to Handle Heterogeneities from Observations and Targets over Large Areas	REMOTE SENSING												Recent advances in remote sensing technologies and the cost reduction of surveying, along with the importance of natural resources management, present new opportunities for mapping land cover at a very high resolution over large areas. This paper proposes and applies a framework to update hyperspatial resolution (<1 m) land thematic mapping over large areas by handling multi-source and heterogeneous data. This framework deals with heterogeneity both from observation and the targeted features. First, observation diversity comes from the different platform and sensor types (25-cm passive optical and 1-m LiDAR) as well as the different instruments (three cameras and two LiDARs) used in heterogeneous observation conditions (date, time, and sun angle). Second, the local heterogeneity of the targeted features results from their within-type diversity and neighborhood effects. This framework is applied to surface water bodies in the southern part of Belgium (17,000 km(2)). This makes it possible to handle both observation and landscape contextual heterogeneity by mapping observation conditions, stratifying spatially and applying ad hoc classification procedures. The proposed framework detects 83% of the water bodiesif swimming pools are not taken into accountand more than 98% of those water bodies greater than 100 m(2), with an edge accuracy below 1 m over large areas.					d'Andrimont, Raphael/0000-0002-7326-7684												2072-4292					MAR	2017	9	3							211	10.3390/rs9030211								WOS:000398720100025

Remote sensing can provide a systematic, synoptic view at regular time intervals, and is therefore often suggested as a powerful tool to assist with the mapping and monitoring of protected habitats and vegetation. In this study, we present a multi-step mapping framework that enables detailed NATURA 2000 (N2000) heathland habitat patch mapping and the assessment of their conservation status at patch level. The method comprises three consecutive steps: (1) a hierarchical land/vegetation type (LVT) classification using airborne AHS imaging spectroscopy and field reference data; (2) a spatial re-classification to convert the LVT map to a patch map based on life forms; and (3) identification of the N2000 habitat type and conservation status parameters for each of the patches. Based on a multivariate analysis of 1325 vegetation reference plots acquired in 2006-2007, 24 LVT classes were identified that were considered relevant for the assessment of heathland conservation status. These labelled data were then used as ground reference for the supervised classification of the AHS image data to an LVT classification map, using Linear Discriminant Analysis in combination with Sequential-Floating-Forward-Search feature selection. Overall classification accuracies for the LVT mapping varied from 83% to 92% (Kappa approximate to 0.82-0.91), depending on the level of detail in the hierarchical classification. After converting the LVT map to a N2000 habitat type patch map, an overall accuracy of 89% was obtained. By combining the N2000 habitat type patch map with the LVT map, two important conservation status parameters were directly deduced per patch: tree and shrub cover, and grass cover, showing a strong similarity to an independent dataset with estimates made in the field in 2009. The results of this study indicate the potential of imaging spectroscopy for detailed heathland habitat characterization of N2000 sites in a way that matches the current field-based workflows of the user.

J	Zhang, L; Liu, YF; Wei, XJ				Zhang, Lei; Liu, Yanfang; Wei, Xiaojian			Forest Fragmentation and Driving Forces in Yingkou, Northeastern China	SUSTAINABILITY												Forest fragmentation, the process of changing original large and intact forest patches into smaller and isolated areas, significantly influences the balance of surface physical environment, biodiversity, and species richness. Sufficient knowledge of forest fragmentation is necessary to maintain ecological balance and promote sustainable resource utilization. This study combines remote sensing, geographical information systems, and landscape metrics to assess forest fragmentation at landscape and pixel levels during different time periods (2000-2005, 2005-2010, and 2010-2015) in the Yingkou region. Spatial statistical analysis is also used to analyze the relationship between forest landscape fragmentation and its determinants (e.g., natural factors, socioeconomic factors, and proximity factors). Results show that forest patches became smaller, subdivided, and isolated during 2010-2015 at the total landscape level. Local changes occurred in the southwest of the study region or around the development area. Our data also indicate that shrinkage and subdivision were the main forest fragmentation processes during three times, and attrition became the main forest fragmentation process from 2010 to 2015. These changes were significantly influenced by natural factors (e.g., elevation and slope), proximity factors (e.g., distance to city and distance to province roads), and socioeconomic factors (e.g., gross domestic product). Results presented in this study provide valuable insights into the pattern and processes of forest fragmentation and present direct implications for the protection and reasonable utilization of forest resources.																	2071-1050					MAR	2017	9	3							374	10.3390/su9030374								WOS:000398714100051						
J	Stenzel, S; Fassnacht, FE; Mack, B; Schmidtlein, S				Stenzel, Stefanie; Fassnacht, Fabian Ewald; Mack, Benjamin; Schmidtlein, Sebastian			Identification of high nature value grassland with remote sensing and minimal field data	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												In the last 50 years intensification of agricultural land use systems drastically reduced extensively used grassland areas. These areas are of high ecological value due to high species richness and occurring rare species. Therefore, recent European Union (EU) laws stipulate the conservation and monitoring of this farmland, also called "high nature value" (HNV) farmland. As a consequence of these new laws, a so called HNV indicator system was implemented that requires all EU member states to establish a nationwide monitoring system for HNV areas. These monitoring systems are challenged among other by the difficult differentiation between grassland types which today at fine scale is only possible with time and cost intensive field work. Due to this high work-load and financial limitations, nationwide field campaigns have to be sample-based and hence will not deliver a spatially consistent result. In this study, we examine whether low and high nature value grasslands can be differentiated with remotely-sensed reflectance data, which could support existing field survey-based monitoring approaches. We used multi-seasonal, multispectral remote sensing data (RapidEye) in combination with sparse field data (collected in southern Germany) and three one-class classifiers to classify A) HNV grassland against other areas and to differentiate between B) three quality classes of HNV grassland according to the current German HNV monitoring approach. The results for A) indicated high performances of the tested approaches to identify HNV grassland areas. Biased support vector machine delivered best overall results (high detection rate and low false positive rates). However, the results also showed a consistent underestimation of HNV grasslands. Results for B) showed that a separation into several HNV quality classes is not possible with any of the tested approaches. We conclude that with the presented approach HNV grasslands can be identified from the landscape matrix based on its spectral signal. Combining the presented approach with an object oriented classifier or with land registry data could further improve the results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To its deeply esthetic values, the practical values and, respectively, ecosystem services delivered by the urban biodiversity are added (amelioration of the environment and urban microclimate, flood control, diminishing of the environmental pollution, increasing of biodiversity and habitats etc.). Accurate remote sensing techniques have been used widely in locating and mapping urban vegetation (Light Detection And Ranging-LiDAR, satellite images). The purpose of this study is to point out the vegetation status in correlation with the number of the bird species (as indicator of the ecosystem's health), using remote sensing techniques (Landsat satellite images), between 1991-2006 in Bucharest, Romania's capital. Rapid urban evolution of Bucharest led to important changes within the structure of the city, underlined by the increasing of the built area to the detriment of the green one. The intensity of the urbanization rate also led to the decreasing of the number of the bird species. The results obtained through analysis of satellite images indicate the necessity to acquire the up-to-date information related to the vegetation status in order to establish in the future, through urban landscape projects, protection measures for the vegetation cover and for the bird habitats in Bucharest Municipality.																	0354-8724	1820-7138				MAR	2017	21	1					9	25		10.18421/GP21.01-02								WOS:000397713900002

The two-basined Wuchang Lake is a typical small shallow lake within the Yangtze River floodplain. Expansion of the emergent macrophyte Zizania latifolia at Wuchang Lower Lake (to 49 km(2) in area, c. 87.0% of Lower Lake) has increasingly denied the local community open water for fishing since the 1980s. To better understand the causes of these changes and potential remediation, we used annual Landsat imagery from 1975 to 2012 to determine the patterns of expansion between years as well as the effects of water levels in different seasons and trophic status on the annual extent of macrophytes in the Lower Lake. These analyses showed that: (1) Z. latifolia progressively covered the Lower Lake, while remaining confined to one inlet in the Upper Lake; (2) despite the generally increasing trend, there were obvious annual variations in area of Z. latifolia; (3) variation of water level in spring contributed to between-year variation in area and was significantly negatively correlated with expansion in Z. latifolia. Based on these results, to reduce the expansion in Z. latifolia, we recommend maintaining spring Lower Lake water levels above at least at 11.6 m and better at 12 m, cutting shoots in June and July, with subsequent shoot removal in autumn.																	1386-2588	1573-5125				MAR	2017	51	1					177	189		10.1007/s10452-016-9609-9								WOS:000394999000015						
J	Xue, K; Zhang, YC; Ma, RH; Duan, HT				Xue, Kun; Zhang, Yuchao; Ma, Ronghua; Duan, Hongtao			An approach to correct the effects of phytoplankton vertical nonuniform distribution on remote sensing reflectance of cyanobacterial bloom waters	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												Cyanobacterial blooms occur frequently in eutrophic lakes and their potentially harmful effects affected the security of drinking water and food sources, biodiversity, and economic activities, and attracted the attention of general public worldwide. Cyanobacteria could move vertically in the water column by regulating their buoyancy, which leads to the assumption of homogeneous water invalid. Ecolight, based on radiative transfer theory, was applied to examine the effects of vertical nonuniform of chlorophyll a concentrations (Chl a(z)) on remote sensing reflectance spectrum (Rrs(k)) of optically complex inland waters. Simulations for nonuniform water consisting of three Chl a(z) profile classes, including Gaussian, exponential, and power, were compared with simulations for a reference homogeneous water whose Chl a was identical to average value of the nonuniform case. The near-surface aggregation of phytoplankton are shown to have significant influence on Rrs(k) and Chl a inversion algorithms. Variations of DRrs(k) (relative difference of Rrs(k) between inhomogeneous and homogeneous waters with same average Chl a concentration) mainly depended on the Chl a(z) structure parameters and wavelength. A correction scheme was developed based on the relationships between DRrs(k) and Chl a(z) structure parameters. With knowledge of Chl a(z) profile parameters, Rrs(k) of inhomogeneous waters can be corrected to the Rrs(k) of uniform waters with same average Chl a across the water column. Examples of field data from Lake Chaohu illustrated the effects of phytoplankton variation on the near infrared-to-red ratio of Rrs and the Rrs correction performance.

Trade-offs between data resolution, accuracy, and cost when choosing information to plan reserves for coral reef ecosystems	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Conservation planners must reconcile trade-offs associated with using biodiversity data of differing qualities to make decisions. Coarse habitat classifications are commonly used as surrogates to design marine reserve networks when fine-scale biodiversity data are incomplete or unavailable. Although finely-classified habitat maps provide more detail, they may have more misclassification errors, a common problem when remotely-sensed imagery is used. Despite these issues, planners rarely consider the effects of errors when choosing data for spatially explicit conservation prioritizations. Here we evaluate trade-offs between accuracy and resolution of hierarchical coral reef habitat data (geomorphology and benthic substrate) derived from remote sensing, in spatial planning for Kubulau District, Fiji. For both, we use accuracy information describing the probability that a mapped habitat classification is correct to design marine reserve networks that achieve habitat conservation targets, and demonstrate inadequacies of using habitat maps without accuracy data. We show that using more detailed habitat information ensures better representation of biogenic habitats (i.e. coral and seagrass), but leads to larger and more costly reserves, because these data have more misclassification errors, and are also more expensive to obtain. Reduced impacts on fishers are possible using coarsely-classified data, which are also more cost-effective for planning reserves if we account for data collection costs, but using these data may under-represent reef habitats that are important for fisheries and biodiversity, due to the maps low thematic resolution. Finally, we show that explicitly accounting for accuracy information in decisions maximizes the chance of successful conservation outcomes by reducing the risk of missing conservation representation targets, particularly when using finely classified data.

Predictions from machine learning ensembles: marine bird distribution and density on Canada's Pacific coast	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Increasingly disrupted and altered, the world's oceans are subject to immense and intensifying anthropogenic pressures. Of the biota inhabiting these ecosystems, marine birds are among the most threatened. For conservation efforts targeting marine birds to be effective, quantitative information relating to their at-sea density and distribution is typically a crucial knowledge component. In this study, we generated predictive machine learning ensemble models for 13 marine bird species and 7 groups (representing 24 additional species) in Canada's Pacific coast waters, including several species listed under Canada's Species at Risk Act. Predictive models were based on systematic marine bird line transect survey information collected in spring, summer, and fall on Canada's Pacific coast (2005-2008). Multiple Covariate Distance Sampling (MCDS) was used to estimate marine bird density along transect segments. Spatial and temporal environmental predictors, including remote sensing information, were used in model ensembles, which were constructed using 4 machine learning algorithms in Salford Systems Predictive Modeler v7.0 (SPM7): Random Forests, TreeNet, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, and Classification and Regression Trees. Predictive models were subsequently combined to generate seasonal and overall predictions of areas important to marine birds based on normalized marine bird species or group richness and densities. Our results employ open access data sharing and are intended to better inform marine bird conservation efforts and management planning on Canada's Pacific coast and for broader-scale geographic initiatives across North America and elsewhere.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				FEB 27	2017	566						199	216		10.3354/meps12030								WOS:000396051300015

Characterizing commercial oil palm expansion in Latin America: land use change and trade	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Commodity crop expansion has increased with the globalization of production systems and consumer demand, linking distant socio-ecological systems. Oil palm plantations are expanding in the tropics to satisfy growing oilseed and biofuel markets, and much of this expansion has caused extensive deforestation, especially in Asia. In Latin America, palm oil output has doubled since 2001, and the majority of expansion seems to be occurring on non-forested lands. We used MODIS satellite imagery (250 m resolution) to map current oil palm plantations in Latin America and determined prior land use and land cover (LULC) using high-resolution images in Google Earth. In addition, we compiled trade data to determine where Latin American palm oil flows, in order to better understand the underlying drivers of expansion in the region. Based on a sample of 342 032 ha of oil palm plantations across Latin America, we found that 79% replaced previously intervened lands (e.g. pastures, croplands, bananas), primarily cattle pastures (56%). The remaining 21% came from areas that were classified as woody vegetation (e.g. forests), most notably in the Amazon and the Peten region in northern Guatemala. Latin America is a net exporter of palm oil but the majority of palm oil exports (70%) stayed within the region, with Mexico importing about half. Growth of the oil palm sector may be driven by global factors, but environmental and economic outcomes vary between regions (i.e. Asia and Latin America), within regions (i.e. Colombia and Peru), and within single countries (i.e. Guatemala), suggesting that local conditions are influential. The present trend of oil palm expanding onto previously cleared lands, guided by roundtable certifications programs, provides an opportunity for more sustainable development of the oil palm sector in Latin America.																	1748-9326					FEB	2017	12	2							024008	10.1088/1748-9326/aa5892								WOS:000410374800001						
J	Feilhauer, H; Somers, B; van der Linden, S				Feilhauer, Hannes; Somers, Ben; van der Linden, Sebastian			Optical trait indicators for remote sensing of plant species composition: Predictive power and seasonal variability	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Most plant species feature similar biochemical compositions and thus similar spectral signals. Still, empirical evidence suggests that the spectral discrimination of species and plant assemblages is possible. Success depends on the presence or absence of faint but detectable differences in biochemical (e.g., pigments, leaf water and dry matter content) and structural properties (e.g., leaf area, angle, and leaf structure), i.e., optical traits. A systematic analysis of the contributions and spatio-temporal variability of optical traits for the remote sensing of organismic vegetation patterns has not yet been conducted. We thus use time series of optical trait values retrieved from the reflectance signal using physical models (optical trait indicators, OTIs) to answer the following questions: How are optical traits related among patterns of floristic composition and reflectance? How variable are these relations in space and time? Are OTIs suitable predictors of plant species composition? We conducted a case study of three temperate open study sites with semi-natural vegetation. The canopy reflectance of permanent vegetation plots was measured on multiple dates over the vegetation period using a field spectrometer. We recorded the cover fractions of all plant species found in the vegetation plots and extracted gradients of species composition from these data. The physical PROSAIL leaf and canopy optical properties model was inverted with random forest regression models to retrieve time series of OTIs for each plot from the reflectance spectra. We analyzed these data sets using correlation analyses. This approach allowed us to assess the distribution of optical traits across gradients of species composition. The predictive performance of OTIs was tested in relation to canopy reflectance using random forest models. OTIs showed pronounced relationships with floristic patterns in all three study sites. These relationships were subject to considerable temporal variability. Such variability was driven by short-term vegetation dynamics introduced by local resource stress. In 72% of all cases OTIs out-performed the original canopy reflectance spectra as indicators of plant species composition. OTIs are also easier to interpret in an ecological sense than spectral bands or features. We thus conclude that optical traits retrieved from reflectance data have a high indicative value for ecological research and applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Field surveys were used to assess and complement to the results of the remote sensing (RS)-based analysis. The RS-based biodiversity hotspot (BH) identification process was accomplished in three steps. The lands with native vegetation cover, including the national natural reserve lands, were first selected as the baseline BHs (BBHs). Then, after assigning resistance coefficients to each land use, the least accumulative cost (LAC) of the BBHs was calculated by distance analysis, while the normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) from the Landsat Thematic Mapper was reclassified into 20 grades based on the Euclidean distance to the main anthropogenic sources. Finally, the RS-based BH identification was realized through the logistic calculation of LAC less than a series of thresholds and NDVI more than 10. While the field survey-based BH identification was through the logistic calculation between HM potential ecological risks of low to moderate and BHs acquired by NDVI-based integrated assessments. The results proved that RS-based analysis could be an important surrogate for necessary field surveys to manage BHs along coasts.

The present study focuses specifically on the Paraguayan part of the tri-national Atlantic Forest. Over the last decades, the Paraguayan Atlantic Forest presented one of the highest deforestation rates in the world, and today, only a small share remains. Hence, forest loss in Paraguay's Atlantic Forest was detected and analysed through remote sensing and GIS methodologies based on Landsat images obtained in 2003 and 2013. The objective of this study was to examine the spatial impact of forest loss in Paraguay's Atlantic Forest over the past decade with a special focus on biodiversity conservation. Classifications results obtained overall accuracies above 83% and revealed that over 6000 km(2) of forest was cleared during the study period. The forest landscape and its fragmentation level were characterised through a set of landscape metrics, in particular the proximity analysis which support the identification of forest priority areas for nature conservation and potential biological corridors. In summary, the study revealed that deforestation and fragmentation of the Atlantic Forest area continued, but at a slower pace than that in the previous decade. Protected areas were conserved very effectively; however, forest core areas without any protection status require further attention. Intact forest patches and their connectivity are a crucial prerequisite to biodiversity conservation in a highly fragmented forest area. The combination of different remote sensing and GIS methods provides valuable information for sustainable forest management in the region. 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Henrik; Fearnside, Philip M.; Palme, Ulrika; Antonelli, Alexandre			Environmental impact assessment in Brazilian Amazonia: Challenges and prospects to assess biodiversity	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has the goal of providing decision makers with an indication of the likely environmental consequences of planned actions risking environmental changes and, when necessary, allowing revision of these actions to mitigate adverse impacts. Here we provide an overview of the efficiency of EIA with emphasis on Brazilian Amazonia and discuss the problems and challenges with this type of assessment in highly diverse ecosystems. We concentrate on the methodology and performance of EIAs for three of the most recent and largest infrastructure projects in Amazonia: the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam, the BR-319 Highway, and the Juruti bauxite mine. We conclude that all of these EIAs fall short of properly assessing the expected impact of infrastructure development in situ, and that their results had little or no effect on policy decisions. To improve the reliability and usefulness of EIAs in biologically diverse ecosystems, We suggest three relatively fast and cost-effective complementary approaches for assessing biodiversity: remote sensing, reflectance spectroscopy, and DNA meta-barcoding. We discuss how these emerging cutting-edge techniques can help in identifying environmental threats and the consequences of different activities in Amazonia. The ability to monitor the state of the environment and the likely impacts of human activities on natural resources is fundamental to evidence-based decisions on development choices, to the design of appropriate management strategies, and to mitigate biological and ecological consequences.

Monitoring of fire incidences in vegetation types and Protected Areas of India: Implications on carbon emissions	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												Carbon emissions released from forest fires have been identified as an environmental issue in the context of global warming. This study provides data on spatial and temporal patterns of fire incidences, burnt area and carbon emissions covering natural vegetation types (forest, scrub and grassland) and Protected Areas of India. The total area affected by fire in the forest, scrub and grasslands have been estimated as 48765.45, 6540.97 and 1821.33 km(2), respectively, in 2014 using Resourcesat-2 AWiFS data. The total CO2 emissions from fires of these vegetation types in India were estimated to be 98.11 Tg during 2014. The highest emissions were caused by dry deciduous forests, followed by moist deciduous forests. The fire season typically occurs in February, March, April and May in different parts of India. Monthly CO2 emissions from fires for different vegetation types have been calculated for February, March, April and May and estimated as 2.26, 33.53, 32.15 and 30.17 Tg, respectively. Protected Areas represent 11.46% of the total natural vegetation cover of India. Analysis of fire occurrences over a 10-year period with two types of sensor data, i.e., AWiFS and MODIS, have found fires in 281 (out of 614) Protected Areas of India. About 16.78 Tg of CO2 emissions were estimated in Protected Areas in 2014. The natural vegetation types of Protected Areas have contributed for burnt area of 17.3% and CO2 emissions of 17.1% as compared to total natural vegetation burnt area and emissions in India in 2014. 9.4% of the total vegetation in the Protected Areas was burnt in 2014. Our results suggest that Protected Areas have to be considered for strict fire management as an effective strategy for mitigating climate change and biodiversity conservation.																	0253-4126	0973-774X				FEB	2017	126	1							UNSP 11	10.1007/s12040-016-0791-x								WOS:000397298500011

However, acquiring these data in mountainous regions requires labor-intensive, often cost-prohibitive field protocols. Here, we report about validated methods to rapidly identify the spatial distribution of tropical forests, and obtain accurate extent estimates using phenology-based procedures that integrate the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat imagery. Firstly, an analysis of temporal profiles of annual time-series MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) was developed to identify the key phenology phase for extraction of tropical evergreen forests in five typical lands cover types. Secondly, identification signatures of tropical evergreen forests were selected and their related thresholds were calculated based on Landsat NDVI, EVI, and LSWI extracted from ground true samples of different land cover types during the key phenology phase. Finally, a map of tropical evergreen forests was created by a pixel-based thresholding. The developed methods were tested in Xishuangbanna, China, and the results show: (1) Integration of Landsat and MODIS images performs well in extracting evergreen forests in tropical complex mountainous regions. The overall accuracy of the resulting map of the case study was 92%; (2) Annual time series of high-temporal-resolution remote sensing images (MODIS) can effectively be used for identification of the key phenology phase (between Julian Date 20 and 120) to extract tropical evergreen forested areas through analysis of NDVI, EVI, and LSWI of different land cover types; (3) NDVI and LSWI are two effective metrics (NDVI >= 0.670 and 0.447 >= LSWI >= 0.222) to depict evergreen forests from other land cover types during the key phenology phase in tropical complex mountainous regions. This method can make full use of the Landsat and MODIS archives as well as their advantages for tropical evergreen forests geospatial inventories, and is simple and easy to use. This method is suggested for use with other similar regions.																	1999-4907					FEB	2017	8	2							34	10.3390/f8020034								WOS:000395659200005

Modeling the spatial dynamics of deforestation and fragmentation using Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network and landscape fragmentation tool	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												This study has assessed forest cover changes, rate of deforestation, levels of fragmentation and modeled the spatial dynamics of deforestation and forest fragmentation in Assam, India. The analysis of the forest change shows that between 1975 and 2015, the area coverage of forest has reduced from 23749 km(2) (30.3% of the state geographical area) to 21145 km(2) (27% of the state geographical area). The total predicted forest area of Assam is 20189 km(2) (25.7%) for 2030. Forest and non-forest classes were evaluated in order to assess changes and to study influence of five physical factors distance from road and settlement areas, elevation, slope and distance from the water bodies on the deforestation. The Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network modeling was used for predicting the spatial distribution of deforestation. According to the Cramer coefficients, the elevation was strongly associated with deforestation in Assam followed by the slope, distance to water bodies and the distance to roads. The forest areas undergoing high concentration of negative changes have been modelled in the form of deforestation hotspots by using optimised hotspot tool. The results of fragmentation analysis have indicated the reduction of core forests throughout the study period. The spatial database generated in the study is a useful input for understanding of the impact of deforestation and fragmentation on biodiversity and land use change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, the interaction between leaf properties and canopy structure confounds the estimation of foliar nitrogen. The canopy scattering coefficient (the ratio of BRF and the directional area scattering factor, DASF) has recently been suggested for estimating %N as it suppresses the canopy structural effects on BRF. However, estimation of %N using the scattering coefficient has not yet been investigated for longer spectral wavelengths (>855 nm). We retrieved the canopy scattering coefficient for wavelengths between 400 and 2500 nm from airborne hyperspectral imagery, and then applied a continuous wavelet analysis (CWA) to the scattering coefficient in order to estimate %N. Predictions of %N were also made using partial least squares regression (PLSR). We found that %N can be accurately retrieved using CWA (R-2 = 0.65, RMSE = 0.33) when four wavelet features are combined, with CWA yielding a more accurate estimation than PLSR (R-2 = 0.47, RMSE = 0.41). We also found that the wavelet features most sensitive to %N variation in the visible region relate to chlorophyll absorption, while wavelet features in the shortwave infrared regions relate to protein and dry matter absorption. Our results confirm that %N can be retrieved using the scattering coefficient after correcting for canopy structural effect. With the aid of high-fidelity airborne or upcoming space-borne hyperspectral imagery, large-scale foliar nitrogen maps can be generated to improve the modeling of ecosystem processes as well as ecosystem-climate feedbacks.

But its determinants and their relative importance are still a matter of debate, especially because most regional and global analyses have not considered the influence of agricultural practices. More information is urgently needed regarding how human practices influence vegetation structure. Here we focused in Central Africa, a region still subjected to traditional agricultural practices with a clear vegetation gradient. Using remote sensing data and global databases, we calibrated a Random Forest model to correlatively link tree cover with climatic, edaphic, fire and agricultural practices data. We showed that annual rainfall and accumulated water deficit were the main drivers of the distribution of tree cover and vegetation classes (defined by the modes of tree cover density), but agricultural practices, especially pastoralism, were also important in determining tree cover. We simulated future tree cover with our model using different scenarios of climate and land-use (agriculture and population) changes. Our simulations suggest that tree cover may respond differently regarding the type of scenarios, but land-use change was an important driver of vegetation change even able to counterbalance the effect of climate change in Central Africa.																	2045-2322					JAN 30	2017	7								41393	10.1038/srep41393								WOS:000392854100001	28134259

Opportunities for Integrated Ecological Analysis across Inland Australia with Standardised Data from Ausplots Rangelands	PLOS ONE												Australian rangelands ecosystems cover 81% of the continent but are understudied and continental-scale research has been limited in part by a lack of precise data that are standardised between jurisdictions. We present a new dataset from AusPlots Rangelands that enables integrative rangelands analysis due to its geographic scope and standardised methodology. The method provides data on vegetation and soils, enabling comparison of a suite of metrics including fractional vegetation cover, basal area, and species richness, diversity, and composition. Cover estimates are robust and repeatable, allowing comparisons among environments and detection of modest change. The 442 field plots presented here span a rainfall gradient of 129-1437 mm Mean annual precipitation with varying seasonality. Vegetation measurements include vouchered vascular plant species, growth form, basal area, height, cover and substrate type from 1010 point intercepts as well as systematically recorded absences, which are useful for predictive modelling and validation of remote sensing applications. Leaf and soil samples are sampled for downstream chemical and genomic analysis. We overview the sampling of vegetation parameters and environments, applying the data to the question of how species abundance distributions (SADs) vary over climatic gradients, a key question for the influence of environmental change on ecosystem processes. We found linear relationships between SAD shape and rainfall within grassland and shrubland communities, indicating more uneven abundance in deserts and suggesting relative abundance may shift as a consequence of climate change, resulting in altered diversity and ecosystem function. The standardised data of AusPlots enables such analyses at large spatial scales, and the testing of predictions through time with longitudinal sampling. In future, the AusPlots field program will be directed towards improving coverage of space, under-represented environments, vegetation types and fauna and, increasingly, re-sampling of established plots. Providing up-to-date data access methods to enhance re-use is also a priority.

Two scales are better than one: Monitoring multiple-use northern temperate forests	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Managing forests for multiple, often conflicting values, coupled with the uncertainty of global environmental change, requires a more flexible approach to maintaining functioning ecosystems into the future. Adaptive management offers such flexibility, but is often hampered by a lack of targeted monitoring data collected in a consistent manner the evidence base. Moreover, effective management of expansive forest ecosystems requires data on both landscape scale processes, as well as finer-scale data on vegetation structure and composition. To address the challenges of adaptive management in forest ecosystems, we tested the ability of a small set of multi-scale indicators to inform management of Minnesota's Northern Great Lakes forest. Using remotely sensed and field data, we monitored changes in forest condition over a 20-year period in the 42,000 ha Manitou forest landscape in northeastern Minnesota. We used multi-temporal remote sensing data to assess landscape-scale changes in disturbance rates, patch size and age structure. With field data, we used a chronosequence method to assess management effects over time on finer scale characteristics such as canopy composition, tree regeneration, vertical structure and coarse woody debris. Combining remotely sensed and field data provided a more robust evidence base for decision-making than either approach could have provided alone. For example, examining remote-sensing data alone indicates that the rate of severe disturbance (timber harvest) peaked during the 20-year analysis period, and has declined in recent years. As disturbance rates declined, patch size and the proportion of forest in later successional stages all increased from year 2000 levels. These indicators of landscape structure showed positive shifts towards conservation objectives, but only tell part of the whole story. Field data elucidate a number of negative trends, including poor regeneration of key species (Picea glauca, Pinus strobus, Thuja occidentalis, Betula alleghaniensis), and simplified structure in young and mature growth stages. In addition, much of the mature forest transitioning into later-successional growth stages lacks the long-lived species and structural characteristics needed to develop late successional conditions. An evidence base compiled from data gathered at both the stand and landscape scale provides the flexibility on which sound adaptive management depends. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this region, the adverse effects of climate change are believed to be a major constraint to vulnerability. Theses extreme climatic events are likely increase in frequency and magnitude of serious drought periods and extreme floods. For vulnerability assessment we used remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) technology and develop a numerical model, using spatial principle component analysis (SPCA) in ArcGIS software and evaluate two decade (1995, 2005 & 2016) vulnerability evaluation. The model contains following indicators: discharge change, climate moisture, drained area, flood risk, irrigation, evapotranspiration, precipitation, surface runoff, nitrogen load and population distribution. According to the numerical results, the vulnerability is classified into five levels: slight, light, medial, heavy and very heavy level by means of the cluster principle. The results show that vulnerability in the study area from 1995 to 2016 is at medial (25%) and heavy (25%) level and presents from south-west to north east direction. The vulnerability change trend show worst situation in 1995 (29.80) and best one in 2005 (17.45) but again vulnerability was increase in 2016 (21.58). In the study area the main driving forces for dynamic change in vulnerability is the intensive land use and high population density. This spatial approach allowed the analysis of different indicators, providing a platform for data integration as well as a visually powerful overview of the study area.

Especially in countries of the Mediterranean Rim, knowledge at regional and national scales regarding the distribution and the characteristics of rural and forest road network is essential in order to ensure an effective emergency management and rapid response of the fire-fighting mechanism. Yet, the absence of accurate and updated geodatabases and the drawbacks related to the use of traditional cartographic methods arising from the forest environment settings, and the cost and efforts needed, as thousands of meters need to be surveyed per site, trigger the need for new data sources and innovative mapping approaches. Monitoring the condition of unpaved forest roads with unmanned aerial vehicle technology is an attractive option for substituting objective, laboursome surveys. Although photogrammetric processing of UAV imagery can achieve accuracy of 1-2 centimeters and dense point clouds, the process is commonly based on the establishment of control points. In the case of forest road networks, which are linear features, there is a need for a great number of control points. Our aim is to evaluate low-cost UAV orthoimages generated over forest areas with GCP's captured from existing national scale aerial orthoimagery, satellite imagery available through a web mapping service (WMS), field surveys using Mobile Mapping System and GNSS receiver. We also explored the direct georeferencing potential through the GNSS onboard the low cost UAV. The results suggest that the GNSS approach proved to most accurate, while the positional accuracy derived using the WMS and the aerial orthoimagery datasets deemed satisfactory for the specific task at hand. The direct georeferencing procedure seems to be insufficient unless an onboard GNSS with improved specifications or Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) capabilities is used.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-1353-9; 978-1-5106-1352-2				2017	10444								UNSP 104440U	10.1117/12.2278008								WOS:000422619600029

Development of new urban areas and expansion of existing cities is inevitable as it's an essential part of sustainable economy but uncontrolled and haphazard urban growth may raise serious problems related to environmental pollution, changes in urban micro climate, loss of biodiversity and ecological balance, human and traffic congestion, etc. Actual information on spatial distribution of different land use and land cover has multi-dimensional utility in planning and management of the land resources which is perceived as a key factor in the process of development of an area. However, optimal use of land resource requires quantitative information on spatial distribution as well as spatio-temporal changes of various land use and land cover in an area. In this context remote sensing data and GIS techniques are well accepted and established tool for assessing the land dynamics. For this paper landsat data of 1977, 2003 and 2014 were used to assess the spatio-temporal change over NCT of Delhi and its per-urban areas within a buffer of 15 km from the outer boundary of NCT of Delhi. In order to identify the urban growth and associated land use land cover changes, change detection analysis was carried out. The study reveals that areas under different land use and land cover has changed during 1977-2003 and the level of change recorded maximum 14.5% increase in low-density built-up and 8.79% high-density built-up areas but sparse vegetation recorded 12.20% decrease in the NCT of Delhi. On the other hand there is just little change, i.e. an increase of about 9.09% in the low-density built-up and almost little change in the rest of the classes in the peri-urban areas. Furthermore the result shows that during 2003-2014 there is large scale change, i.e. 19.63% in high-density built-up area has been recorded at the cost of 8.4% sparse vegetation and 4.4% agricultural in the NCT of Delhi. In the peri-urban areas there is decrease of agricultural land of about 13% during last decades.																	2365-757X		978-3-319-47145-7; 978-3-319-47144-0				2017							145	160		10.1007/978-3-319-47145-7_9	10.1007/978-3-319-47145-7							WOS:000418025900010						
J	Dias, MCA; Lobo, HAS				Dias, Maria Carolina Almeida; Lobo, Heros Augusto Santos			ZONING PROPOSAL FOR THE LARANJA DOCE DAM'S AREA OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION - CITY OF MARTINOPOLIS-SP	REVISTA FORMACAO ONLINE												The West of Sao Paulo is one of the most affected areas in the State, concerning lost of vegetation cover, because of human occupation and its pattern of economic development. Therefore, the demand for creation of protective areas like Unities of Conservation is justified by the need to intensify the preservation of remaining forests and the biodiversity maintenance. The Area of Environmental Protection (APA in Portuguese) is a category of Sustainable Unity of Conservation that aims to protect the environment and to decrease the impact of human activities. In this sense, the city of Martinopolis created from its Director Plan the APA of the Laranja Doce Dam. This article analyzes the process and the motivations of this protected area's creation and proposes its zoning, in order to establish the adequate rule of the protected area inside the current limits and possibilities. For this purpose, bibliographic survey and field studies were performed, interviews with residents of the neighborhood adjacent to the dam and elaboration of maps through geoprocessing techniques and remote sensing, as the vectorization and classification of satellite images through QGIS software. The results showed that the affected population was not consulted about the creation of the APA, neither were conducted studies to analyze its viability, concerning the land use and the vegetation cover. As final proposal, the suggested zoning looked for ally these aspects, aiming to conciliate the discovered reality and the objectives of environmental conservation of the APA.																	2178-7298	1517-543X					2017	1	25					81	104										WOS:000419535700005

Gizem			MONITORING COASTLINE CHANGE USING REMOTE SENSING AND GIS TECHNOLOGY: A CASE STUDY OF BURDUR LAKE, TURKEY	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												There are wetlands, wildlife protection areas and natural sites that are important for the ecosystem that hosts numerous living creatures in Turkey. Burdur Lake Watershed, located in the lakes region of the south west of Anatolia, is also one of the watersheds of Turkey which has significance in terms of agriculture, biodiversity and environmental impact values. Furthermore, Burdur Lake is the largest lake of this region and among deepest lakes of Turkey. In recent years, the lake has shrunk due to adverse effects of urbanization, agricultural activities, industrial activities and forest industry activities while its volume also has been observed to decrease. It is necessary to evaluate this change and develop solution proposals for sustainable development thereof. The main aim of this study is to analyze the temporal variation of the Burdur Lake coastal boundary using GIS and Remote Sensing (RS) applications. For determination of the temporal change of land use of Lake Burdur; Landsat satellite images of 1985, 2000 and 2015 belonging to Burdur Lake were used and a SWOT analysis for Burdur watershed was conducted in order to determine the causes of these changes. Strengths, weaknesses, threats and opportunities of the region have been determined thanks to this analysis and required suggestions have been made as to the issues identified in this analysis.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	12					7235	7242										WOS:000419539700034

However, most research has focused on habitat quality, and we still lack approaches for tracking habitat quality dynamics. In this paper, by establishing qualitative and quantitative relationships between waterbird populations and key habitat indicators such as water abundance, food, shelter conditions and disturbance, we developed an object-oriented classification method, in conjunction with a geographic information systems (GIS) based centroid moving method, to assess habitat suitability dynamics for waterbirds at the Momoge Nature Reserve, China. Our results showed that habitat suitability improved during 1990-2000 and declined during 2000-2014. Habitats with very good and good grades increased by 71.47 km(2) (4.88%) during 1990-2000 and decreased by 200.66 km(2) (13.78%) during 2000-2014. The habitat area with a good grade moved to the north, while the habitat area with a poor grade moved to the south during 1990-2014. This was mainly because the surrounding cropland area increased and shifted as oil and gas projects developed. These findings suggest that our object-oriented classification and centroid moving methods have great potential for use in biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management.																	1648-6897	1822-4199					2017	25	4					367	378		10.3846/16486897.2017.1316982								WOS:000419310900005

Spatial dynamic of the agriculture fields towards their shape and size	UKRAINIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												We estimated the size and shape characteristics of agricultural fields within the administrative area and identified patterns of the margin trends from 1950-1960 till the present time. Here we considered large-scale soil maps for the area of Vasilkovsky district of the Dnepropetrovsk region, which were drawn up in 1950-1960. To assess the landscape metric we used FRAGSTATS program which allow to make conformity assessment of the observed distributions of field sizes regards the normal, exponential, log-normal, gamma, Weibull, and Pareto distributions. We also used Box-Cox transformation to convert the experimental data into the normal distribution law for the further application of the transformed data in regression analysis. We estimated that the area of agricultural fields ranged from 1.20 to 269.00 hectares during the period of large-scale mapping in 1950-1960. The variation limits of the field sizes based on the results of remote sensing data and in our time they are 2,. 5-266.57 hectares. Area of the fields in different periods strongly correlate and are statistically significant (r = 0.98, p = 0.00). Field sizes currently associated with the field sizes in the 50-60 years of linear regression. Shape parameters and field sizes significantly correlated, therefore, to establish the main trends of varying shape and size of fields, as well as for non-multicollinearity variables for regression analysis, we performed a multivariate factor analysis. An important aspect of the structuring of the agri-landscape is the location of settlements and, therefore, the fields distance from them. In results obtained indicate that the processes increase and decrease the size of fields in agricultural production are determined by various factors. Aspects of the shape and size of the fields associated with the dynamics of the processes that lead to variations in field areas. Fields that have shown a tendency to change their size, have different characteristics of forms and size from the stable fields. Typically, variable field size is smaller and more complex shapes.																	2520-2138						2017	7	3					14	31		10.15421/2017_45								WOS:000418742000002						
S	Hamid, AR; Tan, PY		Tan, PY; Jim, CY		Hamid, Abdul Rahim; Tan, Puay Yok			Urban Ecological Networks for Biodiversity Conservation in Cities	GREENING CITIES: FORMS AND FUNCTIONS	Advances in 21st Century Human Settlements											Triggered by concerns of global biodiversity loss, cities are increasingly called upon to play an increased role in biodiversity conservation, leading to a surge in interest in urban biodiversity conservation. In playing this role, greening of cities needs to move beyond mere provision of amenities or ecosystem services to one of providing habitats for native biodiversity. This chapter describes one of the approaches for enhancing urban biodiversity conservation through the ecological network approach. The concept of ecological networks is not new in the field of ecology. However, its application to cities, both in conceptual and operational forms, is highly limited. As a high-rise, high-density city in which biodiversity conservation is threatened by other competing land uses, Singapore is used as an example to illustrate the development and application of the ecological network approach. The ecological network is built on the concept of network, spatial and landscape cohesions. Using methods in landscape ecology, remote sensing, biodiversity conservation and the Analytic Hierarchy Process, this chapter describes how a toolkit for ecological network can be developed, as well as the efficacy of its use for biodiversity management. The toolkit is categorized into monitoring tools, mapping tools, and communication and decision making tools. The learning outcomes gleaned from the research are presented as the 5-multis: multispecies, multiscalar, multilevel, multifunctionality, and multidisciplinarity.																	2198-2546	2198-2554	978-981-10-4113-6; 978-981-10-4111-2				2017							251	277		10.1007/978-981-10-4113-6_12	10.1007/978-981-10-4113-6							WOS:000417611500014

Characterisation of spatial and temporal distribution of the fire regime in Niassa National Reserve, northern Mozambique	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												The Niassa National Reserve (NNR) is the largest conservation area of the Miombo woodlands in southern Africa, representing one of the most remote and pristine biodiversity spots. Anthropogenic fires have long been one of the main ecological drivers in these woodlands. However, the constraint in understanding fire effects results from limited data and accessibility to existing fire records. This study is intended to contribute to the understanding of fire ecology in these woodlands by assessing the fire regime in NNR. We used the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily active fire (MDC14ML) and burned-area (MCD45A1) products to characterise the fire regime in terms of seasonality, intensity, density, burned area, frequency and mean return interval for the period from 2000 to 2012. The results indicated that fire activity starts c. April and peaks in the late dry season (August-October). Approximately 45% of the area burns every year, especially the north-central and eastern sectors, with fire intensity displaying an inverse relationship with frequency. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the relevance of remote sensing for describing the spatial and temporal patterns of fire occurrence in the Miombo eco-region and highlights the necessity for controlling fire and managing fuels in this important conservation area.																	1049-8001	1448-5516					2017	26	12					1021	1029		10.1071/WF17085								WOS:000417477500004

HOW DOES SPATIAL SCALE AFFECT SPECIES RICHNESS MODELLING? A TEST USING REMOTE SENSING DATA AND GEOSTATISTICS	ANNALI DI BOTANICA												Spatially-explicit dataset of plant species occurrences collected in the Province of Siena (Central Italy) is analysed, with the aim of investigating a) the relative role of environmental factors in shaping spatial patterns of plant species richness, and b) how the spatial scale at which predictors have been sampled determines the explicative power of species richness models. The optimal spatial resolution of analysis was evaluated with respect to the total deviance explained by models, using a set of environmental and remotely sensed derived predictors calculated at different spatial scales. Results confirm the hypothesis that the predictive power of landscape structure is influenced by the spatial scale at which predictor variables have been sampled. Furthermore, the relevance of identifying a proper geographical scale of investigation, hence minimizing the redundancy in the predictor variables and maximising the explanatory power of the single groups of predictor variables, is highlighted as well.

Application of GIS for Examine the Contribution to the study and preservation of plant biodiversity in the Saharan: A Case Study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY & DEVELOPMENT												Despite numerous studies on the physical and biotic aspects of the Ahaggar Cultural Park, decision making on the development of the Park remained difficult due to the lack of a centralized database. The purpose of this Geomatic database will be to inform planning and management decisions by identifying sites potentially associated with an important biodiversity and protecting them as a priority. The preservation of biodiversity, which is now one of the important criteria for sustainable land management, requires the habitat protection of certain rare species. As part of this research, a methodology for integrating pluri-thematic and multi-source data into a Geographic Information System (GIS) is initiated. Technical and methodological choices are adopted and an integrated mapping approach to the Saharan natural environment (Ahaggar Cultural Park) assisted by remote sensing is outlined. The conceived methodological chain allows cartographic production in conformity with the requirements of a GIS compatible with the biodiversity monitoring needs. The obtained results validate the overall approach and raise technical or thematic limits to be met. Therefore, to optimize the Geographical Information System (GIS) and ensure its success in monitoring biodiversity, technical and thematic orientations are suggested. This methodological approach, unless revised, provides us with satisfactory and practical results to comfort GIS and to carry out at medium and large scales draping potential indicators for the monitoring of biodiversity.																	0972-9984	0973-7308					2017	32	2					104	114										WOS:000411844700009

Despite their importance, wetlands are suffering from constant degradation and loss, therefore, they require constant monitoring. This article presents an automatic method for the mapping and monitoring of wetlands based on the fused processing of laser scans and multispectral satellite imagery, with validations and evaluations performed over an area of Lake Balaton in Hungary. Markov Random Field models have already been shown to successfully integrate various image properties in several remote sensing applications. In this article, we propose the multi-layer fusion Markov Random Field model for classifying wetland areas, built into an automatic classification process that combines multi-temporal multispectral images with a wetland classification reference map derived from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data acquired in an earlier year. Using an ALS-based wetland classification map that relied on a limited amount of ground truthing proved to improve the discrimination of land-cover classes with similar spectral characteristics. Based on the produced classifications, we also present an unsupervised method to track temporal changes of wetland areas by comparing the class labellings of different time layers. During the evaluations, the classification model is validated against manually interpreted independent aerial orthoimages. The results show that the proposed fusion model performs better than solely image-based processing, producing a non-supervised/semi-supervised wetland classification accuracy of 81-93% observed over different years.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2017	38	23					7422	7440		10.1080/01431161.2017.1375614								WOS:000412545900049

With similar to 70% of Bhutan under forest cover, this water-rich country promises to maintain at least 60% of the landmass under forest in perpetuity at any given point of time. Yet, climate change hasn't pardoned this carbon-neutral nation. This article conveys a brief idea about the dent that climate change is leaving on the glacier environment in Bhutan. Bhutan is undergoing warming at an unprecedented rate with evidences suggesting higher warming trends during winter months and also at higher altitudes (>4000 m.a.s.l.) (Sharma et al., 2009). With large diversity of glaciers in the region, comprehensive field-based studies have been difficult due to rugged terrain, political issues and limited manpower and financial aid. Yet several remote sensing based have suggested glaciers in Bhutan are melting. Evidences suggest oldest stage of glaciers in Bhutan extended down to 2600 m.a.s.l. (Mool et al., 2001); whereas in the present day, they are found only above 4000 m.a.s.l. Glacial retreat in Bhutan has been extensive (Karma et al., 2003; Rupper et al., 2012; Naito et al., 2012; Bajracharya and Shrestha, 2011; Bajracharya et al., 2014; Veettil et al., 2015) leading to formation of supra-glacial, pro-glacial and moraine dammed lakes. Particularly in Bhutan and Eastern Himalayas, threat from glacial lake outburst floods is high. With 22 potentially dangerous glacial lakes, there is high risk and hazard potential to the regions lying downstream from outburst. In spite of being an environmentally sustainable country with a conservative approach, Bhutan is at the frontline of climate change-related threats. Future water security is not warranted under this scenario. This can have serious implications on water-dependent-economy of Bhutan that thrives on hydropower, agriculture and tourism. Extensive research is called for in Bhutan, apart from efforts to adapt and mitigate climate change.																	2395-7611	2395-7697					2017	3	2					1	10		10.3233/JCC-170010								WOS:000414072900002

These negative impacts are including economic loss, health problems, transportation disruption and land degradation or even biodiversity loss. During 2015, forest fire had occurred at the Merang-Kepahyang peat forest that has a total area of about 69.837,00 ha. In order to set a rehabilitation plan for recovering the impact of forest fire, information on the total burnscar area and severity level is required. In this study, the total burnscar area and severity level is evaluated using a calculation on the Normalized Burning Ratio (NBR) Index. The calculation is based on the Near Infra Red (NIR) and Short Wave Infra Red (SWIR) of the satellite imageries from LANDSAT. The images of pre-and post-fire are used to evaluate the severity level, which is defined as a difference in NBR Index of pre-and post-fire. It is found that about 42.906,00 ha of the total area of Merang-Kepahyang peat area have been fired in 2015. These burned area are classified into four categories, i.e., unburned, low, extreme and moderate extreme. By overlying the spatial map of burning level with other thematic maps, it is expected that strategy for rehabilitation plan can be well developed.

Effective use of UAVs depends on the ability of the system to navigate in the mission scenario, especially if the UAV is required to navigate autonomously. There are particular scenarios in which UAV navigation faces challenges and risks. This creates the need for robust motion planning capable of overcoming different sources of uncertainty. One example is a UAV flying to search, track and follow a mobile ground target in GPS-denied space, such as below canopy or in between buildings, while avoiding obstacles. A UAV navigating under these conditions can be affected by uncertainties in its localisation and motion due to occlusion of GPS signals and the use of low cost sensors. Additionally, the presence of strong winds in the airspace can disturb the motion of the UAV. In this paper, we describe and flight test a novel formulation of a UAV mission for searching, tracking and following a mobile ground target. This mission is formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and implemented in real flight using a modular framework. We modelled the UAV dynamic system, the uncertainties in motion and localisation of both the UAV and the target, and the wind disturbances. The framework computes a motion plan online for executing motion commands instead of flying to way-points to accomplish the mission. The system enables the UAV to plan its motion allowing it to execute information gathering actions to reduce uncertainty by detecting landmarks in the scenario, while making predictions of the mobile target trajectory and the wind speed based on observations. Results indicate that the system overcomes uncertainties in localisation of both the aircraft and the target, and avoids collisions into obstacles despite the presence of wind. This research has the potential of use particularly for remote monitoring in the fields of biodiversity and ecology.																	1095-323X		978-1-5090-1613-6				2017																		WOS:000405199502060						
J	Reshetniak, DY				Reshetniak, D. Y.			Methods for assessing anthropogenic threats to freshwater ecosystems biodiversity	DNIPROPETROVSK UNIVERSITY BULLETIN SERIES-GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY												The industrial and agricultural activities of mankind, which includes chemical pollution, building of dams and hydroelectric power stations and their use of the biomass of freshwater ecosystems, have had considerable impacts on freshwater ecosystems, the abundance of aquatic species, and the vital capacity of those species' populations. A variety of aquatic organisms are feasible indicators and they can be used for evaluation water quality through analysis of their population diversity, composition and abundance. The most significant threats for freshwater biodiversity and the integrity of aquatic ecosystems are activities in the watershed's terrestrial realm, disturbances occurring in aquatic and riparian environments and threats that affect freshwater organisms. There are changes of functional structure of biological community due to reducing biodiversity and the dominance of opportunistic species. A lot of changes in characteristics of biological communities can be assessed by using different kinds of evaluations, including the index of biological integrity, saprobity system and geographic information system technology. An effective predictor of great number of disturbances to freshwater ecosystems is the density of human population. Approaches that directly evaluate the level of threat to freshwater biodiversity typically use species composition and abundance data. Methods that indirectly assess the biotic community evaluate the ecological integrity of aquatic ecosystems. For large-scale, resource-limited, time-constrained biodiversity conservation planning, the most appropriate method for assessing the impairment of freshwater systems is relativistic evaluation of biological integrity using geospatial data. For aquatic threat assessments, the most meaningful level of analysis is the drainage basin and its subbasins. The concept of ecoregions covers all freshwater ecosystems. This approach provides biologically meaningful units for further large-scale studies of existing and potential threats to biodiversity. The size of drainage basins can be defined from digital elevation models, which exist as global network in high quality resolution. At the level of drainage basin, using high-resolution remote sensing imagery is often feasible from a financial and workload perspective.																	2313-2159	2409-9864					2017	25	1					71	79		10.15421/111709								WOS:000410864700009

M.			Global biodiversity monitoring: From data sources to Essential Biodiversity Variables	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) consolidate information from varied biodiversity observation sources. Here we demonstrate the links between data sources, EBVs and indicators and discuss how different sources of biodiversity observations can be harnessed to inform EBVs. We classify sources of primary observations into four types: extensive and intensive monitoring schemes, ecological field studies and satellite remote sensing. We characterize their geographic, taxonomic and temporal coverage. Ecological field studies and intensive monitoring schemes inform a wide range of EBVs, but the former tend to deliver short-term data, while the geographic coverage of the latter is limited. In contrast, extensive monitoring schemes mostly inform the population abundance EBV, but deliver long-term data across an extensive network of sites. Satellite remote sensing is particularly suited to providing information on ecosystem function and structure EBVs. Biases behind data sources may affect the representativeness of global biodiversity datasets. To improve them, researchers must assess data sources and then develop strategies to compensate for identified gaps. We draw on the population abundance dataset informing the Living Planet Index (LPI) to illustrate the effects of data sources on EBV representativeness. We find that long-term monitoring schemes informing the LPI are still scarce outside of Europe and North America and that ecological field studies play a key role in covering that gap. Achieving representative EBV datasets will depend both on the ability to integrate available data, through data harmonization and modeling efforts, and on the establishment of new monitoring programs to address critical data gaps.

Through compilation of a database on CS and community-based monitoring (CBM, a subset of CS) programs, we assess where contributions from CS and CBM are significant and where opportunities for growth exist. We use the Essential Biodiversity Variable framework to describe the range of biodiversity data needed to track progress towards global biodiversity targets, and we assess strengths and gaps in geographical and taxonomic coverage. Our results show that existing CS and CBM data particularly provide large-scale data on species distribution and population abundance, species traits such as phenology, and ecosystem function variables such as primary and secondary productivity. Only birds, Lepidoptera and plants are monitored at scale. Most CS schemes are found in Europe, North America, South Africa, India, and Australia. We then explore what can be learned from successful CS/CBM programs that would facilitate the scaling up of current efforts, how existing strengths in data coverage can be better exploited, and the strategies that could maximise the synergies between CS/CBM and other approaches for monitoring biodiversity, in particular from remote sensing. More and better targeted funding will be needed, if CS/CBM programs are to contribute further to international biodiversity monitoring. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Definition and application of expert knowledge on vegetation pattern, phenology, and seasonality for habitat mapping, as exemplified in a Mediterranean coastal site	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												Habitats are effective indicators of biodiversity. Remote sensing data and techniques are of great utility for their long-term monitoring. Habitat maps can be derived from land cover (LC) maps through rules obtained from expert knowledge and integrated with in situ data. Spatial (vegetation pattern) and temporal (phenology and water seasonality) relationships were explored and documented to infer reliable rules for LC (according to the Food and Agricultural Organization Land Cover Classification System (FAO-LCCS) taxonomy) to habitat (Annex I to the 92/43 EEC Directive and EUNIS) class translation. A coastal site in southern Italy was considered as study site for the definition and validation of such rules. Phenological data of the plant communities were collected on the basis of vegetation plots randomly distributed within the study site. Water seasonality was extracted from periodical observation of the water surface. Vegetation pattern was analyzed by means of vegetation survey along transects. The potentiality of rules, based on this specific expert knowledge, was tested in an experimental setting for habitat mapping. The overall accuracy of the habitat map was 75.1%. Such a result supports the usefulness of prior expert knowledge for habitat mapping from LCCS classes and disambiguation on one-to-many relations between LC/LU and habitat types.

J	Wang, J; Wei, ZY; Wang, QB				Wang, Jing; Wei, Zhongyi; Wang, Qiubing			Evaluating the eco-environment benefit of land reclamation in the dump of an opencast coal mine	CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY												Land reclamation significantly affects the ecological and environmental conditions of mining areas. However, quantifying the exact effects is difficult because of the lack of reliable data. The estimation of eco-environment benefit contributes to clarify the ecological and environmental changes caused by land reclamation and to provide useful information for policy-makers concerned with sustainable development. The aim of this study is to investigate variations in eco-environment benefit in response to land use changes during land reclamation. The West dump, one of the earliest regions to implement ecological restoration in Liaoning Province, is selected as the study area. The widely used methods for eco-environment benefits based on the land use change were proposed and applied to the West dump in 2004, 2009, and 2014. The total eco-environment benefits in study areas were 0.98 million dollars in 2004, 1.39 million dollars in 2009, and 1.43 million dollars in 2014, with an increase of 0.41 million dollars from 2004 to 2009 mainly because of the increasing areas of artificial woodland and reclaimed cropland. The combined eco-environment benefits of artificial woodland, improved grassland, and reclaimed cropland were over 90% of the total benefits. Soil formation and protection, biodiversity protection, and gas regulation were the top three functions with high eco-environment benefits, contributing about half of the total eco-environment benefits. The results suggest that future studies estimating eco-environment benefits should pay more attention to ecosystems in fragile ecological regions where various human interferences happen frequently. All of the abovementioned results made the techniques of estimation of the eco-environment benefit of land reclamation are more meaningful in guiding the future exploitation and reclamation of mining areas.																	0275-7540	1029-0370					2017	33	7					607	624		10.1080/02757540.2017.1337103								WOS:000406482600002

A long-term perspective is required on urban expansion when discussing policies to alleviate its environmental impact. The purpose of this study is to advance the suitability method for urban expansion projection at a global scale, utilizing recent world datasets acquired through remote sensing and open source data. We develop an urban suitability model, apply it to create an urban suitability map for land grids across the world, and validate the spatial distribution of land cover errors. According to our results, 99% of the global land grids were estimated with less than 10% error in urban areas. Grids with larger error were unevenly distributed around large cities and small towns worldwide. These errors likely resulted from the application of a single universal model to the entire globe and from the setting of autoregressive factors as well. (C) 2017 The Authors.

It compromises the integrity of ecosystems, human health, agricultural production, and biodiversity. Therefore, its early detection and discrimination are critical for facilitating site-specific weed management. Recently, adoption of remote-sensing approaches has gained popularity for species-level mapping of vegetation. Specifically, the use of hyperspectral data has demonstrated reliable mapping accuracy. However, when working with hyperspectral data, feature selection is fundamental to achieving reliable classification accuracies. Moreover, challenges such as ` the curse of dimensionality' that cause unstable parameter estimates and high generalization errors when the number of observations (n) is less than the number of descriptive variables (p), i. e. n < p often compromise classification accuracy. In this study, we assessed the potential of a hybrid feature selection approach, based on statistical analysis and Support Vector Machines - Recursive Feature Elimination (SVMRFE) for determining a subset of hyperspectral bands relevant for discriminating P. hysterophorus using field spectroscopy data. We compared the performance of SVM-RFE, Random Forest variable importance (RF VarImp), and entire spectral dat aset (p = 1633) using SVM classifier with radial basis function (RBF) kernel. Results of SVM-RFE and RF VarImp generated lower classification accuracies (i. e. 76.19% and 66.67%, respectively) than the entire spectral data set, i. e. 78.57%. On the other hand, using a subset of 10 spectral bands, our hybrid approach yielded a superior overall accuracy of 80.19% in discriminating P. hysterophorus from its cooccurring species. The study showed that a subset consisting of two red-edge bands located at 685 and 707 nm, one near infrared band at 1115 nm, and seven short wave infrared bands at 1971, 1982, 1990, 1966, 2003, 2005, and 2013 nm had the greatest potential for discrimination of P. hysterophorus and co-occurring plant groups. Overall, the study suggests that the hybrid approach is effective for early detection and improvement of invasive alien plants classification accuracy, reducing data dimensionality and selecting a relevant spectral subset of bands.

We applied our study in a landscape mosaic in Southern Ethiopia that was divided into three zones of increasing distance to Munesa Forest-"near," "intermediate," and "distant." A variety of research tools and methods, including remote sensing, participatory methods, farm survey, and yield assessment, were employed. Diets of households were more diverse in the near zone than in the other two zones (6.58 +/- 1.21, 5.38 +/- 1.02, and 4.41 +/- 0.77 food groups consumed daily in the near, intermediate, and distant zones, respectively). This difference was not explained by food items collected from Munesa Forest but by biomass flows from the forest to farmlands. Munesa Forest contributed an average of 6.13 +/- 2.90 tons of biomass per farm and per year to the farms in the near zone, in the form of feed and fuelwood. Feed from the forest allowed for larger livestock herds in the near zone compared with the other two zones, and fuelwood from the forest reduced the need to use cattle dung as fuel in the near zone compared with the two other zones. These two biomass flows contributed to the availability of more manure to farmers closer to the forest (908 +/- 853 kg farm(-1), 771 +/- 717 kg farm-1, and 261 +/- 487 kg farm-1 in the near, intermediate, and distant zones, respectively). In turn, increased manure enabled a larger percentage of farms to cultivate a diversified homegarden (87, 64, and 39% of farms in the near, intermediate, and distant zones, respectively). Homegardens and livestock products provided the greater contribution to household dietary diversity closer to the forest.

Relationships among Vegetation Structure, Canopy Composition, and Avian Richness Patterns across an Aspen-Conifer Forest Gradient	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Ecologists have a long-term interest in understanding the relative influence of vegetation composition and vegetation structure on avian diversity. LiDAR remote sensing is useful in studying local patterns of avian diversity because it characterizes fine-scale vegetation structure across broad extents. We used LiDAR, aerial and satellite imagery, and avian field data to investigate the relative influence of vegetation structure and canopy composition on avian richness across an aspen-conifer forest gradient. Aspen enhances forest avian biodiversity but has been declining across western North America. We conducted bird surveys between 2013 and 2014 in plots with a range of aspen-conifer canopy composition. We found aspen to support higher avian richness than conifer, especially among cavity nesters. In contrast to other studies, we found weak relationships between vegetation structure and avian richness. Although primary cavity excavator richness was negatively influenced by canopy density, canopy composition was the most important variable influencing total richness and nesting guild richness. This study adds to the body of literature utilizing LiDAR-derived metrics to better understand local patterns of avian diversity, and provides perspectives on how avian communities might respond to conifer encroachment into aspen.

Severity mapping methods have been developed and tested for wildfire, but need further refinement for prescribed fire. We evaluated the accuracy of two severity mapping methods for a low-intensity, patchy prescribed fire in a south-eastern Australian eucalypt forest: (1) the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from RapidEye satellite imagery, and (2) PHOENIX RapidFire, a fire-spread simulation model. We used each method to generate a fire severity map (four-category: unburnt, low, moderate and severe), and then validated the maps against field-based data. We used error matrices and the Kappa statistic to assess mapping accuracy. Overall, the satellite-based map was more accurate (75%; Kappa +/- 95% confidence interval 0.54 +/- 0.06) than the modelled map (67%; Kappa 0.40 +/- 0.06). Both methods overestimated the area of unburnt forest; however, the satellite-based map better represented moderately burnt areas. Satellite- and model-based methods both provide viable approaches for mapping prescribed fire severity, but refinements could further improve map accuracy. Appropriate severity mapping methods are essential given the increasing use of prescribed fire as a forest management tool.

J	Hackman, KO; Gong, P; Wang, J				Hackman, Kwame Oppong; Gong, Peng; Wang, Jie			New land-cover maps of Ghana for 2015 using Landsat 8 and three popular classifiers for biodiversity assessment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Remote-sensing products provide opportunities to monitor complex phenomena on the Earth from space for good decision-making. An example is land-cover maps, which are useful for monitoring both human-and naturally induced environmental changes to enhance environmental management for the benefit of the society. Yet there are numerous critical areas of the world such as biodiversity hotspots where the inaccessibility of quality satellite images has hindered progress in our understanding and management of the natural environment. The West African biodiversity hotspot is one such area where persistent thick clouds in freely available satellite images has been a great discouragement to the production of local land-cover maps to monitor the ongoing deforestation and rapid environmental change. Ghana is a country in West Africa where no land-cover map (except global ones) has been published for over a decade although large tracts of land have been converted from their natural states to agricultural land. In this article, we present 30 m land-cover maps of the country using Landsat 8 images and three popular classifiers Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and random forest (RF) - for the year 2015. We produced these maps for use in our future biodiversity assessment in the region. An overall accuracy (OA) of 85.5% (kappa = 0.77) was achieved for MLC, with similar but slightly lower accuracies for RF and SVM, which indicates that advanced classification algorithms may not have many advantages when applied to process only multispectral optical data. We observe that shrublands, crop-lands, and orchards are the dominant classes occupying 35.6%, 31.9%, and 18.4% of the country's land area, respectively. This further indicates that >50.0% of the country's land area is under agriculture. Thick forests occupy only 8.0% of the land and are almost entirely confined to forest reserves, highlighting the usefulness of these nature reserves. Our maps will provide input for research advancement, policy formulation, and environmental management at both national and subnational levels.

An improved ecosystem service value calculation model was proposed based on empirical parameters. Using Yancheng Nature Reserve in China as an example, we employed remote sensing data to conduct an empirical analysis of the changes in the spatiotemporal pattern, ecological vulnerability, and ecosystem services of typical landscape types over the period from 1987 to 2013. The statistical results derived from landscape pattern indices (LPIs) showed that during the investigation period, three natural wetland landscape types (i.e., Spartina alterniflora, Suaeda glauca, and Phragmites australis) showed gradually increased fragmentation in the study area. The ecological vulnerability scores of the major landscape types (in descending order) were P. australis (0.053), farmland (0.047), S. alterniflora (0.042), S. glauca (0.031), and bare mud flat (0.002). The results derived from the ecosystem service value fluctuation index (ESVFI) showed that from 1987 to 1997, the value of the ecosystem services provided by S. glauca and P. australis wetlands decreased, whereas that of S. alterniflora wetlands increased continuously. From 2002 to 2013, the value of the ecosystem services provided by all three types of natural wetland showed a downward trend. In conclusion, the combined effects of human and natural factors, including the expansion of farmland and the invasion of S. alterniflora, and changes in seawater erosion and deposition led to changes in the landscape patterns, ecological vulnerability, and ecosystem services of the Yancheng Nature Reserve during the investigation period. The results indicate that a "dual adaptive" management system based on natural succession and supplemented by appropriate manual intervention should be implemented, and the management efficiency and flexibility should be improved to meet the common needs of biodiversity conservation and economic development.

However, estimating biodiversity from field observations might present difficulties related to costs and time needed. Moreover, a continuous data update for biodiversity monitoring purposes might be prohibitive. From this point of view, remote sensing represents a powerful tool since it allows to cover wide areas in a relatively low amount of time. One of the most common indicators of biodiversity is Shannon's entropy H', which is strictly related to environmental heterogeneity, and thus to species diversity. However, Shannon's entropy might show drawbacks once applied to remote sensing data, since it considers relative abundances but it does not explicitly account for distances among pixels' numerical values. In this paper we propose the use of Rao's Q applied to remotely sensed data, providing a straightforward R-package function to calculate it in 2D systems. We will introduce the theoretical rationale behind Rao's index and then provide applied examples based on the proposed R function. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Differentiation of Alternate Harvesting Practices Using Annual Time Series of Landsat Data	FORESTS												Sustainable forest management practices allow for a range of harvest prescriptions, including clearcut, clearcut with residual, and partial or selective cutting, which are largely distinguished by the amount of canopy cover removed. The different prescriptions are aimed to emulate natural disturbance, encourage regeneration (seed trees), or offer other ecosystem services, such as the maintenance of local biodiversity or habitat features. Using remotely sensed data, stand-replacing disturbance associated with clearcutting is commonly accurately detected. Novel time series-based change detection products offer an opportunity to determine the capacity to detect and label a wider range of harvest practices. In this research, we demonstrate the capacity of time series imagery, spectral metrics, and related attributed change products, to distinguish between different harvesting practices over a study area in central British Columbia, Canada. Producer's accuracy of harvest attribution was 79%, with 93% of harvest blocks >5 ha accurately identified. In relation to the amount of canopy cover removed, clearcut harvesting was the most accurately classified (84%), followed by clearcut with residual (79%), and partial cut (64%). Applying detailed spectral metrics derived from Landsat data revealed clearcut and partial cuts to be spectrally distinct. The annual nature of the Landsat time series also offers spatial harvest information within typical, often decadal, forest inventory update cycles. The statistically significant (p < 0.05) relationship between harvest practices and Landsat spectral information indicates a capacity to add increased attribution richness to remote sensing depictions of forest harvest.

Detection of subtle deforestation due to logging using satellite remote sensing in wet and dry savanna woodlands of Southern Africa	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL												Tropical deforestation through logging activities poses a direct threat to biodiversity. However, the detection of logging has remained a challenge. Based on study sites in Zimbabwe and Zambia, we tested whether the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Coefficient of Variation in NDVI (CVNDVI) derived from high and medium spatial resolution satellite data could be used to detect logging in dry and wet miombo woodlands. Separately, we integrated NDVI and CVNDVI in logistic regression to test whether each can be used to successfully predict logging in the study sites. We tested whether the spatial resolution of satellite data has an effect in detection of logging using NDVI and CVNDVI derived from Landsat 8 and Worldview-2. Based on the ROC curves, we concluded that remotely sensed data could provide an effective predictive tool for detecting logging. However, in wet miombo woodlands the predictive power of remotely sensed data is weak.																	1010-6049	1752-0762					2017	32	5					514	530		10.1080/10106049.2016.1161074								WOS:000396895500004

In the Chilean hotspot, different studies have attempted to understand variations of LULC change. Nevertheless, a broader understanding of common patterns and variability of LULC over the entire range of the hotspot is lacking. We performed a complete review of the different studies reporting LULC changes and performed a joint analysis of their results using an integrated comprehensive approach. We related the variation of LULC change to latitude, time period and vascular plant richness using generalized linear models. Overall, there were nine studies, which covered 36.5 % of the study area, and reported the loss of 19 % of native forest (782,120 ha) between 1973 and 2011. The highest net forest loss was observed in the 1970-1990 period. This decreased in the 1990-2000 period and rose again in the 2000-2010 period. This result reveals a continuous forest loss in the last 40 years. Conversion of native forest to shrublands is the most important contributor to net native forest loss, accounting for 45 % of the loss. However, in the area of greatest species richness native forests are mainly converted to exotic tree plantations. Chilean forestry model has proved successful in expanding exotic tree plantation, but so far it has not been compatible with native forest conservation and restoration. It is imperative to design a new forestry policy to assure the conservation of one of the most unique biodiversity hotspots worldwide.

J	Haakana, H; Hirvela, H; Hanski, IK; Packalen, T				Haakana, Helena; Hirvela, Hannu; Hanski, Ilpo K.; Packalen, Tuula			Comparing regional forest policy scenarios in terms of predicted suitable habitats for the Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans)	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												Forecasting the potential impacts of forest policies on species of special conservation value is a prerequisite for safeguarding forest biodiversity. In this study, regional forest policy scenarios were compared in terms of predicted habitats suitable for the Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans). To derive both patch- and landscape-scale models to predict species presence in a forest stand, species occurrence data from a systematic field survey covering the whole distribution area of the flying squirrel in Finland and Multi-Source National Forest Inventory data were combined. Then, the Finnish forestry model MELA and the derived occupancy models were applied to predict the quantity of suitable habitats for flying squirrels in three different 50-year policy scenarios. The results confirm that increasing the utilization of felling potential from the level of business-as-usual to the level stated as policy targets in regional forest programs decreases the amount of suitable habitat in the future. However, regional forest programs had a less drastic impact on habitats than maximum sustainable removal, except in two regions. It should be noted that the occupancy models seemed to fail on sites that experts deem to be most suitable for the species. Obviously, there are other factors than forest management affecting presence.																	0282-7581	1651-1891					2017	32	2					185	195		10.1080/02827581.2016.1221991								WOS:000394662600010

Moving beyond the concept of "primary forest" as a metric of forest environment quality	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has been reporting country-level area in primary forests in its Global Forest Resource Assessment since 2005. The FAO definition of a primary forest (naturally regenerated forest of native species where there are no clearly visible indications of human activities and the ecological processes are not significantly disturbed) is generally accepted as authoritative and is being used in policy making. However, problems with this definition undermine our capacity to obtain globally coherent estimates. In addition, the current reporting on primary forests fails to consider the complementarily of non-primary forests toward the maintenance of ecosystem services. These issues undermine the appropriate tracking of changes in primary and non-primary forests, and the assessment of impacts of such changes on ecosystem services. We present the case for an operational reconsideration of the primary forest concept and discuss how alternatives or supplements might be developed.

J	Fava, F; Colombo, R				Fava, Francesco; Colombo, Roberto			Remote Sensing-Based Assessment of the 2005-2011 Bamboo Reproductive Event in the Arakan Mountain Range and Its Relation with Wildfires	REMOTE SENSING												Pulse ecological events have major impacts on regional and global biogeochemical cycles, potentially inducing a vast set of cascading ecological effects. This study analyzes the widespread reproductive event of bamboo (Melocanna baccifera) that occurred in the Arakan Mountains (Southeast Asia) from 2005 to 2011, and investigates the possible relationship between massive fuel loading due to bamboo synchronous mortality over large areas and wildfire regime. Multiple remote sensing data products are used to map the areal extent of the bamboo-dominated forest. MODIS NDVI time series are then analyzed to detect the spatiotemporal patterns of the reproductive event. Finally, MODIS Active Fire and Burned Area Products are used to investigate the distribution and extension of wildfires before and after the reproductive event. Bamboo dominates about 62,000 km(2) of forest in Arakan. Over 65% of the region shows evidence of synchronous bamboo flowering, fruiting, and mortality over large areas, with wave-like spatiotemporal dynamics. A significant change in the regime of wildfires is observed, with total burned area doubling in the bamboo-dominated forest area and reaching almost 16,000 km(2). Wildfires also severely affect the remnant patches of the evergreen forest adjacent to the bamboo forest. These results demonstrate a clear interconnection between the 2005-2011 bamboo reproductive event and the wildfires spreading in the region, with potential relevant socio-economic and environmental impacts.																	2072-4292					JAN	2017	9	1							85	10.3390/rs9010085								WOS:000395492600084

Lidar is considered the premier instrument to estimate above ground biomass, but data are expensive and collected on-demand, with limited spatial and temporal coverage. The previous JERS and ALOS SAR satellites data were extensively employed to model forest biomass, with literature suggesting signal saturation at low-moderate biomass values, and an influence of plot size on estimates accuracy. The ALOS2 continuity mission since May 2014 produces data with improved features with respect to the former ALOS, such as increased spatial resolution and reduced revisit time. We used ALOS2 backscatter data, testing also the integration with additional features (SAR textures and NDVI from Landsat 8 data) together with ground truth, to model and map above ground biomass in two mixed forest sites: Tahoe (California) and Asiago (Alps). While texture was useful to improve the model performance, the best model was obtained using joined SAR and NDVI (R-2 equal to 0.66). In this model, only a slight saturation was observed, at higher levels than what usually reported in literature for SAR; the trend requires further investigation but the model confirmed the complementarity of optical and SAR datatypes. For comparison purposes, we also generated a biomass map for Asiago using lidar data, and considered a previous lidar-based study for Tahoe; in these areas, the observed R-2 were 0.92 for Tahoe and 0.75 for Asiago, respectively. The quantitative comparison of the carbon stocks obtained with the two methods allows discussion of sensor suitability. The range of local variation captured by lidar is higher than those by SAR and NDVI, with the latter showing overestimation. However, this overestimation is very limited for one of the study areas, suggesting that when the purpose is the overall quantification of the stored carbon, especially in areas with high carbon density, satellite data with lower cost and broad coverage can be as effective as lidar.

Since then, Prosopis has hybridized and spread throughout the region. Prosopis has negative ecological impacts on biodiversity and socio-economic effects on livelihoods. Vachellia tortilis, on the other hand, is the dominant indigenous tree species in Baringo and is an important natural resource, mostly preferred for wood, fodder and charcoal production. High utilization due to anthropogenic pressure is affecting the Vachellia populations, whereas the well adapted Prosopiscompeting for nutrients and waterhas the potential to replace the native Vachellia vegetation. It is vital that both species are mapped in detail to inform stakeholders and for designing management strategies for controlling the Prosopis invasion. For the Baringo area, few remote sensing studies have been carried out. We propose a detailed and robust object-based Random Forest (RF) classification on high spatial resolution Sentinel-2 (ten meter) and Pleiades (two meter) data to detect Prosopis and Vachellia spp. for Marigat sub-county, Baringo, Kenya. In situ reference data were collected to train a RF classifier. Classification results were validated by comparing the outputs to independent reference data of test sites from the Woody Weeds project and the Out-Of-Bag (OOB) confusion matrix generated in RF. Our results indicate that both datasets are suitable for object-based Prosopis and Vachellia classification. Higher accuracies were obtained by using the higher spatial resolution Pleiades data (OOB accuracy 0.83 and independent reference accuracy 0.87-0.91) compared to the Sentinel-2 data (OOB accuracy 0.79 and independent reference accuracy 0.80-0.96). We conclude that it is possible to separate Prosopis and Vachellia with good accuracy using the Random Forest classifier. Given the cost of Pleiades, the free of charge Sentinel-2 data provide a viable alternative as the increased spectral resolution compensates for the lack of spatial resolution. With global revisit times of five days from next year onwards, Sentinel-2 based classifications can probably be further improved by using temporal information in addition to the spectral signatures.

J	Santos, F; Dubovyk, O; Menz, G				Santos, Fabian; Dubovyk, Olena; Menz, Gunter			Monitoring Forest Dynamics in the Andean Amazon: The Applicability of Breakpoint Detection Methods Using Landsat Time-Series and Genetic Algorithms	REMOTE SENSING												The Andean Amazon is an endangered biodiversity hot spot but its forest dynamics are less studied than those of the Amazon lowland and forests from middle or high latitudes. This is because its landscape variability, complex topography and cloudy conditions constitute a challenging environment for any remote-sensing assessment. Breakpoint detection with Landsat time-series data is an established robust approach for monitoring forest dynamics around the globe but has not been properly evaluated for implementation in the Andean Amazon. We analyzed breakpoint detection-generated forest dynamics in order to determine its limitations when applied to three different study areas located along an altitude gradient in the Andean Amazon in Ecuador. Using all available Landsat imagery for the period 1997-2016, we evaluated different pre-processing approaches, noise reduction techniques, and breakpoint detection algorithms. These procedures were integrated into a complex function called the processing chain generator. Calibration was not straightforward since it required us to define values for 24 parameters. To solve this problem, we implemented a novel approach using genetic algorithms. We calibrated the processing chain generator by applying a stratified training sampling and a reference dataset based on high resolution imagery. After the best calibration solution was found and the processing chain generator executed, we assessed accuracy and found that data gaps, inaccurate co-registration, radiometric variability in sensor calibration, unmasked cloud, and shadows can drastically affect the results, compromising the application of breakpoint detection in mountainous areas of the Andean Amazon. Moreover, since breakpoint detection analysis of landscape variability in the Andean Amazon requires a unique calibration of algorithms, the time required to optimize analysis could complicate its proper implementation and undermine its application for large-scale projects. In exceptional cases when data quality and quantity were adequate, we recommend the pre-processing approaches, noise reduction algorithms and breakpoint detection algorithms procedures that can enhance results. Finally, we include recommendations for achieving a faster and more accurate calibration of complex functions applied to remote sensing using genetic algorithms.

Development of spatial database on intact forest landscapes of India	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												There is an increased interest in identifying the status of biodiversity in different spatial and temporal scales. The objective of the current research is to prepare a consistent spatial database of intact forest landscapes of India. The intact forest landscapes are located in the Himalayas, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Western Ghats and Sunderbans. At national level 237 forest landscapes and 5.4% of the total natural forest remained as intact in India. Current intact forest landscapes of India consists of blocks larger than 10 km(2) covering an area of 34,061 km(2). Of the total area under intact forest landscapes, Eastern Himalayas represent 76.7% of the area, followed by Western Himalayas (8.8%), Andaman & Nicobar Islands (6.2%) and Western Ghats (5.7%). The largest intact forest landscape block occupies an area of 3342.9 km(2) (9.8%) is found in western Arunachal Pradesh. Temperate forest zone represents the highest intactness (56.6%), followed by subtropical zone (19.2%), tropical zone (18.6%) and alpine zone (5.6%). Himalayan moist temperate forests represent the highest area (39.1%) of intact forest landscapes followed by subtropical broad-leaved hill forests, wet evergreen forests, and montane wet temperate forests. It is estimated that 4.4% of the area of intact forest landscapes fall inside the existing 47 protected areas. The results of the analysis best suited as input for the process of identification of new protected areas. The study recommends fine-scale mapping of biodiversity within the intact forest landscapes and to prepare efficient conservation plans. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Mapping peat in Scotland with remote sensing and site characteristics	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Mapping the spatial distribution of organic soil is important for decision making in land management. Organic soil types have a strong effect on carbon storage, water availability and quality, biodiversity and many other ecosystem services. A large proportion of Scotland's soil is organic, and is classed as peats or organomineral. Existing soil maps for Scotland include a 1:25 000 map of eastern and southern parts of the country that identifies the major soil subgroup at each location, or a 1:250 000 map covering the whole country that gives proportions of the major soil group within mapping units. A detailed map of the organic soils of Scotland that disaggregates these mapping units is therefore required. Existing data were used from several Scottish soil surveys and remote sensing data (Landsat 8) to develop a model for predicting whether a site has mineral, organomineral (mineral with peaty topsoil) or organic (peat) soil. The model was applied across Scotland at a grid resolution of 100 m. Predictive accuracies of 68.1% (mineral), 61.3% (organomineral) and 81.8% (organic) were obtained, with an overall prediction accuracy of 69.8%. Training the model with two classes only, non-organic (including mineral and organomineral) and organic, gave accuracies of 83.9 and 93.6%, respectively, and an overall accuracy of 86.4%. A map of prediction confidence was also produced. The results show how the approach can be used to disaggregate the existing map units and predict mineral and organic soils at locations within a map unit. The map is being used to prioritize monitoring efforts in catchments across Scotland. Highlights Use of remote sensing and spatial covariates to map peat in Scotland. Resulting peat maps will be useful for decision making on land management and carbon storage in soil. Peat is mapped accurately in most areas, although uncertainty is greater in complex landscapes. Combination of remote sensing and spatial covariates improves accuracy of mapping.																	1351-0754	1365-2389				JAN	2017	68	1					28	38		10.1111/ejss.12393								WOS:000392814700006

We integrated field inventory, Landsat, and ecological variables to produce 30 m SI and MAI maps for the Tahoe National Forest (TNF) where different tree species coexist. We converted species-specific SI using adjustment factors. Then, the SI map was produced by (i) intensifying plots to expand the training sets to more climatic, topographic, soil, and forest reflective classes, (ii) using results from a stepwise regression to enable a weighted imputation that minimized the effects of outlier plots within classes, and (iii) local interpolation and strata median filling to assign values to pixels without direct imputations. The SI (reference age is 50 years) map had an R-2 of 0.7637, a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.60, and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.07 m. The MAI map was similarly produced with an R-2 of 0.6882, an RMSE of 1.73, and a MAE of 1.20 m(3).ha(-1).year(-1). Spatial patterns and trends of SI and MAI were analyzed to be related to elevation, aspect, slope, soil productivity, and forest type. The 30 m SI and MAI maps can be used to support decisions on fire, plantation, biodiversity, and carbon.																	0045-5067	1208-6037				JAN	2017	47	1					113	124		10.1139/cjfr-2016-0209								WOS:000392095700014

J	Becek, K; Horwath, AB				Becek, Kazimierz; Horwath, Aline B.			Is vegetation collapse on Borneo already in progress?	NATURAL HAZARDS												Vegetation and tropical forests in particular have a central role in mitigating the effects of increasing levels of atmospheric CO2. Photosynthesis is the fundamental process during which CO2 is taken up by plants and fixed into carbohydrates. The effect of temperature on the rate of photosynthesis in different plant species is directly related to degree-days (D-D) as well as the leaf area index (LAI). Throughout the dry season, the reduced net primary productivity is tightly correlated with increasing D-D, while the reduction in soil moisture leads to progressive canopy thinning, indicated by decreasing LAI. Forest degradation exacerbated by soil erosion and depletion of nutrients in response to high rainfall intensities during the rainy season further disturbs the ecological balance of the entire ecosystem, destabilising it beyond its natural resilience. Given this fact, ground-based evidence and remote sensing-based findings, we propose a climatically induced cascade of events leading to a gradual alteration of the tropical forest ecosystems on Borneo with a diminishing ability to absorb CO2 and release O-2. Such a feedback loop, which is primarily triggered by increases in temperature, has potentially dangerous outcome for tropical ecosystems and has already been observed in the north-western state of Brunei Darussalam. The island of Borneo as a whole seems to have reached a level of forest degradation that is beyond a point of no return. In the worst-case scenario, the next niche of stability may be a destruction of tropical forests and the loss of a major proportion of Earth's biodiversity. Our aim is to stimulate further research on such occurrences and inspire the implementation of future preventative measures.

Big data for forecasting the impacts of global change on plant communities	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Plant distributions and vegetation dynamics underpin key global phenomena, including biogeochemical cycling, ecosystem productivity and terrestrial biodiversity patterns. Aggregated and remotely collected 'big data' are required to forecast the effects of global change on plant communities. We synthesize advances in developing and exploiting big data in global change plant ecology, and identify challenges to their effective use in global change studies. Location Global. Methods We explored databases, catalogues and registries with respect to their accessibility, geographical and taxonomic extent, sample bias and other types of uncertainty, from the perspective both users and contributors. We identified four kinds of big data needed to predict the impacts of global change on plant populations and communities using spatially explicit models: remotely sensed and other environmental maps, species occurrence records, community composition (plots) and species traits, especially demographics. Results Digital environmental maps, including remotely sensed data, are the most mature class of big data discussed herein whereby protocols for archiving, discovering and analysing them have developed over three decades. Species locality records are being aggregated into databases that are easy to search and access, and while methods for addressing uncertainties are a major research focus, better spatial representation is still needed. Plot data from inventories have tremendous potential for monitoring and modelling the impacts of global change on plant communities but tend to be restricted to forests or concentrated in certain geographical areas. Ongoing efforts to aggregate plot and trait data from multiple sources are challenged by their heterogeneous coverage, attributes and protocols and a lack of data standards. Main conclusions Future goals include developing systematic frameworks for selecting geospatial data, improving tools for assessing the quality of species occurrence records and increased aggregation and discoverability of plot and trait data. Aggregated data collected by scientists, not sensors, provide more meaningful insights when data collectors are involved in analysis.

J	Chen, SL; Jiang, H; Jin, JX; Wang, Y				Chen, Shulin; Jiang, Hong; Jin, Jiaxin; Wang, Ying			Changes in net primary production in the Tianmu Mountain Nature Reserve, China, from 1984 to 2014	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Nature reserve establishment can lead to conflict with some stakeholders. Zoning management is useful to mitigate against the conflict between human development and nature reserves, and a nature reserve can be divided into three zones: the core zone, buffer zone, and experimental zone. So far, how to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of zoning management in nature reserves is a problem faced by remote sensing scientists and ecologists. Net primary productivity (NPP) is a key indicator which can be used to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of zoning management in nature reserves. However, to date there has been no research on the effectiveness of zoning management on NPP, and the estimation of NPP in the Tianmu Mountain Nature Reserve also has not been studied. Based on remote sensing data and in situ measurements, the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) model was used to estimate NPP in the Tianmu Mountain Nature Reserve during the period 1984-2014. We used the observed NPP to verify the simulated NPP, and the results show that the simulated NPP was consistent with the observed NPP (R-2 = 0.85, p = 0.0002, RMSE = 52.62 g C m(-2) year(-1), where R-2 represents coefficient of determination, p represents statistical significance, and RMSE represents root mean square error). This means that the CASA model is suitable for NPP estimation in the Tianmu Mountain Nature Reserve. The results also indicate that NPP showed an increasing trend during the period 1984-2014, and the increase over the whole period was 6.66%. The total of the annual averaged NPP was 3.07 x 10(10) g C year(-1), while the annual averaged NPP per unit area was 708 g C m(-2) year(-1). The largest averaged annual NPP per unit appeared in the core zone (720 g C m(-2) year(-1)), followed by the buffer zone (711 g C m(-2) year(-1)), with the experimental zone having the smallest averaged annual NPP per unit (706 g C m(-2) year(-1)). At the p < 0.1 level, there was no region where NPP had decreased significantly in the core zone and buffer zone, and the area of the regions where NPP had decreased significantly in the experimental zone was 8.04 ha. At the p < 0.05 level, there was no area where NPP had decreased significantly in the three zones of the Tianmu Mountain Nature Reserve. The results show that the zoning management on NPP was effective in the Tianmu Mountain Nature Reserve.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2017	38	1					211	234		10.1080/01431161.2016.1264025								WOS:000390126200012						
J	Gwenzi, D				Gwenzi, David			Lidar remote sensing of savanna biophysical attributes: opportunities, progress, and challenges	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Despite occupying almost a fifth of the global terrestrial vegetation system, savanna ecosystems are relatively understudied in the Earth observation field. As a result, their contribution to global socioecological functions, such as carbon sequestration, habitat provision, watershed protection, biodiversity, and communal supply of timber and non-timber products, is inadequately accounted for. Since lidar remote sensing has been proved to estimate accurately the three-dimensional structural attributes of vegetation, the author found it insightful to synthesize the application of this technique in the savannas as one of the steps towards addressing this knowledge gap. The synthesis evaluated the progress of current studies that primarily use lidar data in the savannas and identified the associated opportunities and challenges. For each selected application, three main questions are asked: (1) what is typically needed from lidar remote sensing? (2) what have we achieved already? And (3) what is the current status? The last question was further split into two: (a) what is lacking, if any? (b) what challenges need to be addressed? This article concludes by looking into the potential future of lidar remote sensing in the savannas and some recommendations are put forward accordingly.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2017	38	1					235	257		10.1080/01431161.2016.1259683								WOS:000390126200013

Impacts of population density and wealth on the quantity and structure of urban green space in tropical Southeast Asia	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Urban green spaces provide ecosystem services, including climate regulation, food, and opportunities for recreation. The quantity and structure of green space in a city may therefore have consequences for human well-being. Cities in Southeast Asia are rapidly changing as they must accommodate larger populations, and their residents are becoming wealthier. Such changes may have impacts on urban green spaces and the ecosystem services that they provide. To assess the potential impacts of future urbanisation in the region, we analysed existing relationships between city size, wealth, and population density, and (1) the percentage cover of green space, (2) the quantity of green space per capita, and (3) the aggregation of green space. We used remote sensing analysis of Landsat 7 data to classify green space in 111 urban areas in Southeast Asia. Cities with higher population densities had less green space and less green space per capita. Cities with higher GDP per capita had higher percentage coverage of green space. Larger cities had lower percentage coverage of green space and less green space per capita. Cities with higher percentage cover of green space had more aggregated green spaces. Authorities in developing cities should consider protecting ecological assets such as remnant forest patches and river corridors, as re-creating habitats at a later stage of development rarely provides comparable levels of ecosystem services.

J	Rugani, B; Rocchini, D				Rugani, Benedetto; Rocchini, Duccio			Boosting the use of spectral heterogeneity in the impact assessment of agricultural land use on biodiversity	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												No consensus has been yet achieved among Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) practitioners on how to assess the impact on biodiversity due to land uses and land use changes, in particular with regard to agricultural areas. In the domain of nature conservation and landscape ecology, spectral heterogeneity (SH) derived from remotely sensed imagery is considered a viable proxy for species diversity detection. The assessment rationale is based on the 'spectral variation hypothesis': the higher the spectral variability, the higher the ecological heterogeneity and species community diversity, occupying different niches. Our hypothesis is that SH can be effective to improve or complement current Life Cycle Impact Assessment LCIA practice on biodiversity loss evaluation driven by land use. Hence, we aim here to explore this assumption by computing SH at a local scale of crops cultivation in Southern Alps (Trentino province, Italy), and then combining this information with land use over 30 years. We observe and analyse the relationships between land cover maps and habitat heterogeneity at different time and spatial resolutions. This allows us to argue about the robustness of SH to be a potential surrogate of environmental nuances for species variability detection in LCIA. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the city of Rome due to social and economic trends this kind of activity is spreading, but so far very few attempts have been addressed to inventorying the UA areas (e.g., community gardens, residential gardens, school gardens, illegal vegetable gardens, urban farms, etc.). Some mapping experiences have been carried out but all lack of a well-established methodology to be applied for a complete inventory. In this paper we propose a conceptual framework and methodology for mapping the UA in Rome through Earth Observation techniques by using the concepts of photointerpretation and the features of the most used web-mapping services. Google Earth has been used as a basic tool for visual interpretation and polygon digitalization, while other services have been used for the availability of additional features (e.g., the oblique view of Microsoft Bing Maps). The integration of the web-mapping services combined with ancillary data improved the UA site detection, allowing to define both the land use and the UA typologies. We argue that the integration of the web-mapping services for building urban agricultural land use datasets is cost-effective compared to processing commercial remote sensing images. The inventory can enable administrators to perform analysis about the interactions between agricultural activities and the urban environment, and to enact informed policies for green and vacant urban spaces management.

J	Van Vleet, E; Bray, DB; Duran, E				Van Vleet, Eric; Bray, David Barton; Duran, Elvira			Knowing but not knowing: Systematic conservation planning and community conservation in the Sierra Norte of Oaxaca, Mexico	LAND USE POLICY												Systematic conservation planning (SCP) seeks to propose new reserves through a scientifically rigorous process using databases and research selection algorithims. However, SCP exercises have been criticized for "knowing but not doing", i.e. not implementing the proposed reserve. But there is an additional problem that can be called "knowing but not knowing", knowing things from databases, but not knowing crucial contextual information about community-based social processes that have supported the high forest cover and biodiversity detected. Examined here is how a common property region of the Sierra Norte of Oaxaca, Mexico has maintained high forest cover in the absence of public protected areas, while multiple SCP exercises have advocated for the creation of public protected areas in communal tropical montane cloud forests and pine forests as strategies for biodiversity conservation and resilience to climate change. Methods included archival research, review of community documents, focus group interviews, semi-structured interviews, participant observation, land use transects, and GIS analysis and remote sensing. Conservation in the region originally occurred because of low population densities, steep slopes and a lack of agricultural subsidies, supported by locally adapted agricultural practices. In the 1990s, a transition from passive to active conservation took place with land use zoning plans, community conservation rules, community forestry enterprises and payments for environmental service programs that consolidated a trend towards high, unthreatened forest cover. Today, the study communities have an average of 88.3% forest cover, with 61% of that in informal conservation based on community land use zoning and rules and another 14% governed by forest management plans approved by the Mexican government. We argue that truly systematic conservation plans would seek to understand how communities in the region are already managing forests for conservation. It is pointless and uninformed to advocate for top-down conservation interventions of forests that are already robustly conserved and resilient to climate change due to community action.

However, rapid urbanization in China has led to a tremendous farmland loss and to the degradation of farmland quality. Based on remote sensing and geographic information system technology, this study developed a semiautomatic procedure for designating PFPAs using high-resolution satellite imagery (HRSI), which involved object-based image analysis, farmland composite evaluation, and spatial analysis. It was found that the HRSIs can provide elaborate land-use information, and the PFPA demarcation showed strong correlation with the farmland area and patch distance. For the benefit of spatial planning and management, different demarcation rules should be applied for suburban and exurban areas around a metropolis. Finally, the overall accuracy of HRSI classification was about 80% for the study area, and high-quality farmlands from evaluation results were selected as PFs. About 95% of the PFs were demarcated within the PFPAs. The results of this study will be useful for PFPA planning and the methods outlined could help in the automatic designation of PFPAs from the perspective of the spatial science.																	2045-2322					DEC 21	2016	6								37634	10.1038/srep37634								WOS:000390202400001	28000668

Rapidly obtained ecosystem indicators from coral reef soundscapes	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Present-day coral reef ecosystem monitoring techniques can be costly, labor-intensive point measurements that can potentially introduce intractable sampling bias and error. Here we report correlations between visually obtained ecological assessment metrics and concurrently recorded aspects of the underwater biological soundscape over coral reefs at 23 sites spanning the Hawaiian Islands archipelago. Sites from the 'cool tropics' oceanographic habitat grouped along a principal component defined by an acoustic sliding scale: from protected or more remote sites at which lower frequencies were more dominant, to degraded sites which produced soundscapes dominated by higher frequency sound. Positive correlations between ambient biological sounds below 2 kHz and the density of benthic invertebrates (Pearson's rho = 0.61-0.76), their predators (rho = 0.65-0.8), organism-scale bathymetric complexity (rho = 0.6-0.62) and the quantity of crustose coralline algae (rho = 0.6-0.62) suggest a connection between this part of the spectrum, habitat complexity and the density of benthic fauna. A positive correlation was also observed between the daytime soundscape in the 2 to 20 kHz band and the proportion of benthic fleshy macroalgal cover (rho = 0.63-0.7), an indicator of reef degradation. This study indicates the possibility of rapid, inexpensive and spatially integrative remote sensing of the ecological state of coral reefs. Such quantitative methods could be used to ecologically assess vast areas of reef habitat autonomously in near real-time and could be important for remote in situ detection and characterization of subtle but significant ecological changes brought about by climate change and other more localized anthropogenic impacts.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				DEC 15	2016	561						69	82		10.3354/meps11938								WOS:000391695800005

Mapping individual tree health using full-waveform airborne laser scans and imaging spectroscopy: A case study for a floodplain eucalypt forest	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Declining forest health can affect crucial ecosystem functions, such as carbon storage in biomass and soils, the regulation of water regimes, the modulation of regional climate and conservation of biodiversity. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) and imaging spectroscopy (IS) are two potentially complementary remote sensing technologies capable of characterizing and monitoring regional forest health. However, the combined use of ALS and IS data to classify the health of individual trees has not yet been assessed. In this study we propose a new approach utilizing ALS and IS combined to characterize the health of individual trees. Firstly, we applied a recently developed bottom-up individual tree delineation algorithm across a structurally complex floodplain eucalypt forest that has experienced episodes of severe dieback over the past six decades. We further calculated ALS and IS indices for delineated tree crowns and used them as predictor variables in machine learning models. We trained and evaluated an object-oriented random forest classifier against field-measured tree crown dieback and transparency ratios, as indicators of eucalypt tree health and crown density, respectively. Our results showed that die back levels of individual trees can be classified using ALS and IS with an overall accuracy of 81% and a kappa score of 0.66, while the classification of tree crown transparency levels had an overall accuracy of 70% and a kappa score of 0.5. Returned pulse width, intensity and density related ALS indices were the most important predictors in the tree health classification, as they accounted for >40% of the variance in the data. At the forest level in terms of die back, 81.5% of correctly delineated trees were classified as healthy, 12.3% as declining and 6.2% as dying or dead. Dieback occurred primarily in areas that were flooded <5% of the time, as quantified by Landsat derived flooding frequency (1986-2011). Our results provide a novel application of ALS and IS to accurately classify the health of individual trees in a structurally complex eucalypt forest, enabling us to prioritize areas for forest health promotion and conservation of biodiversity.

Introduction to the sampling designs of the National Ecological Observatory Network Terrestrial Observation System	ECOSPHERE												Global change drivers influence ecological processes at multiple scales and manifest across most of Earth as changes in biodiversity, biogeochemical cycles, infectious disease incidence, and ecohydrology. Small-scale investigations provide compelling evidence of specific effects of global change on local systems, but are of limited use in modeling complex ecological processes at continental-to-global scales. Long-term observations distributed across a diversity of habitat types are needed to improve the ability to forecast ecological change at large spatial and temporal scales. This special issue introduces the Terrestrial Observation System (TOS) of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), a long-term, continental-scale ecological research platform designed to deliver these large-scale datasets. The TOS measures biodiversity of key biota (soil microbes, insects, plants, small mammals), ecosystem productivity and biogeochemistry, infectious disease dynamics, phenology, and population dynamics. The articles in this special issue describe the scientific rationale for the sampling designs of the TOS, including an overview of protocols, locations, and frequencies of measurements. The science designs are a culmination of design requirements scoped by NEON and the National Science Foundation, best available practices put forth by the scientific community, input from technical working groups, and consideration of logistical and financial constraints by NEON staff. Within each site, measurements have been collocated to the extent possible to optimize linkages among different sampling elements. Integrated analyses of terrestrial observations with sensor-based, imagery, and remote-sensing data collected by other NEON subsystems can facilitate scaling of measured parameters to larger spatial and temporal scales. NEON is designed to collect data for 30 years, and make these data freely available on a public data portal (data.neonscience.org). Samples and specimens will be archived and available to the scientific community upon request. The open access approach to the Observatory will provide users with the resources necessary to map, understand, and predict the effects of global change drivers on ecological processes at a continental scale.																	2150-8925					DEC	2016	7	12							e01627	10.1002/ecs2.1627								WOS:000401423700007

Detecting unburned areas within wildfire perimeters using Landsat and ancillary data across the northwestern United States	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Wildfires shape the distribution and structure of vegetation across the inland northwestern United States. However, fire activity is expected to increase given the current rate of climate change, with uncertain outcomes. A fire impact that has not been widely addressed is the development of unburned islands; areas within the fire perimeter that do not burn. These areas function as critical ecological refugia for biota during or following wildfires, but they have been largely ignored in methodological studies of remote sensing assessing fire severity under the assumption that they will be detected by algorithms for delineating fire perimeters. Our objective was to develop a model for classifying unburned areas within wildfire perimeters using moderate resolution satellite (i.e., Landsat) and ancillary data. We performed field observations at locations that were unburned or lightly burned within the perimeters of 12 wildfires that burned in 2012 and 2014, and augmented this with field data previously acquired on another seven wildfires across the study region. We used randomForest and classification trees to separate burned from unburned locations with high overall classification accuracy (91.7% and 89.2%, for randomForest and classification tree methods respectively). Classification accuracy was significantly higher than the semi-automated classification products from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) program. After application of the most parsimonious and accurate classification tree model, we found that the average unburned proportion of the fires was 20% with high variability between fires (standard deviation: 16.4%). The total area of unburned islands in non-forested areas was significantly higher than the total unburned area in forested areas. Accurate detection and delineation of unburned areas is increasingly critical, as some of these unburned areas contain habitat (i.e., wildfire refugia) that are crucial for maintaining biodiversity and functioning of ecosystems, particularly given observed and projected anthropogenic climate change.

J	Muller, H; Rufin, P; Griffiths, P; Hissa, LDV; Hostert, P				Mueller, Hannes; Rufin, Philippe; Griffiths, Patrick; Hissa, Leticia de Barros Viana; Hostert, Patrick			Beyond deforestation: Differences in long-term regrowth dynamics across land use regimes in southern Amazonia	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The loss of tropical forests threatens a broad range of ecosystem services. Particularly, tropical deforestation is a major driver of biodiversity decline and substantial carbon emissions. Regrowth of secondary vegetation may help to restore habitat for many threatened species and improve ecosystem services that deteriorated due to deforestation. However, spatial-temporal patterns of regrowing secondary vegetation in the tropics remain weakly understood. We therefore analyze regrowth dynamics across two different land use systems in southern Amazonia: the extensive pastoralism in Para and the capital-intensive agriculture in Mato Grosso. Both systems are connected by the BR-163 highway, which represents a major axis of deforestation and agricultural development in the Brazilian Amazon since decades. We used a 29 year time series of Landsat images to extract regrowth extent, duration, lag time between deforestation and regrowth, and frequency of regrowth cycles. Our results reached an overall accuracy of 89% and showed regrowth on up to 50% of the deforested area in Para and a maximum of 25% in Mato Grosso. In both states, annual regrowth rates drastically dropped after 1996, which coincided with socioeconomic transformations and drought events. The majority of regrowth was concentrated within 60 m distance to forest edges and cleared again after an average of 5 years. Our approach bears great potential for mapping post deforestation regrowth dynamics within and beyond the Brazilian Amazon based on long-term and freely accessible remote sensing data collections, such as the Landsat and the forthcoming Sentinel-2 archives.

J	Ghosh, MK; Kumar, L; Roy, C				Ghosh, Manoj Kumer; Kumar, Lalit; Roy, Chandan			Mapping Long-Term Changes in Mangrove Species Composition and Distribution in the Sundarbans	FORESTS												The Sundarbans mangrove forest is an important resource for the people of the Ganges Delta. It plays an important role in the local as well as global ecosystem by absorbing carbon dioxide and other pollutants from air and water, offering protection to millions of people in the Ganges Delta against cyclone and water surges, stabilizing the shore line, trapping sediment and nutrients, purifying water, and providing services for human beings, such as fuel wood, medicine, food, and construction materials. However, this mangrove ecosystem is under threat, mainly due to climate change and anthropogenic factors. Anthropogenic and climate change-induced degradation, such as over-exploitation of timber and pollution, sea level rise, coastal erosion, increasing salinity, effects of increasing number of cyclones and higher levels of storm surges function as recurrent threats to mangroves in the Sundarbans. In this situation, regular and detailed information on mangrove species composition, their spatial distribution and the changes taking place over time is very important for a thorough understanding of mangrove biodiversity, and this information can also lead to the adoption of management practices designed for the maximum sustainable yield of the Sundarbans forest resources. We employed a maximum likelihood classifier technique to classify images recorded by the Landsat satellite series and used post classification comparison techniques to detect changes at the species level. The image classification resulted in overall accuracies of 72%, 83%, 79% and 89% for the images of 1977, 1989, 2000 and 2015, respectively. We identified five major mangrove species and detected changes over the 38-year (1977-2015) study period. During this period, both Heritiera fomes and Excoecaria agallocha decreased by 9.9%, while Ceriops decandra, Sonneratia apelatala, and Xylocarpus mekongensis increased by 12.9%, 380.4% and 57.3%, respectively.

They shape a disturbance gradient bound to the intensity and frequency of logging, and forest management techniques. However, until now, few studies have been carried out at the landscape scale taking into account these multiple types of logging and this disturbance gradient. Here we address this issue of how to account for the multiple logging activities shaping the current forest landscape. We developed an inexpensive and efficient remote sensing methodology based on Landsat imagery to detect and track logging activity based on the monitoring of canopy openings. Then, we implemented a set of remote sensing indicators to follow the different trajectories of forest disturbance through time. Using these indicators, we emphasized five major spatial and temporal disturbance patterns occurring in the municipality of Paragominas (State of Para, Brazilian Amazon), from well-managed forests to highly over-logged forests. Our disturbance indicators provide observable evidence for the difference between legal and illegal patterns, with some illegal areas having suffered more than three explorations in fifteen years. They also clearly underlined the efficiency of Reduced Impact Logging (RIL) techniques applied under Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) guidelines to reduce the logging impacts in terms of canopy openings. For these reasons, we argue the need to promote legal certified logging to conserve forests, as without them, many actors mine the forest resources without any concerns for future stocks. Finally, our remote tracking methodology, which produces easy to interpret disturbance indicators, could be a real boon to forest managers, including for conservationists working in protected areas and stakeholders dealing with international trade rules such as RBUE (Wood regulation of European Union) or FLEGT (Forest Law for Enforcement, Governance and Trade).

Estimation of urban tree canopy cover using random point sampling and remote sensing methods	URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING												Trees play an important role in urban areas by improving air quality, mitigating urban heat islands, reducing stormwater runoff and providing biodiversity habitat. Accurate and up-to-date estimation of urban tree canopy cover (UTC) is a basic need for the management of green spaces in cities, providing a metric from which variation can be understood, change monitored and areas prioritised. Random point sampling methods, such as i-Tree canopy, provide a cheap and quick estimation of UTC for a large area. Remote sensing methods using airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) and multi-spectral images produce accurate UTC maps, although greater processing time and technical skills are required. In this paper, random point sampling and remote sensing methods are used to estimate UTC in Williamstown, a suburb of Melbourne, Australia. High resolution multi-spectral satellite images fused with LiDAR data with pixel-level accuracy are employed to produce the UTC map. The UTC is also estimated by categorising random points (a) automatically using the LiDAR derived UTC map and (b) manually using Google Maps and i-Tree canopy software. There was a minimum 1% difference between UTC estimated from the map derived from remotely sensed data and only 1000 random points automatically categorised by that same map, indicating the level of error associated with a random sampling approach. The difference between UTC estimated by remote sensing and manually categorised random point sampling varied in range of 4.5% using a confidence level of 95%. As monitoring of urban forest canopy becomes an increasing priority, the uncertainties associated with different UTC estimates should be considered when tracking change or comparing different areas using different methods.

Recently, it has been proposed that tree-community composition based on count-plot surveys could serve as a robust, sensitive, and cost-effective indicator for forest intactness in Bornean logged-over rain forests. In this study, we developed an algorithm to map tree-community composition across the entire landscape based on Landsat imagery. We targeted six forest management units (FMUs), each of which ranged from 50,000 to 100,000 ha in area, covering a broad geographic range spanning the most area of Borneo. Approximately fifty 20 m-radius circular plots were established in each FMU, and the differences in tree-community composition at a genus level among plots were examined for trees with diameter at breast height >= 10 cm using an ordination with non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS). Subsequently, we developed a linear regression model based on Landsat metrics (e.g., reflectance value, vegetation indices and textures) to explain the nMDS axis-1 scores of the plots, and extrapolated the model to the landscape to establish a tree-community composition map in each FMU. The adjusted R-2 values based on a cross-validation approach between the predicted and observed nMDS axis-1 scores indicated a close correlation, ranging from 0.54 to 0.69. Histograms of the frequency distributions of extrapolated nMDS axis-1 scores were derived from each map and used to quantitatively diagnose the forest intactness of the FMUs. Our study indicated that tree-community composition, which was reported as a robust indicator of forest intactness, could be mapped at a landscape level to quantitatively assess the spatial patterns of intactness in Bornean rain forests. Our approach can be used for large-scale assessments of tree diversity and forest intactness to monitor both the progress of Aichi Biodiversity Targets and the effectiveness of REDD+ biodiversity safeguards in production forests in the tropics.																	2073-445X					DEC	2016	5	4							45	10.3390/land5040045								WOS:000392501200004

Additional studies about the biodiversity, hydrology, human impact, modeling dynamics, and phenology in the study area, can be carried on. In these cases, a wide temporal series of images need to be considered in order to get the tendencies throughout the years. In some regions, such as the South-West part of Colombia (Andean region), studies over large areas are needed in order to obtain unified and coherent statistics that can be representative of the region. This means that different images, acquired by the same satellite and over different areas, or acquired by different sensors, or at different times, need to be classified. Standard classification methods do not work properly to perform this task, due to the heterogeneity in both land cover and orography. This paper presents a hybrid approach for the classification of multitemporal, multiregion, and multisensor images. Classification and regression trees (CART) decision tree and an SVM-based clustering were used in cascade in order to get the final classification maps. Experimental results carried over three Landsat Path/Rows, three sensors, and six different years, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach, where the overall accuracy was of 93% with a kappa factor of 0.92.

Spatial Differentiation of Arable Land and Permanent Grassland to Improve a Land Management Model for Nutrient Balancing	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												Agroecosystems play an important role in providing economic and ecosystem services, which directly impact society. Inappropriate land use and unsustainable agricultural management with associated nutrient cycles can jeopardize important soil functions such as food production, livestock feeding, and conservation of biodiversity. The objective of this study was to integrate remotely sensed land cover information into a regional land management model (LMM) to improve the assessment of spatially explicit nutrient balances for agroecosystems. Remotely sensed data and an optimized parameter set contributed to an improved LMM output, allowing for a better land allocation within the model. The best input parameter combination was based on two different land cover classifications with overall accuracies of 98%, improving the land allocation performance compared with using nonspatially explicit input. We conclude that the combined use of remote sensing data and the LMM has the potential to provide valuable guidance for farm practices. It further helps to generate a spatial description of farm-level nutrient balance, a crucial ability when choosing policy options related to sustainable management of agricultural soils.

China faces especially strong pressure since many people live inside protected areas. It has sought to balance human needs and conservation goals within them by creating mixed zoning schemes loosely based on UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere Programme. These include strictly-protected core zones, buffer zones allowing limited human use, and experimental zones that examine different land-use options. To test the efficacy of this zoning, we employed field surveys and remote sensing to assess the penetration of agricultural and urban land into 109 national nature reserves in China for 2000 and 2010. Human disturbance was lowest in core zones and highest in experimental zones in both 2000 and 2010. Over this period, 82% of the reserves were unchanged or had decreased human disturbance. Nonetheless, overall human disturbance increased by 7%, 4%, and 5% in the core, buffer and experimental zones respectively. Almost all the increase in the core zone was in four wetland reserves, where human actions converted large areas to agriculture. Some 58% of reserves experienced some human disturbance in core zones in 2010, demonstrating a need for more effective zoning. The findings have broader implications for protected area management globally because they highlight the strengths and weaknesses of zoning for balancing human needs and species conservation.

Amplification of the water cycle, including the increasing frequency and severity of droughts and wet extremes, is expected to alter spatial and temporal hydrological patterns in arid wetlands globally, with potential threats to ecosystem services and their functioning. Despite these pressing challenges, the ecohydrological interactions and resilience of arid wetlands to highly variable water regimes over long time periods remain largely unknown. Recent broad-scale drought and floods over Australia provide unique opportunities to improve our understanding of arid wetland ecosystem responses to hydroclimatic extremes. Here we analysed the ecohydrological dynamics of the Coongie Lakes arid wetland in central Australia, one of the world's largest Ramsar-designated wetlands, using more than two decades (1988-2011) of vegetation and floodwater extent retrievals derived from Landsat satellite observations. To explore the impacts of large-scale hydrological fluctuations on the arid wetland, we further coupled Landsat measurements with Total Water Storage Anomaly (TWSA) data obtained from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites. Pronounced seasonal and inter-annual variabilities of flood and vegetation activities were observed over the wetland, with variations in vegetation growth extent highly correlated with flood extent (r = 0.64, p < 0.05) that ranged from nearly zero to 3456 km(2). We reported the hydrological dynamics and associated ecosystem responses to be largely driven by the two phases (El Nino and La Nina) of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) ocean-atmosphere system. Changes in flood and vegetation extent were better explained by GRACE-TWSA (r = 0.8, lag = 0 month) than rainfall (r = 034, lag = 3 months) over the water source area, demonstrating that TWS is a valuable hydrological indicator for complex dryland river systems. The protracted Millennium Drought from 2001 to 2009 resulted in long-term absence of major flood events, which substantially suppressed wetland vegetation growth. However, the 2010-11 La Nina induced flooding events led to an exceptionally large resurgence of vegetation, with a mean vegetation growth extent anomaly exceeding the historical average (1988-2011) by more than 1.5 standard deviations, suggesting a significant resilience of arid wetland ecosystems to climate variability. This study showed the ecological functioning of arid wetlands is particularly sensitive to large-scale hydrological fluctuations and extreme drought conditions, and vulnerable to future altered water regimes due to climate change. The methods developed herein can be applied to arid wetlands located in other dryland river systems across the globe. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Integrating TEK into monitoring and management of these areas allows for community participation, as well as for offering novel insights into sustainable resource use. In this study, we developed a 250 m resolution land-cover map of the Western Guyana Shield (Venezuela) based on remote sensing, and used TEK to validate its relevance for indigenous livelihoods and land uses. We first employed a hyper-temporal remotely sensed vegetation index to derive a land classification system. During a 1300 km, eight day fluvial expedition in roadless areas in the Amazonas State (Venezuela), we visited six indigenous communities who provided geo-referenced data on hunting, fishing and farming activities. We overlaid these TEK data onto the land classification map, to link land classes with indigenous use. We characterized land classes using patterns of greenness temporal change and topo-hydrological information, and proposed 12 land-cover types, grouped into five main landscapes: 1) water bodies; 2) open lands/forest edges; 3) evergreen forests; 4) submontane semideciduous forests, and 5) cloud forests. Each land cover class was identified with a pulsating profile describing temporal changes in greenness, hence we labelled our map as "The Forest Pulse". These greenness profiles showed a slightly increasing trend, for the period 2000 to 2009, in the land classes representing grassland and scrubland, and a slightly decreasing trend in the classes representing forests. This finding is consistent with a gain in carbon in grassland as a consequence of climate warming, and also with some loss of vegetation in the forests. Thus, our classification shows potential to assess future effects of climate change on landscape. Several classes were significantly connected with agriculture, fishing, overall hunting, and more specifically the hunting of primates, Mazama americana, Dasyprocta fitliginosa, and Tayassu pecan. Our results showed that TEK-based approaches can serve as a basis for validating the livelihood relevance of landscapes in high-value conservation areas, which can form the basis for furthering the management of natural resources in these regions.

Seasonal spatial dynamics of floodplain macrophyte and periphyton abundance in the Alligator Rivers region (Kakadu) of northern Australia	ECOHYDROLOGY												Isotope studies of freshwater aquatic habitats have shown that epiphytic algae in the form of periphyton provides much of the source material for the biomass of secondary aquatic producers. Consequently, methods that can quantify the seasonal abundance of periphyton are important spatial inputs for wetland management and conservation planning processes for tropical floodplains. In this study, estimation of the seasonal spatial variability in floodplain macrophyte and periphyton abundance was made for the floodplains of the Kakadu region in northern Australia. Statistical modelling, using remotely sensed information, was applied to predict the seasonal distributions of macrophyte structural types, which were then combined with the field measurements of periphyton biomass to produce seasonal distributions of floodplain periphyton biomass per unit area. The seasonal spatial distribution of periphyton was strongly influenced by the seasonal variation in macrophyte abundance. Vertical emergent macrophytes (mainly aquatic grasses), covering 70% of the floodplain in May, had the lowest periphyton abundance. Submerged macrophytes, covering 10-15% of the floodplains, had the greatest periphyton abundance. The submerged macrophytes occupied open water areas, mainly in the deeper backswamp areas on the edges of the floodplains, and these areas maintained high periphyton abundance into the dry season. This study provides explicit spatial representation of the seasonal dynamics of tropical floodplain macrophyte and periphyton abundance and presents an approach that can be applied to map 'hotspots' of floodplain periphyton abundance.

Most of these maps rely on estimates of ecosystem services estimated for individual land cover classes rather than incorporating field data. We developed combined field models (CFM) using regression analysis to estimate ecosystem services based on the observed relationship between environmental and land cover data and field measurements of ecosystem services. Local ecosystem service supply was estimated from vegetation data measured at fifty sites covering the widest range of environmental conditions across a watershed in Mexico. We compared the accuracy of the CFM approach for forage, timber, firewood and carbon storage over a more commonly "look up table" method relying on a uniform estimate of ecosystem service supply by land cover type. The CFM revealed higher accuracy when compared to the "look up table" approach. The resulting CFM models explained a large fraction of the variance (42-89%) using a combination of land cover, remote sensing data, hydrology and distance from developed areas. In addition, mapping residuals from Geographically Weighted Regressions provided an estimate of uncertainty across the CFM model results. This approach provides better estimates of ecosystem service delivery and uncertainty for land managers and decision-makers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Dahlin, KM				Dahlin, Kyla Marie			Spectral diversity area relationships for assessing biodiversity in a wildland-agriculture matrix	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Species-area relationships have long been used to assess patterns of species diversity across scales. Here, this concept is extended to spectral diversity using hyperspectral data collected by NASA's Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) over western Michigan. This mixture of mesic forest and agricultural lands offers two end-points on the local-scale diversity continuum; one set of well-mixed forest patches and one set of highly homogeneous agricultural patches. Using the sum of the first three principal component values and the principal components' convex hull volume, spectral diversity was compared within and among these plots and to null expectations for perfectly random and perfectly patchy landscapes. Overall, the spectral diversity-area relationship confirms the patterns that would be expected for this landscape, but this application suggests that this approach could be extended to less well-understood landscapes and could reveal key insights about the relative importance of different drivers of community assembly, even in the absence of additional data about plant functional traits or species' identities.																	1051-0761	1939-5582				DEC	2016	26	8					2756	2766		10.1002/eap.1390								WOS:000389316400031	27907259

Using high-resolution LiDAR data to quantify the three-dimensional structure of vegetation in urban green space	URBAN ECOSYSTEMS												The spatial arrangement and vertical structure of vegetation in urban green spaces are key factors in determining the types of benefits that urban parks provide to people. This includes opportunities for recreation, spiritual fulfilment and biodiversity conservation. However, there has been little consideration of how the fine-scale spatial and vertical structure of vegetation is distributed in urban parks, primarily due to limitations in methods for doing so. We addressed this gap by developing a method using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data to map, at a fine resolution, tree cover, vegetation spatial arrangement, and vegetation vertical structure. We then applied this method to urban parks in Brisbane, Australia. We found that parks varied mainly in their amount of tree cover and its spatial arrangement, but also in vegetation vertical structure. Interestingly, the vertical structure of vegetation was largely independent of its cover and spatial arrangement. This suggests that vertical structure may be being managed independently to tree cover to provide different benefits across urban parks with different levels of tree cover. Finally, we were able to classify parks into three distinct classes that explicitly account for both the spatial and vertical structure of tree cover. Our approach for mapping the three-dimensional vegetation structure of urban green space provides a much more nuanced and functional description of urban parks than has previously been possible. Future research is now needed to quantify the relationships between vegetation structure and the actual benefits people derive from urban green space.

Forest Type, Diversity and Biomass Estimation in Tropical Forests of Western Ghat of Maharashtra Using Geospatial Techniques	Small-Scale Forestry												Tropical forests are the world's largest terrestrial storehouses of carbon and are recognized as rich, diverse and highly productive ecosystems. The present study was conducted to characterize the land use, diversity and biomass of tropical forest in Western Ghat of Maharashtra State in India through satellite remote sensing and GIS. The study has been designed and implemented to promote analysis on Western Ghat biodiversity resources including trees, shrubs and herbs based on inventorying, monitoring and mapping. Field measured biomass is integrated with spectral responses of various bands and indices of the Landsat TM satellite image for estimation of above-ground biomass in a 36,046 km(2) area of relic forest in the Central Western Ghat. The above-ground biomass from field-based inventory varied from 30.2 to 151.1 ton/ha in moist deciduous forest, 9.2-99.1 ton/ha in dry deciduous forest, 42.1-158.6 ton/ha in semi-evergreen forest, and 160.9-271 ton/ha in evergreen forest. The total above-ground biomass of the study area was estimated to be 95.2 M tons. A regression equation between field above-ground biomass and a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index was used for spectral modeling to estimate and prepare the above-ground biomass map in the region. A total 120 plant species in 81 genera and 31 families were identified in the study area. This study emphasizes the importance of relic forests for their biodiversity, carbon sequestration and total biomass.

J	Herzog, F; Franklin, J				Herzog, Felix; Franklin, Janet			State-of-the-art practices in farmland biodiversity monitoring for North America and Europe	AMBIO												Policy makers and farmers need to know the status of farmland biodiversity in order to meet conservation goals and evaluate management options. Based on a review of 11 monitoring programs in Europe and North America and on related literature, we identify the design choices or attributes of a program that balance monitoring costs and usefulness for stakeholders. A useful program monitors habitats, vascular plants, and possibly faunal groups (ecosystem service providers, charismatic species) using a stratified random sample of the agricultural landscape, including marginal and intensive regions. The size of landscape samples varies with the grain of the agricultural landscape; for example, samples are smaller in Europe and larger in North America. Raw data are collected in a rolling survey, which distributes sampling over several years. Sufficient practical experience is now available to implement broad monitoring schemes on both continents. Technological developments in remote sensing, metagenomics, and social media may offer new opportunities for affordable farmland biodiversity monitoring and help to lower the overall costs of monitoring programs.

Development of deforestation and land cover database for Bhutan (1930-2014)	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Bhutan is a mountainous country located in the Himalayan biodiversity hotspot. This study has quantified the total area under land cover types, estimated the rate of forest cover change, analyzed the changes across forest types, and modeled forest cover change hotpots in Bhutan. The topographical maps and satellite remote sensing images were analyzed to get the spatial patterns of forest and associated land cover changes over the past eight decades (1930-1977-1987-1995-2005-2014). Forest is the largest land cover in Bhutan and constitutes 68.3% of the total geographical area in 2014. Subtropical broad leaved hill forest is predominant type occupies 34.1% of forest area in Bhutan, followed by montane dry temperate (20.9%), montane wet temperate (18.9%), Himalayan moist temperate (10%), and tropical moist sal (8.1%) in 2014. The major forest cover loss is observed in subtropical broad leaved hill forest (64.5 km(2)) and moist sal forest (9.9 km(2)) from 1977 to 2014. The deforested areas have mainly been converted into agriculture and contributed for 60.9% of forest loss from 1930 to 2014. In spite of major decline of forest cover in time interval of 1930-1977, there is no net rate of deforestation is recorded in Bhutan since 1995. Forest cover change analysis has been carried out to evaluate the conservation effectiveness in "Protected Areas" of Bhutan. Hotspots that have undergone high transformation in forest cover for afforestation and deforestation were highlighted in the study for conservation prioritisation. Forest conservation policies in Bhutan are highly effective in controlling deforestation as compared to neighboring Asian countries and such service would help in mitigating climate change.

Remote sensing (RS) provides a wide-range of satellite-based environmental variables that can be fed into species distribution models (SDMs) to investigate species-environment relations and forecast responses to change. We address the spatiotemporal dynamics of species' habitat suitability at the landscape level by combining multi-temporal RS data with SDMs for analysing inter-annual habitat suitability dynamics. We implemented this framework with a vulnerable plant species (Veronica micrantha), by combining SDMs with a time-series of RS-based metrics of vegetation functioning related to primary productivity, seasonality, phenology and actual evapotranspiration. Besides RS variables, predictors related to landscape structure, soils and wildfires were ranked and combined through multi-model inference (MMI). To assess recent dynamics, a habitat suitability time-series was generated through model hindcasting. MMI highlighted the strong predictive ability of RS variables related to primary productivity and water availability for explaining the test-species distribution, along with soil, wildfire regime and landscape composition. The habitat suitability time-series revealed the effects of short-term land cover changes and inter-annual variability in climatic conditions. Multi-temporal SDMs further improved predictions, benefiting from RS time-series. Overall, results emphasize the integration of landscape attributes related to function, composition and spatial configuration for improving the explanation of ecological patterns. Moreover, coupling SDMs with RS functional metrics may provide early-warnings of future environmental changes potentially impacting habitat suitability. Applications discussed include the improvement of biodiversity monitoring and conservation strategies.

Bale Mountain Eco-Region in Ethiopia is a biodiversity-rich ecosystem where such LULCC have occurred. The specific objectives of this study were to: (i) determine which LULC types gained or lost most as a result of the observed LULCC; (ii) identify the major drivers of the LULCC/deforestation; and (iii) assess the approximate amount of carbon stock removed as a result of deforestation during the study period. Remote sensing and GIS were used to analyze LULCC. Landsat images acquired in 1985, 1995, 2005, and 2015 were used. Additionally, data from the Central Statistics Agency on cropland expansion, and human and livestock population growth were analyzed and correlations were made. The results showed that forest lost 123,751 ha while farmland gained 292,294 ha. Farmland and urban settlement expansion were found to be major drivers of LULCC. Aboveground carbon stock removed from forest and shrubland was more than 24 million tons. In the future, allocation of land to different uses must be based on appropriate land use policies. Integrating biodiversity and ecosystem values for each land cover as per the UN Sustainable Development Goal (UN-SDG) 15.9 may be one of the mechanisms to limit unplanned expansion or invasion of one sector at the expense of another.																	2073-445X					DEC	2016	5	4							41	10.3390/land5040041								WOS:000387943800011

Seven land cover categories such as wheat, rapeseed, vegetable, water, built-up, paved road, and unsurfaced road were extracted from GeoEye satellite images dating from late May to late June of 2010. Three diversity metrics and three evenness metrics were estimated from the abovementioned land cover categories for quantifying the effect of landscape composition on nymphal and adult Laodelphax striatellus Fallen. The degree of correlation between the proportion of crop cover and adjacent spatial scales (r: 0.651-0.983) was higher than the correlation between the proportion of crop cover and nonadjacent spatial scales (r: 0.255-0.896). While the degree of correlation between diversity indices and abundance of L. striatellus decreased gradually when the spatial scales varied from large (> 100 m radius buffer) to small (< 100 m). Our study suggests that when using natural biological pest control and ecological engineering practices in the rural-urban fringes, the crop field's width should be less than 200 m and increasing vegetation diversity within such a scale will be helpful to regulate the insect pests under a certain density.

A perspective on the importance of oceanic fronts in promoting aggregation of visitors to seamounts	FISH AND FISHERIES												Recent evidence has demonstrated that not all seamounts are areas where productivity, biomass and biodiversity of marine life thrive. Therefore, understanding the drivers and mechanisms underlying seamount productivity is a major challenge in today's seamount research. Incorporating oceanographic data in future analyses has been suggested to be of paramount importance to unveil many of the seamount ecology paradigms. Persistent hydrographic features, such as oceanic fronts, have been recognized to enhance biological activity and to drive marine animal distributions and migration patterns. However, the importance of oceanic fronts in driving aggregations of visiting animals on seamounts has not been understood yet. Here, we analysed a data set of seamounts in the Pacific Ocean alongside satellite-derived maps of strong, persistent and frequently occurring oceanographic features, to evaluate if oceanic fronts promote aggregation of visitors on seamounts. Our analyses suggest that seamounts with a higher front frequency were more likely to aggregate tuna catch than average seamounts. However, it appears that fronts may be driving factors for aggregation only if present above a certain threshold. These results highlight the importance of environmental conditions in general, and oceanic fronts in particular, in promoting seamount productivity. We therefore argue that a thorough examination of the oceanographic conditions promoting seamount productivity at various temporal and spatial scales is warranted in future seamount research agendas.

However, our understanding of the discrepancies in levels of forest protection on private lands as obligated by the law versus what occurs in practice remains very poor. We assessed patterns of forest cover and legal compliance with the Forest Code in the 1.25 Mkm(2) Brazilian state of Para, which has the highest deforestation rate in the Amazon. We evaluate the LR deficit and surplus patterns for different sized properties and across 144 municipalities, and found that the total LR surplus (12.6 Mha) was more than five times the total area of deficit (2.3 Mha). Yet, from the total surplus, only 11% can be legally deforested while the remaining 89% is already protected by law but can be used (sold or rented) to compensate for areas that are under deficit. Medium and large-scale properties make up most of the total LR deficit area, while agrarian reform settlements had comparatively large amounts of both compensation-only surplus and deforestable surplus. Most of the municipalities (77%) in the state could compensate their total deficit with surplus areas of LR in the same municipality, while the remainder can be compensate their deficit in one or more neighbouring municipalities, indicating compensation can always take place close to the source of the deficit. Maximising the environmental benefits of achieving Forest Code compliance requires measures that go beyond the existing legal framework, including interventions to avoid further deforestation in places where it is still legal, compensate in close proximity to areas with legal reserve deficit and promote local restoration on degraded lands.

Assessment and monitoring of deforestation and land-use changes (1976-2014) in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India using remote sensing and GIS	CURRENT SCIENCE												Andaman and Nicobar Islands are part of Indo-Burma and Sundaland global biodiversity hotspots. This study provides spatial information on forest types, deforestation and associated land-use changes in Andaman and Nicobar Islands during 1976 to 2014. Satellite remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) techniques have been used to analyse forest cover changes, rate of deforestation and to map patterns of forest cover distribution in Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Classified maps prepared for 1976, 1989, 1993, 2000, 2006 and 2014 indicate that the forest cover accounts for an area of 7086.1 (85.9%), 6969.2 (84.5%), 6941.1 (84.1%), 6934.6 (84.1%), 6617.8 (80.2%) and 6407.3 sq. km (77.7%) respectively. It was found that the area occupied by evergreen forests is very high, consisting of 3065.1 sq. km (32.2%) followed by semi-evergreen (1531.6 sq. km), moist deciduous (1133.4 sq. km) and mangrove forest (677.2 sq. km) in 2014. There is large-scale deforestation in Andaman and Nicobar Islands which has been estimated as 678.8 sq. km during the last four decades. The loss of forest cover is high in moist deciduous forests which has been estimated as 312.2 sq. km in Andaman Islands; whereas in Nicobar Islands, the highest loss was found in evergreen forests (244.6 sq. km). The rate of deforestation in Andaman and Nicobar Islands was high during 2000-2006 (0.78) indicating major influence of the tsunami of 26 December 2004. The annual rate of deforestation from 2006 to 2014 was 0.40. The geospatial analysis of areas of forest cover change provides baseline information for restoration and conservation planning.

PLOS ONE												Tropical forests with a low human population and absence of large-scale deforestation provide unique opportunities to study successful conservation strategies, which should be based on adequate monitoring tools. This study explored the conservation status of a large predator, the jaguar, considered an indicator of the maintenance of how well ecological processes are maintained. We implemented an original integrative approach, exploring successive ecosystem status proxies, from habitats and responses to threats of predators and their prey, to canopy structure and forest biomass. Niche modeling allowed identification of more suitable habitats, significantly related to canopy height and forest biomass. Capture/recapture methods showed that jaguar density was higher in habitats identified as more suitable by the niche model. Surveys of ungulates, large rodents and birds also showed higher density where jaguars were more abundant. Although jaguar density does not allow early detection of overall vertebrate community collapse, a decrease in the abundance of large terrestrial birds was noted as good first evidence of disturbance. The most promising tool comes from easily acquired LiDAR data and radar images: a decrease in canopy roughness was closely associated with the disturbance of forests and associated decreasing vertebrate biomass. This mixed approach, focusing on an apex predator, ecological modeling and remote-sensing information, not only helps detect early population declines in large mammals, but is also useful to discuss the relevance of large predators as indicators and the efficiency of conservation measures. It can also be easily extrapolated and adapted in a timely manner, since important open-source data are increasingly available and relevant for large-scale and real-time monitoring of biodiversity.																	1932-6203					NOV 9	2016	11	11							e0165362	10.1371/journal.pone.0165362								WOS:000387724300040	27828993

Hence, understanding their distribution and abundance is important in order to assess the impact on native ecosystems. It is particularly important to be able to track the spread of invasive species across landscapes; a task best achieved using remotely sensed imagery. The availability of high resolution data, combined with efficient classification methods, can potentially improve early detection of invasive alien species thereby enhancing their management. This study aims to classifywoody species with a focus on Melia azedarach (Meliaceae) trees in a moderately invaded coastal belt valley on the east coast of South Africa using WorldView-2 (WV-2) satellite imagery, and to compare the commonly used pixel-based classification with object-oriented approaches. The results show that object-oriented approaches are more suitable for classifying woody species, as well as other land cover classes when using high-resolution WV-2 imagery. The overall accuracy was 90% by object oriented classification, while the pixel-based classification gave an overall accuracy of 78%. For Melia, a producer accuracy of 92% and user accuracy of 91% was obtained by object-oriented classification and a producer accuracy of 85% and user accuracy of 83% was obtained by pixel-based classification. Hence the combined use of new generation sensor imagery and the employment of object-oriented image classification techniques provided more accurate information on Melia invasion in the study area. This is an encouraging result given the high degree of intermingling of Melia with other plants at the study site. In particular, the vegetation maps produced from this study would aid in gathering accurate knowledge about the distribution and spreading status of Melia, a major invasive species over large areas of South Africa and elsewhere in the world.

J	Bacani, VM				Bacani, Vitor Matheus			GEOPROCESSING APPLIED TO RISK ASSESSMENT OF FOREST FIRES IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF BODOQUENA, MATO GROSSO DO SUL	REVISTA ARVORE												Forest fires are a permanent threat in urban-forest interface areas and cause considerable environmental damage, especially in protected areas. An efficient way to assist decision-making to prevent an increase in forest fires is risk assessment using geographical information systems (GIS). The objective of this study was to evaluate the risk of forest fires in the municipality of Bodoquena, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, using remote sensing data and spatial analysis techniques implemented in a GIS. The procedures of the methodology are based on spatial analysis techniques to prepare maps of the likelihood of fire based on calculations of the Euclidean distance, the Kernel statistical method and fuzzy transformation and to combine these maps via the increasing diffuse overlay method. The results showed a high risk of forest fires on the margins of the urban area, rural settlements and main roads that cross the municipality, as well as the surrounding areas. It is concluded that the municipality of Bodoquena has a high risk of forest fires in areas with high biodiversity, especially the areas surrounding the Serra da Bodoquena National Park and Mato Grosso do Sul Pantanal.																	0100-6762					NOV-DEC	2016	40	6					1003	1011		10.1590/0100-67622016000600005								WOS:000394167100005

We mapped a total of 16 natural and human land use classes using both a Random Forest algorithm and a multivariate Gaussian model while considering scenarios with all natural forest classes grouped into a single intact or degraded category. Overall, classification accuracy increased for the multivariate Gaussian model with the partitioning of intact and degraded forest into separate forest cover classes but slightly decreased based on the Random Forest classifier. Natural forest cover was estimated to be 80.7% of total area in Tanintharyi. The most prevalent forest types are upland evergreen forest (42.3% of area) and lowland evergreen forest (21.6%). However, while just 27.1% of upland evergreen forest was classified as degraded (on the basis of canopy cover <80%), 66.0% of mangrove forest and 47.5% of the region's biologically-rich lowland evergreen forest were classified as degraded. This information on the current status of Tanintharyi's unique forest ecosystems and patterns of human land use is critical to effective conservation strategies and land-use planning.																	2072-4292					NOV	2016	8	11							882	10.3390/rs8110882								WOS:000388798400003						
J	Reno, V; Novo, E; Escada, M				Reno, Vivian; Novo, Evlyn; Escada, Maria			Forest Fragmentation in the Lower Amazon Floodplain: Implications for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Provision to Riverine Populations	REMOTE SENSING												This article analyzes the process of forest fragmentation of a floodplain landscape of the Lower Amazon over a 30-year period and its implications for the biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services to the riverine population. To this end, we created a multi-temporal forest cover map based on Landsat images, and then analyzed the fragmentation dynamics through landscape metrics. From the analyses of the landscape and bibliographic information, we made inferences regarding the potential impacts of fragmentation on the biodiversity of trees, birds, mammals and insects. Subsequently, we used data on the local populations' environmental perception to assess whether the inferred impacts on biodiversity are perceived by these populations and whether the ecosystem services related to the biodiversity of the addressed groups are compromised. The results show a 70% reduction of the forest habitat as well as important changes in the landscape structure that constitute a high degree of forest fragmentation. The perceived landscape alterations indicate that there is great potential for compromise of the biodiversity of trees, birds, mammals and insects. The field interviews corroborate the inferred impacts on biodiversity and indicate that the ecosystem services of the local communities have been compromised. More than 95% of the communities report a decreased variety and/or abundance of animal and plant species, 46% report a decrease in agricultural productivity, and 19% confirm a higher incidence of pests during the last 30 years. The present study provides evidence of an accelerated process of degradation of the floodplain forests of the Lower Amazon and indicate substantial compromise of the ecosystem services provision to the riverine population in recent decades, including reductions of food resources (animals and plants), fire wood, raw material and medicine, as well as lower agricultural productivity due to probable lack of pollination, impoverishment of the soil and an increase of pests.

Linking Earth Observation and taxonomic, structural and functional biodiversity: Local to ecosystem perspectives	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Impacts of human civilization on ecosystems threaten global biodiversity. In a changing environment, traditional in situ approaches to biodiversity monitoring have made significant steps forward to quantify and evaluate BD at many scales but still, these methods are limited to comparatively small areas. Earth observation (EO) techniques may provide a solution to overcome this shortcoming by measuring entities of interest at different spatial and temporal scales. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the role of EO to detect, describe, explain, predict and assess biodiversity. Here, we focus on three main aspects related to biodiversity taxonomic diversity, functional diversity and structural diversity, which integrate different levels of organization molecular, genetic, individual, species, populations, communities, biomes, ecosystems and landscapes. In particular, we discuss the recording of taxonomic elements of biodiversity through the identification of animal and plant species. We highlight the importance of the spectral traits (ST) and spectral trait variations (STV) concept for EO-based biodiversity research. Furthermore we provide examples of spectral traits/spectral trait variations used in EO applications for quantifying taxonomic diversity, functional diversity and structural diversity. We discuss the use of EO to monitor biodiversity and habitat quality using different remote-sensing techniques. Finally, we suggest specifically important steps for a better integration of EO in biodiversity research. EO methods represent an affordable, repeatable and comparable method for measuring, describing, explaining and modelling taxonomic, functional and structural diversity. Upcoming sensor developments will provide opportunities to quantify spectral traits, currently not detectable with EO, and will surely help to describe biodiversity in more detail. Therefore, new concepts are needed to tightly integrate EO sensor networks with the identification of biodiversity. This will mean taking completely new directions in the future to link complex, large data, different approaches and models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Urban warming favours C-4 plants in temperate European cities	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Elucidating the mechanisms responsible for the structure of urban communities is a key aim of urban ecology, but one that is often confounded by the multitude of environmental changes that are caused by urbanization. We applied trait-based techniques to identify the specific environmental drivers that shape urban plant assemblages and predict how these drivers will further impact biotas with increasing urbanization and global environmental change. Urbanized areas across temperate Europe have significantly higher abundance and richness of plants using the C-4 photosynthetic pathway, relative to the total number and species richness of all plant records, than non-urban areas. Urban warming, mediated by the contrasting physiological responses of C-3 and C-4 plants to warming, is the main driver of observed patterns of plant assemblage structure. This mirrors broadscale and historical distribution patterns of C-3 and C-4 plants. The increased relative abundance of C-4 plants in cities demonstrated here may be indicative of more geographically widespread assemblage changes to be expected in temperate environments under continuing global climate change.Synthesis. Applying a combined trait-based, ecoinformatic and remote-sensing approach provides new insight into the landscape-level consequences of urbanization. Specifically, we show that localized urban warming in cities across temperate Europe favours C-4 plant species, which respond positively to increased temperatures. Urban plant assemblages are shaped by environmental warming and exhibit significant increases in C-4 plant relative abundance compared to non-urban assemblages.

The reduction of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions since 2013 does not yet appear to yield substantial benefits for haze mitigation. As the reductions of those key precursors to secondary aerosol formation appears not to sufficient, other crucial factors need to be considered for the design of effective air pollution control strategies. Here we argue that ammonia (NH3) plays a - so far - under-estimated role in the formation of secondary inorganic aerosols, a main component of urban fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in China. By analyzing in situ concentration data observed in major cities alongside gridded emission data obtained from remote sensing and inventories, we find that emissions of NH3 have a more robust association with the spatiotemporal variation of PM2.5 levels than emissions of SO2 and NOx. As a consequence, we argue that urban PM2.5 pollution in China in many locations is substantially affected by NH3 emissions. We highlight that more efforts should be directed to the reduction of NH3 emissions that help mitigate PM2.5 pollution more efficiently than other PM2.5 precursors. Such efforts will yield substantial co-benefits by improving nitrogen use efficiency in farming systems. As a consequence, such integrated strategies would not only improve urban air quality, but also contribute to China's food-security goals, prevent further biodiversity loss, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lead to economic savings.

C.; Coelho, Luiz			Impact of sedimentary processes on white-sand vegetation in an Amazonian megafan	JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY												Amazonian white-sand vegetation has unique tree communities tolerant to nutrient-poor soils of interest for interpreting processes of adaptation in neotropical forests. Part of this phytophysionomy is confined to Late Quaternary megafan palaeo-landforms, thus we posit that sedimentary disturbance is the main ecological factor controlling tree distribution and structuring in this environment. In this study, we characterize the topographic trend of one megafan palaeo-landform using a digital elevation model and verify its relationship to the forest by modelling the canopy height with remote sensing data. We also compare the composition and structure (i.e. canopy height and diameter at breast height) of tree groups from the outer and inner megafan environments based on the integration of remote sensing and floristic data. The latter consist of field inventories of trees >= 10 cm dbh using six (500 x 20 m) plots in varzea, terra firme and igapo from the outer megafan and 20 (50 x 20 m) plots in woodlands and forests from the inner megafan. The unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) and the non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) were applied for clustering and dissimilarity analyses, respectively. The megafan is a sand-dominated triangular wetland with a topographic gradient of < 15 cm km(-1), being more elevated along its axis. The outer megafan has a higher number of tree species (367), taller canopy height (mean of 14.1 m) and higher diameter at breast height (mean of 18.2 cm) than the white-sand forest. The latter records 89 tree species, mean canopy height of 8.4 cm and mean diameter at breast height of 15.3 cm. Trees increase in frequency closer to channels and toward the megafan's axis. The flooded and nutrient-poor sandy megafan substrate favoured the establishment of white-sand vegetation according to the overall megafan topography and morphological heterogeneities inherent to megafan sub-environments.

Quantifying spatiotemporal drivers of environmental heterogeneity in Kruger National Park, South Africa	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Environmental heterogeneity is considered an important mechanism of biodiversity. How environmental heterogeneity is characterised by the compositional, structural and functional variation of biotic and abiotic components is a central research theme in conservation. We explore how environmental heterogeneity relates to the underlying physical landscape template and how that relationship changes over space and time. We examine how, in some areas, environmental heterogeneity may also be driven by dynamic ecological processes, and how this relates to patterns of plant species richness. We use local geographically weighted regression to spatially partition environmental heterogeneity, measured as Landsat spectral variance, into the portion explained by stable physical landscape properties (R-2) and the portion unexplained (1-R-2) which we term landscape complexity. We explore how this relationship varies spatially and temporally as a function of dynamic ecological processes such as rainfall and season in Kruger National Park, as well as plant species richness at landscape scales. The significance and direction of relationships varied over space and time and as a function of rainfall and season. R-2 values generally decreased in higher rainfall summer months and revealed patterns describing the importance of known stable factors relative to unknown dynamic factors. Landscape complexity (1-R-2) explained over 70 % of variation in species richness. Rainfall and seasonality are important drivers of environmental heterogeneity. The spatial arrangement and magnitude of model agreement helped disentangle the relative influence of the physical landscape template on environmental heterogeneity. Given the high correlation with species richness, landscape complexity provides complementary guidance to biodiversity research and monitoring prioritization.

We use a combination of an omission/commission plot to evaluate various results and compile a probability map based on consistently strong performing models across a range of standard accuracy measures. We suggest that this easy-to-use approach can be applied in any study using remote sensing to map natural features for management action. We demonstrate this approach using optical remote sensing products of different spatial and spectral resolution to map the endemic and threatened flora of quartz patches in the Knersvlakte, South Africa. Quartz patches can be mapped using either SPOT 5 (used due to its relatively fine spatial resolution) or Landsat8 imagery (used because it is freely accessible and has higher spectral resolution). Of the variety of classification algorithms available, we tested maximum likelihood and support vector machine, and applied these to raw spectral data, the first three PCA summaries of the data, and the standard normalised difference vegetation index. We found that there is no 'one size fits all' solution to the choice of a 'best fit' model (i.e. combination of classification algorithm or data sets), which is in agreement with the literature that classifier performance will vary with data properties. We feel this lends support to our suggestion that rather than the identification of a 'single best' model and a map based on this result alone, a probability map based on the range of consistently top performing models provides a rigorous solution to environmental mapping.

The approach was developed to provide the basis for the management plan of a cluster of Natura 2000 special conservation areas in the Central Apennine mountains, Italy (with a total area of 79,500 ha, including 22,130 ha of grasslands). It includes a novel methodology for estimating sustainable stocking rates of different plant communities, at a detailed spatial scale over large areas, based on the integration of: (i) a classification of grassland types, based on physical habitat stratification and vegetation sampling; (ii) a forage-value assessment of each grassland type, obtained from field sampling of botanical composition and corrected with remote-sensing information on pasture microtopography; (iii) an estimate of primary productivity at a detailed spatial scale, obtained from the remote-sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calibrated with biomass field data. Additionally, to obtain a bioclimatic characterization of the grasslands and to determine the optimal grazing season for each grassland type, intra-annual phenological signatures were obtained from the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Given the inherent limitations in the sustainable stocking rates concept, and the particular susceptibility of dry grasslands to changes in grazing regimes, we tested two biological indicators, the Auchenorrhyncha quality index (AQI) and the Arthropod-based biological soil quality index (QBS-ar). These indicators take into account above- and below-ground arthropod diversity, respectively, and are applied here for the first time to the specific purpose of monitoring grazing load effects on ecological quality and biodiversity of Natura 2000 dry grasslands. We conclude that: (i) it is possible to effectively integrate biomass estimates, obtained from publicly available satellite data, with a relatively simple field sampling of botanical composition, to achieve a detailed spatialization of sustainable stocking rates; (ii) within the same Natura 2000 habitat type there can be a large spatial heterogeneity in both sustainable stocking rates and optimal stocking season: thus, grazing should be kept under careful human control to maintain the habitats in the desired conservation status; (iii) while plant species richness was not correlated to grazing intensity, both AQI and QBS-ar had a significant negative correlation to grazing levels and can thus be useful for monitoring the actual "sustainability" of livestock loads on different aspects of grassland ecosystems.

Wetland loss due to land use change in the Lower Parana River Delta, Argentina	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Wetland loss is a global concern because wetlands are highly diverse ecosystems that provide important goods and services, thus threatening both biodiversity and human well-being. The Parana River Delta is one of the largest and most important wetland ecosystems of South America, undergoing expanding cattle and forestry activities with widespread water control practices. To understand the patterns and drivers of land cover change in the Lower Parana River Delta, we quantified land cover changes and modeled associated factors. We developed land cover maps using Landsat images from 1999 and 2013 and identified main land cover changes. We quantified the influence of different socioeconomic (distance to roads, population centers and human activity centers), land management (area within polders, cattle density and years since last fire), biophysical variables (landscape unit, elevation, soil productivity, distance to rivers) and variables related to extreme system dynamics (flooding and fires) on freshwater marsh conversion with Boosted Regression Trees. We found that one third of the freshwater marshes of the Lower Delta (163,000 ha) were replaced by pastures (70%) and forestry (18%) in only 14 years. Ranching practices (represented by cattle density, area within polders and distance to roads) were the most important factors responsible for freshwater marsh conversion to pasture. These rapid and widespread losses of freshwater marshes have potentially large negative consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services. A strategy for sustainable wetland management will benefit from careful analysis of dominant land uses and related management practices, to develop an urgently needed land use policy for the Lower Delta.

J	Braunisch, V; Patthey, P; Arlettaz, R				Braunisch, Veronika; Patthey, Patrick; Arlettaz, Raphael			Where to Combat Shrub Encroachment in Alpine Timberline Ecosystems: Combining Remotely-Sensed Vegetation Information with Species Habitat Modelling	PLOS ONE												In many cultural landscapes, the abandonment of traditional grazing leads to encroachment of pastures by woody plants, which reduces habitat heterogeneity and impacts biodiversity typical of semi-open habitats. We developed a framework of mutually interacting spatial models to locate areas where shrub encroachment in Alpine treeline ecosystems deteriorates vulnerable species' habitat, using black grouse Tetrao tetrix (L.) in the Swiss Alps as a study model. Combining field observations and remote-sensing information we 1) identified and located the six predominant treeline vegetation types; 2) modelled current black grouse breeding habitat as a function thereof so as to derive optimal habitat profiles; 3) simulated from these profiles the theoretical spatial extension of breeding habitat when assuming optimal vegetation conditions throughout; and used the discrepancy between (2) and (3) to 4) locate major aggregations of homogeneous shrub vegetation in otherwise suitable breeding habitat as priority sites for habitat restoration. All six vegetation types (alpine pasture, coniferous forest, Alnus viridis (Chaix), Rhododendron-dominated, Juniperus-dominated and mixed heathland) were predicted with high accuracy (AUC > 0.9). Breeding black grouse preferred a heterogeneous mosaic of vegetation types, with none exceeding 50% cover. While 15% of the timberline belt currently offered suitable breeding habitat, twice that fraction (29%) would potentially be suitable when assuming optimal shrub and ground vegetation conditions throughout the study area. Yet, only 10% of this difference was attributed to habitat deterioration by shrub-encroachment of dense heathland (all types 5.2%) and Alnus viridis (4.8%). The presented method provides both a general, large-scale assessment of areas covered by dense shrub vegetation as well as specific target values and priority areas for habitat restoration related to a selected target organism. This facilitates optimizing the spatial allocation of management resources in geographic regions where shrub encroachment represents a major biodiversity conservation issue.																	1932-6203					OCT 11	2016	11	10							e0164318	10.1371/journal.pone.0164318								WOS:000385504400026	27727325

Spatial and temporal rainfall distribution and its effect on NDVI can be helpful for drought examining. This study has been done to improved comprehend this association. The response of vegetation growth to current climate change in Pakistan and adjoining south Asian countries (22-42 degrees N, 60-80 degrees E) were investigated by analyzing the time series of the NDVI maps. We also obtained and analyzed time series of different variable i.e. rainfall, soil moisture, evapotranspiration and soil temperature model data, through NASA Geospatial Interactive Online Visualization and analysis Infrastructure (Giovanni) system, during Jan-Dec, 2014 for every three month interval. The NOAA Climate Prediction Center from International Research institute (IRI) for climate and society's platform was also used for rainfall anomaly data. We found that NDVI values varies and depend on land cover types and its spatial location and dependant on rainfall. We found a strong positive relationship among NDVI, rainfall and soil moisture. Seasonal variations of rainfall are having also affects on evapotranspiration, soil temperature, and soil moisture conditions.																	0556-3321	2070-3368				OCT	2016	48	5					1887	1892										WOS:000392910800015						
J	de Paula, MD; Groeneveld, J; Huth, A				de Paula, Mateus Dantas; Groeneveld, Juergen; Huth, Andreas			The extent of edge effects in fragmented landscapes: Insights from satellite measurements of tree cover	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Due to deforestation, intact tropical forest areas are increasingly transformed into a mixture of remaining forest patches and human modified areas. These forest fragments suffer from edge effects, which cause changes in ecological and ecosystem processes, undermining habitat quality and the offer of ecosystem services. Even though detailed and long term studies were developed on the topic of edge effects at local scale, understanding edge effect characteristics in fragmented forests on larger scales and finding indicators for its impact is crucial for predicting habitat loss and developing management options. Here we evaluate the spatial and temporal dimensions of edge effects in large areas using remote sensing. First we executed a neighborhood pixel analysis in 11 LANDSAT Tree Cover (LTC) scenes (180 x 185 km each, 8 in the tropics and 3 in temperate forested areas) using tree cover as an indicator of habitat quality and in relation to edge distance. Second, we executed a temporal analysis of LTC in a smaller area in the Brazilian Amazon forest where one larger forest fragment (25,890 ha) became completely fragmented in 5 years. Our results show that for all 11 scenes pixel neighborhood variation of LTC is much higher in the vicinity of forest edges, becoming lower towards the forest interior. This analysis suggests a maximum distance for edge effects and can indicate the location of unaffected core areas. However, LTC patterns in relation to fragment edge distance vary according to the analyzed region, and maximum edge distance may differ according to local conditions. Our temporal analysis illustrates the change in tree cover patterns after 5 years of fragmentation, becoming on average lower close to the edge (between 50 and 100 m). Although it is still unclear which are the main causes of LTC edge variability within and between regions, LANDSAT Tree Cover could be used as an accessible and efficient discriminator of edge and interior forest habitats in fragmented landscapes, and become invaluable for deriving qualitative spatial and temporal information of ecological and ecosystem processes.

In this article, we analyze the spatial distribution of multiple-ES indicators at three locations on the pioneer fronts of the Brazilian Amazon. We identify trade-offs and synergies between six ES indicators for soil, vegetation and biodiversity characterization. We also propose spatial representations of multiple-ES indicators (vegetation carbon stocks, rates of water infiltration into soil, soil chemical quality, soil carbon stocks, biodiversity and richness in Sphingidae). Finally, we discuss three different methods to map them depending on the goals of the maps, arguing that maps lean on objective-oriented approaches. The study is based on remote sensing and sampling data from 135 sampling points. We created multiple-ES indicators maps based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a score of ES richness, and discrimination of land cover units. PCA is an appropriate tool for showing high correlations between indicators, nevertheless has notable limitations for visual communication. The scoring method may help mapping ES hotspots, however it fails to consider relationships among them. The land-cover-based method has the advantage of being simple and easy to interpret, still it may not consider important indicators not related to land-cover changes. We discuss the interests and limitations of these different ways to map multiple-ES indicators, regarding the final goals of the maps. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Assessing impacts to primary productivity at the park edge in Murchison Falls Conservation Area, Uganda	ECOSPHERE												Human activities around parks can alter vegetation patterns within them, resulting in edge effects that degrade their ability to sustain ecological processes and support biodiversity. We quantified vegetation patterns and edge effects over a large geographic extent in Murchison Falls Conservation Area, Uganda, using freely available remotely sensed data. Over a 13-yr period, we quantified seasonal patterns in productivity using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), comparing the park exterior, a boundary zone <= 10 km from the border inside the park, and the park interior. To identify the extent of edge effects, we further fit mixed models by vegetation type within 1-km bands within the boundary zone. Productivity was higher in the park interior than exterior in both wet and dry seasons, and in the wet season, it was also lower in the boundary zone than the interior. NDVI variability differed between seasons; it declined from exterior to interior in the wet season, but was highest in the boundary zone and similar between interior and exterior during the dry season. Within the boundary zone, edge effects varied by land cover type and extended 4-6 km into MFCA. Abrupt differences in vegetation patterns between the park and adjacent unprotected areas indicated a "hard edge" in this system. While hard edges are readily apparent, the subtle changes in productivity that extend into and degrade park systems are harder to detect. We demonstrated a low-cost and novel approach to detect such effects using readily available satellite imagery, which indicated human influence affecting 29-40% of the park. As human populations grow, parks will become further isolated, and measuring and managing edge effects may be crucial to achieving conservation objectives.																	2150-8925					OCT	2016	7	10								10.1002/ecs2.1486								WOS:000387216300025

Using Google Earth Surface Metrics to Predict Plant Species Richness in a Complex Landscape	REMOTE SENSING												Google Earth provides a freely available, global mosaic of high-resolution imagery from different sensors that has become popular in environmental and ecological studies. However, such imagery lacks the near-infrared band often used in studying vegetation, thus its potential for estimating vegetation properties remains unclear. In this study, we assess the potential of Google Earth imagery to describe and predict vegetation attributes. Further, we compare it to the potential of SPOT imagery, which has additional spectral information. We measured basal area, vegetation height, crown cover, density of individuals, and species richness in 60 plots in the oak forests of a complex volcanic landscape in central Mexico. We modelled each vegetation attribute as a function of surface metrics derived from Google Earth and SPOT images, and selected the best-supported linear models from each source. Total species richness was the best-described and predicted variable: the best Google Earth-based model explained nearly as much variation in species richness as its SPOT counterpart (R-2 = 0.44 and 0.51, respectively). However, Google Earth metrics emerged as poor predictors of all remaining vegetation attributes, whilst SPOT metrics showed potential for predicting vegetation height. We conclude that Google Earth imagery can be used to estimate species richness in complex landscapes. As it is freely available, Google Earth can broaden the use of remote sensing by researchers and managers in low-income tropical countries where most biodiversity hotspots are found.

J	Bustamante, J; Aragones, D; Afan, I				Bustamante, Javier; Aragones, David; Afan, Isabel			Effect of Protection Level in the Hydroperiod of Water Bodies on Donana's Aeolian Sands	REMOTE SENSING												Mediterranean temporary ponds on Donana's aeolian sands form an extensive system of small dynamic water bodies, dependent on precipitation and groundwater, of considerable importance for biodiversity conservation. Different areas of the aeolian sands have received different levels of environmental protection since 1969, and this has influenced the degree of conservation and the flooding dynamic of these temporary surface waters. We use the Landsat series of satellite images from 1985 to 2014 to study the temporal dynamic of small temporary water bodies on the aeolian sands in relation to the protection level and to distance to water abstraction pressures from agriculture and residential areas. The results show that even with small and ephemeral water bodies optical remote sensing time-series are an effective way to study their flooding temporal dynamics. The protected areas of the aeolian sands hold a better preserved system of temporary ponds, with a flooding dynamic that fluctuates with precipitation. The unprotected area shows an increase in mean hydroperiod duration, and surface flooded, and a decline in hydroperiod variability. This seems to be due to the creation of irrigation ponds and the artificialization of the flooding regime of the natural temporary ponds, that either receive excess irrigation water or dry-up due to the lowering of the groundwater table level. Although a decline in hydroperiod duration of temporary ponds is seen as negative to the system, an increase in hydroperiod of surface waters due to artificialization, or a decline in variability cannot be considered as positive compensatory effects.

Land-use change affects water recycling in Brazil's last agricultural frontier	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Historically, conservation-oriented research and policy in Brazil have focused on Amazon deforestation, but a majority of Brazil's deforestation and agricultural expansion has occurred in the neighboring Cerrado biome, a biodiversity hotspot comprised of dry forests, woodland savannas, and grasslands. Resilience of rainfed agriculture in both biomes likely depends on water recycling in undisturbed Cerrado vegetation; yet little is known about how changes in land-use and land-cover affect regional climate feedbacks in the Cerrado. We used remote sensing techniques to map land-use change across the Cerrado from 2003 to 2013. During this period, cropland agriculture more than doubled in area from 1.2 to 2.5 million ha, with 74% of new croplands sourced from previously intact Cerrado vegetation. We find that these changes have decreased the amount of water recycled to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration ( ET) each year. In 2013 alone, cropland areas recycled 14 km(3) less ( -3%) water than if the land cover had been native Cerrado vegetation. ET from single-cropping systems ( e. g., soybeans) is less than from natural vegetation in all years, except in the months of January and February, the height of the growing season. In double-cropping systems ( e. g., soybeans followed by corn), ET is similar to or greater than natural vegetation throughout a majority of the wet season ( December-May). As intensification and extensification of agricultural production continue in the region, the impacts on the water cycle and opportunities for mitigation warrant consideration. For example, if an environmental goal is to minimize impacts on the water cycle, double cropping ( intensification) might be emphasized over extensification to maintain a landscape that behaves more akin to the natural system.

Of significant importance is their photosynthetic pathways (C3 and C4), which epitomizes a fundamental eco-physiological distinction of grasses functional types. With advances in technology and the availability of remotely sensed data at different spatial, spectral, radiometric and temporal resolutions, coupled with the need for detailed information on vegetation condition, the monitoring of C3 and C4 grasses AGB has received renewed attention, especially in the light of global climate change, biodiversity and, most importantly, food security. This paper provides a detailed survey on the progress of remote sensing application in determining C3 and C4 grass species AGB. Importantly, the importance of species functional type is highlighted in conjunction with the availability and applicability of different remote sensing datasets, with refined resolutions, which provide an opportunity to monitor C3 and C4 grasses AGB. While some progress has been made, this review has revealed the need for further remote sensing studies to model the seasonal (cyclical) variability, as well as long-term AGB changes in C3 and C4 grasses, in the face of climate change and food security. Moreover, the findings of this study have shown the significance of shifting towards the application of advanced statistical models, to further improve C3 and C4 grasses AGB estimation accuracy.

Marine ecosystems are indeed largely composed by microbial planktonic communities whose niches are affected by highly dynamical physico-chemical conditions, and whose observation requires advanced methods for morphological and molecular classification. Optical remote sensing offers an appealing complement to these in-situ techniques. Global scale coverage at high spatiotemporal resolution is however achieved at the cost of restrained information on the local assemblage. Here, we use a coupled physical and ecological model ocean simulation to explore one possible metrics for comparing measures performed on such different scales. We show that a large part of the local diversity of the virtual plankton ecosystem - corresponding to what accessible by genomic methods - can be inferred from crude, but spatially extended, information - as conveyed by remote sensing. Shannon diversity of the local community is indeed highly correlated to a 'seascape' index, which quantifies the surrounding spatial heterogeneity of the most abundant functional group. The error implied in drastically reducing the resolution of the plankton community is shown to be smaller in frontal regions as well as in regions of intermediate turbulent energy. On the spatial scale of hundreds of kms, patterns of virtual plankton diversity are thus largely sustained by mixing communities that occupy adjacent niches. We provide a proof of principle that in the open ocean information on spatial variability of communities can compensate for limited local knowledge, suggesting the possibility of integrating in-situ and satellite observations to monitor biodiversity distribution at the global scale.

A plantation-dominated forest transition in Chile	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												As one of the few countries in Latin America to have reversed persistent losses in tree cover, Chile may hold important insights for forest transition theory. However, existing studies have not provided methodologically consistent analyses at sufficient temporal and spatial scales to properly assess the state of Chile's forest transition. In the current study, we generate high-resolution maps of Chilean land use change between 1986, 2001 and 2011. We couple remote sensing with a review of historic assessments of Chile's forest resources to document long-term trends in forest extent. This historical review identifies multiple discrete forest transitions throughout Chile's history. These fluctuations in forest clearing emphasize that the cultural, economic and political forces that precipitate forest transitions can all be reversed. The remote sensing analysis calls into question official statistics indicating an expansion of native forests between 1986 and 2011. We find that increases in forest cover were largely driven by the expansion of forest plantations, rather than through native forest regeneration. Plantation forests directly displaced native forests in many locations, especially during the 1986-2001 period. Nevertheless, declines in the rate of forest conversion during the 2001-2011 period suggest that plantations are beginning to ease pressure on native forests. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Toward quantification of the impact of 21st-century deforestation on the extinction risk of terrestrial vertebrates	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Conservation actions need to be prioritized, often taking into account species' extinction risk. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List provides an accepted, objective framework for the assessment of extinction risk. Assessments based on data collected in the field are the best option, but the field data to base these on are often limited. Information collected through remote sensing can be used in place of field data to inform assessments. Forests are perhaps the best-studied land-cover type for use of remote-sensing data. Using an open-access 30-m resolution map of tree cover and its change between 2000 and 2012, we assessed the extent of forest cover and loss within the distributions of 11,186 forest-dependent amphibians, birds, and mammals worldwide. For 16 species, forest loss resulted in an elevated extinction risk under red-list criterion A, owing to inferred rapid population declines. This number increased to 23 when data-deficient species (i.e., those with insufficient information for evaluation) were included. Under red-list criterion B2, 484 species (855 when data-deficient species were included) were considered at elevated extinction risk, owing to restricted areas of occupancy resulting from little forest cover remaining within their ranges. The proportion of species of conservation concern would increase by 32.8% for amphibians, 15.1% for birds, and 24.7% for mammals if our suggested uplistings are accepted. Central America, the Northern Andes, Madagascar, the Eastern Arc forests in Africa, and the islands of Southeast Asia are hotspots for these species. Our results illustrate the utility of satellite imagery for global extinction-risk assessment and measurement of progress toward international environmental agreement targets. Hacia la Cuantificacion del Impacto de la Deforestacion del Siglo XXI sobre el Riesgo de Extincion de los Vertebrados Terrestres Las acciones de conservacion necesitan ser priorizadas, considerando con frecuencia el riesgo de extincion de las especies. La Lista Roja de la Union Internacional para la Conservacion de la Naturaleza (UICN) proporciona un marco de trabajo objetivo y aceptado para la valoracion del riesgo de extincion. Las valoraciones basadas en los datos colectados en el campo son la mejor opcion, pero los datos de campo sobre los cuales basar las valoraciones con frecuencia son limitados. Los datos colectados por medio de la teledeteccion pueden usarse en lugar de los datos de campo para informar a las valoraciones. Los bosques tal vez sean el tipo de cubierta de suelo mejor estudiado para el uso de datos de teledeteccion. Con un mapa de acceso abierto y resolucion de 30-m de la cobertura de arboles y su cambio entre 2000 y 2012, valoramos la extension de la cobertura de bosque y la perdida dentro de las distribuciones de 11, 186 especies de anfibios, aves y mamiferos dependientes del bosque a nivel mundial. Para 16 especies, la perdida del bosque resulto en un riesgo de extincion elevado, bajo el criterio A de la lista roja, debido a las declinaciones rapidas de poblacion inferidas. Este numero incremento a 23 cuando las especies con deficiencia de datos (es decir, aquellas con informacion insuficiente para su evaluacion) fueron incluidas. Bajo el criterio B2 de la lista roja, 484 especies (855 cuando se incluyeron las especies con deficiencia de datos) se consideraron con riesgo alto de extincion, debido a las areas restringidas de ocupacion como resultado de la pequena cobertura del bosque que permanece dentro de su distribucion. La proporcion de especies de interes para la conservacion incrementaria en 32.8 % para los anfibios, 15.1 % para las aves y 24.7 % para los mamiferos si nuestros cambios de categoria sugeridos son aceptados.

J	Braun, AC; Koch, B				Braun, Andreas Christian; Koch, Barbara			Estimating impacts of plantation forestry on plant biodiversity in southern Chile-a spatially explicit modelling approach	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Monitoring the impacts of land-use practices is of particular importance with regard to biodiversity hotspots in developing countries. Here, conserving the high level of unique biodiversity is challenged by limited possibilities for data collection on site. Especially for such scenarios, assisting biodiversity assessments by remote sensing has proven useful. Remote sensing techniques can be applied to interpolate between biodiversity assessments taken in situ. Through this approach, estimates of biodiversity for entire landscapes can be produced, relating land-use intensity to biodiversity conditions. Such maps are a valuable basis for developing biodiversity conservation plans. Several approaches have been published so far to interpolate local biodiversity assessments in remote sensing data. In the following, a new approach is proposed. Instead of inferring biodiversity using environmental variables or the variability of spectral values, a hypothesis-based approach is applied. Empirical knowledge about biodiversity in relation to land-use is formalized and applied as ascription rules for image data. The method is exemplified for a large study site (over 67,000 km(2)) in central Chile, where forest industry heavily impacts plant diversity. The proposed approach yields a coefficient of correlation of 0.73 and produces a convincing estimate of regional biodiversity. The framework is broad enough to be applied to other study sites.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				OCT	2016	188	10							564	10.1007/s10661-016-5547-1								WOS:000384330800022	27629554

From one- to two-phase sampling to reduce costs of remote sensing-based estimation of land-cover and land-use proportions and their changes	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The estimation of the proportion of land-cover and land-use classes is considered by exploiting remote sensing based imagery. A pure-panel survey based on point sampling is adopted. An initial sample of points is selected by means of tessellation stratified sampling (TSS). The sample points are classified based on the imagery available for the years of interest to estimate land-cover or land-use proportions and their changes. To reduce the sampling effort, the initial selection of points is viewed as the first phase of sampling and a subsample of these points is selected in a second phase by means of one-per-stratum stratified sampling (OPSS). Land-use estimation at any subsequent year is then based on the classifications performed on the points of the second-phase sample. Two-phase estimators of proportions and of their changes are suggested, and their theoretical properties are derived. Presumably conservative estimators of their variances are proposed. A check of the precision lost involved when changing from one- to two-phase sampling is determined from the assessment of land use in Italy as a case study and from an artificial population generated to resemble the current land-use situation in Italy.

Processes related to climate change or agricultural expansion threaten the ecosystem's state, function and the services it provides. A prominent example is the Brazilian Cerrado that has an extent of around 2 million km(2) and features high biodiversity with many endemic species. It is characterized by landscape patterns from open grasslands to dense forests, defining a heterogeneous gradient in vegetation structure throughout the biome. While it is undisputed that the Cerrado provides a multitude of valuable ecosystem services, it is exposed to changes, e.g. through large scale land conversions or climatic changes. Monitoring of the Cerrado is thus urgently needed to assess the state of the system as well as to analyze and further understand ecosystem responses and adaptations to ongoing changes. Therefore we explored the potential of dense Landsat time series to derive phenological information for mapping vegetation gradients in the Cerrado. Frequent data gaps, e.g. due to cloud contamination, impose a serious challenge for such time series analyses. We synthetically filled data gaps based on Radial Basis Function convolution filters to derive continuous pixel-wise temporal profiles capable of representing Land Surface Phenology (LSP). Derived phenological parameters revealed differences in the seasonal cycle between the main Cerrado physiognomies and could thus be used to calibrate a Support Vector Classification model to map their spatial distribution. Our results show that it is possible to map the main spatial patterns of the observed physiognomies based on their phenological differences, whereat inaccuracies occurred especially between similar classes and data-scarce areas. The outcome emphasizes the need for remote sensing based time series analyses at fine scales. Mapping heterogeneous ecosystems such as savannas requires spatial detail, as well as the ability to derive important phenological parameters for monitoring habitats or ecosystem responses to climate change. The open Landsat and Sentinel-2 archives provide the satellite data needed for improved analyses of savanna ecosystems globally. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In tropical areas, hosting large biomass and biodiversity resources which are often threatened by unsustainable anthropogenic pressures, frequent forest resources monitoring is needed. Lidar is a powerful tool to estimate aboveground biomass at fine resolution; however its application in tropical forests has been limited, with high variability in the accuracy of results. Lidar pulses scan the forest vertical profile, and can provide structure information which is also linked to biodiversity. In the last decade the remote sensing of biodiversity has received great attention, but few studies focused on the use of lidar for assessing tree species richness in tropical forests. This research aims at estimating aboveground,biomass and tree species richness using discrete return airborne lidar in Ghana forests. We tested an advanced statistical technique, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), which does not require assumptions on data distribution or on the relationships between variables, being suitable for studying ecological variables. We compared the MARS regression results with those obtained by multilinear regression and found that both algorithms were effective, but MARS provided higher accuracy either for biomass (R-2 = 0.72) and species richness (R-2 = 0.64). We also noted strong correlation between biodiversity and biomass field values. Even if the forest areas under analysis are limited in extent and represent peculiar ecosystems, the preliminary indications produced by our study suggest that instrument such as lidar, specifically useful for pinpointing forest structure, can also be exploited as a support for tree species richness assessment.

To achieve this, the land cover of this protected area was determined by classifying satellite images obtained before, during and after the conflicts, and via ground surveys. Metrics of landscape ecology were calculated. A ground campaign for observing the CFHS's flora and damages incurred was carried out using a sampling of eighteen 500 m-long transects. The results show that forest fragmentation intensified during and after the period of conflicts. Forests covered over 93% of the CFHS's area before conflicts and under 28% in 2015. The main cause of this deforestation is cacao growing. Anthropic activities caused the loss of 40% of plant species, including some which are endemic in Ivory Coast. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Spectranomics: Emerging science and conservation opportunities at the interface of biodiversity and remote sensing	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												With the goal of advancing remote sensing in biodiversity science, Spectranomics represents an emerging approach, and a suite of quantitative methods, intended to link plant canopy phylogeny and functional traits to their spectral-optical properties. The current Spectranomics database contains about one half of known tropical forest canopy tree species worldwide, and has become a forecasting asset for predicting aspects of plant functional and biological diversity to be remotely mapped and monitored with current and future spectral remote sensing technology. To mark ten years of Spectranomics, we review recent scientific outcomes to further stimulate engagement in the use of spectral remote sensing for biodiversity and functional ecology research.

Geomorphic changes of a coral shingle cay measured using Kite Aerial Photography	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Measurements of geomorphic change in the intertidal zones of coral reefs are made using a variety of remote sensing and in-situ techniques, where variations in the coverage and spatial-temporal precision achieved are directly related to the cost of data acquisition. We present a novel, low-cost technique for measuring high resolution changes in reef environments based on Kite Aerial Photography (KAP) and photogrammetry/structure-from-motion post-processing. KAP images are used to measure fine-scale changes in intertidal topography and sediment texture characteristics, including rubble particle size, of a coral shingle cay at One Tree Island, Great Barrier Reef in the context of storm activity. Validation using Real Time Kinematic DGPS demonstrates the ability to measure topographic elevation with an error of 5.53 cm (RMSE) and a spatial resolution of 5 cm per point, an accuracy/resolution that is superior to airborne LiDAR and equivalent to terrestrial LiDAR, but at a fraction of the equipment cost.

J	Musa, ZN; Popescu, I; Mynett, A				Musa, Zahrah N.; Popescu, Ioana; Mynett, Arthur			Assessing the sustainability of local resilience practices against sea level rise impacts on the lower Niger delta	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Response strategies determine the resilience of an area to effects of sea level rise. Strategies that are sustainable are those that do not negatively affect the environment, biodiversity and community life of the people. The paper discusses response strategies practiced in the Niger delta to combat effects of sea level rise like: flooding, erosion, inundation, storm surge, and intrusion of sea salt. Local responses to these natural hazards and the degree of effectiveness of the methods in enabling the people return to their normal lives are reviewed for their suitability as future adaptation strategies. GIS and remote sensing analysis of slope and topography show the Niger delta is vulnerable to further flooding, inundation, and erosion as a result of sea level rise. Based on a 'business as usual' scenario, the GIS based bathtub approach is used to calculate and map possible inundation extents for the Niger delta under sea level rise conditions. As the Niger delta is subsiding due to oil and gas exploitation, relative sea level rise (RSLR) values for the Niger delta are obtained by adding measured subsidence values (7 mm and 25 mm) to predicted eustatic sea level rise values (19 mm by 2030 and 35 mm by 2050); resulting in RSLR of 0.14 0.96 m by 2030 and 2050. With subsidence at 7 mm/year and a RSLR of 0.14 m, results for 2030 shows an inundation extent of 11193 km(2) which is 4.6% of the total surface area; subsidence of 25 mm/year (SLR = 0.44 m) gives an inundation extent of 1254.0 km(2) which is 5.2% of the surface area. Results for 2050 show that a rise of 0.29 rn (subsidence = 7 mm/year) will cause an inundation extent of 1175.9 km(2) which is 4.9% of the total surface area, and RSLR of 0.96 m (subsidence = 25 mm/year) inundates 1633.0 km(2) which is 6.8% of the surface area. Although the literature shows local practices have helped people to cope with the challenges posed by flooding, erosion, inundation, and inland intrusion of sea salts, however some of the practices have disadvantages that make them undesirable for inclusion in future planning. Sustainable local practices in the Niger delta include: planting of Bamboo trees for erosion control, use of sandbags as bridges and dikes (flood control), use of flood receptor pits as temporary flood water reservoirs, and community legislation against sand mining and indiscriminate tree felling. Further studies on the limitations of the local resilience practices in the Niger delta is recommended. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Management of Protected Areas and Its Effect on an Ecosystem Function: Removal of Prosopis flexuosa Seeds by Mammals in Argentinian Drylands	PLOS ONE												The ecological function of animal seed dispersal depends on species interactions and can be affected by drivers such as the management interventions applied to protected areas. This study was conducted in two protected areas in the Monte Desert: a fenced reserve with grazing exclusion and absence of large native mammals (the Man and Biosphere Nacunan Reserve; FR) and an unfenced reserve with low densities of large native and domestic animals (Ischigualasto Park; UFR). The study focuses on Prosopis flexuosa seed removal by different functional mammal groups: "seed predators", "scatter-hoarders", and "opportunistic frugivores". Under both interventions, the relative contribution to seed removal by different functional mammal groups was assessed, as well as how these groups respond to habitat heterogeneity (i.e. vegetation structure) at different spatial scales. Camera traps were used to identify mammal species removing P. flexuosa seeds and to quantify seed removal; remote sensing data helped analyze habitat heterogeneity. In the FR, the major fruit removers were a seed predator (Graomys griseoflavus) and a scatter-hoarder (Microcavia asutralis). In the UFR, the main seed removers were the opportunistic frugivores (Lycalopex griseus and Dolichotis patagonum), who removed more seeds than the seed predator in the FR. The FR shows higher habitat homogeneity than the UFR, and functional groups respond differently to habitat heterogeneity at different spatial scales. In the FR, because large herbivores are locally extinct (e.g. Lama guanicoe) and domestic herbivores are excluded, important functions of large herbivores are missing, such as the maintenance of habitat heterogeneity, which provides habitats for medium-sized opportunistic frugivores with consequent improvement of quality and quantity of seed dispersal services. In the UFR, with low densities of large herbivores, probably one important ecosystem function this group performs is to increase habitat heterogeneity, allowing for the activity of medium-sized mammals who, behaving as opportunistic frugivores, did the most significant seed removal.

Quantifying the influences of spectral resolution on uncertainty in leaf trait estimates through a Bayesian approach to RTM inversion	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The remote monitoring of plant canopies is critically needed for understanding of terrestrial ecosystem mechanics and biodiversity as well as capturing the short- to long-term responses of vegetation to disturbance and climate change. A variety of orbital, sub-orbital, and field instruments have been used to retrieve optical spectral signals and to study different vegetation properties such as plant biochemistry, nutrient cycling, physiology, water status, and stress. Radiative transfer models (RTMs) provide a mechanistic link between vegetation properties and observed spectral features, and RTM spectral inversion is a useful framework for estimating these properties from spectral data. However, existing approaches to RTM spectral inversion are typically limited by the inability to characterize uncertainty in parameter estimates. Here, we introduce a Bayesian algorithm for the spectral inversion of the PROSPECT 5 leaf RTM that is distinct from past approaches in two important ways: First, the algorithm only uses reflectance and does not require transmittance observations, which have been plagued by a variety of measurement and equipment challenges. Second, the output is not a point estimate for each parameter but rather the joint probability distribution that includes estimates of parameter uncertainties and covariance structure. We validated our inversion approach using a database of leaf spectra together with measurements of equivalent water thickness (EWT) and leaf dry mass per unit area (LMA). The parameters estimated by our inversion were able to accurately reproduce the observed reflectance (RMSEVIS = 0.0063, RMSENIR-SWIR = 0.0098) and transmittance (RMSEVIS = 0.0404, RMSENIR-SWIR = 0.0551) for both broadleaved and conifer species. Inversion estimates of EWT and LMA for broadleaved species agreed well with direct measurements (CVEWT = 18.8%, CVLMA = 24.5%), while estimates for conifer species were less accurate (CVEWT = 53.2%, CVLMA = 63.3%). To examine the influence of spectral resolution on parameter uncertainty, we simulated leaf reflectance as observed by ten common remote sensing platforms with varying spectral configurations and performed a Bayesian inversion on the resulting spectra. We found that full-range hyperspectral platforms were able to retrieve all parameters accurately and precisely, while the parameter estimates of multispectral platforms were much less precise and prone to bias at high and low values. We also observed that variations in the width and location of spectral bands influenced the shape of the covariance structure of parameter estimates. Our Bayesian spectral inversion provides a powerful and versatile framework for future RTM development and single-and multi-instrumental remote sensing of vegetation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The connection of forest fragments through ecological corridors is an important step in biodiversity conservation. Certain areas are more resilient, and in those areas, natural forest regeneration, for example, can be encouraged. The aim of this study was to identify areas of greater resilience in order to support the connection of Atlantic Forest fragments with ecological corridors. Forest fragments in the municipality of Paraiba do Sul, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, were mapped using the supervised maximum likelihood classification of an Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Landsat-8 sensor image. Next, we analyzed the influence of terrain attributes (aspect, incident solar radiation, slope, and curvature profile) on natural regeneration. The areas with the greatest potential to achieve natural regeneration and to form ecological corridors were indicated through fuzzy membership functions. Within Paraiba do Sul, 31% of the territory is covered by vegetation in different stages of regeneration. Recordings were made of 1,251 forest fragments in a middle or advanced stage of regeneration. These fragments are usually situated in the southeast, south, and southwest aspects, in areas that receive the least amount of global solar radiation (Wh.m(-2)) per year, and on slopes with an angle of inclination greater than 20%. The adjustment of fuzzy functions identified 17,327.5 ha with a tendency to recover, and which are therefore strategic areas in the development of ecological corridors.																	0100-6762					SEP-OCT	2016	40	5					803	813		10.1590/0100-67622016000500004								WOS:000391439500004						
J	Walther, BA				Walther, Bruno A.			A review of recent ecological changes in the Sahel, with particular reference to land-use change, plants, birds and mammals	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												This review focuses on recent ecological changes in the Sahel. While other recent reviews focused mainly on agricultural changes, remote sensing, and the evolution and distribution of biodiversity, no review focused on ecological changes over time although these changes needed to be summarized to better understand the recent and often dramatic species declines across the Sahel during the last half century. Therefore, I conducted a literature review to summarize these changes, in particular changes to (i) land-use and land-cover, (ii) wetlands, (iii) plants, (iv) birds, especially large and migratory birds and (v) large mammals. The main conclusion is that the exceptionally severe Sahel drought in the late 20th century was extremely detrimental to both human society and nature, but thereafter, rainfall, agricultural productivity and human welfare increased again. As human populations and their ecological footprint increased dramatically, the Sahel's biodiversity continued to become more and more impoverished, whereby woody vegetation, migratory birds, and large birds and mammals suffered particularly severe declines. Besides the agricultural expansion, the other main reasons for these declines are wetland conversions, increased fire frequency, overharvesting, persecution, poisoning and death caused by human artefacts and disturbance. More effective protected areas are urgently needed, which could also generate much needed tourism revenue.																	0141-6707	1365-2028				SEP	2016	54	3					268	280		10.1111/aje.12350								WOS:000388181700002

For this, PAs can be characterized according to their species, ecosystems and threats, but such information is often difficult to access and usually not comparable across regions. There are currently over 200,000 PAs in the world, and assessing these systematically according to their ecological values remains a huge challenge. However, linking remote sensing with ecological modelling can help to overcome some limitations of conservation studies, such as the sampling bias of biodiversity inventories. The aim of this paper is to introduce eHabitat+, a habitat modelling service supporting the European Commission's Digital Observatory for Protected Areas, and specifically to discuss a component that systematically stratifies PAs into different habitat functional types based on remote sensing data. eHabitat+ uses an optimized procedure of automatic image segmentation based on several environmental variables to identify the main biophysical gradients in each PA. This allows a systematic production of key indicators on PAs that can be compared globally. Results from a few case studies are illustrated to show the benefits and limitations of this open-source tool.

Despite its potential to profoundly alter ecosystem carbon and water cycles, how tree mortality scales up to ecosystem functions and fluxes is uncertain. We describe a framework for this scaling where the effects of mortality are a function of the mortality attributes, such as spatial clustering and functional role of the trees killed, and ecosystem properties, such as productivity and diversity. We draw upon remote-sensing data and ecosystem flux data to illustrate this framework and place climate-driven tree mortality in the context of other major disturbances. We find that emerging evidence suggests that climate-driven tree mortality impacts may be relatively small and recovery times are remarkably fast (similar to 4 years for net ecosystem production). We review the key processes in ecosystem models necessary to simulate the effects of mortality on ecosystem fluxes and highlight key research gaps in modeling. Overall, our results highlight the key axes of variation needed for better monitoring and modeling of the impacts of tree mortality and provide a foundation for including climate-driven tree mortality in a disturbance framework.

Mapping of land cover in northern California with simulated hyperspectral satellite imagery	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Land-cover maps are important science products needed for natural resource and ecosystem service management, biodiversity conservation planning, and assessing human-induced and natural drivers of land change. Analysis of hyperspectral, or imaging spectrometer, imagery has shown an impressive capacity to map a wide range of natural and anthropogenic land cover. Applications have been mostly with single-date imagery from relatively small spatial extents. Future hyperspectral satellites will provide imagery at greater spatial and temporal scales, and there is a need to assess techniques for mapping land cover with these data. Here we used simulated multi-temporal HyspIRI satellite imagery over a 30,000 km(2) area in the San Francisco Bay Area, California to assess its capabilities for mapping classes defined by the international Land Cover Classification System (LCCS). We employed a mapping methodology and analysis framework that is applicable to regional and global scales. We used the Random Forests classifier with three sets of predictor variables (reflectance, MNF, hyperspectral metrics), two temporal resolutions (summer, spring-summer-fall), two sample scales (pixel, polygon) and two levels of classification complexity (12, 20 classes). Hyperspectral metrics provided a 16.4-21.8% and 3.1-6.7% increase in overall accuracy relative to MNF and reflectance bands, respectively, depending on pixel or polygon scales of analysis. Multi-temporal metrics improved overall accuracy by 0.9-3.1% over summer metrics, yet increases were only significant at the pixel scale of analysis. Overall accuracy at pixel scales was 72.2% (Kappa 0.70) with three seasons of metrics. Anthropogenic and homogenous natural vegetation classes had relatively high confidence and producer and user accuracies were over 70%; in comparison, woodland and forest classes had considerable confusion. We next focused on plant functional types with relatively pure spectra by removing open-canopy shrublands, woodlands and mixed forests from the classification. This 12-class map had significantly improved accuracy of 85.1% (Kappa 0.83) and most classes had over 70% producer and user accuracies. Finally, we summarized important metrics from the multi-temporal Random Forests to infer the underlying chemical and structural properties that best discriminated our land-cover classes across seasons.

Even for narrow swath sensors like Landsat TM/ETM+, the influence of reflectance anisotropy can be sufficiently strong to introduce a cross track reflectance gradient. If the BRDF could be assumed to be linear for the limited swath of Landsat, it would be possible to remove this gradient during image preprocessing using a simple empirical method. However, the existence of natural gradients in reflectance caused by spatial variation in floristic composition of the forest can restrict the applicability of such simple corrections. Here we use floristic information over Peruvian and Brazilian Amazonia acquired through field surveys, complemented with information from geological maps, to investigate the interaction of real floristic gradients and the effect of reflectance anisotropy on the observed reflectances in Landsat data. In addition, we test the assumption of linearity of the BRDF for a limited swath width, and whether different primary non-inundated forest types are characterized by different magnitudes of the directional reflectance gradient. Our results show that a linear function is adequate to empirically correct for view angle effects, and that the magnitude of the across-track reflectance gradient is independent of floristic composition in the non-inundated forests we studied. This makes a routine correction of view angle effects possible. However, floristic variation complicates the issue, because different forest types have different mean reflectances. This must be taken into account when deriving the correction function in order to avoid eliminating natural gradients. (C) 2016 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

RS can describe what a site looks like and how it behaves (using time series), but is unable to distinguish anthropogenic impacts from natural dynamics. Consequently, it is possible to mistake a heavily degraded habitat for a natural habitat, for example a logged forest may appear identical to an intact open woodland. This problem is compounded by the existence of multiple natural states in any given environment, and spatial variation in the natural composition and structure of vegetation as a function of variation in environment. Uncertainty in assessing habitat condition from RS is often further exacerbated by sparseness in the spatial coverage of training data. We describe a novel generic, RS-based algorithm called Habitat Condition Assessment System, designed to address the above sources of uncertainty and to be highly flexible in its application. It allows for variability in the definition of condition and in the type and quantity of input data employed. Here, we demonstrate the mechanics of the new algorithm in a simple worked example and its practical application in a case study using inferred natural-only' reference data, reflective remotely sensed data, and associated environmental data, to map condition for Australia at a 001 degrees resolution. We assess the behaviour and shortcomings of the method, and compare the national case study with estimates from two existing national data sets, and field measured condition data observed at 16967 sites across the State of Victoria. The modelled predictions outperform both of the existing national data sets, explaining 52% of the variability in field observations for well-sampled cells (relative to 8% and 12% for the existing products). The methodology can potentially address some of the key pitfalls of condition modelling and could be applied in other regions with sufficient coverage of reference data. The approach also has good potential to be extended to work with reference data for which condition is measured on a continuous scale, for example from field-based condition assessment initiatives.

The relationship between species richness and climatic variables of rainfall and temperature is explored based on species data collected from the field over a 3 year period and climate data collected from four local weather stations. Relationship between NDWI and species diversity indices is examined to confirm the usefulness of Remote Sensing in predicting vegetative diversity. The resultant predictive model was used to estimate changes in species richness over a 27 year period (1987-2014). The species diversity data was then regressed with climatic data for the same period. The results show a significant (P<0.05) correlation between species diversity and the two climatic variables. The results also indicate that there is a significant positive (P=0.0001; alpha=0.05; R-2=0.565) relationship between species richness and NDWI. This implies that the NDWI is essential when assessing changes in species diversity over time. The Mann Kendall test revealed a decrease, though not statistically significant, in the rainfall received within the catchment over the period and significant variability. The minimum and maximum temperatures over the period were significantly increasing. These changes in climate variables were matched with a decrease in species richness. Some species tend to be succumbing to the environmental changes influenced by climate change resulting in their changes in phenology, abundance and distribution.																	2225-8531					SEP	2016	5	2					244	268		10.4314/sajg.v5i2.11								WOS:000382877700012

Rapid conservation assessment for endangered species using habitat connectivity models	ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION												To avoid extinction of rare species in regions of active environmental change, strategic approaches are needed to manage remaining habitat. When observations of dispersal or metapopulation information are not available, habitat connectivity simulations may offer a valuable alternative source of information to assess threats and evaluate conservation options. For the Critically Endangered San Martin titi monkey (Callicebus oenanthe) in north central Peru, an updated distribution model was generated and land cover in the heavily deforested northern range of the species was mapped. The value of remaining forest fragments was characterized and threats from future land use change were assessed using complementary connectivity models. It is estimated that the species range is less than 14 000 km(2). Remote sensing analysis reveals that at least 34% of lowland forest in the northern range has been lost, while nearly 95% of remaining habitat fragments are likely too small to support viable populations and less than 8% of this habitat lies within conservation areas. Areas with the highest modelled connectivity comprise only10% of the remaining forest in the northern range and small patches may contribute disproportionately to movement; these lands represent opportunities for conservation and reforestation to prevent potentially significant impacts from future mining and urban development. This study prioritized remaining suitable habitat patches using modelled connectivity and local knowledge to gain insight into the status of an understudied species. This approach offers a relatively rapid method to identify potential land use conflicts, and to further focus research and locally appropriate conservation.

As marine ecosystems degrade, so do the well-being and livelihoods of humans that depend directly on the ecosystem goods and services they provide. Marine protected areas have been proposed to protect biodiversity, restore damaged ecosystems, sustain fisheries, and rebuild overexploited stocks. The effectiveness of marine protected areas depends in part on their effectiveness as connected networks, linked over large areas by ecological processes such as larval dispersal. Here, we applied a biophysical model driven by ocean currents derived from satellite altimetry to evaluate connectivity between Western Indian Ocean reefs. We applied graph-theoretic analysis, including clustering and a betweenness centrality metric. Our results show high interconnectivity within several regions (Mozambique Channel, Mascarene archipelago) and lower connectivity across the WIO region. We compared the results with the current MPA network, and proposed sites/reefs that should be considered priority sites for MPA implementation: Pebane, Cosmoledo, Majunga, Masoarivo, Platte Island, Farquhar, Agalega and Geyser bank. Our results are timely, considering the oil and gas exploration that is ongoing in the region. We discuss implications for transboundary marine policies and regional cooperation in the Western Indian Ocean, and advocate the creation of a regional-scale organization to structure interactions among the different actors.

The aim of this study was to create a detailed map of land use land cover of the deforested areas of the Brazilian Legal Amazon up to 2008. Deforestation data from and uses were mapped with Landsat-5/TM images analysed with techniques, such as linear spectral mixture model, threshold slicing and visual interpretation, aided by temporal information extracted from NDVI MODIS time series. The result is a high spatial resolution of land use and land cover map of the entire Brazilian Legal Amazon for the year 2008 and corresponding calculation of area occupied by different land use classes. The results showed that the four classes of Pasture covered 62% of the deforested areas of the Brazilian Legal Amazon, followed by Secondary Vegetation with 21%. The area occupied by Annual Agriculture covered less than 5% of deforested areas; the remaining areas were distributed among six other land use classes.

Spatially-explicit models of global tree density	SCIENTIFIC DATA												Remote sensing and geographic analysis of woody vegetation provide means of evaluating the distribution of natural resources, patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem structure, and socio-economic drivers of resource utilization. While these methods bring geographic datasets with global coverage into our day-to-day analytic spheres, many of the studies that rely on these strategies do not capitalize on the extensive collection of existing field data. We present the methods and maps associated with the first spatially-explicit models of global tree density, which relied on over 420,000 forest inventory field plots from around the world. This research is the result of a collaborative effort engaging over 20 scientists and institutions, and capitalizes on an array of analytical strategies. Our spatial data products offer precise estimates of the number of trees at global and biome scales, but should not be used for local-level estimation. At larger scales, these datasets can contribute valuable insight into resource management, ecological modelling efforts, and the quantification of ecosystem services.

Remotely Sensed Data Informs Red List Evaluations and Conservation Priorities in Southeast Asia	PLOS ONE												The IUCN Red List has assessed the global distributions of the majority of the world's amphibians, birds and mammals. Yet these assessments lack explicit reference to widely available, remotely-sensed data that can sensibly inform a species' risk of extinction. Our first goal is to add additional quantitative data to the existing standardised process that IUCN employs. Secondly, we ask: do our results suggest species of concern-those at considerably greater risk than hitherto appreciated? Thirdly, these assessments are not only important on a species-by-species basis. By combining distributions of species of concern, we map conservation priorities. We ask to what degree these areas are currently protected and how might knowledge from remote sensing modify the priorities? Finally, we develop a quick and simple method to identify and modify the priority setting in a landscape where natural habitats are disappearing rapidly and so where conventional species' assessments might be too slow to respond. Tropical, mainland Southeast Asia is under exceptional threat, yet relatively poorly known. Here, additional quantitative measures may be particularly helpful. This region contains over 122, 183, and 214 endemic mammals, birds, and amphibians, respectively, of which the IUCN considers 37, 21, and 37 threatened. When corrected for the amount of remaining natural habitats within the known elevation preferences of species, the average sizes of species ranges shrink to < 40% of their published ranges. Some 79 mammal, 49 bird, and 184 amphibian ranges are < 20,000km(2)-an area at which IUCN considers most other species to be threatened. Moreover, these species are not better protected by the existing network of protected areas than are species that IUCN accepts as threatened. Simply, there appear to be considerably more species at risk than hitherto appreciated. Furthermore, incorporating remote sensing data showing where habitat loss is prevalent changes the locations of conservation priorities.

John			A forest structure habitat index based on airborne laser scanning data	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Most efforts to link remote sensing to species distributions and movement have focused on indirect estimates of traits based on components of physiological and functional biodiversity. Such a view reflects one perspective on the general needs (habitat) of species. However, information on the vertical and horizontal structure of habitat may play a critical role in defining what a suitable habitat is. The development and application of highly accurate airborne laser scanning (ALS) systems, which are capable of describing the three-dimensional distribution of vegetation, have significant potential value in deriving quantitative relationships between species distributions and their habitat structure. In this paper we review the use of ALS for biodiversity studies, and propose a three-dimensional index which captures the three main components of vertical and horizontal vegetation structure: height, cover, and complexity. Once developed, we apply the index across the forested area of the Canadian province of Alberta, and compare and contrast the differences across natural subregions and land cover types. We also demonstrate how the index can be used with biodiversity data, in this case examining patterns in avian species richness. We conclude with a discussion on the potential use of the habitat structure index with other biodiversity-related research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Regulating Ecosystem Services of forests in ten Italian Metropolitan Cities: Air quality improvement by PM10 and O-3 removal	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Urban and periurban forests, which are integrated within the concept of Green Infrastructure, provide important Ecosystem Services, including air purification. In this study, we quantified the Ecosystem Service of particulate matter (PM10) and Ozone (0(3)) removal from urban and periurban forests in ten metropolitan cities in Italy, and its total monetary value. In order to gain a better understanding of how Ecosystem Services can be regulated on a wider scale, the vegetation ecosystem types were grouped into Physiognomic-Structural Categories of Vegetation according to morphofunctional criteria. The pollution removal was mapped using a remote sensing and GIS approach, by applying a deposition model and a stomatal flux model. We estimated, for the ten metropolitan cities, an overall pollution abatement of 7150 Mg of PM10 and 30,014 Mg of 0(3) in the year 2003, which was an extremely hot year. Our findings indicate that structural characteristics (i.e. Leaf Area Index) and functional diversity, linked to stomatal conductance, exert a marked influence on the provision of the regulating Ecosystem Services, whose total monetary value was estimated to be equal to 47 and 297 million USD for PM10 and 0(3) removal, respectively. This study represent the first national-scale assessment of the Ecosystem Services of air pollution removal in Europe, thus providing information that may be useful to stakeholders to manage Green Infrastructure more efficiently.

However, many ecosystem maps in tropical countries consist of discrete polygons containing information on various ecosystem properties such as vegetation cover, soil, climate, geomorphology and biodiversity. The combination of these properties into one class leads to error. We propose a probability-based sampling design with two domains, multiple stages, and stratification with selection of primary sampling units (PSUs) proportional to the richness of strata present. Validation is undertaken through field visits and fine resolution remote sensing data. A pilot site in the center of the Colombian Andes was chosen to validate a government official ecosystem map. Twenty primary sampling units (PSUs) of 10 x 15 km were selected, and the final numbers of final sampling units (FSUs) were 76 for the terrestrial domain and 46 for the aquatic domain. Our results showed a confidence level of 95%, with the accuracy in the terrestrial domain varying between 51.8% and 64.3% and in the aquatic domain varying between 75% and 92%. Governments need to account for uncertainty since they rely on the quality of these maps to make decisions and guide policies.

However, the reproducibility of remote sensing methods for discriminating and mapping mangrove habitats is often overstated due to the lack of temporal observations. Here, we investigated the potential use of temporal series of high-resolution multispectral satellite images to discriminate and map four typical Asian ZMS. This study was based on the analysis of eight images acquired between 2001 and 2014 over the mangrove area of Nusa Lembongan, Bali, Indonesia. Variations between years in the top-of-atmosphere reflectance signatures were examined as functions of the acquisition angles. We also applied maximum likelihood supervised classification to all of the images and determined the variability in the classification errors. We found that the distinction between spectral signatures of ZMS characterized by a close canopy was fairly independent of the season and sensor characteristics. By contrast, the variability in the multispectral signatures of ZMS with open canopies and associated classification errors could be attributed to variability in ground surface scattering. In both cases, sun-viewing geometry could alter the separability between ZMS classes in near-nadir viewing or frontward sun-viewing configurations, thereby explaining why the overall accuracy of ZMS classification might vary from 65% to 80%. Thus, multitemporal analysis is an important stage in the development of robust methods for ZMS mapping. It must be supported by physical-based research aiming to quantify the influences of canopy structure, species composition, ground surface properties, and viewing geometry parameters on ZMS multispectral signatures.

Unlike ecologically driven approaches that require spatially and temporally co-located training data of the specific species, we tested whether indicative information on the habitat potential could be obtained by means of an unsupervised classification of ALS data. Based on a literature review, altogether five ALS features quantifying vegetation height, cover and diversity were expected to capture the essential variation in the habitat requirements of western capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus L.) and hazel grouse (Tetrastes bonasia L.), which are the most important game birds occurring in the studied area. The features were extracted from sparse density, leaf-off ALS data at a resolution of 256 m(2) and partitioned using an unsupervised k-means algorithm. By analysing the persistence of the cluster ensemble formed by the partitioning, altogether 158 plots in 16 structural classes were assigned for field measurements to determine which real-world forest phenomena affected the clustering. The clustering was found to stratify the area mainly in terms of size-related attributes such as timber volume and basal area. The understorey, shrub and herb layers had less correspondence with the clustering, indicating that an unsupervised classification is not directly suitable for habitat mapping. The result was improved using empirical threshold values for the ALS features determined according to the plots labelled as the most potential habitats in the field measurements. This semi-supervised classification of the data indicated 4 per cent of the total forest area as suitable for the specific species, which appears a reasonable estimate of the core area of the habitats considered. Overall, the partitioning formed aggregated, stand-like spatial patterns, even though the neighbourhoods of the individual 256 m(2) cells were not considered at all. The result could be further refined by spatial optimization to produce indicative maps for forest management planning with ALS as the sole data source.

J	Valbuena, R; Maltamo, M; Packalen, P				Valbuena, Ruben; Maltamo, Matti; Packalen, Petteri			Classification of multilayered forest development classes from low-density national airborne lidar datasets	FORESTRY												Compared with traditional inventory methods based on field plot sampling, airborne laser scanning (ALS) has the potential to assess forest structural properties with greater detail over space and time and at lower cost. Many national ALS survey programmes covering entire countries for topographic mapping are currently in progress and some have provided data that are in the public domain. Although the point density of these datasets is relatively low, there is an interest in developing methods that employ these types of data for categorizing different approaches to forest management. Using Finnish national ALS data with a point density of 0.91 pulses per square metre, we carried out a classification of 252 000 ha of boreal forests into silvicultural development classes (DC) used in practical forest management. Taking into account all eight DCs, the overall accuracy was 74.1 per cent and kappa = 0.70. We conclude that the dataset is adequate for discriminating multilayered forests from even-aged ones. This result was compared with a method based on mathematical rules, which succeeded in discriminating multilayered stands with regeneration of shade-intolerant species without the need of field data for training. However, the low point density may hamper the detection of shade-tolerant understories in mature high forests with closed canopies. We, therefore, recommend the use of this supervised classification in the presence of shade-tolerant species.

They are characterised by heterogeneity in forest management practices dating back to the socialist planned economy of the pre-1991 era. In this study we investigated the difference in rates of deforestation and reforestation in private- and state-owned forests during the post-socialist period and the causal drivers of change. The selected region of Northern Croatia is characterised by a high percentage of privately owned forests with minimal national monitoring and control. We used a mixed-methods approach which combines remote sensing, statistical modelling and a household-based questionnaire survey to assess the rates of forest cover change and factors influencing those changes. The results show that predominantly privately owned forests in Northern Croatia have recorded a net forest loss of 1.8 % during the 1991-2011 period, while Croatia overall is characterised by a 10 % forest cover increase in predominantly state-owned forests. Main factors influencing forest cover changes in private forests are slope, altitude, education structure, population age and population density. The results also show that the deforestation in private forests is weakening overall, mostly due to the continuation of the de-agrarisation and de-ruralisation processes which began during socialism.

This paper evaluates landscape change in savanna vegetation along Chobe Riverfront within Chobe National Park Botswana, from 1982 to 2011 to understand what change may be occurring in land cover. Classifying land cover in savanna environments is challenging because the vegetation spectral signatures are similar across distinct vegetation covers. With vegetation species and even structural groups having similar signatures in multispectral imagery difficulties exist in making discrete classifications in such landscapes. To address this issue, a Random Forest classification algorithm was applied to predict land-cover classes. Additionally, time series vegetation indices were used to support the findings of the discrete land cover classification. Results indicate that a landscape level vegetation shift has occurred across the Chobe Riverfront, with results highlighting a shift in land cover towards more woody vegetation. This represents a degradation of vegetation cover within this savanna landscape environment, largely due to an increasing number of elephants and other herbivores utilizing the Riverfront. The forested area along roads at a further distance from the River has also had a loss of percent cover. The continuous analysis during 1982-2011, utilizing monthly AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) values, also verifies this change in amount of vegetation is a continuous and ongoing process in this region. This study provides land use planners and managers with a more reliable, efficient and relatively inexpensive tool for analyzing land-cover change across these highly sensitive regions, and highlights the usefulness of a Random Forest classification in conjunction with time series analysis for monitoring savanna landscapes.																	2072-4292					AUG	2016	8	8							623	10.3390/rs8080623								WOS:000382458700010

In arid environments, these ecosystems represent key habitats, since water availability makes them unique in terms of fauna, flora and ecological processes. Simple yet powerful remote sensing techniques were used to assess how spatial and temporal land cover dynamics, and water depth reflect distribution of key land cover types in riparian areas. Our study area includes the San Miguel and Zanjon rivers in Northwest Mexico. We used a supervised classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm to produce thematic classifications (with accuracies higher than 78%) for 1993, 2002 and 2011 using Landsat TM scenes. Our results suggest a decline in agriculture (32.5% area decrease) and cultivated grasslands (21.1% area decrease) from 1993 to 2011 in the study area. We found constant fluctuation between adjacent land cover classes and riparian habitat. We also found that water depth restricts Riparian Vegetation distribution but not agricultural lands or induced grasslands. Using remote sensing combined with spatial analysis, we were able to reach a better understanding of how riparian habitats are being modified in arid environments and how they have changed through time.

U. europaeus is widely distributed in the south-central area of Chile, which is considered a world hotspot for biodiversity conservation. In addition to its negative effects on the biodiversity of natural ecosystems, U. europaeus is one of the most severe pests for agriculture and forestry. Despite its importance as an invasive species, U. europaeus has been little studied. Although information exists on the potential distribution of the species, the interaction of the invasion process with the spatial dynamic of the landscape and the landscape-scale factors that control the presence or absence of the species is still lacking. We studied the spatial and temporal dynamics of the landscape and how these relate to U. europaeus invasion in south-central Chile. We used supervised classification of satellite images to determine the spatial distribution of the species and other land covers for the years 1986 and 2003, analysing the transitions between the different land covers. We used logistic regression for modelling the increase, decrease and permanence of U. europaeus invasion considering landscape variables. Results showed that the species covers only around 1 % of the study area and showed a 42 % reduction in area for the studied period. However, U. europaeus was the cover type which presented the greatest dynamism in the landscape. We found a strong relationship between changes in land cover and the invasion process, especially connected with forest plantations of exotic species, which promotes the displacement of U. europaeus. The model of gorse cover increase presented the best performance, and the most important predictors were distance to seed source and landscape complexity index. Our model predicted high spread potential of U. europaeus in areas of high conservation value. We conclude that proper management for this invasive species must take into account the spatial dynamics of the landscape within the invaded area in order to address containment, control or mitigation of the invasion.

However, being a country with a large population and rapid economic development, its diverse forest is facing unprecedent challenges. The Chinese Forest Biodiversity Network (CForBio) was initiated 12 years ago to study the maintenance of biodiversity in China's forest ecosystems. In this review, we first summarize research progress in CForBio, and then give suggestions for future research. In the past 12 years, the research based on CForBio mainly focused on local ecological factors, such as environment filtering, biotic interactions and small-scale dispersal limitation. We suggest that future studies in CForBio should (1) continue research on trees, but expand more on insects, birds, mammals, microbes and other organism groups; (2) investigate the effects of widespread defaunation on forest biodiversity, structure and functioning; (3) evaluate the diverse effects of climate change on forest composition, structure and functioning; (4) include new technologies, such as remote sensing, to better monitor and study forest biodiversity change and maintenance.

Geospatial assessment of long-term changes in carbon stocks and fluxes in forests of India (1930-2013)	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												The present study has estimated spatial distribution of biomass carbon density from satellite remote sensing data, historical archives and collateral data from 1930 to 2013. The spatial forest canopy density datasets for 1930, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2013 were analysed to obtain biomass carbon pools at 5 km grid level. The overall loss of forest cover was 28% from 1930 to 2013. Analysis of change in the forest canopy density indicates that the dense forest cover reduced from 419,175 km(2) in 1975 to 390,966 km(2) in 2013. The total above ground biomass carbon stock of Indian forest was calculated as 3070.27 Tg C in 2013. Standing biomass carbon stocks varied significantly during different steps of time periods. There are a total 67,184 grid cells with loss of carbon stocks during 1930-1975 followed by 55,742 cells during 1975-1985. The annual carbon loss in the above ground biomass showed the highest decrease during the period of 1930 to 1975 and estimated as 2168.50 Tg C while the net annual loss of carbon is 48.19 Tg C. The maximum observed net annual loss of carbon stocks was 53.97 Tg C during 2005 to 2013. Carbon content for various states shows that maximum carbon stocks were stored in the forests of Arunachal Pradesh (11.27%) in 2013. State-wise change analysis indicates the highest loss of carbon stocks in Tripura (80.99%) from 1930 to 2013. Overall reduction in carbon stock in Indian forests has been estimated as 3079.98 Tg C (50.08%) from 1930 to 2013. The spatial characterization of distribution and changes in carbon stocks can provide useful information for planning and strategic management of resources and fulfilling global initiatives to conserve forest biodiversity.

J	Stotz, GC; Pec, GJ; Cahill, JF				Stotz, Gisela C.; Pec, Gregory J.; Cahill, James F.			Is biotic resistance to invaders dependent upon local environmental conditions or primary productivity? A meta-analysis	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												Biotic resistance is an important component to limiting the spread of invasive plants into native communities. However, under certain conditions native plants may also facilitate invasion, a process identified as biotic assistance. Identifying the conditions that associate with resistance and assistance is needed to better understand the factors driving species invasion. Substantial theory and empirical work suggests net effects of neighbors may be dependent upon habitat productivity and environmental conditions. How that applies to the interaction among the resident community and the invaders is largely untested. Here we compiled data from 23 articles, which had experimentally determined the strength of biotic resistance and/or assistance. We then combined these data with remote-sensing estimates of productivity, precipitation and temperature at each study site, Using standard meta-analytical techniques we determined the overall effect resident communities had on the emergence, growth, reproduction and survival of non-native invaders. Further, we tested whether the interaction between resident communities and invasive species was influenced by primary productivity, temperature and precipitation. Across all sites, we found broad support for biotic resistance, while evidence for biotic assistance was rare. However, we found the relative magnitude of biotic resistance on invaders increased with temperature or precipitation; a pattern consistent with the stress gradient hypothesis. In contrast we found no evidence that the strength of biotic resistance varied as a function of primary productivity. Further evaluation of the relationship between productivity and environmental conditions on the direction and strength of the effect of resident species on invaders may help predict invasion establishment and success. Understanding or predicting the susceptibility of communities to invasion may help prioritize management efforts.

Conventional species-based, regional biodiversity assessments are rarely adequate for policy planning and decision making. We show how new ground and remotely sensed survey methods can be coordinated to help elucidate and predict relationships between biodiversity, land use and soil properties along complex biophysical gradients that typify many similar landscapes worldwide. In the lower Zambezi valley, Mozambique we used environmental, gradient directed transects (gradsects) to sample vascular plant species, plant functional types, vegetation structure, soil properties and land-use characteristics. Soil fertility indices were derived using novel multidimensional scaling of soil properties. To facilitate spatial analysis, we applied a probabilistic remote sensing approach, analyzing Landsat 7 satellite imagery to map photosynthetically active and inactive vegetation and bare soil along each gradsect. Despite the relatively low sample number, we found highly significant correlations between single and combined sets of specific plant, soil and remotely sensed variables that permitted testable spatial projections of biodiversity and soil fertility across the regional land-use mosaic. This integrative and rapid approach provides a low-cost, high-return and readily transferable methodology that permits the ready identification of testable biodiversity indicators for adaptive management of biodiversity and potential agricultural productivity.

In this study, we use Landsat data to explore the relationship between vegetation structure and forest management institutions, in order to assess the efficacy of local institutions in management of forests outside protected areas. These forests form part of an important tiger corridor in Eastern Maharashtra, India. We assessed forest condition using 450 randomly placed 10 m radius circular plots in forest patches of villages with and without local institutions, to understand the impact of these institutions on forest vegetation. Tree density and species richness were significantly different between villages with and without local forest institutions, but there was no difference in tree biomass. We also found a significant difference in the relationship between tree density and NDVI between villages with and without local forest institutions. However, the relationship between species richness and NDVI did not differ significantly. The methods proposed by this study evaluate the status of forest management in a forest corridor using remotely sensed data and could be effectively used to identify the extent of vegetation health and management status.

However, scholars used to measure human activity by social, economic and humanistic indexes. These indexes cannot directly reflect human activity and are not suitable for fine-grained analysis due to the coarse spatial resolution. In view of the above problems, this paper proposes a method that obtains the intensity of human activity from GPS trajectory data, collects landscape information from remote sensing images and further analyzes the interaction between human activity and landscape pattern at a fine-grained scale. The Lijiang River Basin is selected as the study area. Experimental results show that human activity and landscape pattern interact synergistically in this area. Built-up land and water boost human activity, while woodland restrains human activity. The effect of human activity on landscape pattern differs by the land cover category. Overall, human activities make natural land, such as woodland and water, scattered and fragmented, but cause man-built land, such as built-up land and farmland, clustered and regular. Nevertheless, human activities inside and outside urban areas are the opposite. The research findings in this paper are helpful for designing and implementing sustainable management plans.

However, the influence of these management practices on hydrodynamics and biodiversity remains poorly understood. This study assesses advantages of using radar data from the recently launched Sentinel-1A satellite to monitor hydrological dynamics of the Poitevin marshland in western France. We analyze a time series of 14 radar images acquired in VV and HV polarizations from December 2014 to May 2015 with a 12-day time step. Both polarizations are used with a hysteresis thresholding algorithm which uses both spatial and temporal information to distinguish open water, flooded vegetation and non-flooded grassland. Classification results are compared to in situ piezometric measurements combined with a Digital Terrain Model derived from LiDAR data. Results reveal that open water is successfully detected, whereas flooded grasslands with emergent vegetation and fine-grained patterns are detected with moderate accuracy. Five hydrological regimes are derived from the flood duration and mapped. Analysis of time steps in the time series shows that decreased temporal repetitivity induces significant differences in estimates of flood duration. These results illustrate the great potential to monitor variations in seasonal floods with the high temporal frequency of Sentinel-1A acquisitions.

In this regard, summer temperatures have become a parameter of essential interest under a framework of a hypothetical increase in the number of intense-heat conditions. Thus, their forecast is a crucial aspect bearing in mind a mitigation of the effects and impacts that these intense-heat situations could produce. The current work tries to reach a better understanding of these sorts of situations that are really common over theWestern Mediterranean coast. An extreme heat episode that took place in the Valencia Region in July 2009 is analysed, based on the simulations performed with the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS). This event recorded maximum temperatures exceeding 40 degrees C amply extended over the region besides reaching minimum temperatures up to 25.92 degrees C. We examine the role of improved skin and soil temperature (ST) initial conditions in the forecast results by means of different modelling and satellite-derived products. The influence of incorporating the Land Surface Temperature (LST) into RAMS is not found to produce a meaningful impact on the simulation results, independently of the resolution of the dataset used in the initial conditions of the model. In contrast, the introduction of the ST in lower levels, not only the skin temperature, has a more marked decisive effect in the simulation. Additionally, we have evaluated the influence of increasing the number of soil levels to spread deeper underground. This sensitivity experiment has revealed that more soil levels do not produce any meaningful impact on the simulation compared to the original one. In any case, RAMS is able to properly capture the observed patterns in those cases where a Western advection is widely extended over the area of study. This region's variability in orography and in distances to the sea promotes the development of sea-breeze circulations, thus producing a convergence of two opposite wind flows, a Western synoptic advection and a sea-breeze circulation. As a result, the RAMS skill in those cases where a sea breeze is well developed depends on the proper location of the boundary and convergence lines of these two flows.

Satellite remote sensing provides the only means for mapping global forest cover regularly. However, forest classification with optical data is limited by its insensitivity to three-dimensional canopy structure and cloud cover obscuring many forest regions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors are increasingly being used to mitigate these problems, mainly in the L-, C-and X-band domains of the electromagnetic spectrum. S-band has not been systematically studied for this purpose. In anticipation of the British built NovaSAR-S satellite mission, this study evaluates the benefits of polarimetric S-band SAR for forest characterisation. The Michigan Microwave Canopy Scattering (MIMICS-I) radiative transfer model is utilised to understand the scattering mechanisms in forest canopies at S-band. The MIMICS-I model reveals strong S-band backscatter sensitivity to the forest canopy in comparison to soil characteristics across all polarisations and incidence angles. Airborne S-band SAR imagery over the temperate mixed forest of Savernake Forest in southern England is analysed for its information content. Based on the modelling results, S-band HH- and VV-polarisation radar backscatter and the Radar Forest Degradation Index (RFDI) are used in a forest/non-forest Maximum Likelihood classification at a spatial resolution of 6 m (70% overall accuracy, kappa = 0.41) and 20 m (63% overall accuracy, kappa = 0.27). The conclusion is that S-band SAR such as from NovaSAR-S is likely to be suitable for monitoring forest cover and its changes.

Seascapes as a new vernacular for pelagic ocean monitoring, management and conservation	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												For terrestrial and marine benthic ecologists, landscape ecology provides a framework to address issues of complexity, patchiness, and scale-providing theory and context for ecosystem based management in a changing climate. Marine pelagic ecosystems are likewise changing in response to warming, changing chemistry, and resource exploitation. However, unlike spatial landscapes that migrate slowly with time, pelagic seascapes are embedded in a turbulent, advective ocean. Adaptations from landscape ecology to marine pelagic ecosystem management must consider the nature and scale of biophysical interactions associated with organisms ranging from microbes to whales, a hierarchical organization shaped by physical processes, and our limited capacity to observe and monitor these phenomena across global oceans. High frequency, multiscale, and synoptic characterization of the 4-D variability of seascapes are now available through improved classification methods, a maturing array of satellite remote sensing products, advances in autonomous sampling of multiple levels of biological complexity, and emergence of observational networks. Merging of oceanographic and ecological paradigms will be necessary to observe, manage, and conserve species embedded in a dynamic seascape mosaic, where the boundaries, extent, and location of features change with time.

Barrier effects of roads on an endangered forest obligate: influences of traffic, road edges, and gaps	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Habitat fragmentation and destruction caused by development of infrastructure such as roads threaten biodiversity. Roads act as barriers by impeding animal movements and restricting space use. Understanding factors that influence barrier effects is important to discern the impacts of habitat fragmentation and to develop appropriate mitigations. We combined telemetry and demographic data in 2008 to 2012 with remote sensing imagery to investigate barrier effects of forest roads and assess effects of traffic, road edges, and canopy gaps on space use of an endangered, endemic forest obligate, the Mt. Graham red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus grahamensis). We mapped low to high traffic roads, road edges, canopy gaps, and random lines in forests to serve as references. We determined if red squirrels included these linear features in their total and core home ranges, and used this metric as an indicator of crossing and preference for habitat adjacent to the linear features. Forest roads acted as barriers regardless of traffic volume and had long-term impacts on animal space use. Animals did not avoid entering roadside areas, and probability of crossing linear features in the forest was not affected by distance to roads. In contrast, greater canopy cover increased probability of crossing, and gaps in canopy impeded animal movements. Higher likelihood of road crossing was associated with more variable tree height and mating activity. We demonstrated that narrow forest roads with low traffic volume were barriers for forest dependent species, and suggest that gap avoidance inhibits road crossings.

Coupling Satellite Data with Species Distribution and Connectivity Models as a Tool for Environmental Management and Planning in Matrix-Sensitive Species	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Climate change and anthropogenic habitat fragmentation are considered major threats for global biodiversity. As a direct consequence, connectivity is increasingly disrupted in many species, which might have serious consequences that could ultimately lead to the extinction of populations. Although a large number of reserves and conservation sites are designated and protected by law, potential habitats acting as inter-population connectivity corridors are, however, mostly ignored in the common practice of environmental planning. In most cases, this is mainly caused by a lack of quantitative measures of functional connectivity available for the planning process. In this study, we highlight the use of fine-scale potential connectivity models (PCMs) derived from multispectral satellite data for the quantification of spatially explicit habitat corridors for matrix-sensitive species of conservation concern. This framework couples a species distribution model with a connectivity model in a two-step framework, where suitability maps from step 1 are transformed into maps of landscape resistance in step 2 filtered by fragmentation thresholds. We illustrate the approach using the sand lizard (Lacerta agilis L.) in the metropolitan area of Cologne, Germany, as a case study. Our model proved to be well suited to identify connected as well as completely isolated populations within the study area. Furthermore, due to its fine resolution, the PCM was also able to detect small linear structures known to be important for sand lizards' inter-population connectivity such as railroad embankments. We discuss the applicability and possible implementation of PCMs to overcome shortcomings in the common practice of environmental impact assessments.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				JUL	2016	58	1					130	143		10.1007/s00267-016-0698-y								WOS:000379159600010	27094442

Choice of baseline climate data impacts projected species' responses to climate change	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Climate data created from historic climate observations are integral to most assessments of potential climate change impacts, and frequently comprise the baseline period used to infer species-climate relationships. They are often also central to downscaling coarse resolution climate simulations from General Circulation Models (GCMs) to project future climate scenarios at ecologically relevant spatial scales. Uncertainty in these baseline data can be large, particularly where weather observations are sparse and climate dynamics are complex (e.g. over mountainous or coastal regions). Yet, importantly, this uncertainty is almost universally overlooked when assessing potential responses of species to climate change. Here, we assessed the importance of historic baseline climate uncertainty for projections of species' responses to future climate change. We built species distribution models (SDMs) for 895 African bird species of conservation concern, using six different climate baselines. We projected these models to two future periods (2040-2069, 2070-2099), using downscaled climate projections, and calculated species turnover and changes in species-specific climate suitability. We found that the choice of baseline climate data constituted an important source of uncertainty in projections of both species turnover and species-specific climate suitability, often comparable with, or more important than, uncertainty arising from the choice of GCM. Importantly, the relative contribution of these factors to projection uncertainty varied spatially. Moreover, when projecting SDMs to sites of biodiversity importance (Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas), these uncertainties altered site-level impacts, which could affect conservation prioritization. Our results highlight that projections of species' responses to climate change are sensitive to uncertainty in the baseline climatology. We recommend that this should be considered routinely in such analyses.																	1354-1013	1365-2486				JUL	2016	22	7					2392	2404		10.1111/gcb.13273								WOS:000378722000009	26950769

These impacts are greatly understudied, especially in biodiversity rich mountains in East Africa. The objectives of this study were to: conduct a biophysical baseline of soil and land health; assess the effects of cultivation on soil organic carbon (SOC); and develop a map of SOC at high resolution to enable farm-scale targeting of management interventions. Biophysical field surveys were conducted in a 100 km 2 landscape near Lushoto, Tanzania, with composite soil samples collected from 160 sampling plots. Soil erosion prevalence was scored, trees were counted, and current and historic land use was recorded at each plot. The results of the study showed a decline in SOC as a result of cultivation, with cultivated plots (n = 105) having mean topsoil OC of 30.6 g kg(-1), while semi-natural plots (n = 55) had 71 g OC kg(-1) in topsoil. Cultivated areas were also less variable in SOC than seminatural systems. Prediction models were developed for the mapping of SOC based on RapidEye remote sensing data for January 2014, with good model performance (RMSEPcal = 8.0 g kg(-1); RMSEPval = 10.5 g kg(-1)) and a SOC map was generated for the study. Interventions will need to focus on practices that increase SOC in order to enhance productivity and resilience of the farming system, in general. The high-resolution maps can be used to spatially target interventions as well as for monitoring of changes in SOC.

A case study at Portofino MPA	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Baseline data on the distribution, condition and extent of coralligenous and cave bioconcretions is one of the main requirements of the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) necessary to assess the achievement of a Good Environmental Status (GES) by 2020. In this study the potential of remote sensing and distribution modelling techniques to map, measure descriptors and choose indicators were tested, that could provide standard methods for the assessment of the health status and assist in monitoring activities. It is demonstrated how, by combining different methodologies, it is possible to map the distribution of the bioconcretions with acceptable accuracy and to discriminate the main habitat types and fades. In addition, zonal statistical analysis revealed that fishing activities primarily coincide with areas of high coverage of the bioconcretions. Results demonstrate that the presented methodology is a valuable simple tool to assess several MSFD descriptors and indicators, and could strengthen management efficiency when making informed, ecologically relevant decisions.

Spatio-temporal changes of a mangrove-saltmarsh ecotone in the northeastern coast of Florida, USA	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												General circulation models predict warming trends and changes in temperature and precipitation patterns that have the potential to alter the structure and function of coastal habitats. The purpose of this study was to quantify the expansion and contraction of mangroves and saltmarsh habitats and assess the impact of climate on these landscape changes. The study was conducted in a mangrove/saltmarsh ecotone in Flagler County, FL, near the northern range limit of mangroves along the Atlantic coast of North America. We used time series of historical aerial photography and high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery from 1942 to 2013 to quantify changes in the extent of mangrove and saltmarsh vegetation and compared these changes to climate variables of temperature and precipitation, temperature-seasonality, as well as historical sea-level data. Results showed increases in mangrove extent of 89% between 1942 and 1952, and a continuous increase from 1995 to 2013. Largest decrease in saltmarsh extent occurred between 1942 and 1952 (-136%) and between 2008 and 2013 (-81%). We found significant effects of precipitation, temperature, seasonality, and time on mangrove and saltmarsh areal extent. The statistical effect of sea-level was rather small, but we speculate that it might have ecological impacts on these two coastal ecosystems. Results also showed a cyclical dynamism as well as a reversal in habitat dominance, which may be the result of complex interactions between plant habitats and several environmental drivers of change such as species interactions, and hydrological changes induced by sea-level rise, in addition to temperature and precipitation effects. Our results on mangrove/saltmarsh expansion and contraction may contribute to the improvement of management and conservation strategies for coastal ecosystems being impacted by climate change.

Integrating technologies for scalable ecology and conservation	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Integration of multiple technologies greatly increases the spatial and temporal scales over which ecological patterns and processes can be studied, and threats to protected ecosystems can be identified and mitigated. A range of technology options relevant to ecologists and conservation practitioners are described, including ways they can be linked to increase the dimensionality of data collection efforts. Remote sensing, ground-based, and data fusion technologies are broadly discussed in the context of ecological research and conservation efforts. Examples of technology integration across all of these domains are provided for large-scale protected area management and investigation of ecological dynamics. Most technologies are low-cost or open-source, and when deployed can reach economies of scale that reduce per-area costs dramatically. The large-scale, long-term data collection efforts presented here can generate new spatio-temporal understanding of threats faced by natural ecosystems and endangered species, leading to more effective conservation strategies.

LANDSCAPE MAPPING: GAINING "SENSE OF PLACE" FOR CONSERVATION IN THE MANASLU CONSERVATION AREA, NEPAL	JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY												Satellite mapping contributes significantly to ecological studies of landscape composition and structure but needs to better engage local populations in more culturally sensitive assessments of diversity patterns. This study examines how participatory mapping can contribute to land-cover analyses derived from satellite data of landscapes in the Manaslu Conservation Area (MCA), Nepal. Landscapes were mapped by local residents, first on paper and again on a geo-registered Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scene, for April 7, 2010. Local landscape knowledge from men and women was transferred from participatory maps to the classified satellite image to create an integrated landscape map for the MCA. Participatory maps added the significance of "place" to the evaluation of landscape diversity (n = 276 named places for women and 315 for men). The classification of the TM image resulted in seven land cover types with only 10% of the land classified as forests, which are highly fragmented. The final map combined local landscape knowledge (n = 43 places mapped on the TM image and n = 21 from the transect walks) with the empirical classification of land cover types, increasing the spatial understanding of MCA as a "place" of material use and cultural meaning. This integrative map, as process and outcome, promoted collaborative learning about local places and local peoples' perspectives on their landscape, which can contribute to more adaptive landscape planning and conservation of forest and livelihood resources.																	0278-0771	2162-4496				JUL	2016	36	2					326	347										WOS:000377540300006

Recent dam constructions on the Yangtze River and its tributaries for agriculture and hydroelectric power exert strong effects on the hydrological regimes of this lake. However, few studies have investigated how the land-use changes through time affect the habitat suitability for wintering Anseriformes-the largest community in this region. Thus, it is necessary to timely monitor changes in the habitat quality and understand the potential factors that alter it. In this study, three periods (1995, 2005 and 2014) of typical environmental indicators that have direct impacts on foraging and resting for the Anserformes, including proximity to water (density of lakes, rivers and ponds), human disturbances (density of residences and various road networks), preferred land cover types and food availability (NDVI), are integrated to develop a habitat suitability index model for habitat mapping. The results indicate that long-term lake shrinkage in low-water periods led to greatly expanded wetlands in these years, which provided more suitable habitat for migratory waterfowl. The amount of highly suitable habitat in 2014 was nearly twice as much as in 1995. Recent survey data from 1997 to 2013 also revealed an increase in the population size, and confirmed the improvement of habitat suitability in the Poyang Lake region. Spatial analysis revealed that land use changes contributed most to the improved habitat coverage between 1995 and 2014. However, the relative significances of these transformations for highly suitable and moderately suitable habitats are strikingly different. Increases in wetland and paddy field area are the main reasons for explaining these improvements, respectively. The framework model proposed in this study will help governments to evaluate habitat conservation and restoration for protecting waterbirds in a spatially explicit way. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Ecological Responses to Extreme Flooding Events: A Case Study with a Reintroduced Bird	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												In recent years numerous studies have documented the effects of a changing climate on the world's biodiversity. Although extreme weather events are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity and are challenging to organisms, there are few quantitative observations on the survival, behaviour and energy expenditure of animals during such events. We provide the first data on activity and energy expenditure of birds, Eurasian cranes Grus grus, during the winter of 2013-14, which saw the most severe floods in SW England in over 200 years. We fitted 23 cranes with telemetry devices and used remote sensing data to model flood dynamics during three consecutive winters (2012-2015). Our results show that during the acute phase of the 2013-14 floods, potential feeding areas decreased dramatically and cranes restricted their activity to a small partially unflooded area. They also increased energy expenditure (+15%) as they increased their foraging activity and reduced resting time. Survival did not decline in 2013-14, indicating that even though extreme climatic events strongly affected time-energy budgets, behavioural plasticity alleviated any potential impact on fitness. However under climate change scenarios such challenges may not be sustainable over longer periods and potentially could increase species vulnerability.

This process may play an important role in reducing fieldwork costs, monitoring changes in canopy biodiversity, and locating parent trees to collect seeds for forest restoration efforts. However, mapping tree species in tropical forests with remote sensing data is a challenge because of high floristic and spectral diversity. In this research, we discriminated and mapped tree species in tropical seasonal semi-deciduous forests (Brazilian Atlantic Forest Biome) by using airborne hyperspectral and simulated multispectral data in the 450 to 2400 nm wavelength range. After quantifying the spectral variability within and among individual tree crowns of eight species, three supervised machine learning classifiers were applied to discriminate the species at the pixel level. Linear Discriminant Analysis outperformed Support Vector Machines with Linear and Radial Basis Function (RBF-SVMs) kernels and Random Forests in almost all the tested cases. An average classification accuracy of 70% was obtained when using the visible/near-infrared (VNIR, 450-919 nm) bands. The inclusion of shortwave infrared bands (SWIR, 1045-2400 nm) increased the accuracy to 84%. Narrow-band vegetation indices (VIs) were also tested and increased the classification accuracy by up to 5% when combined with VNIR features. Furthermore, the spectral bands of the WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite sensor were simulated for classification purposes. WV-3 VNIR bands provided an accuracy of 57.4%, which increased to 74.8% when using WV-3 SWIR bands. We also tested the production of species maps by using an object-oriented approach that integrated a novel segmentation algorithm that was tailored to delineate tree crowns and label high class membership pixels inside each object. In this scenario, RBF-SVMs produced the best species maps, correctly identifying 84.9% of crowns with hyperspectral data and 78.5% with simulated WV-3 data. The use of a reduced set of hyperspectral bands, which were selected with stepwise regression, did not significantly affect the classification accuracies but allowed us to depict the most important wavelengths to discriminate the species. These wavelengths were located around the green reflectance peak (550 nm), at the red absorption feature (650 nm) and in the SWIR range at 1200,1700, 2100 and 2300 nm. These encouraging results suggest the feasibility of the proposed approach for mapping pioneering and climax tree species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest Biome, highlighting its potential use in forest recovery and inventory initiatives.

Strong anthropization, over-exploitation of natural resources, and climate change affect the natural amount of phytoplankton and, therefore, represent a continuous threat to the biodiversity in marine waters. In particular, a concerning risks for coastal waters is the increase in nutrient inputs of terrestrial/anthropogenic origin that can lead to undesirable modifications of phytoplankton concentration (i.e., eutrophication). Monitoring chlorophyll (Chl) concentration, which is a proxy of phytoplankton biomass, is an efficient tool for recording and understanding the response of the marine ecosystem to human pressures and thus for detecting eutrophication. Here, we compute Chl trends over the Mediterranean Sea by using satellite data, also highlighting the fact that remote sensing may represent an efficient and reliable solution to synoptically control the "good environmental status" (i.e., the Marine Directive to achieve Good Environmental Status of EU marine waters by 2020) and to assess the application of international regulations and environmental directives. Our methodology includes the use of an ad hoc regional (i.e., Mediterranean) algorithm for Chl concentration retrieval, also accounting for the difference between offshore (i.e., Case I) and coastal (i.e., Case II) waters. We apply the Mann-Kendall test and the Sens's method for trend estimation to the Chl concentration de-seasonalized monthly time series, as obtained from the X-11 technique. We also provide a preliminary analysis of some particular trends by evaluating their associated inter-annual variability. The high spatial resolution of our approach allows a clear identification of intense trends in those coastal waters that are affected by river outflows. We do not attempt to attribute the observed trends to specific anthropogenic events. However, the trends that we document are consistent with the findings of several previous studies.

Location Global, covering 99% of all mangrove forests. Methods We synthesized the Global Forest Change database, the Terrestrial Ecosystems of the World database and the Mangrove Forests of the World database to extract mangrove forest cover at high spatial and temporal resolutions. We then used the new database to monitor mangrove cover at the global, national and protected area scales. Results Countries showing relatively high amounts of mangrove loss include Myanmar, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia and Guatemala. Indonesia remains by far the largest mangrove-holding nation, containing between 26% and 29% of the global mangrove inventory with a deforestation rate of between 0.26% and 0.66% per year. We have made our new database, CGMFC-21, freely available. Main conclusions Global mangrove deforestation continues but at a much reduced rate of between 0.16% and 0.39% per year. Southeast Asia is a region of concern with mangrove deforestation rates between 3.58% and 8.08%, this in a region containing half of the entire global mangrove forest inventory. The global mangrove deforestation pattern from 2000 to 2012 is one of decreasing rates of deforestation, with many nations essentially stable, with the exception of the largest mangrove-holding region of Southeast Asia. We provide a standardized spatial dataset that monitors mangrove deforestation globally at high spatio-temporal resolutions. These data can be used to drive the mangrove research agenda, particularly as it pertains to monitoring of mangrove carbon stocks and the establishment of baseline local mangrove forest inventories required for payment for ecosystem service initiatives.

Cerrado habitats have suffered significant degradation and decline over the past decades due to expansion of cash crops and livestock farming across South America. Approximately 1,800,000 km(2) of the Cerrado remain in Brazil, but detailed maps and conservation assessments of the Cerrado are lacking. We developed a land cover classification for the Cerrado, focusing on the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, which may also be used to map critical habitat for endangered species. We used a Random Forest algorithm to perform a supervised classification on a set of Landsat 8 images. To determine habitat fragmentation for the Cerrado, we used Fragstats. A habitat connectivity analysis was performed using Linkage Mapper. Our final classification had an overall accuracy of 88%. Our classification produced higher accuracies (72%) in predicting Cerrado than existing government maps. We found that remaining Cerrado habitats were severely fragmented. Four potential corridors were identified in the southwest of Mato Grosso do Sul, where large Cerrado patches are located. Only two large patches remain in Mato Grosso do Sul: one within the Kadiweu Indian Reserve, and one near the southeastern edge of the Pantanal-dominated landscape. These results are alarming for rare species requiring larger tracts of habitat such as the giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus).

Using a winter 2006 waterbird survey, we examined the relationships among metrics of bird community diversity and abundance and landscape characteristics of 51 wetland sub-lakes derived by an object-based classification of Landsat satellite data. Relative importance of predictors and their sets was assessed using information-theoretic model selection and the Akaike Information Criterion. Ordinary least squares regression models were diagnosed and corrected for spatial autocorrelation using spatial autoregressive lag and error models. The strongest and most consistent landscape predictors included Normalized Difference Vegetation Index for mudflat (negative effect) and emergent grassland (positive effect), total sub-lake area (positive effect), and proportion of submerged vegetation (negative effect). Significant spatial autocorrelation in linear regression was associated with local clustering of response and predictor variables, and should be further explored for selection of wetland sampling units and management of protected areas. Overall, results corroborate the utility of remote sensing to elucidate potential indicators of waterbird diversity that complement logistically challenging ground observations and offer new hypotheses on factors underlying community distributions.																	2072-4292					JUN	2016	8	6							462	10.3390/rs8060462								WOS:000379985300022

With its 10 m to 20 m spatial resolution, Sentinel-2 is a promising sensor for the detection of a variety of landscape features of ecological relevance. However, many components of the ecological network are still smaller than the 10 m pixel, i.e., they are sub-pixel targets that stretch the sensor's resolution to its limit. This paper proposes a framework to empirically estimate the minimum object size for an accurate detection of a set of structuring landscape foreground/background pairs. The developed method combines a spectral separability analysis and an empirical point spread function estimation for Sentinel-2. The same approach was also applied to Landsat-8 and SPOT-5 (Take 5), which can be considered as similar in terms of spectral definition and spatial resolution, respectively. Results show that Sentinel-2 performs consistently on both aspects. A large number of indices have been tested along with the individual spectral bands and target discrimination was possible in all but one case. Overall, results for Sentinel-2 highlight the critical importance of a good compromise between the spatial and spectral resolution. For instance, the Sentinel-2 roads detection limit was of 3 m and small water bodies are separable with a diameter larger than 11 m. In addition, the analysis of spectral mixtures draws attention to the uneven sensitivity of a variety of spectral indices. The proposed framework could be implemented to assess the fitness for purpose of future sensors within a large range of applications.

Individual Tree Species Classification From Airborne Multisensor Imagery Using Robust PCA	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING					IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 26-31, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE				Remote sensing of individual tree species has many applications in resource management, biodiversity assessment, and conservation. Airborne remote sensing using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and hyperspectral sensors has been used extensively to extract biophysical traits of vegetation and to detect species. However, its application for individual tree mapping remains limited due to the technical challenges of precise coalignment of images acquired from different sensors and accurately delineating individual tree crowns (ITCs). In this study, we developed a generic workflow to map tree species at ITC level from hyperspectral imagery and LiDAR data using a combination of well established and recently developed techniques. The workflow uses a nonparametric image registration approach to coalign images, a multiclass normalized graph cut method for ITC delineation, robust principal component analysis for feature extraction, and support vector machine for species classification. This workflow allows us to automatically map tree species at both pixel- and ITC-level. Experimental tests of the technique were conducted using ground data collected from a fully mapped temperate woodland in the UK. The overall accuracy of pixel-level classification was 91%, while that of ITC-level classification was 61%. The test results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, and in particular the use of robust principal component analysis to prune the hyperspectral dataset and reveal subtle difference among species.

METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION					5th Anniversary Symposium of Methods in Ecology and Evolution	2015	CANADA					1. Essential Biodiversity Variable, Natural Capital, Biodiversity Indicator and Ecosystem Service are four concepts that underpin the most popular frameworks currently considered for helping to coordinate and structure biodiversitymonitoring efforts worldwide. Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS) has considerable potential to inform these initiatives. To date, however, discussions on the role of SRS in supporting these frameworks have mostly evolved independently; tend to be led by different groups; sometimes target slightly different scales; and are likely to reach different audiences. Because of this, there is some confusion among environmental managers and policymakers as to what the potential of SRS is or whether there is prospect in considering and promoting the use of satellite data for biodiversity conservation. 2. Here, we provide a brief overview of the role of SRS to date in informing these frameworks. Through a case study focused on the Sahara Desert ecosystem, we also demonstrate the current potential for SRS-based methodologies to support conservation in data-deficient areas and discuss the relative applicability of SRS-based metrics to each of these frameworks. 3. The relevance and use of SRS across the four frameworks are clearly variable, due to differences and ambiguity in definitions, and due to differences in monitoring priorities. Our case study illustrates the particularly high potential for SRS approaches to provide key information relevant to the Biodiversity Indicators framework in desert ecosystems; it also identifies SRS-based metrics relevant to all frameworks. 4. Altogether, this work highlights how more dialogue is required within the biodiversity-monitoring community for SRS to reach its full potential in conservation. In particular, agreement on what is needed in priority, given the realm of what is possible, will be of paramount importance to developing SRS-based products that are used by policymakers and international conventions.

A case study in Ghana	IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY												Degradation, a reduction of the ecosystem's capacity to supply goods and services, is widespread in tropical forests and mainly caused by human disturbance. To maintain the full range of forest ecosystem services and support the development of effective conservation policies, we must understand the overall impact of degradation on different forest resources. This research investigates the response to disturbance of forest structure using several indicators: soil carbon content, arboreal richness and biodiversity, functional composition (guild and wood density), and productivity. We drew upon large field and remote sensing datasets from different forest types in Ghana, characterized by varied protection status, to investigate impacts of selective logging, and of illegal land use and resources extraction, which are the main disturbance causes in West Africa. Results indicate that functional composition and the overall number of species are less affected by degradation, while forest structure, soil carbon content and species abundance are seriously impacted, with resources distribution reflecting the protection level of the areas. Remote sensing analysis showed an increase in productivity in the last three decades, with higher resiliency to change in drier forest types, and stronger productivity correlation with solar radiation in the short dry season. The study region is affected by growing anthropogenic pressure on natural resources and by an increased climate variability: possible interactions of disturbance with climate are also discussed, together with the urgency to reduce degradation in order to preserve the full range of ecosystem functions.

J	Pullanikkatil, D; Palamuleni, L; Ruhiiga, T				Pullanikkatil, Deepa; Palamuleni, Lobina; Ruhiiga, Tabukeli			Assessment of land use change in Likangala River catchment, Malawi: A remote sensing and DPSIR approach	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												The provisioning ecosystem services of Likangala River catchment located in Southern Malawi provides food, construction materials, fuel-wood, timber, ornamental products and water for its inhabitants. However, poor land use practices, deforestation and exploitation of natural resources by local communities have negative impact on the ecosystem services. The aim of this study was to evaluate land cover changes from 1984 to 2013 and how the changes may affect provisioning ecosystem services. Remote sensing techniques were used to inventory temporal changes of land use changes in the catchment and the Drivers, Pressures, States, Impacts, Responses (DPSIR) framework was used to explain the complexity of such changes. The analysis of land use maps indicate that deforestation, river bank cultivation, pollution and over extraction of natural resources were threatening sustainability of provisioning ecosystem services in Likangala River catchment. Land use/land cover change detection between 1984 and 2013 revealed that woodlands have decline by 88.5%, shrublands have declined by 16.7%, agricultural areas have increased by 443% and urban areas increased by 143%. The study revealed that the main drivers of change in this catchment are the demand for agricultural land as population grows. The pressures identified are expansion of agricultural land, construction materials, medicinal plants, wood and waste generation. The impacts include declining provisioning ecosystem services, water borne diseases and biodiversity loss through loss of habitats from land use and land cover change. As a response, the study noted that reducing deforestation, enforcement of buffers along river banks, waste management for improving water quality, improving sanitation, providing civic education to communities could assist in improving the state of the catchment. The study highlights the integration of remote sensing techniques for land cover change detection and the use of focus group discussions to capture the understanding and responses of the community to ecosystem degradation in order to achieve the outcome of an ecologically sustainable society.

However, the costs to maintain a long-term monitoring site are enormous. Lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones) have been rapidly emerging as a new tool for local-scale monitoring. To evaluate the value of drone applications in long-term ecological studies, we combined drone-derived canopy variables, detailed ground-based stem-mapping data and topographic and edaphic variables from a 20-ha forest dynamics plot in a species-rich subtropical forest. Specifically, we evaluated the relative importance of these variables in explaining local-scale variation in forest stand and species measures. We found that drone-derived canopy variables contributed substantially towards explaining local patterns of biodiversity and more specifically in supporting a gap dynamics hypothesis in structuring observed forest biodiversity. Stand basal area was positively related with canopy closure, indicating the importance of protecting old-growth forests as carbon sinks. The importance of topographic and edaphic variables was also demonstrated, supporting a niche differentiation hypothesis in structuring patterns in biodiversity. Species-level analyses illustrated that light-demanding species were more strongly correlated with canopy variables than shade-tolerant species. We provide convincing evidence that drones can add substantial value to long-term ecological monitoring by providing low cost, high resolution data. Drones should be included in the ecologist's toolbox to complement traditional field surveys. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Conservation priorities of forest ecosystems: Evaluation of deforestation and degradation hotspots using geospatial techniques	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Spatially explicit planning is required to set focused conservation priorities and assessing future ecological implications. Spatial ecological modeling and hotspot analysis prioritizes the forest ecosystems and supports the conservation of species level biodiversity. In the present study, the hotspots of deforestation and forest fires were obtained using historical deforestation trends (1975-1985-1995-2005-2014) and fire history (2009-2014) in Andhra Pradesh, India. The priority areas were identified as deforestation and degradation hotspots using combined measures of threat from deforestation, fire hotspots and current level of forest fragmentation. The state of Andhra Pradesh represents an area of 25985 km(2) (16.2% of total geographical area) under forest cover in 2014. The net deforested area was estimated as 2390 km(2) (8.4%) from 1975 to 2014. We have calculated the region of influence in percentages and found deforestation hotspots covering an average of 40.2% forest, followed by 35.9% under high fragmentation and 19.2% under fire hotspots. Ecosystem level analysis has been carried out for all the forest types i.e., semi evergreen, moist deciduous, dry deciduous, dry evergreen, thorn and mangroves, indicating ecosystem vulnerability. According to the results of prioritization, about 10.5% of existing forest had severe ecosystem collapse and categorized as deforestation and degradation hotspot-I. Analysis of protected areas shows Nagarjunasagar Srisailam Tiger Reserve, Sri Peninsula Narasimha sanctuary, Papikonda sanctuary and Sri Venkateshwara sanctuary are representing deforestation and degradation hotspot-I. Deforestation and degradation hotspots identified in the study is an excellent surrogate for understanding anthropogenic disturbances and can be effectively useful in forest management to proceed for applicable restoration measures.

FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Old-growth boreal forests display high within-stand structural variation, with large variation in tree sizes and age structure, a heterogeneous horizontal spatial pattern with gaps of different sizes and multi layered canopies. Old managed forests, on the other hand, are characterized by more homogeneous structural patterns. In many parts of Europe, no true 'virgin forests' remains. Still, in many places forests previously influenced by selective logging have been abandoned, and is now developing towards a more natural forest structure. Such near-natural forest areas can be of special importance for forest biodiversity and related ecosystem services, and it is therefore important to map and monitor such forests. Recently, airborne laser scanning (ALE) has been applied to provide ecologically relevant information on forest structure. The advantage of ALS is that it can characterize three-dimensional forest structure in fine detail across broad areas, replacing more labour-intensive field-based measurements. In this study, we use ALS to compare the structural characteristics of 89 near-natural and 280 managed old forest stands in a 17,000 ha boreal forest study site in southeastern Norway. For the study area, both maps of logging history separating old near-natural and old managed forests, and high-resolution ALS data was available. Our aim was to investigate if ALS data could be used to separate vertical and horizontal forest structure in old near natural versus old managed forests. We also wanted to compare different methods for classification, and to describe the potential for use of ALS in classification of forest naturalness for future mapping and monitoring purposes. We found that ALS data had a strong potential in separating stands of old near-natural forests from old managed stands. The most important metrics for classification were those reflecting canopy height, canopy density, variation in canopy height, number of trees per area and gap patterns. This fits well with ecological knowledge of relevant structural differences between forests of different degree of naturalness. Both vertical and horizontal metrics provided useful input to the classification, but the horizontal metrics performed slightly better on accuracy and were easier to interpret. Although the method has a good potential for wider use in boreal forest landscapes, the need for local reference data for calibration as well as the importance of ALS pulse density for precision of classification should be further investigated. Large-scale spatial information on remaining source areas of natural and near-natural forests will be essential in order to manage forests in a way that safeguards biodiversity and ecosystem services. We suggest that classification of forest naturalness based on ALS data can be a helpful tool in future forest mapping and monitoring. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Adaptation of Asia-Pacific forests to climate change	JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH												Climate change is a threat to the stability and productivity of forest ecosystems throughout the Asia-Pacific region. The loss of forests due to climate-induced stress will have extensive adverse impacts on biodiversity and an array of ecosystem services that are essential for the maintenance of local economies and public health. Despite their importance, there is a lack of decision-support tools required to evaluate the potential effects of climate change on Asia-Pacific ecosystems and economies and to aid in the development of regionally appropriate adaptation and mitigation strategies. The project Adaptation of Asia-Pacific Forests to Climate Change, summarized herein, aims to address this lack of knowledge and tools and to provide support for regional managers to develop effective policy to increase the adaptive capacity of Asia-Pacific forest ecosystems. This objective has been achieved through the following activities: (1) development of a high-resolution climate downscaling model, ClimateAP, applicable to any location in the region; (2) development of climate niche models to evaluate how climate change might affect the distribution of suitable climatic conditions for regionally important tree species; (3) development and application of forest models to assess alternative management strategies in the context of management objectives and the projected impacts of climate change; (4) evaluation of models to assess forest fire risk and the relationship between forest fire and climate change; (5) development of a technique to assess ecosystem carbon storage using LiDAR; and (6) evaluation of how vegetation dynamics respond to climate change using remote sensing technology. All project outputs were developed with a focus on communication and extension to facilitate the dissemination of results to regional forest resource managers to support the development of effective mitigation and adaptation policy.																	1007-662X	1993-0607				JUN	2016	27	3					469	488		10.1007/s11676-016-0218-1								WOS:000375452300001

Interactions between macroclimate, microclimate, and anthropogenic disturbance affect the distribution of aspen near its northern edge in Quebec: Implications for climate change related range expansions	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Policy to address the shifting tree species distributions anticipated in coming decades requires a sound understanding of how forests respond to environmental change. Using a combination of remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS) analysis, and ground-based techniques, we explored the environmental factors associated with the distribution and abundance of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) across regional gradients near its northern range limit in northwestern Quebec, Canada. Although not regionally abundant, aspen is the main deciduous tree species in this conifer-dominated landscape. Regionally, the similar to 51,200-km(2) study area has very few settlements or roads, and little industrial resource extraction. Most of the region is inaccessible to humans except by foot or water travel. We utilized Landsat Thematic Mapper images from 2010 and 2011, and a robust collection of ground reference data developed from aerial photography, supported by field verification (vegetation sampling) where access permitted, to construct a thematic map of 11 land cover classes. The map highlights the spatial distribution of aspen, which represents only 03% of the study area. Map validation indicated an overall mapping accuracy of 74%, and the aspen predicted class was determined to be over 77% accurate. The regional-scale distribution of aspen stands >= 0.5 ha within the study area shows two patterns: (1) a shift toward greatest abundance on south-facing aspects with increasing latitude; and (2) a highly clustered pattern with a strong signal of concentration in areas of human activity. These patterns suggest that aspen range expansion due to climate warming will vary with topographic and other microclimatic factors (i.e. be a function of climate change interacting with landscapes) and that anthropogenic activities have the potential to influence future aspen abundance independently of climate. Forest management policies concerned with changing forest composition in these northern landscapes should recognize the potentially important role of human activity in driving the abundance of aspen.

J	Burgoyne, C; Kelso, C; Ahmed, F				Burgoyne, Christopher; Kelso, Clare; Ahmed, Fethi			Human activity and vegetation change around Mkuze Game Reserve, South Africa	SOUTH AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL												In the last century, the establishment of protected areas has become an important part of managing South Africa's wilderness and wildlife. The notion of untouched protected areas has become contested in a time when developing nations are seeking to improve quality of life for their citizens. With the promulgation of modern environmental legislation, resource sharing with local rural communities has become an important policy guideline for protected area management authorities. Census archives and remotely sensed data were used in order to investigate anthropogenic land-cover change around Mkuze Game Reserve between 1979 and 2008. Results showed that natural land cover decreased consistently as populations increased, despite variations in rainfall and population movement. Natural land cover inside Mkuze Game Reserve remained relatively stable. Bush was found to be increasingly degraded around more densely populated areas, while grassland was degrading in districts more concentrated with agricultural activity. A potential problem for future natural resource-dependent livelihoods in the area was the replacement of wetlands with sugarcane agriculture. If current trends continue, natural land-cover loss will continue. Evidence suggests that local socio-environmental systems are changing signifying important implications for the management of human activity and biodiversity around the borders of protected areas in South Africa.																	0373-6245	2151-2418				MAY 3	2016	98	2					217	234		10.1080/03736245.2015.1028978								WOS:000373878500002

In this study, we test the ability to discriminate between two tree species of the same genera, using data from Landsat 8 satellite imagery, aerial images, and airborne laser scanning. Ground observations from forest stands dominated by either Norway spruce (Picea abies) or Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) were coupled with variables derived from each of the three sets of remote sensing data. Random forest, support vector machine, and logistic regression classification models were fit to the data, and the classification accuracy tested by performing a cross-validation. Classification accuracies were compared for different combinations of remote sensing data and classification methods. The overall classification accuracy varied from 0.53 to 0.79, with the highest accuracy obtained using logistic regression with a combination of data derived from Landsat imagery and aerial images. The corresponding kappa value was 0.58. The contribution to the classification accuracy from using airborne data in addition to Landsat imagery was not substantial in this study. The classification accuracy varied between models using data from individual Landsat images.																	2072-4292					MAY	2016	8	5							363	10.3390/rs8050363								WOS:000378406400007

CAF's (The Chinese Academy of Forestry) LiCHy (LiDAR, CCD and Hyperspectral) Airborne Observation System is a unique system that permits simultaneous measurements of vegetation vertical structure, horizontal pattern, and foliar spectra from different view angles at very high spatial resolution (similar to 1 m) on a wide range of airborne platforms. The horizontal geo-location accuracy of LiDAR and CCD is about 0.5 m, with LiDAR vertical resolution and accuracy 0.15 m and 0.3 m, respectively. The geo-location accuracy of hyperspectral image is within 2 pixels for nadir view observations and 5-7 pixels for large off-nadir observations of 55 degrees with multi-angle modular when comparing to LiDAR product. The complementary nature of LiCHy's sensors makes it an effective and comprehensive system for forest inventory, change detection, biodiversity monitoring, carbon accounting and ecosystem service evaluation. The LiCHy system has acquired more than 8000 km(2) of data over typical forests across China.

We present an approach on how to combine vegetation-plot databases and remotely-sensed land surface phenology (LSP) metrics to predict plant alpha-diversity on a regional scale. We gathered data on plant alpha-diversity, measured as species density, from 999 vegetation plots sized 20 m x 50 m covering all major vegetation units of the Okavango basin in the countries of Angola, Namibia and Botswana. As predictor variables, we used MODIS LSP metrics averaged over 12 years (250-m spatial resolution) and three topographic attributes calculated from the SRTM digital elevation model. Furthermore, we tested whether additional climatic data could improve predictions. We tested three predictor subsets: (1) remote sensing variables; (2) climatic variables; and (3) all variables combined. We used two statistical modeling approaches, random forests and boosted regression trees, to predict vascular plant alpha-diversity. The resulting maps showed that the Miombo woodlands of the Angolan Central Plateau featured the highest diversity, and the lowest values were predicted for the thornbush savanna in the Okavango Delta area. Models built on the entire dataset exhibited the best performance followed by climate-only models and remote sensing-only models. However, models including climate data showed artifacts. In spite of lower model performance, models based only on LSP metrics produced the most realistic maps. Furthermore, they revealed local differences in plant diversity of the landscape mosaic that were blurred by homogenous belts as predicted by climate-based models. This study pinpoints the high potential of LSP metrics used in conjunction with biodiversity data derived from vegetation-plot databases to produce spatial information on a regional scale that is urgently needed for basic natural resource management applications.

Impacts of Mining and Urbanization on the Qin-Ba Mountainous Environment, China	SUSTAINABILITY												The Qin-Ba Ecological Functional Zone is a component of China's ecological security pattern designed to protect the regional ecosystem and maintain biodiversity. However, due to the impact of mining and urban encroachment, the plight of a sustainable ecosystem in the Qin-Ba mountainous area is deteriorating. This paper has used a remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) to examine the impacts of mining and urban encroachment on the environment in the Qin-Ba mountainous area. The results indicate that the total mined area in 2013 was 22 km(2) and is predicted to escalate. Results also show that the ecosystems in Fengxian County, Shaanxi Province and Baokang County, Hubei Province were most severely affected by mining. Urbanization in the Qin-Ba mountainous area has seen an increase of 85.58 km(2) in urban land use from 2010 to 2013. In addition, infrastructure development including airport construction, tourism resorts and real estate development in the Qin-Ba mountainous area has intensified environmental and biodiversity disturbances since large areas of forest have been cleared. Our results should provide insight and assistance to city planners and government officials in making informed decisions.					hu, lan/0000-0002-1481-5206												2071-1050					MAY	2016	8	5							488	10.3390/su8050488								WOS:000377983800082						
J	Pellikka, P; Alshaikh, AY				Pellikka, Petri; Alshaikh, Amal Yahya			Remote sensing of the decrease of juniper woodlands in the mountains of Southwestern Saudi Arabia-reasons and consequences	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Urban sprawl is a typical land use change in developed countries, which converts agricultural land or vegetated areas to built-up areas or other consolidated land cover types, like roads. In southwestern Saudi Arabia, urban sprawl and establishment of recreation areas decreases the area of juniper woodlands, which are important for carbon sequestration, biodiversity maintenance, erosion control, and atmospheric moisture harvest and water storage. The change detection study applying land cover classification for Landsat TM and ETM+ data from 1984, 1999, and 2014 in the Al Bahah governorate demonstrated a 10 % loss of juniper woodlands from 1984 to 2014, mainly caused by establishment of recreation sites in the mountains. At the same time, built-up area expanded 24 % mostly on the cost of barren lands, but also on the cost of woodlands. The juniper woodlands are also declining in quality as throughout the southwestern mountains a dieback is reported and visible also in the study area. Knowing the scarcity of woodlands in the Arabian Peninsula and the importance of the unique woodlands for water resources, it is of utmost importance to use the results for raising awareness and protecting the juniper woodlands. Further research is required to study the loss of the juniper forests and rate of dieback in the whole study area.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				MAY	2016	9	6							457	10.1007/s12517-016-2481-z								WOS:000376611000031

Thus, it is necessary to analyze the responses of ecosystem services to changes in land use over time. Polders, a typical floodplain landscape in the Chaohu Lake Basin, were selected as the study area to evaluate how ecosystem services respond to changes in both land use and patch size over time. Multiple approaches, including remote sensing, geographical information system and correspondence analysis, were used. The results showed that the total ecosystem services were increased from 9.97 x 10(8) to 1.02 x 10(9) Yuan for all polders. Based on a correspondence analysis, recreation and culture, water supply and waste treatment are the ecosystem services that depend on water bodies, whereas six other types of ecosystem services (biodiversity protection, climate regulation, food production, raw material, soil formation and protection and gas regulation) depend on soil. Therefore, there are trade-offs between the ecosystem services provided by farmlands and those provided by water bodies, between supporting and provisioning services and cultural services in the polders, and between provisioning services and most regulating services. Furthermore, trade-offs and synergies were detected among regulating services. In this study, the relationships between patch sizes and ecosystem services were significantly changed during the 1985-2007 period, particularly from 2000 to 2007. The area variation of special land use can drive changes in these relationships. Notably, correspondence analysis can be used as a method to analyze synergies and trade-offs among multiple ecosystem services.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAY	2016	75	10							856	10.1007/s12665-016-5683-5								WOS:000376589500009

Circumpolar Arctic vegetation: a hierarchic review and roadmap toward an internationally consistent approach to survey, archive and classify tundra plot data	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Satellite-derived remote-sensing products are providing a modern circumpolar perspective of Arctic vegetation and its changes, but this new view is dependent on a long heritage of ground-based observations in the Arctic. Several products of the Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna are key to our current understanding. We review aspects of the PanArctic Flora, the Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map, the Arctic Biodiversity Assessment, and the Arctic Vegetation Archive (AVA) as they relate to efforts to describe and map the vegetation, plant biomass, and biodiversity of the Arctic at circumpolar, regional, landscape and plot scales. Cornerstones for all these tools are ground-based plant-species and plant-community surveys. The AVA is in progress and will store plot-based vegetation observations in a public-accessible database for vegetation classification, modeling, diversity studies, and other applications. We present the current status of the Alaska Arctic Vegetation Archive (AVA-AK), as a regional example for the panarctic archive, and with a roadmap for a coordinated international approach to survey, archive and classify Arctic vegetation. We note the need for more consistent standards of plot-based observations, and make several recommendations to improve the linkage between plot-based observations biodiversity studies and satellite-based observations of Arctic vegetation.

J	Ma, H; Shi, LY				Ma, He; Shi, Longyu			Assessment of eco-environmental quality of Western Taiwan Straits Economic Zone	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Regional eco-environmental quality is the key and foundation to the sustainable socio-economic development of a region. Eco-environmental quality assessment can reveal the capacity of sustainable socio-economic development in a region and the degree of coordination between social production and the living environment. As part of a new development strategy for Fujian Province, the Western Taiwan Straits Economic Zone (hereafter referred to as the Economic Zone) provides an important guarantee for the development of China's southeastern coastal area. Based on ecological and remote sensing data on the Economic Zone obtained in 2000, 2005, and 2010, this study investigated county-level administrative regions with a comprehensive index of eco-environmental indicators. An objective weighting method was used to determine the importance of each indicator. This led to the development of an indicator system to assess the eco-environmental quality of the economic zone. ArcGIS software was used to assess the eco-environmental quality of the economic zone based on each indicator. The eco-environmental quality index (EQI) of the county-level administrative regions was calculated. The overall eco-environmental quality of the Economic Zone during the period studied is described and analyzed. The results show that the overall eco-environmental quality of the Economic Zone is satisfactory, but significant intraregional differences still exist. The key to improving the overall eco-environmental quality of this area is to restore vegetation and preserve biodiversity.				shi, longyu/E-5345-2017; CAS, KLUEH/G-8978-2016	shi, longyu/0000-0002-5775-4917; 												0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY	2016	188	5							311	10.1007/s10661-016-5312-5								WOS:000376017400052	27117445

Tropical nature reserves are losing their buffer zones, but leakage is not to blame	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Tropical forests provide important ecosystem services to humanity, yet are threatened by habitat loss resulting from deforestation and land-use change. Although reserves are considered the cornerstones of conservation efforts in the tropics, their efficacy remains equivocal. One question that remains unresolved is whether leakage - the unanticipated displacement of deforestation from inside reserves into the unrestricted zones just beyond a reserve's administrative boundary - is common around tropical forest reserves, or whether the zones are acting as buffers between the protected area and the outside world. To resolve this question, we used the Landsat-derived Global Forest Change dataset to estimate deforestation rates between 2000 and 2012 inside and outside of 60 nature reserves spread across the tropics. Deforestation rates inside reserves (within 5 km of the administrative boundary) were generally lower than those immediately outside the reserves (i.e. in buffer zones 0-10 km from the boundary), suggesting that reserves are effective at protecting forests. We hypothesised that leakage would result in greater deforestation rates in reserve buffer zones than in the broader reserve landscapes, but such a pattern was observed in only five African sites, suggesting that leakage does not often occur on the edge of established reserves. However, roughly 80% of reserves experienced deforestation rates that increased gradually from their interiors to the outer periphery of their buffer zones. Thus, while leakage may not be a pervasive phenomenon around tropical reserves worldwide, tropical reserves are often losing their buffer zones, resulting in increased isolation that could have ramifications for ecosystem services provisioning and tropical conservation strategies.

J	Haywood, A; Mellor, A; Stone, C				Haywood, Andrew; Mellor, Andrew; Stone, Christine			A strategic forest inventory for public land in Victoria, Australia	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The aim of this paper is to present a strategic forest inventory approach that has been applied on public land in Victoria, Australia. The Victorian Forest Monitoring System is an integral component of a monitoring and reporting program that enables Victoria to critically assess and evaluate its progress towards achieving its sustainable forest management objectives and targets. The inventory approach utilises field measurements in combination with remote sensing data. The approach is novel in that it utilises a relatively small sample size with a stratification scheme designed to examine questions around tenure and land management options. The small sample was dictated by limited resources (capacity, time and budget). The stratification scheme was designed to explore different land management approaches (e.g. National Parks versus State forest), as a more consistent and balanced approach to the management of public forests is currently being considered by most State Governments in Australia. The resultant accuracy of estimates for management and bioregion strata and associated characteristics, like above ground biomass from this small sample size were found to be sufficient for the regional monitoring goals of this study.

Predicting Vascular Plant Richness in a Heterogeneous Wetland Using Spectral and Textural Features and a Random Forest Algorithm	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												A method to predict vascular plant richness using spectral and textural variables in a heterogeneous wetland is presented. Plant richness was measured at 44 sampling plots in a 16-ha anthropogenic peatland. Several spectral indices, first-order statistics (median and standard deviation), and second-order statistics [metrics of a gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)] were extracted from a Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager image and a Pleiades 1B image. We selected the most important variables for predicting richness using recursive feature elimination and then built a model using random forest regression. The final model was based on only two textural variables obtained from the GLCM and derived from the Landsat 8 image. An accurate predictive capability was reported (R-2 = 0.6; RMSE = 1.99 species), highlighting the possibility of obtaining parsimonious models using textural variables. In addition, the results showed that the mid-resolution Landsat 8 image provided better predictors of richness than the high-resolution Pleiades image. This is the first study to generate a model for plant richness in a wetland ecosystem.

J	Katz, Y; Levin, N				Katz, Yali; Levin, Noam			Quantifying urban light pollution - A comparison between field measurements and EROS-B imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Artificial night lighting and its negative consequences are of interest in the fields of Astronomy, Human Geography, Ecology and Human Health. The majority of studies to date focused on the impacts light pollution has on our ability to view the night sky, as well as on biodiversity, ecosystems and humans. However, in recent years, with the emergence of new high spatial resolution sensors, providing detailed evaluation of night lights at the local level, more attention has been given for estimating and quantifying artificial light within cities. In this study, we evaluate urban night lights within the city of Jerusalem by combining data from two remote sensing tools: ground measurements using Sky Quality Meter (SQM) devices and space-borne measurements using EROS-B night light imagery. In addition, we examined the use of the SQM for evaluating artificial light in different view directions: upwards, downwards and horizontally. Differences in night lights were found between the three SQM view directions, with the brightest values measured in the horizontal direction (8.7-18.9 mag(SQM) arcsec(-2), and darlcest values in the downwards direction (11.2-19.5 mag(SQM) arcsec(-2)). The downwards SQM measurements were influenced by surface albedo, the horizontal direction was the most exposed to direct lights from buildings and cars, while in most locations the upwards direction represented skyglow. Using quantile regression we found strong correlations between the SQM and EROS-B brightness values. Statistically significant correlations (R-2 = 0.53) were found between the upwards and downwards devices to the EROS-B in the 0.95 quantile, as well as between the horizontal device to the EROS-B in the 0.90 quantile (R-2 = 0.44). In addition to local and external light sources, bright areas on the EROS-B image were associated with areas of low vegetation cover and high albedo. This study provides evidence for the correspondence between field and space-borne measurements of artificial lights and emphasizes the need for better understanding of light pollution at the local level and for taking into account of the three dimensional nature of light pollution.

Conservation of the Ethiopian church forests: Threats, opportunities and implications for their management	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In the central and northern highlands of Ethiopia, native forest and forest biodiversity is almost confined to sacred groves associated with churches. Local communities rely on these 'church forests' for essential ecosystem services including shade and fresh water but little is known about their region-wide distribution and conservation value. We(1) performed the first large-scale spatially-explicit assessment of church forests, combining remote-sensing and field data, to assess the number of forests, their size, shape, isolation and woody plant species composition, (2) determined their plant communities and related these to environmental variables and potential natural vegetation, (3) identified the main challenges to biodiversity conservation in view of plant population dynamics and anthropogenic disturbances, and (4) present guidelines for management and policy. The 394 forests identified in satellite images were on average similar to 2 ha in size and generally separated by similar to 2 km from the nearest neighboring forest. Shape complexity, not size, decreased from the northern to the central highlands. Overall, 148 indigenous tree, shrub and liana species were recorded across the 78 surveyed forests. Patch a-diversity increased with mean annual precipitation, but typically only 25 woody species occurred per patch. The combined results showed that >50% of tree species present in tropical northeast Africa were still present in the 78 studied church forests, even though individual forests were small and relatively species-poor. Tree species composition of church forests varied with elevation and precipitation, and resembled the potential natural vegetation. With a wide distribution over the landscape, these church forests have high conservation value. However, long-term conservation of biodiversity of individual patches and evolutionary potential of species may be threatened by isolation, small sizes of tree species populations and disturbance, especially when considering climate change. Forest management interventions are essential and should be supported by environmental education and other forms of public engagement. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the last years, aerial and satellite imagery have been increasingly used to monitor the spatial extent of changes in LU/LC, deriving relevant biophysical parameters (i.e. primary productivity, climate and habitat structure) that have clear implications in determining spatial and temporal patterns of biodiversity, landscape composition and ecosystem services. An innovative hierarchical modelling framework was developed in order to address the influence of nested attributes of LU/LC on community-based ecological indicators. Founded in the principles of the spatially explicit stochastic dynamic methodology (StDM), the proposed methodological advances are supported by the added value of integrating bottom-up interactions between multi-scaled drivers. The dynamics of biophysical multi-attributes of fine-scale subsystem properties are incorporated to inform dynamic patterns at upper hierarchical levels. Since the most relevant trends associated with LU/LC changes are explicitly modelled within the StDM framework, the ecological indicators' response can be predicted under different social-economic scenarios and site-specific management actions. A demonstrative application is described to illustrate the framework methodological steps, supporting the theoretic principles previously presented. We outline the proposed multi-model framework as a promising tool to integrate relevant biophysical information to support ecosystem management and decision-making.

Remote sensing has much potential for biodiversity mapping, and high spatial resolution imaging spectroscopy (IS) allows for direct prediction of tree species diversity based on spectral reflectance. The objective of this study was to test an approach for mapping tree species alpha diversity that takes advantage of an unsupervised object-based clustering. Tree species diversity of a tropical montane forest in the Taita Hills, Kenya, was mapped based on spectral variation of high spatial resolution IS data. Airborne IS data and species data from 31 field plots were collected in the study area. Species diversity measures were obtained from the IS data by clustering spectrally similar image segments representing tree crowns. In order to do this, the image was segmented to objects that represented tree crowns. Three measures of species diversity were calculated based on the field data and on the clustering results, and the relationships were statistically analyzed. According to the results, the approach succeeded well in revealing tree species diversity patterns. Especially, tree species richness was well predicted (RMSE = 3 species; r(2) = 0.50) directly based on the clustering results. The optimal number of clusters was found to be close to the estimated number of tree species in the forest. Minimum tree size was an important determinant of the relationships, because only part of the trees are visible to the airborne sensor in the multi-layered closed canopy forest. In general, the object-based approach proved to be a viable alternative to a pixel-based clustering. The approach takes advantage of the capability of IS to detect spectral differences among tree crowns, but without the need for spectral training data, which is expensive to collect. With further development, the approach could be applied also for estimating beta diversity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Rowlands, G; Purkis, S; Bruckner, A				Rowlands, Gwilym; Purkis, Sam; Bruckner, Andrew			Tight coupling between coral reef morphology and mapped resilience in the Red Sea	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Lack of knowledge on the conservation value of different reef types can stymie decision making, and result in less optimal management solutions. Addressing the information gap of coral reef resilience, we produce a map-based Remote Sensed Resilience Index (RSRI) from data describing the spatial distribution of stressors, and properties of reef habitats on the Farasan Banks, Saudi Arabia. We contrast the distribution of this index among fourteen reef types, categorized on a scale of maturity that includes juvenile (poorly aggraded), mature (partially aggraded), and senile (fully aggraded) reefs. Sites with high reef resilience can be found in most detached reef types; however they are most common in mature reefs. We aim to stimulate debate on the coupling that exists between geomorphology and conservation biology, and consider how such information can be used to inform management decisions.

They depend on periodic floods from rivers, but dams and diversions have reduced flood frequencies and volumes, leading to deterioration of trees and associated biota. There is a need to determine their water requirements so environmental flows can be administered to maintain or restore the forests. Their water requirements include the frequency and extent of overbank flooding, which recharges the floodplain soils with water, as well as the actual amount of water consumed in evapotranspiration (ET). We estimated the flooding requirements and ET for a 38134ha area of red gum forest fed by the Murrumbidgee River in Yanga National Park, New South Wales. ET was estimated by three methods: sap flux sensors placed in individual trees; a remote sensing method based on the Enhanced Vegetation Index from MODIS satellite imagery and a water balance method based on differences between river flows into and out of the forest. The methods gave comparable estimates yet covered different spatial and temporal scales. We estimated flood frequency and volume requirements by comparing Normalized Difference Vegetation Index values from Landsat images with flood history from 1995 to 2014, which included both wet periods and dry periods. ET during wet years is about 50% of potential ET but is much less in dry years because of the trees' ability to control stomatal conductance. Based on our analyses plus other studies, red gum trees at this location require environmental flows of 2000GLyr(-1) every other year, with peak flows of 20000MLd(-1), to produce flooding sufficient to keep them in good condition. However, only about 120-200GLyr(-1) of river water is consumed in ET, with the remainder flowing out of the forest where it enters the Murray River system.

Concerns grow that environmental disruption of marine mutualisms exacerbates ecosystem degradation, with breakdown of the obligate coral mutualism ("coral bleaching") being an iconic example [2, 4, 5]. However, as these mutualisms are mostly facultative rather than obligate, it remains unclear whether mutualism breakdown is a common risk in marine ecosystems, and thus a potential accelerator of ecosystem degradation. Here, we provide evidence that. drought triggered landscape-scale seagrass degradation and show the consequent failure of a facultative mutualistic feedback between seagrass and sulfide-consuming lucinid bivalves that in turn appeared to exacerbate the observed collapse. Local climate and remote sensing analyses revealed seagrass collapse after a summer with intense low-tide drought stress. Potential analysis a novel approach to detect feedback-mediated state shifts-revealed two attractors (healthy and degraded states) during the collapse, suggesting that the drought disrupted internal feedbacks to cause abrupt, patch-wise degradation. Field measurements comparing degraded patches that were healthy before the collapse with patches that remained healthy demonstrated that bivalves declined dramatically in degrading patches with associated high sediment sulfide concentrations, confirming the breakdown of the mutualistic seagrass-lucinid feedback. Our findings indicate that drought triggered mutualism breakdown, resulting in toxic sulfide concentrations that aggravated seagrass degradation. We conclude that external disturbances can cause sudden breakdown of facultative marine mutualistic feedbacks. As this may amplify ecosystem degradation, we suggest including mutualisms in marine conservation and restoration approaches.

Markov random field-based method for super-resolution mapping of forest encroachment from remotely sensed ASTER image	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL												Forest encroachment (FE) is a problem in Andaman and Nicobar Islands (ANI) in India for environment and planning. Small gaps created in the forest slowly expand its periphery disturbing the biodiversity. Therefore, intrusion of poachers, slash and burn and other factors causing FE must be carefully detected and monitored. Remote sensing offers a great opportunity to accomplish this task because of its synoptic view. Conventional classification methods with remotely sensed images are problematic because of small size of FE and mixed landcover composition. This study presents an application of super-resolution mapping (SRM) based on Markov random field for detection of FE using ASTER (15m) images. The SRM results were validated using multispectral IRS LISS-IV (5.8m) image. Non-contiguous FE patches of various sizes and shapes are characterized using the spatial contextual information. The novelty of this approach lies in the identification and separability of small FE pockets which could not be achieved with pixel-based maximum likelihood classifier (MLC). The SRM parameters were optimized and found comparable to previous studies. Classification accuracy obtained with SRM at scale factor 3 is =0.62 that is superior to accuracy of MLC (=0.51). SRM is a promising tool for detection and monitoring of FE at Rutland Island in ANI, India.

J	Garcia, P; Perez, E				Garcia, Pilar; Perez, Eugenia			Mapping of soil sealing by vegetation indexes and built-up index: A case study in Madrid (Spain)	GEODERMA												This study analyzes the most suitable methods for detecting and measuring the soil sealing change caused by urban growth in the city of Madrid, Spain, using remote sensing techniques and GIS. Some irreversible, negative effects of soil sealing are impermeable ground and modified ecosystems (bio-geochemical cycle, water cycles, loss of biodiversity, etc.), which alter matter and energy flows and the ecological functions of the soil. Urban development has often been more concerned with viability and financial profit, to the detriment of the environment. Multi-temporal studies on the processes are assisted by several types of technologies providing geographical information, together with large cartography, photogrammetric and satellite databases. The best soil sealing detection is carried out based on principal component analysis of the images and the SAVI index. Supervised classifications show that from 1984 to 2013 soil sealing in the municipality of Madrid and its surroundings has risen from almost 15% to 24%, an increase of 9%. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Sudhakar			Long term changes in forest cover and land use of Similipal Biosphere Reserve of India using satellite remote sensing data	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												The spatial changes in forest cover of Similipal biosphere reserve, Odisha, India over eight decades (1930-2012) has been quantified by using multi-temporal data from different sources. Over the period, the forest cover reduced by 970.8 km(2) (23.6% of the total forest), and most significantly during the period, 1930-1975. Human-induced activities like conversion of forest land for agriculture, construction of dams and mining activities have been identified as major drivers of deforestation. Spatial analysis indicates that 399 grids (1 grid = 1 x 1 km) have undergone large-scale changes in forest cover (>75 ha) during 1930-1975, while only 3 grids have shown >75 ha loss during 1975-1990. Annual net rate of deforestation was 0.58 during 1930-1975, which has been reduced substantially during 1975-1990 (0.04). Annual gross rate of deforestation in 2006-2012 is indeed low (0.01) as compared to the national and global average. This study highlights the impact and effectiveness of conservation practices in minimizing the rate of deforestation and protecting the Similipal Biosphere Reserve.																	0253-4126	0973-774X				APR	2016	125	3					559	569										WOS:000375930100008						
J	Etzold, J; Munzner, F; Manthey, M				Etzold, Jonathan; Muenzner, Franziska; Manthey, Michael			Sub-alpine and alpine grassland communities in the northeastern Greater Caucasus of Azerbaijan	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: Which are the main sub-alpine and alpine grassland communities in the northeastern Greater Caucasus of Azerbaijan and what are their environmental and anthropogenic drivers? Location: Grasslands at 1800 and 3500 m a.s.l. on northern macroslope of the Greater Caucasus in Azerbaijan near Shahdag Mt. Methods: We established a randomized sampling design with stratification by geomorphology and altitude and validation using remote sensing data. The vegetation survey on 194 releves in a nested plot design of up to 100 m(2) encompassed examiniation of various site conditions. We applied cluster and indicator species analysis for vegetation classification, and indirect multivariate ordination to assess vegetation-environment relationships. Results: We classified 13 unranked communities in two sub-alpine groups and one alpine group, plus the very distinct vegetation around camp sites of semi-nomadic herders. Important drivers for vegetation differentiation are altitude as proxy for temperature, latitude as proxy for orographically founded differences in bedrock and precipitation, aspect, soil factors, such as content of organic matter and variables connected to land-use types and intensity (e.g. pasturing vs hay meadows, browsing tracks). In consequence, also effects on species richness are detectable. Furthermore, we found only partial concordance of our communities with existing vegetation classifications in the Greater Caucasus. Conclusions: A state-of-the-art classification and ordination of regional high-mountain grassland communities and their environmental drivers fills a gap in knowledge about this vegetation. It is widely unknown to international audience and remained almost unstudied during the last 25 yr, when severe shifts in land use remarkably changed the natural conditions. The study can help to identify problems in current grassland management and their consequences for biodiversity conservation. Desirable changes towards sustainable grassland utilization require combined socio-ecological assessments beforehand.																	1402-2001	1654-109X				APR	2016	19	2					316	335		10.1111/avsc.12207								WOS:000374545600015

This area has been the site for many research projects; however, no project has been carried out for forest fire susceptibility assessment. Thus, protection of the forest including fire prevention is one of the main concerns of the local authorities. This work aims to produce a tropical forest fire susceptibility map for the Cat Ba National Park area, which may be helpful for the local authorities in forest fire protection management. To obtain this purpose, first, historical forest fires and related factors were collected from various sources to construct a GIS database. Then, a forest fire susceptibility model was developed using Kernel logistic regression. The quality of the model was assessed using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the ROC curve (AUC), and five statistical evaluation measures. The usability of the resulting model is further compared with a benchmark model, the support vector machine (SVM). The results show that the Kernel logistic regression model has a high level of performance in both the training and validation dataset, with a prediction capability of 92.2%. Since the Kernel logistic regression model outperforms the benchmark model, we conclude that the proposed model is a promising alternative tool that should also be considered for forest fire susceptibility mapping in other areas. The results of this study are useful for the local authorities in forest planning and management.

In this study, Worldview-2 (WV-2) imagery was combined with field sampling to demonstrate the capability of mapping species type, percentage cover, and above-ground biomass of seagrasses in monsoonal southern Thailand. A high accuracy positioning technique, involving the Real Time Kinematic (RTK) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), was used to record field sample data positions and reduce uncertainties in matching locations between satellite and field data sets. Our results showed high accuracy (90.67%) in mapping seagrass distribution and moderate accuracies for mapping percentage cover and species type (73.74% and 75.00%, respectively). Seagrass species type mapping was successfully achieved despite discrimination confusion among Halophila ovalis, Thalassia hemprichii, and Enhalus acoroides species with greater than 50% cover. The green, yellow, and near infrared spectral channels ofWV-2 were used to estimate the above-ground biomass using a multiple linear regression model (RMSE of +/- 10.38 g.DW/m(2), R = 0.68). The average total above-ground biomass was 23.95 +/- 10.38 g.DW/m(2). The seagrass maps produced in this study are an important step towards measuring the attributes of seagrass biodiversity and can be used as inputs to seagrass dynamic models and conservation efforts.

Taking Southwestern China (a typical mountainous region) as an example, this paper established a new HC-MMK approach (Hierarchical Classification based on Multi-source and Multi-temporal data and geo-Knowledge), which was especially designed for land cover mapping in mountainous areas. This approach was taken in order to generate a 30 m-resolution land cover product in Southwestern China in 2010 (hereinafter referred to as CLC-SW2010). The multi-temporal native HJ (HuanJing, small satellite constellation for disaster and environmental monitoring) CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) images, Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) images and topographical data (including elevation, aspect, slope, etc.) were taken as the main input data sources. Hierarchical classification tree construction and a five-step knowledge-based interactive quality control were the major components of this proposed approach. The CLC-SW2010 product contained six primary categories and 38 secondary categories, which covered about 2.33 million km(2) (accounting for about a quarter of the land area of China). The accuracies of primary and secondary categories for CLC-SW2010 reached 95.09% and 87.14%, respectively, which were assessed independently by a third-party group. This product has so far been used to estimate the terrestrial carbon stocks and assess the quality of the ecological environments. The proposed HC-MMK approach could be used not only in mountainous areas, but also for plains, hills and other regions. Meanwhile, this study could also be used as a reference for other land cover mapping projects over large areas or even the entire globe.					tan, jian bo/0000-0002-1483-5995												2072-4292					APR	2016	8	4							305	10.3390/rs8040305								WOS:000375156500038						
J	Moser, L; Schmitt, A; Wendleder, A; Roth, A				Moser, Linda; Schmitt, Andreas; Wendleder, Anna; Roth, Achim			Monitoring of the Lac Bam Wetland Extent Using Dual-Polarized X-Band SAR Data	REMOTE SENSING												Wetlands in semi-arid Africa are vital as water resource for local inhabitants and for biodiversity, but they are prone to strong seasonal fluctuations. Lac Bam is the largest natural freshwater lake in Burkina Faso, its water is mixed with patches of floating or flooded vegetation, and very turbid and sediment-rich. These characteristics as well as the usual cloud cover during the rainy season can limit the suitability of optical remote sensing data for monitoring purposes. This study demonstrates the applicability of weather-independent dual-polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for the analysis of spatio-temporal wetland dynamics. A TerraSAR-X repeat-pass time series of dual-co-polarized HH-VV StripMap data-with intervals of 11 days, covering two years (2013-2015) from the rainy to the dry season-was processed to normalized Kennaugh elements and classified mono-temporally and multi-temporally. Land cover time series and seasonal duration maps were generated for the following four classes: open water, flooded/floating vegetation, irrigated cultivation, and land (non-wetland). The added value of dual-polarimetric SAR data is demonstrated by significantly higher multitemporal classification accuracies, where the overall accuracy (88.5%) exceeds the classification accuracy using single-polarimetric SAR intensity data (82.2%). For relevant change classes involving flooded vegetation and irrigated fields dual-polarimetric data (accuracies: 75%-97%) are favored to single-polarimetric data (42%-87%). This study contributes to a better understanding of the dynamics of semi-arid African wetlands in terms of water areas including water with flooded vegetation, and the location and timing of irrigated cultivations.

Mapping the structure of Borneo's tropical forests across a degradation gradient	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												South East Asia has the highest rate of lowland forest loss of any tropical region, with logging and deforestation for conversion to plantation agriculture being flagged as the most urgent threats. Detecting and mapping logging impacts on forest structure is a primary conservation concern, as these impacts feed through to changes in biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Here, we test whether high-spatial resolution satellite remote sensing can be used to map the responses of aboveground live tree biomass (AGB), canopy leaf area index (LAI) and fractional vegetation cover (FCover) to selective logging and deforestation in Malaysian Borneo. We measured these attributes in permanent vegetation plots in rainforest and oil palm plantations across the degradation landscape of the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems project. We found significant mathematical relationships between field-measured structure and satellite-derived spectral and texture information, explaining up to 62% of variation in biophysical structure across forest and oil palm plots. These relationships held at different aggregation levels from plots to forest disturbance types and oil palms allowing us to map aboveground biomass and canopy structure across the degradation landscape. The maps reveal considerable spatial variation in the impacts of previous logging, a pattern that was less clear when considering field data alone. Up-scaled maps revealed a pronounced decline in aboveground live tree biomass with increasing disturbance, impacts which are also clearly visible in the field data even a decade after logging. Field data demonstrate a rapid recovery in forest canopy structure with the canopy recovering to pre-disturbance levels a decade after logging. Yet, up-scaled maps show that both LAI and FCover are still reduced in logged compared to primary forest stands and markedly lower in oil palm stands. While uncertainties remain, these maps can now be utilised to identify conservation win-wins, especially when combining them with ongoing biodiversity surveys and measurements of carbon sequestration, hydrological cycles and microclimate.

However, there is a lack of unified methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of nature reserves, particularly in China, the world's most populous nation supporting some of the most valuable biodiversity hotspots in the world. In this study, we conducted a long-term and large-scale analysis of the effectiveness of 20 of the earliest nature reserves established in Hainan Province, an island home to among the highest concentration of plants and animals in China. Remote sensing imagery from 1988, 1998, and 2008 were analyzed to investigate the temporal and spatial changes of natural forests in these nature reserves and surrounding areas. We also conducted transition matrix analysis and principle component analysis to identify the driving factors that affect the protection effectiveness of nature reserves. The results were as follows: 1) During the 20-year period from 1988 to 2008, natural forests coverage of the 20 studied nature reserves dropped 2.34 percentage points, whereas the natural forests coverage dropped 11.31 percentage points in a 0-5 km outside reserve buffer and 9.36 percentage points in a 5-10 km outside reserve buffer, indicating a significant inhibitory effect of the nature reserves on the loss of natural forests. 2) Natural forests coverage dropped in 60% of the studied nature reserves during the 20-year period, suggesting a poor protection effectiveness of these reserves, while the coverage proportion showed some increase (0%/yr-5%/yr) in other reserves. 3) Expansion of rubber and pulp forests as part of a booming economy were the main factors affecting the effectiveness of the nature reserves for conserving natural forests in Hainan Province. The results of this study provide an important empirical basis for the protection of natural forests in Hainan Province, which can be used as a blueprint for nature reserve evaluation in other places in China.																	1002-0063	1993-064X				APR	2016	26	2					208	215		10.1007/s11769-016-0800-7								WOS:000372238400008						
J	Li, BBV; Pimm, SL				Li, Binbin V.; Pimm, Stuart L.			China's endemic vertebrates sheltering under the protective umbrella of the giant panda	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												The giant panda attracts disproportionate conservation resources. How well does this emphasis protect other endemic species? Detailed data on geographical ranges are not available for plants or invertebrates, so we restrict our analyses to 3 vertebrate taxa: birds, mammals, and amphibians. There are gaps in their protection, and we recommend practical actions to fill them. We identified patterns of species richness, then identified which species are endemic to China, and then which, like the panda, live in forests. After refining each species' range by its known elevational range and remaining forest habitats as determined from remote sensing, we identified the top 5% richest areas as the centers of endemism. Southern mountains, especially the eastern Hengduan Mountains, were centers for all 3 taxa. Over 96% of the panda habitat overlapped the endemic centers. Thus, investing in almost any panda habitat will benefit many other endemics. Existing panda national nature reserves cover all but one of the endemic species that overlap with the panda's distribution. Of particular interest are 14 mammal, 20 bird, and 82 amphibian species that are inadequately protected. Most of these species the International Union for Conservation of Nature currently deems threatened. But 7 mammal, 3 bird, and 20 amphibian species are currently nonthreatened, yet their geographical ranges are <20,000 km(2) after accounting for elevational restriction and remaining habitats. These species concentrate mainly in Sichuan, Yunnan, Nan Mountains, and Hainan. There is a high concentration in the east Daxiang and Xiaoxiang Mountains of Sichuan, where pandas are absent and where there are no national nature reserves. The others concentrate in Yunnan, Nan Mountains, and Hainan. Here, 10 prefectures might establish new protected areas or upgrade local nature reserves to national status. Los Vertebrados Endemicos de China y su Resguardo bajo la Sombrilla Protectora del Panda GiganteEl panda gigante(Ailuropoda melanoleuca) atrae recursos desproporcionados para la conservacion. Buscamos determinar que tanto este enfasis protege a las demas especies endemicas de China. La informacion detallada para las plantas y los invertebrados no estuvo disponible, asi que restringimos nuestros analisis a las aves, mamiferos y anfibios para los cuales habia disponibilidad de mapas de distribucion en Birdlife International y en la Lista Roja de la UICN. Usamos los datos de extension de estas fuentes para identificar los patrones de la riqueza de especies. Despues identificamos cuales especies son endemicas de China y cuales especies, como el panda, viven en los bosques. Despues de refinar la extension de cada especie de acuerdo a su extension conocida en el gradiente de elevacion y de mantener el bosque como el habitat determinado para la teledeteccion, identificamos al 5% de las areas mas ricas como centros de endemismo. Las montanas del sur, especialmente las montanas Hengduan del este, fueron centros para los tres taxones. Mas del 96% del habitat del panda se traslapo con los centros de endemismo. Asi, invertir en casi cualquier habitat del panda beneficia a muchas otras especies endemicas. Las reservas naturales nacionales en las que se protege al panda cubren a todas salvo a una de las especies endemicas que se traslapa con la distribucion del panda. Para China en su totalidad, son de particular interes 14 especies de mamiferos, 20 de aves y 82 de anfibios que no estan protegidas adecuadamente. La Union Internacional para la Conservacion de la Naturaleza enlista a la mayoria de estas especies como amenazadas, pero 7 especies de mamiferos, 3 de aves y 20 de anfibios estan actualmente como no amenazadas, aunque sus extensiones geograficas sean < 20, 000 km(2) despues de considerar la restriccion de la elevacion y el habitat permaneciente. Estas especies estuvieron concentradas principalmente en cuatro areas: Sichuan, Yunnan, las montanas Nan y Hainan.

Scaling up the diversity-resilience relationship with traitdatabases and remote sensing data: the recovery ofproductivity after wildfire	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Understanding the mechanisms underlying ecosystem resilience - why some systems have an irreversible response to disturbances while others recover - is critical for conserving biodiversity and ecosystem function in the face of global change. Despite the widespread acceptance of a positive relationship between biodiversity and resilience, empirical evidence for this relationship remains fairly limited in scope and localized in scale. Assessing resilience at the large landscape and regional scales most relevant to land management and conservation practices has been limited by the ability to measure both diversity and resilience over large spatial scales. Here, we combined tools used in large-scale studies of biodiversity (remote sensing and trait databases) with theoretical advances developed from small-scale experiments to ask whether the functional diversity within a range of woodland and forest ecosystems influences the recovery of productivity after wildfires across the four-corner region of the United States. We additionally asked how environmental variation (topography, macroclimate) across this geographic region influences such resilience, either directly or indirectly via changes in functional diversity. Using path analysis, we found that functional diversity in regeneration traits (fire tolerance, fire resistance, resprout ability) was a stronger predictor of the recovery of productivity after wildfire than the functional diversity of seed mass or species richness. Moreover, slope, elevation, and aspect either directly or indirectly influenced the recovery of productivity, likely via their effect on microclimate, while macroclimate had no direct or indirect effects. Our study provides some of the first direct empirical evidence for functional diversity increasing resilience at large spatial scales. Our approach highlights the power of combining theory based on local-scale studies with tools used in studies at large spatial scales and trait databases to understand pressing environmental issues.

Biomass production is in turn strongly affected by the frequency and intensity of climate extremes. The aim of this study is to evaluate to what extent species-poor intensively managed agricultural grasslands can maintain their biomass productivity under climate anomalies, as compared to species-rich, semi-natural grasslands. Our hypothesis is that species richness stabilizes biomass production over time. Biomass production stability was assessed in response to drought and temperature anomalies using 14years of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), temperature and drought index time series. More specifically, vegetation resistance (i.e. the ability to withstand the climate anomaly) and resilience (i.e. the recovery rate) were derived using an auto-regressive model with external input variables (ARx). The stability metrics for both grasslands were subsequently compared. We found that semi-natural grasslands exhibited a higher resistance but lower resilience than agricultural grasslands in the Netherlands. Furthermore, the difference in stability between semi-natural and agricultural grasslands was dependent on the physical geography: the most significant differences in resistance were observed in coastal dunes and riverine areas, whereas the differences in resilience were the most significant in coastal dunes and fens.Synthesis and applications. We conclude that semi-natural grasslands show a higher resistance to drought and temperature anomalies compared to agricultural grasslands. These results underline the need to reassess the ways agricultural practices are performed. More specifically, increasing the plant species richness of agricultural grasslands and lowering their mowing and grazing frequency may contribute to buffer their biomass production stability against climate extremes.

Lentinula edodes based GIS mapping, biometabolites and antiinflamatory activity of wild edible mushrooms from tropical 'sacred grove' forests of Meghalaya, India	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												The biodiversity rich state of Meghalaya, India located in the realms of mega-biodiversity hotspots, is home to numerous species of wild edible macrofungi that are used extensively by the mycophillic ethnic population, as a part of their traditional cuisine and medicine systems. However, habitat loss, due to deforestation and climate change, is destroying the natural population of these mushrooms, depleting their availability to the local communities. In the present investigation, a GIS guided habitat search, using Lentinula edodes as a representative species, was used in mapping the habitats of wild edible macrofungi of the study region. Sampling of around 4000 specimens per distinct morphological type available in the traditional markets and "sacred grove" forests indicated presence of ten common genera, belonging to nine different families of wild edible mushrooms. Nutritional profiling of the representative species Lentinula edodes was carried out by evaluation of its moisture, total fat, crude protein and carbohydrates contents by standard methods. Similarly, bioactive components determination was performed by estimation of total phenols, flavonoids, ascorbic acid, beta-carotene and lycopenes. Bioactivity of the mushrooms extracts was studied using the DPPH radical scavenging and Human Red Blood Cell (HRBC) membrane stabilization assays. The present investigation successfully attempted to explore remote sensing technologies and GIS (Geographic Information System) based system to predict the natural habitats of wild edible mushrooms of Meghalaya, India which we believe will lead to the generation of a mushroom specific non-wood forest resource mapping system in the near future. Results of nutritional profiling and biological activity studies on the representative species of wild edible mushrooms from the studied region revealed that it is a rich source of essential nutrients and antioxidants.																	0034-7744	2215-2075				MAR	2016	64	1					247	257		10.15517/rbt.v64i1.20349								WOS:000381953400021	28862816					
J	Zhang, ZB; Ke, CQ				Zhang, Zuobang; Ke, Changqing			Monitoring and analysis of changes in a wetland landscape in Xingzi county	EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS												Wetlands play an important role in water conservation, environmental protection, and biodiversity conservation. Remote sensing is an economical and efficient technique for wetland monitoring which can limit disturbance in sensitive areas and support wetland conservation. In this paper, we used three phases of Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (TM/ETM+) remote sensing images from October 1989, October 1999, and October 2009 to study wetlands in Xingzi County. The images were segmented using the object-oriented remote sensing image interpretation software eCognition Developer 8.64, then segmented images were classified by slope, digital elevation model (DEM) data, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Specific Leaf Area Vegetation Index (SLAVI), and Land and Water Masks (LWM) index to produce land type classification maps. Land use change information was obtained by analyzing the superposition of two classification maps of the wetland area from different years. The results showed that landscape patches in Xingzi County displayed fragmentation in their spatial distribution over time. Based on an index of changes in landscape patches, the fastest growing landscape type is grassland, while the fastest decreasing type is irrigated land. Dominant driving factors of changes in Xingzi County's wetland landscape are population growth and policy changes.																	1865-0473	1865-0481				MAR	2016	9	1					35	45		10.1007/s12145-015-0232-4								WOS:000375341900003

Phylogenetic Structure of Foliar Spectral Traits in Tropical Forest Canopies	REMOTE SENSING												The Spectranomics approach to tropical forest remote sensing has established a link between foliar reflectance spectra and the phylogenetic composition of tropical canopy tree communities vis-a-vis the taxonomic organization of biochemical trait variation. However, a direct relationship between phylogenetic affiliation and foliar reflectance spectra of species has not been established. We sought to develop this relationship by quantifying the extent to which underlying patterns of phylogenetic structure drive interspecific variation among foliar reflectance spectra within three Neotropical canopy tree communities with varying levels of soil fertility. We interpreted the resulting spectral patterns of phylogenetic signal in the context of foliar biochemical traits that may contribute to the spectral-phylogenetic link. We utilized a multi-model ensemble to elucidate trait-spectral relationships, and quantified phylogenetic signal for spectral wavelengths and traits using Pagel's lambda statistic. Foliar reflectance spectra showed evidence of phylogenetic influence primarily within the visible and shortwave infrared spectral regions. These regions were also selected by the multi-model ensemble as those most important to the quantitative prediction of several foliar biochemical traits. Patterns of phylogenetic organization of spectra and traits varied across sites and with soil fertility, indicative of the complex interactions between the environmental and phylogenetic controls underlying patterns of biodiversity.																	2072-4292					MAR	2016	8	3								10.3390/rs8030196								WOS:000373627400102

An accurate and efficient way is needed to estimate grassland health and production for monitoring and adjusting management to get sustainable products and other ecosystem services. Previous studies of grasslands have shown varying relationships between productivity and biodiversity, with most showing either a positive or a hump-shaped relationship where productivity peaks at intermediate diversity. In this study, we used airborne imaging spectrometry combined with ground sampling and eddy covariance measurements to estimate the spatial pattern of production and biodiversity for two sites of contrasting productivity in a southern Alberta prairie ecosystem. Resulting patterns revealed that more diverse sites generally had greater productivity, supporting the hypothesis of a positive relationship between production and biodiversity for this site. We showed that the addition of evenness to richness (using the Shannon Index of dominant species instead of the number of dominant species alone) improved the correlation with optical diversity, an optically derived metric of biodiversity based on the coefficient of variation in spectral reflectance across space. Similarly, the Shannon Index was better correlated with productivity (estimated via NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)) than the number of dominant species alone. Optical diversity provided a potent proxy for other more traditional biodiversity metrics (richness and Shannon index). Coupling field measurements and imaging spectrometry provides a method for assessing grassland productivity and biodiversity at a larger scale than can be sampled from the ground, and allows the integrated analysis of the productivity-biodiversity relationship over large areas.

Major land policies have recently resulted in remarkable landscape modifications throughout the basin. The availability of precise regional land cover change information is crucial to better understand the prevailing dynamics and underlying factors influencing the current processes in such a complex system and can additionally serve as a valuable component for modeling and decision making. Such comprehensive and detailed information is lacking for the Yellow River Basin so far. In this study, we derived land cover characteristics and dynamics from the complete last decade based on optical high-temporal MODIS Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series for the whole Yellow River Basin. After filtering and smoothing for noise reduction with the use of the adaptive Savitzky-Golay filter, the processed time series was used to derive a large variety of phenological and annual metrics. The final classifications for the basin (2003 and 2013) were based on a random forest classifier, trained by reference samples from very high-resolution imagery. The accuracy assessment for all 18 thematic classes, which was based on a 30% reference data split, yielded an overall accuracy of 87% and 84% for 2003 and 2013, respectively. Major land cover and land use changes during the last decade have occurred on the Loess Plateau, where land and conservation reforms triggered large-scale recovery of grassland and shrubland habitat that had been previously covered by agriculture or sparse vegetation. Agricultural encroachment and urban area expansion are other processes influencing the dynamics in the basin. The necessity for regionally-adapted land cover maps becomes obvious when our land cover products are compared to existing global products, where thematic accuracy remains low, particularly in a heterogeneous landscape, such as the Yellow River Basin. The basin-wide novel land cover and land use products of the Yellow River Basin hold a large potential for climate, hydrology and biodiversity modelers, as well as river basin and regional governmental authorities and will be shared upon request.																	2072-4292					MAR	2016	8	3								10.3390/rs8030186								WOS:000373627400085

First, observed field survey based spatial patterns of species richness including threatened species are presented to test their linear relationship with remote sensing based DHI (2001-2010 MODIS). Areas with a high cumulative DHI component are associated with relatively high species richness, and threatened species richness increases in regions with frequently varying levels of the cumulative DHI component. The analysis of geographical and statistical distributions yields the following results on interdependence, polarization and change detection: (1) The decadal mean Cumulative Annual Productivity (DHI- [GRAPHICS] < 4) in Northwest China and (DHI- [GRAPHICS] > 4) in Southeast China are in a stable (positive) relation to the Minimum Annual Apparent Cover (DHI- [GRAPHICS] ) and is positively (negatively) related to the Seasonal Variation of Greenness (DHI- [GRAPHICS] ); (2) The decadal tendencies show bimodal frequency distributions aligned near DHI- [GRAPHICS] ~0.05 and DHI- [GRAPHICS] ~0.5 which separated by zero slopes; that is, regions with both small DHI-min and DHI-sea are becoming smaller and vice versa; (3) The decadal tendencies identify regions of land-cover change (as revealed in previous research). That is, the relation of strong and significant tendencies of the three DHI components with climatic or anthropogenic induced changes provides useful information for conservation planning. These results suggest that the spatial-temporal dynamics of China's terrestrial species and threatened species richness needs to be monitored by first and second moments of remote sensing based information of the DHI.																	2072-4292					MAR	2016	8	3								10.3390/rs8030227								WOS:000373627400083

However, the regional mapping of forest species diversity is still difficult because of the complexity of species distribution and overlapping tree crowns. A new method called "spectranomics" that maps forest species richness based on leaf chemical and spectroscopic traits using imaging spectroscopy was developed by Asner and Martin. In this paper, we use this method to detect the relationships among the spectral, biochemical and taxonomic diversity of tree species, based on 20 dominant canopy species collected in a subtropical forest study site in China. Eight biochemical components (chlorophyll, carotenoid, specific leaf area, equivalent water thickness, nitrogen, phosphorus, cellulose and lignin) are quantified by spectral signatures (R-2 = 0.57-0.85, p < 0.01). We also find that the simulated maximum species number based on the eight optimal biochemical components is approximately 15, which is suitable for most 30 m x 30 m forest sites within this study area. This research may support future work on regional species diversity mapping using airborne imaging spectroscopy.																	2072-4292					MAR	2016	8	3								10.3390/rs8030216								WOS:000373627400095

Two remote sensing techniques, airborne laser scanning (ALS) and structure from motion (SfM) were tested to capture three-dimensional structural information from a small multi-rotor UAV platform. A case study is presented through the analysis of data collected from a 30 x 50 m plot in a dry sclerophyll eucalypt forest with a spatially varying canopy cover. The study provides an insight into the capabilities of both technologies for assessing absolute terrain height, the horizontal and vertical distribution of forest canopy elements, and information related to individual trees. Results indicate that both techniques are capable of providing information that can be used to describe the terrain surface and canopy properties in areas of relatively low canopy closure. However, the SfM photogrammetric technique underperformed ALS in capturing the terrain surface under increasingly denser canopy cover, resulting in point density of less than 1 ground point per m(2) and mean difference from ALS terrain surface of 0.12 m. This shortcoming caused errors that were propagated into the estimation of canopy properties, including the individual tree height (root mean square error of 0.92 m for ALS and 1.30 m for SfM). Differences were also seen in the estimates of canopy cover derived from the SfM (50%) and ALS (63%) pointclouds. Although ALS is capable of providing more accurate estimates of the vertical structure of forests across the larger range of canopy densities found in this study, SfM was still found to be an adequate low-cost alternative for surveying of forest stands.

We assess the status and trends of key ecosystem services in this region where native forest conversion has accelerated to make way for housing and farm development. This is a mountainous forested area that is valuable for both conservation and multiple human uses including recreation and farming. It contains globally significant natural habitats for in situ conservation of biological diversity. A rapid, qualitative, and participatory approach was used including interviews with local households and experts in combination with assessment of land use/cover remote sensing data to identify and map priority ecosystem services in the Geographic Information System (GIS). Based on the interests of the beneficiaries, eight priority services (food production, water supply, raw materials, soil conservation, water regulation, climate regulation, biodiversity, and recreation) were identified and mapped. The results indicate the current typical spatial distribution of the provided services based on structural characteristics of the study landscape and their changing trends through a comparison of past, present and future land use, and land cover. Although food production and recreation have greatly increased in recent decades, the other services, in particular timber production, biodiversity, and water purification and supply are being gradually lost. The results of this study and of others elsewhere should raise awareness of ecosystem service status and trends and the value of examining these since they provide much of the information to inform natural resources policy and decision making. The declines in supply of key ecosystem services both within and outside the protected area are creating conflicts within communities as well as impacting on the integrity of the area and careful planning and conservation is required to provide win-win opportunities.																	1999-4907					MAR	2016	7	3								10.3390/f7030051								WOS:000373700800003

Species richness representation within protected areas is associated with multiple interacting spatial features	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim To assess the relative effects of the spatial features of protected areas (PAs), and their interactions, on species richness representation. Location Continental America and associated islands. Methods We used a novel dataset comprising species richness estimates for amphibians, birds and mammals for more than 400 PAs in the Western Hemisphere. Using spatial tools and remote sensing imagery, we calculated four spatial features for each PA: size, shape index, fragmentation level and proximity to the closest PA. The relative effect size of both PA spatial features and environmental covariates on levels of species richness, and how they interact, were assessed using generalized mixed effect models. Results Spatial features and environmental covariates explained about 61% of the variation in species richness within PAs, with the magnitude of the effect remaining similar among spatial features and taxonomic groups. While area had a positive effect on species richness, shape index and fragmentation had negative effects. Proximity had a significant positive effect only for mammals and a negative effect for all the taxa combined. PA spatial features showed significant interactions between them and with environmental covariates. Main conclusions We provide the first empirical evidence for the combined and interactive effects of terrestrial PA spatial features on predicting species richness. Our results suggest that the spatial features of PAs have an important effect on species richness and while the magnitude of this effect varies across taxonomic groups, its direction is consistent. Additionally, we show that the effect of one spatial design feature can be amplified or attenuated by that of another. These findings contribute towards a better understanding of the effect of spatial features on the performance of PAs and therefore how best to enhance the spatial configuration of existing and future PAs.

During the growing season, MSAV develops to form dense canopy seaweed beds that play a vital role in coastal marine ecosystems and offer great potential to chemical, pharmaceutical, and bio-energy industries. At present, the total biomass and the distribution of the MSAV beds along the coast of Western Australia (WA) are not fully identified and quantified. Therefore, the application of satellite remote sensing data with high spatial resolution for examining the MSAV beds is required. The main objective of the present study was to assess and map the distribution of MSAV at two sites; Rottnest Island and Point Peron, Rockingham, WA, using WorldView-2 (WV2) satellite data. These study sites are important marine protected areas in WA waters with extraordinary documented biodiversity. By means of quantitative quadrat techniques, the MSAV canopy covers and fresh biomass data from the ground truth observations were assessed from September 2012 to December 2014. At Point Peron, the fresh biomass of Sargassum in the inter-tidal zone reached 5651.7 +/- 754.5, 5218.9 +/- 192.6, 1136.6 +/- 526.4, and 3472.2 +/- 434.2 g m(-2) for spring, summer, fall, and winter, respectively. The overall accuracy of the minimum distance method was employed and yielded the highest accuracy rates of 90.93% (Kappa coefficient, kappa = 0.96) and 97.13% (kappa = 0.96) for Rottnest Island and Point Peron, respectively. The Mahalanobis classification with overall accuracy yielded 90.66% (kappa = 0.88) and 94.16% (kappa = 0.85) for Rottnest Island and Point Peron, respectively. The study results revealed that WV2 satellite data provided evidence of the high accuracy of MSAV classification.

If captured over a large extent yet at sufficiently fine spatial grain, cloud cover dynamics may provide key information for delineating a variety of habitat types and predicting species distributions. Here, we develop new near-global, fine-grain (approximate to 1 km) monthly cloud frequencies from 15 y of twice-daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images that expose spatiotemporal cloud cover dynamics of previously undocumented global complexity. We demonstrate that cloud cover varies strongly in its geographic heterogeneity and that the direct, observation-based nature of cloud-derived metrics can improve predictions of habitats, ecosystem, and species distributions with reduced spatial autocorrelation compared to commonly used interpolated climate data. These findings support the fundamental role of remote sensing as an effective lens through which to understand and globally monitor the fine-grain spatial variability of key biodiversity and ecosystem properties.

With a systematic grid-sample-plot investigation and landscape-attributes extraction of SPOT-5 imagery in a tropical forest region in Hainan Island, China, we developed a landscape classification system of land cover, successional stages, and dominant plant functional groups in species-rich forest ecosystems. We classified the study landscape into eight land cover types, four successional stages, and six functional patch types, with accuracies at >= 78%. The patches dominated by the pioneer functional groups were mainly distributed in areas of early recovery stages on sunny slopes at elevations < 850 m, while the climax functional groups had more occupancies in the late recovery stages on shaded slopes at elevations > 850 m. The slope gradient had no significant influence on the patch distribution patterns in the study region. Our results show that species-rich forest landscapes can be classified into patch types of different dominant functional groups and successional stages through remote sensing in conjunction with ground survey and GIS.																	1940-0829					MAR	2016	9	1					135	152		10.1177/194008291600900107								WOS:000373295900007

Our study confirmed that shifting cultivation is still being used to produce subsistence rice throughout the region, but there is a trend of intensification away from shifting cultivation towards permanent rice production, especially near protected areas. While large continuous forest exists today only in the core zones of protected areas, the agricultural matrix is still dominated by a dense cover of tree crops and smaller forest fragments. We believe that this evidence makes a crucial contribution to the development of interventions to prevent further conversion of forest to agricultural land while improving local land users' well-being.

Assessing the Ecological Results of County Green Infrastructure Planning	JOURNAL OF PLANNING EDUCATION AND RESEARCH												This study assesses the process and outcomes of landscape-scale green infrastructure planning as a strategy for supporting biodiversity and ecosystem services. The research examines how nine county planning agencies carry out green infrastructure planning and the effectiveness of those strategies in retaining, preserving, and connecting green space over time. The study develops and applies a new framework for green infrastructure planning and uses remote sensing, land conversion analysis, and a landscape ecology-oriented spatial analysis program (FRAGSTATS) to assess on-the-ground change. Results confirm the relationship between green infrastructure planning and green space outcomes, question conventional metrics, and highlight the importance of strategies that support connectivity and manage growth.																	0739-456X	1552-6577				SPR	2016	36	1					90	104		10.1177/0739456X15598615								WOS:000371659000007						
J	Zhang, L; Weng, QH				Zhang, Lei; Weng, Qihao			Annual dynamics of impervious surface in the Pearl River Delta, China, from 1988 to 2013, using time series Landsat imagery	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Information on impervious surface distribution and dynamics is useful for understanding urbanization and its impacts on hydrological cycle, water management, surface energy balances, urban heat island, and biodiversity. Numerous methods have been developed and successfully applied to estimate impervious surfaces. Previous methods of impervious surface estimation mainly focused on the spectral differences between impervious surfaces and other land covers. Moreover, the accuracy of estimation from single or multi-temporal images was often limited by the mixed pixel problem in coarse- or medium resolution imagery or by the intra-class spectral variability problem in high resolution imagery. Time series satellite imagery provides potential to resolve the above problems as well as the spectral confusion with similar surface characteristics due to phenological change, inter-annual climatic variability, and long-term changes of vegetation. Since Landsat time series has a long record with an effective spatial resolution, this study aimed at estimating and mapping impervious surfaces by analyzing temporal spectral differences between impervious and pervious surfaces that were extracted from dense time series Landsat imagery. Specifically, this study developed an efficient method to extract annual impervious surfaces from time series Landsat data and applied it to the Pearl River Delta, southern China, from 1988 to 2013. The annual classification accuracy yielded from 71% to 91% for all classes, while the mapping accuracy of impervious surfaces ranged from 80.5% to 94.5%. Furthermore, it is found that the use of more than 50% of Scan Line Corrector (SLC)-off images after 2003 did not substantially reduced annual classification accuracy, which ranged from 78% to 91%. It is also worthy to note that more than 80% of classification accuracies were achieved in both 2002 and 2010 despite of more than 40% of cloud cover detected in these two years. These results suggested that the proposed method was effective and efficient in mapping impervious surfaces and detecting impervious surface changes by using temporal spectral differences from dense time series Landsat imagery. The value of full sampling was revealed for enhancing temporal resolution and identifying temporal differences between impervious and pervious surfaces in time series analysis.

However, global variation in forest canopy height and its determinants are poorly known. We used global data on Light Detection and Ranging-derived maximum forest canopy height (H-max) to test hypotheses relating H-max to current climate (water availability, ambient energy and water-energy dynamics), regional evolutionary and biogeographic history, historical climate change, and human disturbance. We derived H-max for 32304 forested 55-km grid cells using 1-km global canopy height data(maximum height of 1-km cells within a 55-km grid). Variation in H-max was related to latitude and biomes, along with environmental and historical variables. Both spatial and non-spatial linear models were used to assess the relative importance of the different hypothesized factors.H-max was inversely related to latitude (i.e. tall canopies at the equator), but with high geographical variability. Actual evapotranspiration and annual precipitation were the factors most correlated to H-max globally, thus supporting the water-energy dynamics hypothesis. However, water limitation emerged as a key factor in tropical and temperate biomes within specific geographic regions, while energy limitation was a more important factor in boreal regions where temperature is more limiting to trees than water.H-max exhibited strong variation among biogeographic regions, supporting the role of regionalevolutionary and biogeographic history in structuring broad-scale patterns in canopy height. Furthermore, there were divergent relationships between climate and H-max between the Southern and Northern Hemispheres, consistent with historical evolutionary contingencies modulating these relationships. Historical climate change was also related to H-max, albeit not as strongly, with shorter canopy heights where late-Quaternary climate has been less stable. In contrast, human disturbance was only weakly related to H-max at the scale (55km) examined here.Synthesis. This study confirms that forest canopy height is strongly controlled by current climate, but also provides evidence for an important supplementary role for regional-historical factors. This highlights the importance of considering evolutionary and biogeographic history for achieving a comprehensive understanding of forest ecosystem properties.

Prescribed moorland burning meets good practice guidelines: A monitoring case study using aerial photography in the Peak District, UK	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Upland moors in the UK have been managed for centuries using rotational prescribed-burning, but in recent years there has been contentious debate over its continuing use due to varying effects on moorland ecosystem services. Prescribed-burning should only be carried out using good-practice codes, which include restrictions on the size, location and frequency of burns. Good burning practice is an indicator of management standards and habitat condition in moorland landscapes. However, there has been little attempt to assess management performance with respect to these restrictions. We investigated prescribed-burning on a case-study estate (Howden Moor) in the Peak District National Park from 1988 to 2009 using management maps and aerial photography. The annual area burned (0.9%) was far below recommendations (10%) and patches were in keepingwith the target sizes specified (mean +/- se: 2370 +/- 70 m(2)). The risk of a large or escaped fire was very low, with less than 1% of fires greater than 15,000 m(2). However, only 28.9% of the total burnable area was burned, leaving the rest unmanaged and accumulating fuel. Future guidelines might recommend the application of prescribed-burning across the range of Calluna vulgaris growth phases, to reduce fuel load and promote biodiversity at the landscape scale. We show that vegetation mapping and aerial photography are an effective method for monitoring prescribed burning practice on moorlands. The information derived from such monitoring studies should lead to greater confidence in the standard of prescribed-burning and adherence to good-practice guidelines and requirements imposed by statutory authorities.

Environmental sensitivity mapping of the coast of Karnataka, west coast of India	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Environmental sensitivity maps have been prepared to identify the sensitive coastal resources, oil spill contingency planning and its results. The present study attempts to identify the environmental sensitivity to the oil spill of Karnataka coast by using GIS and remote sensing techniques. Nearly 300 km long coastline of Karnataka is endowed with a vast variety of natural resources and aesthetics. Several of the rivers that originate in the Western Ghats form wide extensive estuaries, backwaters and mangrove forests before debouching into the Arabian Sea. Besides, several non-vegetal wetlands like beaches, spits, shoals, mudflats, rocky cliffs and a few islands are found scattered all along the coast. A major port (New Mangalore Port), ten minor ports and a naval base (near Karwar) are also situated in the study area. As a result, various ESI types namely: 1A, 1B, 3A, 4, 6B, 8B, 9B, 10A, 10B and 10D were noticed in the study area. Bio-resources such as birds, marine mammals, reptiles (sea turtle), shellfish; and habitats like corals etc.; and human-use resources such as factories, ferry, boat ramp, access to vehicles, beach etc. are mapped in this study.

To protect their diversity and functionality, spatially explicit monitoring systems are needed. In remote areas, monitoring is difficult and recurrent field surveys are costly. By using Lidar or the more cost-effective and repetitive optical satellite data, remote sensing could provide proxies for habitat structure supporting measures for the conservation of biodiversity. Here we compared the explanatory power of both, airborne Lidar and optical satellite data in modeling the spatial distribution of biodiversity of birds across a complex tropical mountain forest ecosystem in southeastern Ecuador. We used data from field surveys of birds and chose three measures as proxies for different laspects of diversity: (i) Shannon diversity as a measure of alpha-diversity that also includes the relative abundance of species, (ii) phylodiversity as a first proxy for functional diversity, and (iii) community composition as a proxy for combined alpha- and beta-diversity. We modeled these diversity estimates using partial least-square regression of Lidar and optical texture metrics separately and compared the models using a leave-one-out validated R-2 and root mean square error. Bird community information was best predicted by both remote sensing datasets, followed by Shannon diversity and phylodiversity. Our findings reveal a high potential of optical texture metrics for predicting Shannon diversity and a measure of community composition, but not for modeling phylodiversity. Generalizing from the investigated tropical mountain ecosystem, we conclude that texture information retrieved from multispectral data of operational satellite systems could replace costly airborne laser-scanning for modeling certain aspects of biodiversity.

Quantification and monitoring of forest cover changes in Agasthyamalai Biosphere Reserve, Western Ghats, India (1920-2012)	CURRENT SCIENCE												Protected areas need to be monitored regularly to realize the effectiveness of conservation measures. In this study, Agasthyamalai Biosphere Reserve of Western Ghats has been monitored for deforestation in a historic time frame. The study attempted to identify the changes that occurred within the Biosphere Reserve from the early 1920s to the recent by mapping the land use/land cover and quantifying the forest cover changes that have occurred in the Biosphere Reserve individually for each conservation zone and protected area. Multi-temporal satellite datasets and topographical maps were used for mapping the forest cover of the study area. Visual interpretation technique involving on screen digitization was used for mapping and post-classification comparison method was used for carrying out change detection process. In addition, grid wise spatial tracking was carried out for the periods of 1920-1973 and 1973-2012 to prioritize change areas. Results showed that 747.1 km(2) of forests have been lost during the period of 1920-2012. The present study demonstrates the importance of long-term land use/land cover information to examine conservation effectiveness by utilizing remote sensing and GIS techniques to carry out best management practices.																	0011-3891					FEB 25	2016	110	4					508	520		10.18520/cs/v110/i4/508-520								WOS:000370491500018

Moving Towards Dynamic Ocean Management: How Well Do Modeled Ocean Products Predict Species Distributions?	REMOTE SENSING												Species distribution models are now widely used in conservation and management to predict suitable habitat for protected marine species. The primary sources of dynamic habitat data have been in situ and remotely sensed oceanic variables (both are considered measured data), but now ocean models can provide historical estimates and forecast predictions of relevant habitat variables such as temperature, salinity, and mixed layer depth. To assess the performance of modeled ocean data in species distribution models, we present a case study for cetaceans that compares models based on output from a data assimilative implementation of the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) to those based on measured data. Specifically, we used seven years of cetacean line-transect survey data collected between 1991 and 2009 to develop predictive habitat-based models of cetacean density for 11 species in the California Current Ecosystem. Two different generalized additive models were compared: one built with a full suite of ROMS output and another built with a full suite of measured data. Model performance was assessed using the percentage of explained deviance, root mean squared error (RMSE), observed to predicted density ratios, and visual inspection of predicted and observed distributions. Predicted distribution patterns were similar for models using ROMS output and measured data, and showed good concordance between observed sightings and model predictions. Quantitative measures of predictive ability were also similar between model types, and RMSE values were almost identical. The overall demonstrated success of the ROMS-based models opens new opportunities for dynamic species management and biodiversity monitoring because ROMS output is available in near real time and can be forecast.																	2072-4292					FEB	2016	8	2							149	10.3390/rs8020149								WOS:000371898800052

Measuring structural complexity underwater is not trivial and researchers have been searching for accurate and cost-effective methods that can be applied across spatial extents for over 50 years. This study integrated a set of existing multi-view, image-processing algorithms, to accurately compute metrics of structural complexity (e.g., ratio of surface to planar area) underwater solely from images. This framework resulted in accurate, high-speed 3D habitat reconstructions at scales ranging from small corals to reef-scapes (10s km(2)). Structural complexity was accurately quantified from both contemporary and historical image datasets across three spatial scales: (i) branching coral colony (Acropora spp.); (ii) reef area (400 m(2)); and (iii) reef transect (2 km). At small scales, our method delivered models with <1 mm error over 90% of the surface area, while the accuracy at transect scale was 85.3% +/- 6% (CI). Advantages are: no need for an a priori requirement for image size or resolution, no invasive techniques, cost-effectiveness, and utilization of existing imagery taken from off-the-shelf cameras (both monocular or stereo). This remote sensing method can be integrated to reef monitoring and improve our knowledge of key aspects of coral reef dynamics, from reef accretion to habitat provisioning and productivity, by measuring and up-scaling estimates of structural complexity.

Remote Sensing of Coral Reefs for Monitoring and Management: A Review	REMOTE SENSING												Coral reefs are in decline worldwide and monitoring activities are important for assessing the impact of disturbance on reefs and tracking subsequent recovery or decline. Monitoring by field surveys provides accurate data but at highly localised scales and so is not cost-effective for reef scale monitoring at frequent time points. Remote sensing from satellites is an alternative and complementary approach. While remote sensing cannot provide the level of detail and accuracy at a single point than a field survey, the statistical power for inferring large scale patterns benefits in having complete areal coverage. This review considers the state of the art of coral reef remote sensing for the diverse range of objectives relevant for management, ranging from the composition of the reef: physical extent, benthic cover, bathymetry, rugosity; to environmental parameters: sea surface temperature, exposure, light, carbonate chemistry. In addition to updating previous reviews, here we also consider the capability to go beyond basic maps of habitats or environmental variables, to discuss concepts highly relevant to stakeholders, policy makers and public communication: such as biodiversity, environmental threat and ecosystem services. A clear conclusion of the review is that advances in both sensor technology and processing algorithms continue to drive forward remote sensing capability for coral reef mapping, particularly with respect to spatial resolution of maps, and synthesis across multiple data products. Both trends can be expected to continue.				Harborne, Alastair/F-6155-2013; Bejarano, Sonia/S-7784-2016; Skirving, William/E-7927-2011; Strong, Alan/E-7924-2011; Heron, Scott/E-7928-2011; Eakin, C.

The fact that fine-scale surveys of grassland plant communities are time-consuming may limit the spatial extent of ground-based diversity surveys. Remote sensing tools have the potential to support field-based sampling and, if remote sensing data are able to identify grassland sites that are likely to support relatively higher or lower levels of species diversity, then field sampling efforts could be directed towards sites that are of potential conservation interest. In the present study, we examined whether aerial hyperspectral (414-2501 nm) remote sensing can be used to predict fine-scale plant species diversity (characterized as species richness and Simpson's diversity) in dry grazed grasslands. Vascular plant species were recorded within 104 (4 m x 4 m) plots on the island of oland (Sweden) and each plot was characterized by a 245-waveband hyperspectral data set. We used two different modeling approaches to evaluate the ability of the airborne spectral measurements to predict within-plot species diversity: (1) a spectral response approach, based on reflectance information from (i) all wavebands, and (ii) a subset of wavebands, analyzed with a partial least squares regression model, and (2) a spectral heterogeneity approach, based on the mean distance to the spectral centroid in an ordinary least squares regression model. Species diversity was successfully predicted by the spectral response approach (with an error of ca. 20%) but not by the spectral heterogeneity approach. When using the spectral response approach, iterative selection of important wavebands for the prediction of the diversity measures simplified the model but did not improve its predictive quality (prediction error). Wavebands sensitive to plant pigment content (400-700 nm) and to vegetation structural properties, such as above-ground biomass (700-1300 nm), were identified as being the most important predictors of plant species diversity. We conclude that hyperspectral remote sensing technology is able to identify fine-scale variation in grassland diversity and has a potential use as a tool in surveys of grassland plant diversity.																	2072-4292					FEB	2016	8	2							133	10.3390/rs8020133								WOS:000371898800025

One reason for this uncertainty lies in the multitude of methodological approaches to sampling biodiversity and productivity, some of which can be subjective. Remote sensing offers new, objective ways of assessing productivity and biodiversity. In this study, we tested the species richness-productivity relationship using a common remote sensing index, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), as a measure of productivity in experimental prairie grassland plots (Cedar Creek). Our study spanned a growing season (May to October, 2014) to evaluate dynamic changes in the NDVI-species richness relationship through time and in relation to environmental variables and phenology. We show that NDVI, which is strongly associated with vegetation percent cover and biomass, is related to biodiversity for this prairie site, but it is also strongly influenced by other factors, including canopy growth stage, short-term water stress and shifting flowering patterns. Remarkably, the NDVI-biodiversity correlation peaked at mid-season, a period of warm, dry conditions and anthesis, when NDVI reached a local minimum. These findings confirm a positive, but dynamic, productivity-diversity relationship and highlight the benefit of optical remote sensing as an objective and non-invasive tool for assessing diversity-productivity relationships.

Assessment and monitoring of long-term forest cover changes (1920-2013) in Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												Western Ghats are considered as one of the global biodiversity hotspots. There is an information gap on conservation status of the biodiversity hotspots. This study has quantified estimates of deforestation in the Western Ghats over a period of past nine decades. The classified forest cover maps for 1920, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2013 indicates 95,446 (73.1%), 63,123 (48.4%), 62,286 (47.7%), 61,551 (47.2%), 61,511 (47.1%) and 61,511 km(2) (47.1%) of the forest area, respectively. The rates of deforestation have been analyzed in different time phases, i.e., 1920-1975, 1975-1985, 1985-1995, 1995-2005 and 2005-2013. The grid cells of 1 km(2) have been generated for time series analysis and describing spatial changes in forests. The net rate of deforestation was found to be 0.75 during 1920-1975, 0.13 during 1975-1985, 0.12 during 1985-1995 and 0.01 during 1995-2005. Overall forest loss in Western Ghats was estimated as 33,579 km(2) (35.3% of the total forest) from 1920's to 2013. Land use change analysis indicates highest transformation of forest to plantations, followed by agriculture and degradation to scrub. The dominant forest type is tropical semi-evergreen which comprises 21,678 km(2) (35.2%) of the total forest area of Western Ghats, followed by wet evergreen forest (30.6%), moist deciduous forest (24.8%) and dry deciduous forest (8.1%) in 2013. Even though it has the highest population density among the hotspots, there is no quantifiable net rate of deforestation from 2005 to 2013 which indicates increased measures of conservation.																	0253-4126	0973-774X				FEB	2016	125	1					103	114		10.1007/s12040-015-0645-y								WOS:000371447200009

To use remote sensing for the estimation of these traits, it is essential to understand the underlying factors that influence their relationships with canopy reflectance. The effect of canopy structures-particularly stem density (SD), leaf area index (LAI), stand height (SH), crown diameter (CD), and average leaf angle (ALA)-on the relationship between LDMC and SLA with the canopy reflectance were investigated using a canopy reflectance dataset simulated by the invertible forest reflectance model (INFORM) radiative transfer model. The parameterization of the model was based on the range of the field parameters collected in the Bavarian National Park in July 2013 and the configuration of the HYSpex hyperspectral sensor. Strong correlations were observed between the two leaf traits and indices derived from simulated canopy spectra in the NIR and SWIR region (R-2 values of 0.87 for LDMC and 0.85 for SLA). Among the tested HYSpex wavelengths, the bands most sensitive to variation were 2298.69 nm for LDMC and 2280.71 nm for SLA. The effects of the stated structural variables on the relationships were best controlled by the modified normalized difference (mND) vegetation index (VI): ([R2275 - R1920]/[R2275 + R1920 - 2 * R1520]). The structural variables that most affected the relationship were forest SD and CD. The modeling results suggest that the spectral variation due to changes in LDMC and SLA is best captured for stands with SD > 400 trees/ha and CD >= 5 m. The influence of LAI and SH on the relationships can be greatly reduced using VIs. We conclude that LDMC and SLA can be accurately estimated from canopy reflectance, irrespective of the heterogeneity of structural variables, providing that canopy cover exceeds 50%.

The main goal of this paper is to demonstrate the implementation and effectiveness of the Forest Canopy Density (FCD) model in producing a remote sensing-based and detailed map of montado canopy density over a large territory in southern Portugal. This map will make a fundamental contribution to accurately identifying and assessing High Nature Value farmland in montado areas. The results reveal that the FCD model is an effective approach to estimating the density classes of montado canopy (overall accuracy = 78.0 %, kappa value = 0.71). The study also shows that the FCD approach generated good user's and producer's accuracies for the three montado canopy-density classes. Globally, the results obtained show that biophysical indices such as the advanced vegetation index, the bare soil index, the shadow index and the thermal index are suitable for estimating and mapping montado canopy-density classes. These results constitute the first remote sensing-based product for mapping montado canopy density that has been developed using the FCD model. This research clearly demonstrates that this approach can be used in the context of Mediterranean agro-forestry systems.

Forest cover changes in Bhutan: Revisiting the forest transition	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Reforestation is observed in several tropical countries, mostly in marginal lands including mountain environments. Bhutan, a landlocked and mountainous country characterized by a long tradition of environmental preservation, is considered as one of the few tropical countries which has experienced a recent forest transition, i.e., a shift from net loss to net increase of forest cover. However, doubts persist regarding the contemporary evolution of forest cover in Bhutan as two recent studies reported opposite trends. The objective of this study was to assess whether a forest transition did indeed recently take place in Bhutan. We used topographically corrected Landsat images from 1990, 2001/2002, and 2011 to detect and quantify forest cover change trajectories over Bhutan. Results of the land cover classifications confirmed that forest cover in Bhutan remained very stable, with a forested area covering more than 60% of the country. For both time periods, gross and net forest cover changes were remarkably small. A trend reversal occurred as a net forest loss of 91 km(2) during the 1990s was followed by a net forest gain of 52 km(2) during the following decade. This small transition resulted from both an increase in rates of forest gain and a decrease in rates of forest loss, mostly affecting the broadleaf forest ecosystem of southern low-elevation districts. Northern districts covered by coniferous forests did not contribute to the forest transition. A spatially explicit comparison of our forest cover change maps with two previous studies highlighted the importance of a robust validation of change detection results and of a topographic correction of remote sensing images in rugged environments, as performed in this study. These recent forest cover changes can be explained by socio-economic and political changes associated with the opening of the country to trade, which induced a gradual transition from subsistence shifting cultivation to market-oriented agriculture. This study confirmed that the high forest cover of Bhutan was maintained since 1990, with a slight increase during the 2000s. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These disturbances often create small patches of successional vegetation and heterogeneous spatial patterns. Airborne LiDAR can detect small-scale disturbances, which are undetectable by conventional remote sensing. Here, our aim was to evaluate the similarity in community composition of tree assemblages after human disturbances in a tropical rainforest in northern Borneo using small-footprint airborne LiDAR. We derived 16 variables related to the height distribution and canopy characteristics from airborne LiDAR data. The similarity in community composition among plots was calculated using ordination analysis (nonmetric multidimensional scaling) based on the number of trees of each species. LiDAR-derived variables were significantly correlated with the similarity in community composition; the strongest correlation was with the canopy laser penetration rate down to 1-m height above ground (r(s) = 0.81, p < 0.001). The predictive model for similarity in community composition developed using the canopy laser penetration rate at 0-m height and the maximum height had R-adj(2) = 0.71 (p < 0.001). We applied this equation to the entire study area and compared the output with the human disturbance histories. A predictive map based on the equation suggested that the similarity in community composition changes in proportion to the degree of human disturbances. Our findings indicate that the similarity attributed to human disturbances in tropical forests can be predicted and monitored by means of airborne LiDAR. This approach could be combined with ground-based monitoring data to map the patterns of biodiversity in tropical rainforest. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Data sets on wetlands required for the representation of aquatic ecosystem biodiversity and systematic wetland conservation planning are typically not available or are inadequate, particularly at country-wide scale, which hinders conservation planning. The improvement in hierarchical classification systems and increased availability of broad-scale data sets offers new opportunities to overcome these limitations. 2. This study demonstrates replicable methods for classifying wetland ecosystem types and condition country-wide using broad-scale data sets in data-scarce countries. 3. A country-wide data set, compiled primarily using remote sensing techniques, was combined with regional and landscape-setting data sets to reflect the ecological and geomorphic biodiversity of wetlands. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) were employed to model wetland types, disturbance indices and identify priority wetlands through threatened faunal species associations using existing data. Accuracy of the national data was assessed through a congruency with two local data sets. 4. Most of the 1 680 306ha of inland wetlands were classified as Natural (80%), of which the majority were located on Valley Floors (68%). However, the national data were found only to represent 54% of wetlands mapped at a local scale, and comparison with local data showed inaccuracies in the types and condition classifications. 5. Problems regarding spatial data quality and scale are discussed and suggestions for improvement are provided. The desktop classification steps can be reproduced easily for other data-scarce countries. Data sets on freshwater ecosystems can assist in raising awareness and influence policy at a national scale.

Historical forest management in Romania is imposing strong legacies on contemporary forests and their management	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Historical forest management can heavily affect contemporary forest management and conservation. Yet, relatively little is known about century-long changes in forests, and that limits the understanding of how past management and land tenure affect current forestry practice and ecosystem conservation. Our goal here was to examine the relationship between historical forest management (as depicted by historical forest cover, species composition, age structure and harvesting data) and contemporary forest patterns in Romania. Romania represents an ideal case-study to examine the effects of historical forest management, because it experienced multiple shifts in forest management regimes since the 1800s due to Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, Romanian, Soviet and later EU policy influences, and because it is both a conservation hotspot harboring some of the largest old-growth forest in Europe, and an important source of timber for international markets. We reviewed forestry literature and statistics since the 19th century to reconstruct a time-series of forest cover, composition, disturbance patterns, and ownership patterns and interpreted these data in light of institutional changes. We further assessed changes in forest cover, forest harvest, species composition and age structure between two points in time (1920s and 2010s) at the county level, using a combination of historical forest statistics, remote sensing data and modeled forest composition. We complemented our national data with three case studies for which we had stand level historical and contemporary forest management data. We found that forest area increased in Romania since 1924 by 5% and that the annual rate of forest harvest between 2000 and 2013 was half of the annual rate between 1912 and 1922, which indicates high potential for forest biodiversity conservation. However, the composition, distribution, and age structure of contemporary forests is also substantially different from historical forests. We found an overall increase in coniferous species and several deciduous species (such as Tilia, Populus, Betula, Alnus sp.), a spatial homogenization of species composition, and more even-aged stands. We also observed a drop from 14% to 9% in the relative abundance of old forests (>100 years). Spikes in forest harvest coincided with times of widespread forest privatization, and drastic institutional changes, such as agrarian reforms, or the onset and collapse of the Soviet Regime. Overall, our results suggest that effects of past management, land ownership and institutional changes can persist for centuries, and affect forest ecosystem composition, health and structure, and consequently ecosystem services and habitat availability. Our findings are scientifically important because they provide evidence for legacies of past management and for the effects of forest privatization on harvesting rates. Our findings are also relevant to forest management and conservation practice, because they highlight that environmentally sound management over long time periods is essential for sustainable forestry and old-growth forest protection in Europe and elsewhere.

Termite mounds alter the spatial distribution of African savanna tree species	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Termite mounds form small islands of enhanced water and soil nutrient availability on otherwise dry and nutrient-poor hill crests, which can have important impacts on the plant community. However, the way in which termite mounds alter the spatial distribution of particular tree species across broad savanna landscapes is poorly understood. We aimed to understand the nature and extent of the relationship between termite mounds and key woody savanna species at landscape scales through the use of airborne remote sensing. Location Kruger National Park, South Africa. Methods We mapped 9894 termite mounds and 666,679 savanna trees from 15 species across two landscapes with contrasting rainfall regimes using airborne imaging spectroscopy and LiDAR data. We then examined changes in tree species densities and community composition with respect to distance from termite mounds. Results In both landscapes, termite mounds reduced overall tree densities over distances up to 10 m from mound centres. However, the effect of termite mounds on tree density differed among species, with some species, typically associated with lowland and riparian habitats, showing increased density near termite mounds. Indeed, changes in overall tree community composition revealed that termite mounds harbour tree communities similar to lowland communities, with this similarity decreasing with increased distance from the nearest mound. Termite effects were more pronounced in the savanna landscape receiving higher annual rainfall, whereas a greater percentage of the landscape was affected in the drier landscape due to higher mound densities. Main conclusions Termite mounds mediate the spatial distribution of tree species in savanna landscapes, increasing the abundance of tree species typically associated with lowland habitats. This contributes to the spatial heterogeneity of savanna vegetation within landscapes and the maintenance of savanna biodiversity.

J	Weissteiner, CJ; Garcia-Feced, C; Paracchini, ML				Weissteiner, Christof J.; Garcia-Feced, Celia; Paracchini, Maria Luisa			A new view on EU agricultural landscapes: Quantifying patchiness to assess farmland heterogeneity	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Mapping and assessment of ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes as required by the EU biodiversity policy need a better characterization of the given landscape typology according to its ecological and cultural values. Such need should be accommodated by a better discrimination of the landscape characteristics linked to the capacity of providing ecosystem services and socio-cultural benefits. Often, these key variables depend on the degree of farmland heterogeneity and landscape patterns. We employed segmentation and landscape metrics (edge density and image texture respectively), derived from a pan-European multi-temporal and multi-spectral remote sensing dataset, to generate a consistent European indicator of farmland heterogeneity, the Farmland Heterogeneity Indicator (FHI). We mapped five degrees of FHI on a wall-to-wall basis (250 m spatial resolution) over European agricultural landscapes including natural grasslands. Image texture led to a clear improvement of the indicator compared to the pure application of Edge Density, in particular to a better detection of small patches. In addition to deriving a qualitative indicator we attributed an approximate patch size to each class, allowing an indicative assessment of European field sizes. Based on CORINE land cover, we identified pastures and heterogeneous land cover classes as classes with the highest degree of FHI, while agroforestry and olive groves appeared less heterogeneous on average. We performed a verification based on a continental and regional scale, which resulted in general good agreement with independently derived data. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Testing the discrimination and detection limits of WorldView-2 imagery on a challenging invasive plant target	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Invasive plants pose significant threats to biodiversity and ecosystem function globally, leading to costly monitoring and management effort. While remote sensing promises cost-effective, robust and repeatable monitoring tools to support intervention, it has been largely restricted to airborne platforms that have higher spatial and spectral resolutions, but which lack the coverage and versatility of satellite-based platforms. This study tests the ability of the WorldView-2 (WV2) eight-band satellite sensor for detecting the invasive shrub mesquite (Prosopis spp.) in the north-west Pilbara region of Australia. Detectability was challenged by the target taxa being largely defoliated by a leaf-tying biological control agent (Gelechiidae: Evippe sp. #1) and the presence of other shrubs and trees. Variable importance in the projection (VIP) scores identified bands offering greatest capacity for discrimination were those covering the near-infrared, red, and red-edge wavelengths. Wavelengths between 400 nm and 630 nm (coastal blue, blue, green, yellow) were not useful for species level discrimination in this case. Classification accuracy was tested on three band sets (simulated standard multispectral, all bands, and bands with VIP scores >= 1). Overall accuracies were comparable amongst all band-sets (Kappa = 0.71-0.77). However, mesquite omission rates were unacceptably high (21.3%) when using all eight bands relative to the simulated standard multispectral band-set (9.5%) and the band-set informed by VIP scores (11.9%). An incremental cover evaluation on the latter identified most omissions to be for objects <16 m(2). Mesquite omissions reduced to 2.6% and overall accuracy significantly improved (Kappa = 0.88) when these objects were left out of the confusion matrix calculations. Very high mapping accuracy of objects >16 m(2) allows application for mapping mesquite shrubs and coalesced stands, the former not previously possible, even with 3 m resolution hyperspectral imagery. WV2 imagery offers excellent portability potential for detecting other species where spectral/spatial resolution or coverage has been an impediment. New generation satellite sensors are removing barriers previously preventing widespread adoption of remote sensing technologies in natural resource management.

Natural environments, nature relatedness and the ecological theater: connecting satellites and sequencing to shinrin-yoku	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGICAL ANTHROPOLOGY												Recent advances in research concerning the public health value of natural environments have been remarkable. The growing interest in this topic (often housed under terms such as green and/or blue space) has been occurring in parallel with the microbiome revolution and an increased use of remote sensing technology in public health. In the context of biodiversity loss, rapid urbanization, and alarming rates of global non-communicable diseases (many associated with chronic, low-grade inflammation), discussions of natural vis-a-vis built environments are not merely fodder for intellectual curiosity. Here, we argue for increased interdisciplinary collaboration with the aim of better understanding the mechanisms-including aerobiological and epigenetic-that might help explain some of the noted positive health outcomes. It is our contention that some of these mechanisms are related to ecodiversity (i.e., the sum of biodiversity and geodiversity, including biotic and abiotic constituents). We also encourage researchers to more closely examine individual nature relatedness and how it might influence many outcomes that are at the interface of lifestyle habits and contact with ecodiversity.																	1880-6805					JAN 13	2016	35									10.1186/s40101-016-0083-9								WOS:000368055200001

Rates and drivers of mangrove deforestation in Southeast Asia, 2000-2012	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												The mangrove forests of Southeast Asia are highly biodiverse and provide multiple ecosystem services upon which millions of people depend. Mangroves enhance fisheries and coastal protection, and store among the highest densities of carbon of any ecosystem globally. Mangrove forests have experienced extensive deforestation owing to global demand for commodities, and previous studies have identified the expansion of aquaculture as largely responsible. The proportional conversion of mangroves to different land use types has not been systematically quantified across Southeast Asia, however, particularly in recent years. In this study we apply a combined geographic information system and remote sensing method to quantify the key proximate drivers (i.e., replacement land uses) of mangrove deforestation in Southeast Asia between 2000 and 2012. Mangrove forests were lost at an average rate of 0.18% per year, which is lower than previously published estimates. In total, more than 100,000 ha of mangroves were removed during the study period, with aquaculture accounting for 30% of this total forest change. The rapid expansion of rice agriculture in Myanmar, and the sustained conversion of mangroves to oil palm plantations in Malaysia and Indonesia, are identified as additional increasing and under-recognized threats to mangrove ecosystems. Our study highlights frontiers of mangrove deforestation in the border states of Myanmar, on Borneo, and in Indonesian Papua. To implement policies that conserve mangrove forests across Southeast Asia, it is essential to consider the national and subnational variation in the land uses that follow deforestation.

Therefore, it is essential in the forest management and biodiversity policy context to monitor and assess forest fragmentation using reliable data from remote sensing and GIS. This chapter focuses on the assessment and mapping forest fragmentation in two mountain regions in Bulgaria (part of the Eastern Rhodopes Mountain) and in Slovakia (the Tatra Mountains). The aim is to point out the correlation between the observed land cover changes during the 22-year period from 1990 to 2012 and forest fragmentation, which affects loss of biodiversity. The landscape fragmentation tool (LFT v2.0) was used to map the forest fragmentation and to analyze the forest pattern. The results indicate more signifi cant forest fragmentation in the Tatra Mountains and decrease of the compact forest areas (i.e., core forest) in both mountain regions. The main causes for forest fragmentation were natural disasters and human activities. Generated maps identify areas in which to focus management efforts aimed at minimizing forest fragmentation.																			978-3-319-20110-8; 978-3-319-20109-2				2016							167	181		10.1007/978-3-319-20110-8_11	10.1007/978-3-319-20110-8							WOS:000417781700012

Recommendations for the Next Generation of Global Freshwater Biological Monitoring Tools	ADVANCES IN ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH, VOL 55: LARGE-SCALE ECOLOGY: MODEL SYSTEMS TO GLOBAL PERSPECTIVES	Advances in Ecological Research											Biological monitoring has a long history in freshwaters, where much of the pioneering work in this field was developed over a 100 years ago-but few of the traditional monitoring tools provide the global perspective on biodiversity loss and its consequences for ecosystem functioning that are now needed. Rather than forcing existing monitoring paradigms to respond to questions they were never originally designed to address, we need to take a step back and assess the prospects for novel approaches that could be developed and adopted in the future. To resolve some of the issues with indicators currently used to inform policymakers, we highlight new biological monitoring tools that are being used, or could be developed in the near future, which (1) consider less-studied taxonomic groups, (2) are standardised across regions to allow global comparisons, and (3) measure change over multiple time points. The new tools we suggest make use of some of the key technological and logistical advances seen in recent years-including remote sensing, molecular tools, and local-to-global citizen science networks. We recommend that these new indicators should be considered in future assessments of freshwater ecosystem health and contribute to the evidence base for global to regional (and national) assessments of biodiversity and ecosystem services: for example, within the emerging framework of the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services.

This chapter examines two challenges to tropical forest conservation-the demand for use of land for multiple and continuous spatially and temporally linked purposes, and the gaps in our knowledge to fully understand and characterize resulting land cover change dynamics. This chapter uses the case of the biodiversity hot spot of Madre de Dios in Peru as an example. Here, land-use competition is largely resultant from mutually exclusive activities of Brazil nut harvesting, which depends on intact primary forest, development through construction of the Interoceanic Highway and legal and illegal mining of gold. The analysis compares areas with authorized land-use allocations against remotely sensed satellite data to identify past land cover change events and areas of potential land-use competition and conflict. Based on the case study, this chapter illustrates the increasing importance of distal and transnational commodity demands as a driver for land-use change. Further, it discusses the advantages and caveats of spatially and temporally explicit quantification of change using remote sensing techniques. For the latter, it focusses on issues of simplicity and system boundary definitions that may overlook relevant connections to distal drivers and forest/non-forest functions. This chapter concludes that teleconnected systems that drive local land-use and land cover change (LULCC) must be accounted for when mapping land disturbance dynamics, and discusses the potential paths that remote sensing analysis may take to understand and address these challenges.																			978-3-319-33628-2; 978-3-319-33626-8				2016	6						111	123		10.1007/978-3-319-33628-2_7	10.1007/978-3-319-33628-2							WOS:000409534500008

In a pilot research project, we integrate changes in different types of ES along a gradient of land-and seascape units (terrestrial, coastal and marine). This gradient includes developed urban and peri-urban areas, and undeveloped areas including submerged lands in the coastal (territorial) waters of Israel. The emphasis in our research is on development of a practical methodology for sustainable (urban and rural) development. Goals of the pilot project presented here include: (1) evaluation of various ecosystem services based on categorical indicators for each of the four ES types: provisional, regulating, supporting and cultural; (2) development of a method that can be used on a wider scale across varying landscape units; and (3) refinement of scenario building relevant to local planning institutions and frameworks. The project's final product consists of GIS-generated maps. These maps are the basis for weighing trade-offs in ES across relevant land-and seascape units in the Mt. Carmel region of Israel. Despite some limitations, this approach to ES assessment is helpful, and if improved upon in some of the ways described herein, it can provide the first steps for infusing ES values within planning frameworks in Israel and beyond.																			978-3-319-26218-5; 978-3-319-26216-1				2016	14						23	41		10.1007/978-3-319-26218-5_3	10.1007/978-3-319-26218-5							WOS:000398203700003

Land Use Change Assessment, Prediction Using Remote Sensing, and GIS Aided Markov Chain Modelling at Eleyele Wetland Area, Nigeria	JOURNAL OF SETTLEMENTS AND SPATIAL PLANNING												Land use change involve changes in the area extent of a given type of land use or cover and such changes have significant impact on natural and human environment at all geographic scales. We performed a land use classification and analysis by using GIS and Remote sensing technique, and GIS aided 'Markov Cellular Automata' technique was used to model the land use change and determine the magnitude, rate and dynamics of change in the spatial extent of the Eleyele wetland area, Nigeria. We also identified the factor responsible for the observed changes with the objectives of predicting future change in the next 30 years. Four multi-temporal datasets comprising Landsat TM 1984, 2000 and Landsat OLI/TIRS 2014 imageries were classified using ArcGIS 10.0 version with support of ground truth data. Post-classification comparison with GIS overlay to map the spatial dynamics of land use/cover change was conducted. Land use Change Modeller (LCM) and Markovian processes were employed to analyze the pattern and trend of change. Based on the past trend of land use changes (from 1984 to 2014), the future land use map of Eleyele wetland area for the year of 2044 was generated using the neural network built-in module in the Idrisi Selva. The study revealed that the lake area decreased from 1.28 km(2) in 1984 to 0.99 km(2) in 2000 and further to 0.60 km(2) in 2014. The study concluded that the increase in built area around the lake has resulted in the loss of vegetal cover, which has a negative implication for biodiversity conservation in the study area. This type of research will help shaping the urban form of the city in a planned manner.																	2069-3419	2248-2199					2016	7	1					51	63		10.19188/06JSSP012016								WOS:000408238700006

By combining a multi-source merging method and aerial photo-interpretation, we analyzed land cover dynamics during the 1998-2009 period. The analysis across 3 dates of the cartographic database for the 4450km(2) at 1: 15,000 scale, with of 23 land cover types, showed a rapid and steady urban growth at the expense of agricultural areas, with an expansion greater than 6% during the ten-year period. A synthetic overview of changes at municipality scale showed the prominence of newly artificialized areas not only in the valleys around Grenoble but also in the main, predominantly agricultural plain areas of Bievre and Voiron. Most of the changes are contiguous to already urbanized areas. Therefore they induce limited landscape fragmentation, as new built-up areas are emerging alongside existing ones or within existing ones as part of a densification process. The results obtained for this area illustrate an emerging major preoccupation in the Western European Alps (Switzerland, Italy, Austria...), namely that the present rate of urbanization is not sustainable in the longer run in fragile Alpine valleys. In this respect, our cartographic database will provide baseline information for a participatory prospective exercise performed with local stakeholders of the Grenoble region, aiming to support sustainable land management and planning.																	1278-3366						2016									UNSP 791	10.4000/cybergeo.27800								WOS:000404585900058

Analysis of deforestation pattern in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria	JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE												This study examines deforestation in a part of the Niger Delta region of Nigeria between 1987 and 2013 using remote sensing data and geographic information systems. The results indicate an increasing rate of deforestation, an increasing rate of water body loss and a decreasing rate of exposed surface/settlement increase. The results also show that the rate at which cropland/secondary vegetation is increasing is above average while sandbar is increasing below average. The implications of these changes include environmental degradation resulting from loss of biodiversity and loss of forest goods and services. These losses can also affect the social and economic conditions of local people. The study recommends that policies and strategies targeted at slowing down the rate of forest loss and degradation should be pursued.																	1747-423X	1747-4248					2016	11	1					113	130		10.1080/1747423X.2014.965279								WOS:000404054400007

This research utilizes field surveys and analyses of multi-resolution remote sensing images to clarify the impact on landscapes caused by this disaster and also to monitor the subsequent survival and recovery process in the Sendai Bay region. MODIS data (250 m resolution) were employed to map the overall extent of inundation and damage on the regional landscape scale. The major damage caused by the tsunami, destruction of coastal pine forests and inundation of rice paddies on the plain, was identified at this level. Progressively finer-scale analyses were then implemented using SPOT/HRG-2 (10 m resolution) data, GeoEye-1 fine-resolution data (0.5 m), very fine-resolution aerial photographs (10 cm) and LiDAR. These results demonstrated the minute details of the damage and recovery process down to the level of individual groves and trees. The results of the research show that on the wide-scale regional level, plant communities on rocky cliffs along the rias-style Sanriku Coast survived relatively intact, but coastal forests and other vegetations on sandy beaches and other low-lying coasts were severely damaged. Finer-scale analyses of a coastal pine forest in the Sendai Bay area showed that local topography influenced the patterns of damage and survival for individual trees. At the finest level, damaged pine forests and sandy beach vegetation could be seen recovering only a little more than a year after the disaster. Continuous monitoring using fieldwork and remote sensing is required for balanced regional strategies that provide for economic and social recovery as well as restoration of vegetation, biodiversity and vital ecotones.																	2191-0707		978-4-431-56448-5; 978-4-431-56446-1				2016							253	269		10.1007/978-4-431-56448-5_16	10.1007/978-4-431-56448-5							WOS:000402094400017

Sand dunes and coastal forests received direct impacts from the tsunami, while some new hygrophyte communities were generated from buried seeds in the remains of rice paddies. Although natural recoveries of vegetation (e.g., from open water to wet grassland) were observed at some areas, artificial impacts such as reconstruction projects turned wetland plant communities into artificial bare land. Some places (e.g., reclaimed lake) were turned back to original environment by the comparison with the land cover of 100 years before the earthquake. Many shorelines that had receded due to erosion accompanied with the tsunami had made early recovery except for some river mouth bars and pocket beaches. Distribution of seaweed (Phaeophyceae spp.) seemed to have little impacts. On the other hand, seagrass (Zostera spp.), which generally grow on the sediment of sand and silt, had heavy impact because the tsunami swiped the sediment away although many cases of recovery of seagrass beds were observed 4 years after the earthquake. Moreover, fauna and flora survey in key sites and monitoring on pre-surveyed sites of tidal flats, seagrass beds, seaweed beds, and seabird breeding sites have been conducted. According to the series of the surveys, the living organisms were seemed to be adapted to the natural disturbance although some were still in the middle of recovery process. All of the data of these survey results were archived and are disclosed at "Shiokaze Natural Environment Log" <http://www.shiokaze.biodic.go.jp/>.																	2191-0707		978-4-431-56448-5; 978-4-431-56446-1				2016							395	410		10.1007/978-4-431-56448-5_23	10.1007/978-4-431-56448-5							WOS:000402094400024

However, the optical and lidar remote sensing technologies are only suitable for the seabed study in shallow and clear coastal waters due to rapid light attenuation with water depth [2]. The development of the acoustic remote sensing techniques such as multibeam echo-sounders system, becomes the only effective way to map a large area of seabed from the water depths of hundreds to thousands of meters [3]. The modern multibeam echo-sounders system is capable of emitting and receiving hundreds of narrow-angle beams which create small footprints on the seabed. As a result, it is able to accurately map the seabed of the whole survey area.																	2153-6996		978-1-5090-3332-4				2016							987	990		10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729250								WOS:000388114601026

Thus, the IUCN Council recently adopted a new Red List criteria as a global standard for ecosystem risk assessment, aims to establish a global Red List of ecosystem. Remote sensing is one of the most powerful technology for earth observation at macro-scale, which have great potential to impetus the establishment of a global Red List of ecosystem. Here we operated a systematic assessment of ecosystems with this protocol in Southwestern China, to present the procedure of assessment for biodiversity at ecosystem level based on remote sensing data and test the applicability of IUCN Red List criteria in high heterogeneous region. The result show that the red lists of this area contain all the nationally protected types of Atlas of China's vegetation, which means the high robustness of the protocol.

This paper attempts to propose a simple, practical and automatic method to produce the ecosystem map in mountainous areas by fusing multi-source data and the related knowledge. The multi-source data included the 30m-resolution land cover map and the vegetation map of China (1: 1 000 000). Three fusion strategies were contained in the proposed approach: hard matching, buffer matching and merged categories matching. Meanwhile, the related spatial distribution knowledge and the law of spatial distance decay were used to determine the optimal vegetation type, when more than two vegetation types are matched simultaneously. Taking the Southwestern China as study area, a new 30m-resolution ecosystem map with 144 ecosystem types was generated by the proposed method, which was used to establish the red list of ecosystems and evaluate the condition of biodiversity in the White Paper: China's Biodiversity.					tan, jian bo/0000-0002-1483-5995												2153-6996		978-1-5090-3332-4				2016							1344	1347		10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729342								WOS:000388114601116

Therefore, agricultural land often needs to be converted to nature. Lowering soil nitrogen and phosphorus levels appears to be a necessary prerequisite for a successful restoration. To select which agricultural fields are most suitable for conversion to natural habitats, large and expensive soil monitoring campaigns are actually executed in situ. n this paper, it is demonstrated that hyperspectral satellite imagery, acquired by the EO-1 Hyperion sensor, has a large potential to substitute the current method. This is demonstrated in a qualitative regional study, where ground water analyses are used to derive the correlation between nutrient concentrations and spectral bands. Additionally, a pair-wise index is calculated for each band and compared with in-situ values. For this study, it is stated that the concentration of nutrients can be explained by a linear model using at least one or two spectral bands, with R-2 correlations between 0.4 and 0.7.																	2153-6996		978-1-5090-3332-4				2016							3114	3117		10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729805								WOS:000388114603034

Supported by the Carbon Special Program and the Ecological Decade Program, the spatial patterns of land cover changes and its driving forces were investigated in Southwestern China from 1990 to 2010 in this paper. The residential land expansion, croplands lost, plateau lake extension and shrinkage, forests recovery and increasing rubber and orchard plantations are the general characteristics of land cover changes in Southwestern China. National macro-policies (such as Western Development Strategy and Ecological Protection Projects), urbanization, rural labors transfer, hydropower development, climate change and natural disasters are the main driving forces for land cover changes in this region over the last two decades.																	2153-6996		978-1-5090-3332-4				2016							5445	5448		10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730418								WOS:000388114605094

To monitor the thermal pollution of cooling-water discharge from the coal-fired power plants and nuclear power plant in the eastern coastal region in China, the mono-window algorithm for retrieving sea surface temperature (SST) from thermal infrared bands of Landsat TM/ETM+, and HJ IRS data is improved by integrating the atmospheric correction model. The SST variability influenced by the thermal discharge from the coal-fired power plants and nuclear power plant near Xiangshan Harbour, Tianwan and Yueqing Bay in the eastern coastal area in China is investigated by comparing the distributions of SST around the power plants before and after the operation of the power plants. The results indicate that the spatial variability of SST rise depends on the installed capacity of power plants, coastal terrain, tide, etc. Although the area where the SST rise is more than 3. was not large, thermal discharge still exerts impact on ecosystems within the bay to some degree due to the relatively closeness of the environment of the bay. Taking the coastal terrain near the power plants into consideration, more reasonable operation projects of the power plants and the design of the intake and discharge mouth should be set up in order to accelerate the dilution, diffusion and cooling of the thermal plume under the influence of discharged flow of the rivers, and reduce the impact of thermal pollution on the ecological community with high biodiversity in the intertidal zone.																	2153-6996		978-1-5090-3332-4				2016							7659	7662		10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730997								WOS:000388114607117

Benthic habitat mapping is defined as plotting the distribution and extent of habitats to create a map with complete coverage of the seabed showing distinct boundaries separating adjacent habitats or the use of spatially continuous environmental data sets to represent and predict biological patterns on the seafloor. Seagrass is an essential endemic marine species that prevents coast erosion and regulates carbon dioxide absorption in both undersea and atmosphere. Fishing, mining, pollution and other human activities cause serious damage to seabed ecosystems and reduce benthic biodiversity. According to the latest studies, only 5-10% of the seafloor is mapped, therefore it is not possible to manage resources effectively, protect ecologically important areas. In this study, it is aimed to map seagrass cover using Landsat 8 OLI images in the northern part of Mediterranean coast of Turkey. After pre-processing (e.g. radiometric, atmospheric, water depth correction) of Landsat images, coverage maps are produced with supervised classification using in-situ data which are underwater photos and videos. Result maps and accuracy assessment are presented and discussed.

BIODIVERSITY MAPPING VIA NATURA 2000 CONSERVATION STATUS AND EBV ASSESSMENT USING AIRBORNE LASER SCANNING IN ALKALI GRASSLANDS	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VIII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				Biodiversity is an ecological concept, which essentially involves a complex sum of several indicators. One widely accepted such set of indicators is prescribed for habitat conservation status assessment within Natura 2000, a continental-scale conservation programme of the European Union. Essential Biodiversity Variables are a set of indicators designed to be relevant for biodiversity and suitable for global-scale operational monitoring. Here we revisit a study of Natura 2000 conservation status mapping via airbone LIDAR that develops individual remote sensing-derived proxies for every parameter required by the Natura 2000 manual, from the perspective of developing regional-scale Essential Biodiversity Variables. Based on leaf-on and leaf-off point clouds (10 pt/m(2)) collected in an alkali grassland area, a set of data products were calculated at 0.5 x0.5 m resolution. These represent various aspects of radiometric and geometric texture. A Random Forest machine learning classifier was developed to create fuzzy vegetation maps of classes of interest based on these data products. In the next step, either classification results or LIDAR data products were selected as proxies for individual Natura 2000 conservation status variables, and fine-tuned based on field references. These proxies showed adequate performance and were summarized to deliver Natura 2000 conservation status with 80% overall accuracy compared to field references. This study draws attention to the potential of LIDAR for regional-scale Essential Biodiversity variables, and also holds implications for global-scale mapping. These are (i) the use of sensor data products together with habitat-level classification, (ii) the utility of seasonal data, including for non-seasonal variables such as grassland canopy structure, and (iii) the potential of fuzzy mapping-derived class probabilities as proxies for species presence and absence.																	2194-9034						2016	41	B8					1293	1299		10.5194/isprsarchives-XLI-B8-1293-2016								WOS:000393156000217

As part of the European Union Biodiversity Strategy Plan for 2020, the protection and development of green-infrastructures is strengthened in urban areas. In order to evaluate and monitor the quality of the green infra-structures, this article investigates contributions of Pleiades multi-angular images to extract and characterize low and high urban vegetation. From such images one can extract both spectral and elevation information from optical images. Our method is composed of 3 main steps : (1) the computation of a normalized Digital Surface Model from the multi-angular images; (2) Extraction of spectral and contextual features; (3) a classification of vegetation classes (tree and grass) performed with a random forest classifier. Results performed in the city of Rennes in France show the ability of multi -angular images to extract DEM in urban area despite building height. It also highlights its importance and its complementarity with contextual information to extract urban vegetation.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0420-9; 978-1-5106-0421-6				2016	10008								UNSP 100080H	10.1117/12.2241162								WOS:000391362900014

LEAF AREA INDEX RETRIEVED FROM THERMAL HYPERSPECTRAL DATA	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				Leaf area index (LAI) is an important essential biodiversity variable due to its role in many terrestrial ecosystem processes such as evapotranspiration, energy balance, and gas exchanges as well as plant growth potential. A novel approach presented here is the retrieval of LAI using thermal infrared (8-14 mu m, TIR) measurements. Here, we evaluate LAI retrieval using TIR hyperspectral data. Canopy emissivity spectral measurements were recorded under controlled laboratory conditions using a MIDAC (M4401-F) illuminator Fourier Transform Infrared spectrometer for two plant species during which LAI was destructively measured. The accuracy of retrieval for LAI was then assessed using partial least square regression (PLSR) and narrow band index calculated in the form of normalized difference index from all possible combinations of wavebands. The obtained accuracy from the PLSR for LAI retrieval was relatively higher than narrow-band vegetation index (0.54<R-2<0.74). The results demonstrated that LAI may successfully be estimated from hyperspectral thermal data. The study highlights the potential of hyperspectral thermal data for retrieval of vegetation biophysical variables at the canopy level for the first time.																	2194-9034						2016	41	B7					99	105		10.5194/isprsarchives-XLI-B7-99-2016								WOS:000393155900016

USING REMOTE SENSING AND GIS TECHNIQUES TO DETECT CHANGES TO THE PRINCE ALFRED HAMLET CONSERVATION AREA IN THE WESTERN CAPE, SOUTH AFRICA	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				Understanding and identifying the spatial-temporal changes in the natural environment is crucial for monitoring and evaluating conservation efforts, as well as understanding the impact of human activities on natural resources, informing responsible land management, and promoting better decision-making. Conservation areas are often under pressure from expanding farming and related industry, invasive alien vegetation, and an ever-increasing human settlement footprint. This study focuses on detecting changes to the Prince Alfred Hamlet commonage, near Ceres in the Cape Floral Kingdom. It was chosen for its high conservation value and significance as a critical water source area. The study area includes a fast-growing human settlement footprint in a highly productive farming landscape. There are conflicting development needs as well as risks to agricultural production, and both of these threaten the integrity of the ecosystems which supply underlying services to both demands on the land. Using a multi-disciplinary approach and high-resolution satellite imagery, land use and land cover changes can be detected and classified, and the results used to support the conservation of biodiversity and wildlife, and protect our natural resources. The aim of this research is to study the efficacy of using remote sensing and GIS techniques to detect changes to critical conservation areas where disturbances can be understood, and therefore better managed and mitigated before these areas are degraded beyond repair.																	2194-9034						2016	41	B7					475	481		10.5194/isprsarchives-XLI-B7-475-2016								WOS:000393155900073

SATELLITE, AIRBORNE AND UAV IMAGERY TO TACKLE PLANT INVASIONS	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				Invasive plant species represent a serious threat to biodiversity and landscape as well as human health and socio-economy. To successfully fight plant invasions, new methods enabling fast and efficient monitoring, such as remote sensing, are needed. In an ongoing project, optical remote sensing (RS) data of different origin (satellite, aerial and UAV), spectral (panchromatic, multispectral and color), spatial (very high to medium) and temporal resolution, and various technical approaches (object-, pixel- based and combined) are tested to choose the best strategies for monitoring of four invasive plant species (giant hogweed, black locust, tree of heaven and exotic knotweeds). In our study, we address trade-offs between spectral, spatial and temporal resolutions required for balance between the precision of detection and economic feasibility. For the best results, it is necessary to choose best combination of spatial and spectral resolution and phenological stage of the plant in focus. For species forming distinct inflorescences such as giant hogweed iterative semi-automated object-oriented approach was successfully applied even for low spectral resolution data (if pixel size was sufficient) whereas for lower spatial resolution satellite imagery or less distinct species with complicated architecture such as knotweed, combination of pixel and object based approaches was used. High accuracies achieved for very high resolution data indicate the possible application of described methodology for monitoring invasions and their long-term dynamics elsewhere, making management measures comparably precise, fast and efficient. This knowledge serves as a basis for prediction, monitoring and prioritization of management targets.

The development goal of the Project is to contribute to stop biodiversity loss by supporting the development of conservation strategies. An important step in developing conservation of biodiversity requires a successful groundwater protection. Conservation of biodiversity depends on groundwater needs strategies that allows for the use of groundwater in a way that is compatible with the persistence of ecosystems in natural area, such as Limpopo Transfrontier Park, in the Southern African Region. Groundwater is a key element n the SADC region Groundwater is the primary source of water for people living in the SADC region, because it is used extensively throughout the southern African region, including the Limpopo River basin, supplying a large percentage of water for irrigation, rural water supply schemes and mining. The province has limited surface and ground water resources. Most of the water management areas are severely stressed and many people still do not have access to the accepted minimum supply of water. The goal of the strategy is to make sure that the water resources of protected areas are managed in an equitable manner so as to ensure the long-term sustainability of those resources, in order to the continue availability and security of supply of suitable quality water for all consumptive users and for the needs of the environment. Crystalline basement rock is distributed extensively throughout Africa and underlies large parts of the semi-arid Limpopo Province in South Africa. The development of crystalline basement aquifers as a reliable source of water supply is notoriously complex, and groundwater occurrence is spatially highly variable. Some of the greatest groundwater needs occur in the region and groundwater is the only dependable source of water for many users. The aim of the study is to provide an assessment of the actual groundwater monitoring network and in consideration of the growing demand for water, there is a need to understand the effects of planting on water rescouces to estimate crop water requirement for the focus area, as last step of the methodological strategy. This paper would outline a methodology on where to focuse future research.

Operational Remote Sensing services increased manifolds in the region with the establishment of North Eastern Space Applications Centre (NESAC) in the year 2000. Since inception, NESAC has been providing remote sensing services in generating inventory, planning and developmental activities, and management of natural resources, disasters and dissemination of information and services through geo-web services for NER. The operational remote sensing services provided by NESAC can be broadly divided into three categories viz. natural resource planning and developmental services, disaster risk reduction and early warning services and information dissemination through geo-portal services. As a apart of natural resources planning and developmental services NESAC supports the state forest departments in preparing the forest working plans by providing geospatial inputs covering entire NER, identifying the suitable culturable wastelands for cultivation of silkworm food plants, mapping of natural resources such as land use/land cover, wastelands, land degradation etc. on temporal basis. In the area of disaster risk reduction, NESAC has initiated operational services for early warning and post disaster assessment inputs for flood early warning system (FLEWS) using satellite remote sensing, numerical weather prediction, hydrological modeling etc.; forest fire alert system with actionable attribute information; Japanese Encephalitis Early Warning System (JEWS) based on mosquito vector abundance, pig population and historical disease intensity and agriculture drought monitoring for the region. The large volumes of geo-spatial databases generated as part of operational services are made available to the administrators and local government bodies for better management, preparing prospective planning, and sustainable use of available resources. The knowledge dissemination is being done through online web portals wherever the internet access is available and as well as offline space based information kiosks, where the internet access is not available or having limited bandwidth availability. This paper presents a systematic and comprehensive study on the remote sensing services operational in NER of India for natural resources management, disaster risk reduction and dissemination of information and services, in addition to outlining future areas and direction of space applications for the region.																	2194-9034						2016	41	B4					767	775		10.5194/isprsarchives-XLI-B4-767-2016								WOS:000392752100122

Recently but infrequently burnt breeding sites are favoured by threatened Gouldian finches (Erythrura gouldiae)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												Frequent and extensive fires are becoming increasingly common throughout the tropical savannas of northern Australia. This fire regime has been implicated in both habitat alteration and losses of biodiversity. Granivorous birds are particularly affected because of the effect of fire on grass seed availability. The endemic Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae) has experienced population declines in recent decades, potentially in response to changed fire regimes. Using breeding data from monitored artificial nest-boxes, this study examined the choice of breeding site by Gouldian finches in response to several attributes of the prevailing fire regime. The fire regime was characterised using remote sensing analysis of annual fire scars. Time since last fire and fire frequency were the most useful predictors of breeding site occupancy. Gouldian finches favoured recently burnt sites (previous dry season), but also sites that were infrequently burnt (return time of 2-3 years). Consequently, under the current regime of many frequent fires, Gouldian finches move among breeding sites and display low seasonal site fidelity. Our findings provide support for the notion that the Gouldian finch favours a fine-grain patch-mosaic fire regime and that contemporary large-scale fire regimes are likely contributing to their decline.																	1049-8001	1448-5516					2016	25	12					1281	1290		10.1071/WF16105								WOS:000391120200009

Though presenting significant economic potential as a renewable resource, they are not adequately valorised, in spite of a growing market demand for cork and cork-based products, which are appreciated, today, for their use in sustainable building. In this respect, cork meets the needs of the building industry in responding to the growing demand for quality products, which are eco-and energy-friendly and hygienically safe. Moreover, European cultural and biodiversity value has been attributed to cork oak woodlands and their most significant examples have been included in the Natura 2000 framework. So far. in some countries like Italy. the territorial distribution and characterisation of cork oak woodlands have not been adequately investigated. This study provides a method for mapping the actual presence of cork oak woodlands and for assessing their potential distribution. Special attention was given to the characterisation of cork oak spectral signature. To this end, Landsat 8 satellite images, digital photointerpretation and in situ surveys were implemented. The work carried out allows assessing the effectiveness of GIS and remote sensing techniques coupled with ancillary data and tools, and their applicability for the development of a comprehensive mapping and monitoring system of cork oak woodlands in Mediterranean ecosystems. Such techniques are vital to develop a detailed management strategy and to assist restoration activities and the economic assessment of semi-natural habitats. A case study, carried out in two different locations in Calabria (Italy), is provided.

It has detrimental effects not only on the aquatic environment such as reduced transparency, elevated pH, and oxygen depletion but also on the drinking, agricultural, industrial, commercial, and recreational uses of inland waters. In this chapter, we first review the influence of the harmful cyanobacterial blooms on aquatic fauna and flora such as zooplankton, fish, and aquatic macrophyte. And then we introduce the monitoring of the cyanobacterial bloom using satellite remote sensing. Satellite remote sensing could present a valuable tool to obtain more reliable information about the extent of the cyanobacterial bloom than the conventional monitoring methods such as ship survey. With the rapid development of satellite sensors, many useful algorisms have been proposed by scientists. As one of the methods, we introduce a novel method for monitoring the abundance of the cyanobacterial bloom from Landsat images using an environmental indicator, namely, the visual cyanobacteria index (VCI).																	2191-0707		978-981-10-0780-4; 978-981-10-0778-1				2016							71	85		10.1007/978-981-10-0780-4_6								WOS:000390822600006

Evolutionary Legacy Effects on Ecosystems: Biogeographic Origins, Plant Traits, and Implications for Management in the Era of Global Change	ANNUAL REVIEW OF ECOLOGY, EVOLUTION, AND SYSTEMATICS, VOL 47	Annual Review of Ecology Evolution and Systematics											Biogeographic origins of plant lineages are often reflected in species functional traits, with consequences for community assembly, diversity, and ecosystem function. The climatic and environmental conditions in which species evolved have lasting influence (legacy effects) through phylogenetic conservatism of traits that underlie community assembly and drive ecosystem processes. Legacy effects that influence community assembly may have direct consequences for ecosystem function or may be linked, owing to lineage history, to traits that impact ecosystems. Evolutionary priority effects, driven by the order of colonization and lineage diversification, as well as migration barriers and historical environmental changes, have shaped the diversity and composition of regional floras and their ecosystem functions. We examine the likely consequences of biogeographic history for plant responses to global change and consider how understanding linkages between biogeographic origins, functional traits, and ecosystem consequences can aid the management and restoration of ecosystems globally in the face of rapid environmental change.																	1543-592X		978-0-8243-1447-7				2016	47						433	462		10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-121415-032229								WOS:000389576500019

The result show: the primary production, pollutants loading, coastline and sea area have changed greatly in the Bohai Sea since 1988. The environmental changes increased the value of marine ecosystem services value from 529.42 billion RMB in 1988 to 558.83 billion RMB in 2013. The ecosystem services values of recreation, food and materials production, O-2 supply, climate regulation and primary productivity were raised. However, other marine ecosystem services value, including biological control, pollutant purification, knowledge broaden and biodiversity protection were lowered.																			978-1-60595-343-4				2016							333	339										WOS:000389851900051

Analysing fragmentation in vulnerable biodiversity hotspots in Tanzania from 1975 to 2012 using remote sensing and fragstats	NATURE CONSERVATION-BULGARIA												Habitat fragmentation is a threat to conservation of biodiversity hotspots in the Morogoro region, Tanzania. However, on-going research on fragmentation has not kept pace with temporal lapses and how individual species respond to habitat transformation and heterogeneity. This study sought to model spatial and temporal fragmentation patterns. Cloud free multi-temporal Landsat imagery with similar spectral resolution were acquired in the same season in 1975, 1995 and 2012. The images were used to characterize the biophysical landscape characteristics and a range of metrics used to quantify the magnitude of fragmentation. Patches and classes in the landscape were assessed using Fragstats, a spatial statistics program useful in computing landscape metrics. Results show that patch number was higher in dense forest and woodland than in less dense forest and grassland in 1975, 1995 and 2012 while the interspersion Juxtaposition Index (IJI) ranged between 0 (for clumped patches) and 100 (for grassland). In 1975 and 1995, the grassland habitat had the highest IJI while in 2012 less dense forest had the highest IJI. The Games-Howell test showed a significant fragmentation trend in less dense forests class (p=0.05). Generally, the study indicates a high fragmentation pattern in the vulnerable tropical eastern arc mountain region of East Africa. This finding demonstrates the value of remotely sensed data in understanding the impact of anthropogenic processes on natural landscape transformation. Furthermore, the study provides a basis for informed conservation policy design and implementation in the region.																	1314-6947	1314-3301					2016		16					19	37		10.3897/natureconservation.16.9312								WOS:000389654600002

Remote sensing imagery is an important data source for investigating species composition, owing to its large spatial coverage and continuous data acquisition. However, commonly-used remote sensing images acquired by satellite (e.g., Landsat, Quickbird) or airplane have a spatial resolution lower than 0.5m, and are thus not capable of resolving characteristically small features. This poses a particular challenge in grassland ecosystems, since grassland species are typically small in size and highly mixed. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is an emerging technology in recent decades that can acquire imagery with ultra-high spatial resolution (sub-decimeter). Therefore, UAV-acquired imagery facilitates fine-scale species classification. This study classified two UAV-acquired images obtained at different times during the vegetation-growing cycle for species investigation in a temperate grassland. The classification approach utilized in this process was object-oriented classification, which is capable of identifying ground covers using spectral, spatial, and textural information. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) was applied for feature selection, which is an essential step in determining optimal features for classifiers. The dominant species in the study area were classified with an overall accuracy higher than 80%. Spatial and temporal variations of dominant species were analyzed, and their potential influencing factors (e.g., topographic condition, soil moisture) were also examined. Challenges of using UAV-acquired imagery and the object-oriented technique for species classification were summarized at the end of this paper.																	2380-8039		978-1-5090-1479-8				2016																		WOS:000389576700023

Coastal regions should be monitored vigilantly by planners and control mechanisms, and any changes in these regions should be detected with its human or natural origin, and future plans and possible interventions should be formed in these aspects to maintain ecological balance, sustainable development, and planned urbanization. Integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) provides an important tool to reach that goal. One of the important elements of ICZM is the detection of coastlines. While there are several methods to detect coastlines, remote sensing methods provide the fastest and the most efficient solutions. In this study, color infrared, grayscale, RGB, and fake infrared images were processed with the median filtering and segmentation software developed within the study, and coastal lines were detected by the edge detection method. The results show that segmentation with fake infrared images derived from RGB images give the best results.

An algorithm for assessing reef biodiversity in benthic habitats is presented. The method consists of capturing spectral heterogeneity from hyperspectral images using vector quantization (VQ) method and use the result for prediction of benthic species richness. The results are compared with that of Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) method. The validation of the process index is done by comparing the Shannon entropy from actual field data and the Shannon entropy computed from the image. The hyperspectral image corresponds to the marine coastal area of Enrique Reef in La Parguera, Puerto Rico which includes all biological communities associated with the sea floor, from the top of the intertidal zone and inner reaches of estuaries down to the deep sea. This work provides fundamental and basic information on benthic habitats for automating the process of marine biodiversity assessment for remote sensing satellite images.																	2154-4824						2016																		WOS:000386618400002

Nevertheless, the tropical rainforest holds the most extensive forest in the world with the vast diversity of tree with layered canopies. With the usage of optical sensor integrate with empirical models is a common way to assess the AGB. Using the regression, the linkage between remote sensing and a biophysical parameter of the forest may be made. Therefore, this paper exemplifies the accuracy of non-linear regression equation of quadratic function to estimate the AGB and carbon stocks for the tropical lowland Dipterocarp forest of Ayer Hitam forest reserve, Selangor. The main aim of this investigation is to obtain the relationship between biophysical parameter field plots with the remotely-sensed data using non-linear regression model. The result showed that there is a good relationship between crown projection area (CPA) and carbon stocks (CS) with Pearson Correlation (p < 0.01), the coefficient of correlation (r) is 0.671. The study concluded that the integration of Worldview-3 imagery with the canopy height model (CHM) raster based LiDAR were useful in order to quantify the AGB and carbon stocks for a larger sample area of the lowland Dipterocarp forest.

J	Tan, PY; Feng, YQ; Hwang, YH				Tan, Puay Yok; Feng, Yuanqiu; Hwang, Yun Hye			Deforestation in a tropical compact city (Part A) Understanding its socio-ecological impacts	SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT												Purpose - Secondary forest loss in Singapore has recently emerged as a contentious issue that tests the relationships between state, public and civil society, but debates on this issue have occurred without the benefit of supporting information on the spatial extent, and understanding of multiple socio-ecological impacts arising from their gradual disappearance. The purpose of this paper is to fill these knowledge gaps to contribute to development of approaches to manage land developments on secondary forests. Design/methodology/approach - This study evaluated the past and potential future losses of spontaneous re-growth forest through spatial analyses of vegetation cover maps combined with national land use plans using remote sensing and GIS. The socio-ecological impacts of such losses were interpreted from published writings, which comprise scientific publications and public opinion in news media. Findings - Secondary forest losses accounted for more than half of total vegetation cover reduction between 2007 and 2012, and future potential losses amount to about 4,700 ha of land if these are fully developed over the next 10-15 years. The socio-ecological consequences of such losses are identified. Strong public opinion are reflected in the large number of news article on the topic over the last four years, pointing to the emergence of a contentious issue that requires careful management. Originality/value - This paper conducted the first assessment of the spatial extent of secondary forests losses, and an extensive review of public opinion of the matter, and the results validated the significance of this topic.

Relative importance analysis of Landsat, waveform LIDAR and PALSAR inputs for deciduous biomass estimation	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Aboveground forest biomass estimation is an integral component for climate change, carbon stocks assessment, biodiversity and forest health. LiDAR ( Light Detection And Ranging), specifically NASA's Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor ( LVIS), PALSAR ( Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar), and Landsat data have been previously used in biomass estimation with promising results when used individually. In this manuscript all three products are jointly utilized for the first time to assess their importance for deciduous biomass estimation. Results indicate that LVIS inputs are ranked as most important followed by PALSAR inputs. Particularly for PALSAR, scenes acquired in May and August were ranked higher compared to other months.																	2279-7254						2016	49						795	807		10.5721/EuJRS20164942								WOS:000385998900019

Gautala Autramghat is a protected area of the Marathwada region of Maharashtra state, India. It is situated in the Satmala and Ajantha hill ranges of the Western Ghats; it is administrated by Aurangabad and Jalgaon District. The wildlife sanctuary was established in an existing reserved forest area in 1986. The area is a southern tropical dry deciduous forest with scattered bush and grasslands. India, being a mega-biodiversity country, supports diverse forest vegetation of tropical, sub-tropical and temperate types. The remote-sensing techniques are employed to map the forest cover. IRS RS2 LISS III sensor data are used to generate a medium-scale vegetation cover map. One scene of 01-Feb-2015 with minimum cloud cover was acquired, preprocessed, and georeferenced to Survey of India toposheets. The satellite image was then subjected to the Maximum Likelihood Classification, assuming six types of objects, namely Open Forest, Moderate Dense Forest, Shrubs Forest, Barren Land, Crop, and Water. A standard forest vegetation cover classification legend was used for this purpose. The vegetation classes were visited on ground to collect information on their structure and composition, which was utilized in the classification exercise.																			978-1-315-65791-2; 978-1-138-02877-7				2016							391	395										WOS:000385792500076

In what quantity it changes, where and when can help us in identifying sources of ecosystem stress, which is very useful for understanding changes in biodiversity and its effect on climate change. Such changes known for a region are important in prioritizing management. The present study considers the dynamics of savanna vegetation in Kruger National Park (KNP) through the use of temporal satellite remote sensing images. Spatial variability of vegetation is a key characteristic of savanna landscapes and its importance to biodiversity has been demonstrated by field-based studies. The data used for the study were sourced from the U.S. Agency for International Development where AVHRR derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images available at spatial resolutions of 8 km and at dekadal scales. The study area was extracted from these images for the time-period 1984-2002. Maximum value composites were derived for individual months resulting in an image dataset of 216 NDVI images. Vegetation dynamics across spatio-temporal domains were analyzed using standardized principal components analysis (SPCA) on the NDVI time-series. Each individual image variability in the time-series is considered. The outcome of this study demonstrated promising results - the variability vegetation change in the area across space and time, and also indicated changes in landscape on 6 individual principal components (PCs) showing differences not only in magnitude, but also in pattern, of different selected eco-zones with constantly changing and evolving ecosystem.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-923-8				2016	9688								UNSP 968812	10.1117/12.2240711								WOS:000385792200037						
J	de la Barrera, F; Rubio, P; Banzhaf, E				de la Barrera, Francisco; Rubio, Patricio; Banzhaf, Ellen			The value of vegetation cover for ecosystem services in the suburban context	URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING												Latin-American cities can be characterized by dynamic processes of urbanization that encroach upon the natural and semi-natural surrounding landscapes. Our study presents the effects of landscape development, transformed from semi-natural conditions into a mostly disperse suburban settlement. We explore the impact that this transformation has had on this context by three ecosystem services that regulate rainwater runoff, enhance microclimate conditions and help to improve air quality by monitoring vegetation cover. We have designed a spatio-temporal hierarchical analysis which employs remote sensing techniques to capture the structural changes of this landscape over long, medium and short term scales on two spatial levels. This methodological approach was tested in the Metropolitan Area of Santiago (MAS) as case study area. Despite of the increase in impervious surfaces due to urban processes, there has also been an increase in vegetation cover, which has led to an improvement in the provision of the above-mentioned ecosystem services. Hence, if diverse urbanization processes continue and they are coupled with an increase in vegetation cover, the provision of ecosystem services could also expand. This phenomenon can be observed in some areas, where public and private green spaces are created and maintained. Our data analyses give evidence that certain types of suburban areas which increase the share of vegetation cover can provide daily ecological benefits for urban neighborhoods, and beyond, for adjacent areas. Moreover, suburban development can successfully provide ecological benefits to citizens. Such processes can only be ecologically sustainable if the composition of vegetation is well-adapted to the regional climatic conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

A METHOD FOR ESTIMATING THE CURRENT AND FUTURE CARBON CONTENT OF STANDING BIOMASS APPLIED TO GISHWATI FOREST RESERVE, RWANDA	JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE												The carbon content of standing tree biomass was determined in the Gishwati Forest Reserve in north-western Rwanda and growth potential of the forest was estimated using a straightforward, generalisable model of natural forest regeneration. A survey was conducted on 2289 trees in plots throughout the reserve. Wood density data were obtained from literature and tree biomass was estimated using a recent pan-tropical allometric equation. A survey on United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects showed that current methods of growth rate projection for mixed, non-plantation forests might significantly overestimate the amount of carbon sequestered. The current study identified an alternative potential method for the estimation of sequestration rates that did not depend upon compiling single-species growth rates and reduced the risk that error would lead to significant over- or underestimation of total biomass sequestration potential. This method used remote-sensing data to estimate total biomass potential in a mature forest based upon local samples and assumes a standard growth trajectory based upon literature values. The benefits in terms of accuracy and ease of model construction are likely to be high. It was found that tree biomass in Gishwati forest contained 53.9 +/- 10 CO2 equivalent(e) ha(-1) and was expected to sequester an average of 1.01 (0.80-1.38) Mg CO(2)e ha(-1) per annum over the next 30 years.																	0128-1283						2016	28	4					416	425										WOS:000384711100004

Anthropogenic habitat alteration and increasing human access to previously remote landscapes are potential source of stress for this species in Iran. Therefore, land cover changes in the Chelcheli protected area were mapped for 1991-2013 using time sequential Landsat TM and ETM at 30 meters resolution. Moreover, Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling was used to investigate habitat selection of brown bear. The results showed that suitable patches overlapped with forest areas (Hyrcanian forest) and rivers. Our results also indicate that the brown bear habitat suitability is negatively influenced by human disturbance (e.g., roads, settlements). Increased human disturbance in brown bear habitat in recent decades may cause bears to avoid the disturbed areas. Therefore, the management plans should focus on reducing the human infrastructures around brown bear habitat. A suggestion is to place the core secure areas for brown bear inside the suitable habitat close to rivers where the human access is restricted. Promoting awareness of biodiversity conservation among tourism should also be one of the major focuses of management plans.

EFFECT OF TEMPORAL LAND USE/LAND COVER CHANGES ON ECOSYSTEM SERVICES VALUE IN COASTAL AREA OF CHINA: THE CASE OF SU-XI-CHANG REGION	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Providing goods and services, while maintaining ecosystem service functions and biodiversity that built up their sustainable supply to support human welfare, is one of the great challenges of our time. This study examined the dynamics of land use land cover (LULC) changes, temporal variation of ecosystem service value (ESV), the threatened ecosystem services function in Su-Xi-Chang region, and explore the consequences of unsustainable use of land resources on ESV provision. Remote sensing applications were used to evaluate changes in LULC, and an evaluation method for ESV based on land cover change was applied in 2000, 2005 and 2010. Our study investigated that change in ESV was caused mainly due to the expansion of construction land, which was increased by 88% during the study period. Meanwhile, ESV dropped from 57.1775 x 10(9) CNY in 2000 to 53.7585 x 10(9) CNY in 2010. Ecosystem service function for food provision was the most critically affected followed by climate and gas regulation functions respectively. Waste treatment and water supply were the two largest services functions provided by ecosystems of the area. The expansion of construction land, which have due impact on LULC change, is likely responsible for the overall decline in 3.4190 billion CNY ESV of the region. As they have showed the highest ESV and greatest degradation during the study period, protection of farmland and water bodies should be paid due attention by regional land use planning and policy making offices. As a result, sustainable use of land resources and mitigation of the declining ESV of the region will be realized.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2016	14	3					409	422		10.15666/aeer/1403_409422								WOS:000383084700027

Evaluating Nature Reserve Design Efficacy in the Canadian Boreal Forest Using Time Series AVHRR Data	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												This research evaluates the efficacy of candidate reserves in boreal ecosystems with respect to a long-term record of remote-sensing-derived productivity based on the dynamic habitat index (DHI) generated using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data (1987-2007) and compared differences related to reserve location (stratified by land cover, ecozone, and gross primary productivity (GPP)) and reserve size. Effectiveness of candidate reserves was assessed by how productivity values differed from the initial conditions (2000-2005 baseline). Results indicate that small reserves (<1,000km(2)) at high elevations, high latitudes, intermittent environments (wetlands), or dominated by open shrub experienced the greatest amount of interannual variability. To the contrary, larger reserves (1,000km(2); <10,000 km(2)) were stable under these same conditions. Results also indicate that reserves located in highly productive areas (>700 kgC m(-2) yr(-1)) experienced greater interannual variability than low-productivity areas. This approach provides an objective and consistent means of evaluating reserve efficacy across different geographic areas and through time. By highlighting uncertainty associated with change impacts, this approach also offers opportunities to develop more robust long-term conservation targets in new reserves and to test potential mitigation strategies prior to implementation.

Many cities have instigated programs to remove invasive plants, which requires detailed knowledge of plant locations. Hyperspectral remote sensing allows identification of invasive plants species based on spectral properties. Imagery from the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) was used to extract spectra of Himalayan blackberry (Rubus armeniacus), English ivy (Hedera helix), and other species across the nonforest vegetated environment of Surrey, British Columbia, Canada. Additionally, field spectra were acquired from a handheld spectrometer. All spectra were processed through an instability index spectral channel selection algorithm. The resulting wavelengths, selected for their capacity to differentiate key species, were input into a spectral angle mapper classification to detect Himalayan blackberry and English ivy across the city. Results show detection accuracies of 80.0% for English ivy and 76.4% for Himalayan blackberry. Spatially, both species were observed with proportionally more area outside parks than within parks. Our study highlights the feasibility of detecting Himalayan blackberry and English ivy in open urban areas and demonstrates advantages of selecting of spectral channels.Resume.

Big data opportunities and challenges for assessing multiple stressors across scales in aquatic ecosystems	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Aquatic ecosystems are under threat from multiple stressors, which vary in distribution and intensity across temporal and spatial scales. Monitoring and assessment of these ecosystems have historically focussed on collection of physical and chemical information and increasingly include associated observations on biological condition. However, ecosystem assessment is often lacking because the scale and quality of biological observations frequently fail to match those available from physical and chemical measurements. The advent of high-performance computing, coupled with new earth observation platforms, has accelerated the adoption of molecular and remote sensing tools in ecosystem assessment. To assess how emerging science and tools can be applied to study multiple stressors on a large (ecosystem) scale and to facilitate greater integration of approaches among different scientific disciplines, a workshop was held on 10-12 September 2014 at the Sydney Institute of Marine Sciences, Australia. Here we introduce a conceptual framework for assessing multiple stressors across ecosystems using emerging sources of big data and critique a range of available big-data types that could support models for multiple stressors. We define big data as any set or series of data, which is either so large or complex, it becomes difficult to analyse using traditional data analysis methods.

Analyzing such interactions at a large spatial scale may advance our understanding of parasitism patterns over complex landscapes. Combining high-resolution airborne imaging spectroscopy and LiDAR, we studied hemiparasite incidence within and among tree host stands to examine the prevalence and spatial distribution of hemiparasite load in ecosystems. Specifically, we aimed to assess: (1) detection accuracy of mistletoes on their oak hosts; (2) hemiparasitism prevalence within host tree canopies depending on tree height, and (3) spatial variation in hemiparasitism across fragmented woodlands, in a low-diversity mediterranean oak woodland in California, USA. We identified mistletoe infestations with 55-96% accuracy, and detected significant differences in remote-sensed spectra between oak trees with and without mistletoe infestation. We also found that host canopy height had little influence on infestation degree, whereas landscape-level variation showed consistent, non-random patterns: isolated host trees had twice the infestation load than did trees located at the core of forest fragments. Overall, we found that canopy exposure (i.e., lower canopy density or proximity to forest edge) is more important than canopy height for mistletoe infestation, and that by changing landscape structure, parasitic prevalence increased with woodland fragmentation. We conclude that reducing fragmentation in oak woodlands will minimize anthropogenic impact on mistletoe infestation at the landscape level. We argue that advanced remote sensing technology can provide baselines to quantitatively analyze and monitor parasite-host trajectories in light of global environmental change, and that this is a promising approach to be further tested in other temperate and tropical forests.

Quantification and monitoring of deforestation in India over eight decades (1930-2013)	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												There is still large uncertainty over the status of global forest cover owing to the paucity of comprehensive and holistic studies related to long term forest cover change. The aim of the present work is to prepare a nation-wide multi-date forest cover database which describes and quantifies historical and recent changes in natural forests of India. This analysis facilitated the determination of the state of Indian forest cover changes over last eight decades. Here, we have mapped the total area under forest cover, evaluated the spatial tracking of changes in natural forests, estimated the rate of deforestation and afforestation, analysed the biogeographic zone wise and state wise forest cover change, existing land use in deforested area, influence of environmental factors such as terrain on deforestation and implication of different definitions of forest used by agencies reporting deforestation in India. The results indicated that forests covered an area of 869,012 km(2) in 1930 which has decreased to 625,565 km(2) in 2013, a net loss of 243,447 km(2) (28 %) in eight decades. The highest annual average forest loss was found to be 4795 km(2) during 1930-1975, 1476 km(2) during 1975-1985, 767 km(2) during 1985-1995, 356 km(2) during 1995-2005 and 209 km(2) during 2005-2013. Between 1930 and 1975, forest experienced large scale deforestation at gross annual rate of 0.77 % which has declined to 0.29 % and 0.14 % for the 1975-1985 and 1985-1995 periods respectively. Quantification of annual rate of gross deforestation for the recent period indicates 0.07 % during 1995-2005 and 0.05 % during 2005-2013. The lower rates of deforestation during recent period support effectiveness of conservation measures taken at national level. It was found that deforestation rate has decreased in many biogeographic zones by 2005, except for Andaman & Nicobar Islands and North East. The major deforestation has mostly occurred due to conversion of forests to agriculture. The construction of reservoirs contributed to 4.1 % of forest loss. The tropical forests have experienced large scale deforestation followed by subtropical forests. The findings of the study will be useful to prioritize conservation and protection of forest cover at the regional level. It shall also provide a base for future research on the impacts of deforestation on carbon flux and biodiversity.

Annual South American forest loss estimates based on passive microwave remote sensing (1990-2010)	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Consistent forest loss estimates are important to understand the role of forest loss and deforestation in the global carbon cycle, for biodiversity studies, and to estimate the mitigation potential of reducing deforestation. To date, most studies have relied on optical satellite data and new efforts have greatly improved our quantitative knowledge on forest dynamics. However, most of these studies yield results for only a relatively short time period or are limited to certain countries. We have quantified large-scale forest loss over a 21-year period (1990-2010) in the tropical biomes of South America using remotely sensed vegetation optical depth (VOD). This passive microwave satellite-based indicator of vegetation water content and vegetation density has a much coarser spatial resolution than optical data but its temporal resolution is higher and VOD is not impacted by aerosols and cloud cover. We used the merged VOD product of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) observations, and developed a change detection algorithm to quantify spatial and temporal variations in forest loss dynamics. Our results compared reasonably well with the newly developed Landsat-based Global Forest Change (GFC) maps, available for the 2001 onwards period (r(2) = 0.90 when comparing annual country-level estimates). This allowed us to convert our identified changes in VOD to forest loss area and compute these from 1990 onwards. We also compared these calibrated results to PRODES (r(2) = 0.60 when comparing annual state-level estimates). We found that South American forest exhibited substantial interannual variability without a clear trend during the 1990s, but increased from 2000 until 2004. After 2004, forest loss decreased again, except for two smaller peaks in 2007 and 2010. For a large part, these trends were driven by changes in Brazil, which was responsible for 56% of the total South American forest loss area over our study period according to our results. One of the key findings of our study is that while forest loss decreased in Brazil after 2005, increases in other countries partly offset this trend suggesting that South American forest loss as a whole decreased much less than that in Brazil.

Projected SST trends across the Caribbean Sea based on PRECIS downscaling of ECHAM4, under the SRES A2 and B2 scenarios	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												The Caribbean Sea and adjacent land areas are highly sensitive to the projected impacts of global climate change. The countries bordering the Caribbean Sea depend heavily on coastal and marine assets as a major source of livelihood support. Rising sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are known to be associated with coral bleaching, ocean acidification, and other phenomena that threaten livelihoods in the region. The paucity of SST systematic observations in both the Caribbean Sea and adjoining Western Atlantic waters is a limiting factor in the projection of future climate change impacts on the region's marine resources. Remote sensing of SST by satellites began only within the last three decades and although the data collected so far might be insufficient to provide conclusive definitions of long-term SST variations in the Caribbean waters, these data along with the output from climate model simulations provide a useful basis for gaining further insights into plausible SST futures under IPCC SRES scenarios. In this paper, we examine the recent SST records from the NESDIS AVHRR satellite data and NOAA Optimum Interpolation (OI) sea surface temperature V2 and provide a comparative analysis of projected SST changes for the Caribbean Sea up to the end of the twenty-first century, under the SRES A2 and B2 scenarios' simulations of the sea surface skin temperatures (SSsT) using the Hadley Centre's regional model, PRECIS. The implications of these projected SST changes for bleaching of coral reefs, one of the region's most valuable marine resource, and for rainfall are also discussed.																	0177-798X	1434-4483				JAN	2016	123	1-2					199	215		10.1007/s00704-014-1346-1								WOS:000368715000016

Ecological legacies of civil war: 35-year increase in savanna tree cover following wholesale large-mammal declines	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. Large mammalian herbivores (LMH) exert strong effects on plants in tropical savannas, and many wild LMH populations are declining. However, predicting the impacts of these declines on vegetation structure remains challenging. 2. Experiments suggest that tree cover can increase rapidly following LMH exclusion. Yet it is unclear whether these results scale up to predict ecosystem-level impacts of LMH declines, which often alter fire regimes, trigger compensatory responses of other herbivores and accompany anthropogenic land-use changes. Moreover, theory predicts that grazers and browsers should have opposing effects on tree cover, further complicating efforts to forecast the outcomes of community-wide declines. 3. We used the near-extirpation of grazing and browsing LMH from Gorongosa National Park during the Mozambican Civil War (1977-1992) as a natural experiment to test whether megafaunal collapse increased tree cover. We classified herbaceous and tree cover in satellite images taken (a) at the onset of war in 1977 and (b) in 2012, two decades after hostilities ceased. 4. Throughout the 3620-km(2) park, proportional tree cover increased by 34% (from 0.29 to 0.39) an addition of 362 km(2). Four of the park's five major habitat zones (including miombo woodland, Acacia-Combretum-palm savanna, and floodplain grassland) showed even greater increases in tree cover (51-134%), with an average increase of 94% in ecologically critical Rift Valley habitats. Only in the eastern Cheringoma Plateau, which had historically low wildlife densities, did tree cover decrease (by 5%). 5. The most parsimonious explanation for these results is that reduced browsing pressure enhanced tree growth, survival and/or recruitment; we found no directional trends in rainfall or fire that could explain increased tree cover. 6. Synthesis. Catastrophic large-herbivore die-offs in Mozambique's flagship national park were followed by 35 years of woodland expansion, most severely in areas where pre-war wildlife biomass was greatest. These findings suggest that browsing release supersedes grazer-grass-fire feedbacks in governing ecosystem-level tree cover, consistent with smaller-scale experimental results, although the potentially complementary effect of CO2 fertilization cannot be definitively ruled out. Future work in Gorongosa will reveal whether recovering LMH populations reverse this trend, or alternatively whether woody encroachment hinders ongoing restoration efforts.																	0022-0477	1365-2745				JAN	2016	104	1					79	89		10.1111/1365-2745.12483								WOS:000368298700009

Toward an integrated monitoring framework to assess the effects of tropical forest degradation and recovery on carbon stocks and biodiversity	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Tropical forests harbor a significant portion of global biodiversity and are a critical component of the climate system. Reducing deforestation and forest degradation contributes to global climate-change mitigation efforts, yet emissions and removals from forest dynamics are still poorly quantified. We reviewed the main challenges to estimate changes in carbon stocks and biodiversity due to degradation and recovery of tropical forests, focusing on three main areas: (1) the combination of field surveys and remote sensing; (2) evaluation of biodiversity and carbon values under a unified strategy; and (3) research efforts needed to understand and quantify forest degradation and recovery. The improvement of models and estimates of changes of forest carbon can foster process-oriented monitoring of forest dynamics, including different variables and using spatially explicit algorithms that account for regional and local differences, such as variation in climate, soil, nutrient content, topography, biodiversity, disturbance history, recovery pathways, and socioeconomic factors. Generating the data for these models requires affordable large-scale remote-sensing tools associated with a robust network of field plots that can generate spatially explicit information on a range of variables through time. By combining ecosystem models, multiscale remote sensing, and networks of field plots, we will be able to evaluate forest degradation and recovery and their interactions with biodiversity and carbon cycling. Improving monitoring strategies will allow a better understanding of the role of forest dynamics in climate-change mitigation, adaptation, and carbon cycle feedbacks, thereby reducing uncertainties in models of the key processes in the carbon cycle, including their impacts on biodiversity, which are fundamental to support forest governance policies, such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation.

Global environmental challenges, such as biodiversity conservation or climate change mitigation, fall squarely into this category. This contribution focuses on the specific dimensions of evaluating the provision of global public goods in light of experiences from the Global Environment Facility. As global environmental problems persist, it is important that evaluations focus on the results and impact of our actions beyond the immediate outputs and outcomes of individual projects and programs. It is essential to be able to assess whether these actions are making a difference on the health of the global environment and in the lives of people depending on it. Multiple methods ranging from quantitative to qualitative, and innovations, such as the use of remote sensing and GIS, are needed and have been utilized by the GEF independent evaluation office. The contribution also discusses ways of making global environmental evaluations more influential amongst stakeholders.

In this study, we used a combination of field surveys, remote sensing, census data and spatial analysis to investigate the interrelationships among geographical and social-economic variables across 328 different urban structural units (USUs) and how they may influence the distributions of urban forest cover, plant diversity and abundance, within the central urban area of Beijing, China. We found that the urban green space coverage varied substantially across different types of USUs, with higher in agricultural lands (N = 15), parks (N = 46) and lowest in utility zones (N = 36). The amount of urban green space within USUs declines exponentially with the distance to urban center. Our study suggested that geographical, social and economic factors were closely related with each other in urban ecological systems, and have important impacts on urban forest coverage and abundance. The percentage of forest as well as high and low density urban areas were mainly responsible for variations in the data across all USUs and all land use/land cover types, and thus are important constituents and ecological indicators for understanding and modeling urban environment. Herb richness is more strongly correlated with tree and shrub density than with tree and shrub richness (r = -0.472, p < 0.05). However, other geographic and socioeconomic factors showed no significant relationships with urban plant diversity or abundance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Lawley, EF; Lewis, MM; Ostendorf, B				Lawley, Evertje Frederika; Lewis, Megan M.; Ostendorf, Bertram			A remote sensing spatio-temporal framework for interpreting sparse indicators in highly variable arid landscapes	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The world's extensive and often remote arid landscapes are receiving increasing attention to maintain their ecological and productive values. Monitoring and management of these lands requires indicators and evidence of ecosystem condition and trend, generally derived from widely distributed and infrequently repeated site-based records. However adequate geographic representation and frequent site revisits are difficult to achieve because of the remoteness and vast extent of these landscapes. Interpreting such sparse ecological indicators is difficult, particularly within landscapes that are highly variable in space and time. To interpret ecological indicator data collected in such environments long-term patterns of natural landscape variability need to be understood. This paper presents a framework of landscape spatio-temporal variability within which to interpret ecological indicator data. This framework is based on long-term patterns of vegetation growth across the Australian arid zone, derived from twenty-five years of high temporal resolution National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite imagery. We present a case study of the extensive Alinytjara Wilurara (AW) Natural Resource Management (NRM) region in far western South Australia to illustrate new insights about landscape function gained from this approach, and their implications for collection and interpretation of ecological indicator data. We illustrate how variability in vegetation response is expressed across the region, and how stratification based on active vegetation response differs from more commonly used biogeographic stratifications in this region. Lastly we demonstrate the unique patterns of long-term vegetation response for the major vegetation response classes. Average amount, seasonality, magnitude, timing and variability of vegetation response over time are used to characterise the natural "envelope" of variability of the new landscape classes. The study region showed low vegetation response in summer and higher response in winter. Onset of growth was earlier in the north and in ecosystems dominated by mallee vegetation. Cyclonic influence from the west was evident at the southern margin of the study region. The study demonstrates the landscape functional response of the study region, and presents a method whereby remote sensing reveals the landscape context within which to better interpret ecological indicator data collected in a highly variable landscape.

Digital and real-habitat modeling of Hipparchia statilinus based on hyper spectral remote sensing data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The abandonment of military areas leads to succession processes affecting valuable open-land habitats and is considered to be a major threat for European butterflies. We assessed the ability of hyper spectral remote sensing data to spatially predict the occurrence of one of the most endangered butterfly species (Hipparchia statilinus) in Brandenburg (Germany) on the basis of habitat characteristics at a former military training area. Presence-absence data were sampled on a total area of 36 km(2), and N = 65 adult individuals of Hipparchia statilinus could be detected. The floristic composition within the study area was modeled in a three-dimensional ordination space. Occurrence probabilities for the target species were predicted as niches between ordinated floristic gradients by using Regression Kriging of Indicators. Habitat variance could be explained by up to 81 % with spectral variables at a spatial resolution of 2 x 2 m by transferring PLSR models to imagery. Ordinated ecological niche of Hipparchia statilinus was tested against environmental predictor variables. N = 6 variables could be detected to be significantly correlated with habitat preferences of Hipparchia statilinus. They show that Hipparchia statilinus can serve as a valuable indicator for the evaluation of the conservation status of Natura 2000 habitat type 2330 (inland dunes with open Corynephorus and Agrostis grasslands) protected by the Habitat Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC).

In this study, the relationship between wetland and avifauna changes in the Yellow River Delta Wetland was studied. Remote sensing and geographic information system provided an advanced platform for the research. After the avifauna survey was performed from 2012 to 2013, the birds' variation and driving factors were analyzed. The results showed that the flow into the wetland increased continuously from 2000, and the increased of artificial wetland prevented the wetland degradation, although at the same time the total wetland area decreased. Medium grassland, tidal flat and pond are the three main landscapes which are beneficial for the habitation of birds. The migrating numbers of red-crowned crane increased significantly from 2005, and the overwintering numbers increased from 2009. The study results show that the key land use types for protecting endangered species of birds are medium grassland, tidal flat and pond landscapes. Wetland changes are sensitive to the birds and significantly affected by the flow. We suggest that the artificial wetland project should enhance the three land use type area to ensure the wetland restoration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Quantifying livestock effects on bunchgrass vegetation with Landsat ETM plus data across a single growing season	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Grassland systems provide important habitat for native biodiversity and forage for livestock, with livestock grazing playing an important role influencing sustainable ecosystem function. Traditional field techniques to monitor the effects of grazing on vegetation are costly and limited to small spatial scales. Remote sensing has the potential to provide quantitative and repeatable monitoring data across large spatial and temporal scales for more informed grazing management. To investigate the ability of vegetation metrics derived from remotely sensed imagery to detect the effect of cattle grazing on bunchgrass grassland vegetation across a growing season, we sampled 32 sites across four prescribed stocking rates on a section of Pacific Northwest bunchgrass prairie in northeastern Oregon. We collected vegetation data on vertical structure, biomass, and cover at three different time periods: June, August, and October 2012 to understand the potential to measure vegetation at different phenological stages across a growing season. We acquired remotely sensed Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data closest in date to three field sampling bouts. We correlated the field vegetation metrics to Landsat spectral bands, 14 commonly used vegetation indices, and the tasselled cap wetness, brightness, and greenness transformations. To increase the explanatory value of the satellite-derived data, full, stepwise, and best-subset multiple regression models were fit to each of the vegetation metrics at the three different times of the year. Predicted vegetation metrics were then mapped across the study area. Field-based results indicated that as the stocking rate increased, the mean vegetation amounts of vertical structure, cover, and biomass decreased. The multiple regression models using common vegetation indices had the ability to discern different levels of grazing across the study area, but different spectral indices proved to be the best predictors of vegetation metrics for differing phenological windows. Field measures of vegetation cover yielded the highest correlations to remotely sensed data across all sampling periods. Our results from this analysis can be used to improve grassland monitoring by providing multiple measures of vegetation amounts across a growing season that better align with land management decision making.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2016	37	1					150	175		10.1080/01431161.2015.1117681								WOS:000367156000009

GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis for forest fire susceptibility mapping: a case study in Harenna forest, southwestern Ethiopia	TROPICAL ECOLOGY												Forest fire is influenced by ecological, human and climatic factors. Forest fire directly causes biodiversity loss and forest degradation and affects global climate change. The present study deals with identification of fire-prone areas in Harenna forest using remote sensing and GIS techniques. Parameters used for the analysis of the forest fire risk susceptibility were physiographic data and proximity factors, such as elevation, slope, aspect, vegetation type, proximity to settlements and distance from roads. All these parameters have direct and or indirect influence on the occurrence of fire. Multi-criteria decision-making technique was adopted to derive fire susceptibility map of the area. The final output shows forest fire-risk areas of Harenna forest in four categories such as very high risk, high risk, moderate risk and low risk. An extent of 22,981 ha (3.4 %) of forest cover in the area was of very high risk and 1,59,229 ha (24 %) was of high risk to forest fire. The extents of moderate and low fire-risk areas were 2,52,327 ha (37.3 %) and 1022 ha (0.15 %), respectively. Identity of locations of fire-prone areas in advance can be used effectively to plan fire control measures in forest and wildlife management areas.																	0564-3295					JAN	2016	57	1					33	43										WOS:000363436300004

Carr.), and a shift in tree species composition toward hardwood stands. Developing an understanding of the geographic distribution of individual species can inform conservation practices that seek to maintain functional capabilities of ecosystems. Modeling is necessary for understanding changes in forest composition, and subsequent changes in biodiversity, and one that can be implemented at the species level. By integrating the use of remote sensing, modeling, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) coupled with expert knowledge in forest ecology and disturbance, we can advance the methodologies currently available in the literature on predictive modeling. This paper describes an approach to modeling the spatial distribution of the less common but foundational tree species eastern hemlock throughout the state of Maine (similar to 84,000 km(2)) at a high resolution. There are currently no published accuracy assessments on predictive models for high resolution continuous distribution of eastern hemlock relative basal area that span the geographic extent covered by our model, which is at the northern limit of the species' range. A two stage mapping approach was used where presence/absence was predicted with an overall accuracy of 85% and the continuous distribution (percent basal area) was predicted with an accuracy of 84%. Overall, these findings are quite good despite high variability in the training dataset and the general minor component that eastern hemlock represents in the primary forest types in Maine. Eastern hemlock occurs along the southern half of the state stretching the east-west span with little to no occurrence in the northern regions. Several environmental and site characteristics, particularly average yearly maximum and minimum temperatures, were found to be positively correlated with hemlock occurrence. Eastern hemlock dominated stands appeared predominantly in the southwest corner of the state where HWA monitoring efforts can be focused. Given the importance of climate variables in predicting eastern hemlock, forecasts of future range shifts should be possible using data generated from climate scenarios. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Peng, J; Liu, ZC; Liu, YX; Hu, XX; Wang, A				Peng, Jian; Liu, Zhicong; Liu, Yanxu; Hu, Xiaoxu; Wang, An			Multifunctionality assessment of urban agriculture in Beijing City, China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												As an important approach to the realization of agricultural sustainable development, multifunctionality has become a hot spot in the field of urban agriculture. Taking 13 agricultural counties of Beijing City as the assessing units, this study selects 10 assessing index from ecological, economic and social aspects, determines the index weight using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method, and establishes an index system for the integrated agricultural function. Based on standardized data from agricultural census and remote sensing, the integrated function and multifunctionality of urban agriculture in Beijing City are assessed through the index grade mapping. The results show that agricultural counties with the highest score in ecological, economic, and social function are Yanqing, Changping, and Miyun, respectively; and the greatest disparity among those counties is economic function, followed by social and ecological function. Topography and human disturbance may be the factors that affect integrated agricultural function. The integrated agricultural function of Beijing rises at the beginning then drops later with the increase of mean slope, average altitude, and distance from the city. The whole city behaves balance among ecological, economic, and social functions at the macro level, with 8 out of the 13 counties belonging to ecology-society-economy balanced areas, while no county is dominant in only one of the three functions. On the micro scale, however, different counties have their own functional inclination: Miyun, Yanqing, Mentougou, and Fengtai are ecology-society dominant, and Tongzhou is ecology-economy dominant. The agricultural multifunctionality in Beijing City declines from the north to the south, with Pinggu having the most significant agricultural multifunctionality. The results match up well with the objective condition of Beijing's urban agriculture planning, which has proved the methodological rationality of the assessment to a certain extent.

J	Xu, H				Xu, Hao			ASSESSMENT OF CHANGES IN GREEN SPACE OF NANJING CITY USING 1998 AND 2007 LANDSAT SATELLITE DATA.	OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL												Conservation of green space is crucial to the sustainable urban development of China. Nanjing is a central city in the Yangtze River Delta cluster in eastern China. Owing to urbanization, the green spaces in this city have been affected significantly in terms of their scale and structure. Assessing such changes can provide a basis for environmental protection measures and sustainable development. Using Landsat remote-sensing image data from 1998 and 2007, we constructed a distribution map of the patches of green spaces in Nanjing, and analyzed and assessed the changes in scale and spatial layout of the green spaces using various landscape metrics including CA, PLAND, PD, MPS, LPI, NP, PD, TE, ED, MPI, and LSI. Coinciding with a sharp increase in urban population, the area of green spaces in Nanjing decreased by 27.06% between 1998 and 2007. The patches of green space increased by 39%, and the average area per patch decreased by about 47.52%. Green space patches were found to be unevenly distributed among the districts of Nanjing. In urban areas, significant numbers of such patches were found primarily in various types of parks, while in suburban areas, they were concentrated mainly in the hilly forestlands. Green spaces exhibited tendencies towards fragmentation, miniaturization, and discretization.																	0168-2601					DEC	2015	40	4					63	70										WOS:000373433800011

We conducted the present study to examine factors influencing the diversity and spatial distribution of herpetofauna in the Chakwal District (Chakwal Tehsil), Punjab, Pakistan. We gathered data from March 2011 through July 2013 in selected sampling sites of the study area using standard methods. We used satellite images to identify and classify different landscape features. We found that the herpetofaunal diversity varied from 2.07 (unprotected tropical thorn forest) to 0.27 (mixed habitat in a wildlife sanctuary), while evenness oscillated between 1.76 (unprotected tropical thorn forest) and 0.21 (mixed habitat in a wildlife sanctuary). The two units with the highest similarity (0.82) were wetlands inside a protected area and wetlands outside of a protected area. Of the 12 variables tested, the factor analysis produced seven significant variables (r > 0.80) influencing the herpetofauna of the study area. These included hard substrate, water availability, agriculture activities, road network, traffic, road mortality, and habitat conversion. The processed image of the area shows that the area is still dominated by natural vegetation and forest. However, the natural areas are intersected by road networks that make them easily accessible. Changes in the land-use practices such as habitat conversion for residential development, housing schemes, and road development may cause reductions in the diversity of amphibians and reptiles. Data on current diversity and distribution is needed for planning and we have suggested options for herpetofauna conservation and management.																	2151-0733	1931-7603				DEC	2015	10	3					801	810										WOS:000369505400001						
J	Shen, XL; Li, S; Wang, DJ; Lu, Z				Shen, Xiaoli; Li, Sheng; Wang, Dajun; Lu, Zhi			Viable contribution of Tibetan sacred mountains in southwestern China to forest conservation	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												The Tibetan sacred mountains (TSMs) cover a large area and may represent a landscape-scale conservation opportunity. We compared the conservation value of forests in these mountains with the conservation value of government-established nature reserves and unmanaged open-access areas in Danba County, southwestern China. We used Landsat satellite images to map forest cover and to estimate forest loss in 1974-1989, 1989-1999, and 1999-2013. The TSMs (n = 41) and nature reserves (n = 4) accounted for 21.6% and 29.7% of the county's land area, respectively. Remaining land was open-access areas (i.e., areas without any restrictions on resource use) (56.2%) and farmlands (2.2%). Within the elevation range suitable for forests, forest cover did not differ significantly between nature reserves (58.8%) and open-access areas (58.4%), but was significantly higher in TSMs (65.5%) after controlling for environmental factors such as aspect, slope, and elevation. The TSMs of great cultural importance had higher forest cover, but patrols by monastery staff were not necessarily associated with increased forest cover. The annual deforestation rate in nonsacred areas almost tripled in 1989-1999 (111.4 ha/year) relative to 1974-1989 (40.4 ha/year), whereas the rate in TSMs decreased in the later period (19.7 ha/year vs. 17.2 ha/year). The reduced forest loss in TSMs in 1989-1999 was possibly due to the renaissance of TSM worship and strengthened management by the local Buddhist community since late 1980s. The annual deforestation rate in Danba decreased dramatically to 4.4 ha/ year in 1999-2013, which coincided with the implementation of a national ban on logging in 1998. As the only form of protected area across the Tibetan region during much of its history, TSMs have positively contributed to conserving forest at a landscape scale. Conservation of TSM forests largely relied on the strength of local religious institutions. Integrating community-based conservation of TSMs within the government conservation network would benefit the conservation of the Tibetan region.																	0888-8892	1523-1739				DEC	2015	29	6					1518	1526		10.1111/cobi.12587								WOS:000368334800005	26371613					
J	Xu, DD; Guo, XL				Xu, Dandan; Guo, Xulin			Evaluating the impacts of nearly 30 years of conservation on grassland ecosystem using Landsat TM images	GRASSLAND SCIENCE												When grassland degradation became a global issue because of overgrazing and other human activities, grassland managers implemented different management methods in an attempt to restore grassland ecosystems (e.g. conservation actions). Few studies have investigated the impacts of conservation actions (removing large grazers and conserving biodiversity) on grassland ecosystems, therefore, this study aims to evaluate the impacts of conservation actions and to measure the time lag of the significant influences of grassland conservations on mixed grasslands that were assessed by five different biophysical parameters (biodiversity, soil organic matter, fresh biomass, litter cover and green cover). Instead of measuring the biophysical parameters from field data and remotely sensed images, the methodology of this study focused on the difference in biophysical parameters between the ecological comparison sites (grazing sites and conserved sites), which enhance the impacts of grassland conservation on grasslands comparing to grazing management. The results show that: (i) biodiversity in conserved grasslands increased gradually in the first 3-5 years, decreased gradually over the next 4 or 5 years, and then stabilized after that; (ii) soil organic matter increased and reached its maximum value within 7-9 years of conservation and then remained at this level, while litter accumulated the maximum level one year later than soil organic matter; (iii) soil organic matter is the primary factor of biodiversity in the grasslands with low litter accumulation, while high-density litter layers are the primary cause of decreases in biodiversity; (iv) fresh biomass decreased over a period of 7-10 years under conservation and remained nearly unchanged after that; (v) green vegetation fraction was also increased by conservation action in about 6-7 years. The result of this study provides the fundamental information for implementing and adjusting grassland management policies.

J	Liu, HJ; Sun, J				Liu, Haijiao; Sun, Jun			Netz-Phytoplankton Diversity in the western and southern regions of the South China Sea	OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES												Based on the survey records on netz-phytoplankton (>76 mu m) collected in the South China Sea (SCS) during the cruise from the 21st August to the 18th October, 2012, the species composition, biodiversity and its spatial distribution were studied. The identified 326 phytoplankton species belonged to 75 genera and 4 phyla. Thalassionema nitzschioides was the most dominant species accounting for 33.24% of the total cell abundance, followed by Bacteriastrum furcatum -8.69%. Whereas the phytoplankton cell abundance (cells l-1) was the highest in the Zhubi Reef (1106.45 +/- 2475.38), the southern SCS (396.84 +/- 969.87), the western SCS (90.82 +/- 144.66) and the northern SCS (66.48 +/- 70.89) in order. The distribution of phytoplankton appears to be affected by the Mekong river discharge and particles derived in Sumatra and Kalimantan from biomass burning, nutrient concentrations, the South China Sea Warm Current (SCSWC). The evaluation of biodiversity indices indicated the high level of species richness, evenness and biodiversity in the survey area.																	1730-413X	1897-3191				DEC	2015	44	4					530	538		10.1515/ohs-2015-0050								WOS:000368444900010

Implication of regionalization and connectivity analysis for marine spatial planning and coastal management in the Gulf of Cadiz and Alboran Sea	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												This work proposes a regionalization of marine waters south of the Iberian Peninsula, north Morocco and Algeria based on empirical orthogonal functions and GIS analysis. The regions identified are consistent and correspond to hydrological mesoscale and macroscale structures well characterized from physical and biological viewpoints. Although it is difficult to determine the boundaries of a fluid continuously moving, the procedure used recognizes the most frequent patterns and can be used to geographically reference the most likely position of the limit among the regions. Once established the regions, the connectivity among them is addressed by means of geostrophic currents derived from altimetry data. The main geostrophic circulation pattern depict an elevated connectivity in the area that might facilitate the conservation and recovery of species, but also imply a higher vulnerability to negative external forces and highlight the need of models, marine spatial planning, and coastal management approaches that include the pelagic ecosystem and connectivity of the seas. Furthermore, the results confirm that the cooperation between public authorities at different levels (local, regional, state) as well as among coastal countries is essential for Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) and prevention of potential risk derived from upcoming marine activities in the framework of the 2020 Agenda and Blue Growth Strategy (European Commission, 2012). The recently approved Directive for Marine Spatial Planning and Integrated Coastal Zone Management (European Commission, 2013), with the objective to avoid conflicts among diverse users and guarantees stable environment and sustainable growth, requiring information concerning regionalization and connectivity in the sea, but this information is not always available in all regions, space and time scales. Our approach offers a cheap, fast and universal applicable methodology for mesoscale regionalization and connectivity estimation as a starting point of a nested MSP approach until further detailed oceanographic studies can be carried out at the most interesting points identified in the respective area considered in the MSP.

Despite the existence of very high-resolution remote sensing technology for nearly two decades, comprehensive assessment of coral reef habitats at national to regional spatial scales and at very high spatial resolution is still scarce. Here, we develop benthic habitat maps at a sub-national scale by analyzing large multispectral QuickBird imagery dataset covering similar to 686 km(2) of the main shallow coral fringing reef along the southern border with Tanzania (4.68 degrees S, 39.18 degrees E) to the reef end at Malindi, Kenya (3.2 degrees S, 40.1 degrees E). Mapping was conducted with a user approach constrained by ground-truth data, with detailed transect lines from the shore to the fore reef. First, maps were used to evaluate the present management system's effectiveness at representing habitat diversity. Then, we developed three spatial prioritization scenarios based on differing objectives: (i) minimize lost fishing opportunity; (ii) redistribute fisheries away from currently overfished reefs; and (iii) minimize resource use conflicts. We further constrained the priority area in each prioritization selection scenario based on optionally protecting the least or the most climate exposed locations using a model of exposure to climate stress. We discovered that spatial priorities were very different based on the different objectives and on whether the aim was to protect the least or most climate-exposed habitats. Our analyses provide a spatially explicit foundation for large-scale conservation and management strategies that can account for ecosystem service benefits.

Remote sensing applications have progressed significantly and photogrammetry together with application of structure from motion software is emerging as a leading technique to create three-dimensional (3D) models of corals and reefs from which biophysical properties of structural complexity can be quantified. This enables the addressing of a range of important marine research questions, such as what the role of habitat complexity is in driving key ecological processes (i.e., foraging). Yet, it is essential to assess the accuracy and precision of photogrammetric measurements to support their application in mapping, monitoring and quantifying coral reef form and structure. This study evaluated the precision (by repeated modeling) and accuracy (by comparison with laser reference models) of geometry and structural complexity metrics derived from photogrammetric 3D models of marine benthic habitat at two ecologically relevant spatial extents; individual coral colonies of a range of common morphologies and patches of reef area of 100s of square metres. Surface rugosity measurements were generally precise across all morphologies and spatial extents with average differences in the geometry of replicate models of 1-6 mm for coral colonies and 25 mm for the reef area. Precision decreased with complexity of the coral morphology, with metrics for small massive corals being the most precise (1% coefficient of variation (CV) in surface rugosity) and metrics for bottlebrush corals being the least precise (10% CV in surface rugosity). There was no indication however that precision was related to complexity for the patch-scale modelling. The 3D geometry of coral models differed by only 1-3 mm from laser reference models. However, high spatial variation in these differences around the model led to a consistent underestimation of surface rugosity values for all morphs of between 8% and 37%. This study highlights the utility of several off-the-shelf photogrammetry tools for the measurement of structural complexity across a range of scales relevant to ecologist and managers. It also provides important information on the accuracy and precision of these systems which should allow for their targeted use by non-experts in computer vision within these contexts.

We summarize the role of remote sensing (both satellite and aircraft) for observational monitoring of forests, including measuring changes in their current and past extent for setting baselines, their carbon stock density for estimating emissions in areas that are deforested or degraded, and their regrowth dynamics following disturbance. We emphasize the synergistic role of integrating field inventory measurements with remote sensing for best practices in monitoring, reporting and verification. We also address the potential of remote sensing for enforcing safeguards on conservation of natural forests and biodiversity. We argue that capabilities exist now to meet operational needs for REDD+ measurement, reporting, and verification and reference levels. For some other areas of importance for REDD+, such as safeguards for natural forests and biodiversity, monitoring capabilities are approaching operational in the near term. For all REDD+ needs, measurement capabilities will rapidly advance in the next few years as a result of new technology as well as advances in capacity building both within and outside of the tropical forest nations on which REDD+ is primarily focused.
