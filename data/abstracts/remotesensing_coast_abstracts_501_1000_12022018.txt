It is an important indicator to reveal the condition of forest systems and has a significant importance for ecosystem models as a main input. The aim of this study is to estimate the percent tree cover of various forest stands in a Mediterranean environment based on an empirical relationship between tree coverage and remotely sensed data in Goksu Watershed located at the Eastern Mediterranean coast of Turkey. A regression tree algorithm was used to simulate spatial fractions of Pinus nigra, Cedrus libani, Pinus brutia, Juniperus excelsa and Quercus cerris using multi-temporal LANDSAT TM/ETM data as predictor variables and land cover information. Two scenes of high resolution GeoEye-1 images were employed for training and testing the model. The predictor variables were incorporated in addition to biophysical variables estimated from the LANDSAT TM/ETMdata. Additionally, normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) was incorporated to LANDSAT TM/ETM band settings as a biophysical variable. Stepwise linear regression (SLR) was applied for selecting the relevant bands to employ in regression tree process. SLR-selected variables produced accurate results in the model with a high correlation coefficient of 0.80. The output values ranged from 0 to 100 %. The different tree species were mapped in 30 m resolution in respect to elevation. Percent tree cover map as a final output was derived using LANDSAT TM/ETM image over Goksu Watershed and the biophysical variables. The results were tested using high spatial resolution GeoEye-1 images. Thus, the combination of the RT algorithm and higher resolution data for percent tree cover mapping were tested and examined in a complex Mediterranean environment.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				FEB	2015	187	2							4	10.1007/s10661-014-4151-5								WOS:000349012200004	25604062

Mangrove shrimp farm mapping and productivity on the Brazilian Amazon coast: Environmental and economic reasons for coastal conservation	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												The present study evaluates the role of marine aquaculture in the conversion of mangrove forests into shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei, Boone, 1931) farms using remote sensing and geographic information system techniques and analyzes the productivity of the installed farms in the mangroves and adjacent coastal plateau. The extension of the shrimp ponds was quantified using satellite image analysis, and the water quality of the shrimp farms was analyzed based on measurements of dissolved oxygen concentration, temperature, pH, and salinity. The productivity of the farms was measured using biometric data. The data were analyzed using ANOVA with Tukey's post-test. The results indicated that shrimp farms cover an area of similar to 0.8 km(2) (approximately 0.4% of Brazilian ponds), of which 29.4% are located within areas of mangroves, and 70.6% are located in the coastal plateau. Saltwater aquaculture contributed to the conversion of 0.53 km(2) of the mangroves into rearing ponds, which represents only 0.007% of the total area of the Amazonian mangroves. The installations in the mangrove presented significantly higher pH, temperature, transparency, and salinity compared with the ponds installed in the coastal plateau, although coastal plateau ponds had higher dissolved oxygen concentrations. Based on these differences, the mean sizes of the shrimp raised in the mangrove and coastal plateau ponds were 5.7 g and 4.3 g, respectively. However, the estimated value of one hectare of mangrove is much higher than its potential value in the production of shrimp. The considerable value of the ecosystem services provided by the mangroves indicates that the production of shrimp in the coastal plateau is relatively less damaging in ecological and economic terms. Thus, we can consider that the production of shrimp in the coastal plateau instead of in mangrove areas is less damaging to the long-term conservation of mangrove forests, which follows the management best practices established by international organizations. The coastal zone is considered a common resource that belongs to all citizens in Iberoamerican countries, and it is defined as a zone of non-building. Therefore, we conclude that mangroves are more valuable intact than converted into aquaculture ponds. Hence, aquaculture activities in the Amazon coastal plain are not sustainable from environmental and socioeconomic perspectives. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SIMilarity Environment Correction (SIMEC) applied to MERIS data over inland and coastal waters	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The launch of several new satellites such as Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3, HyspIRI, EnMAP and PRISMA in the very near future, opens new perspectives for the inland and coastal water community. The monitoring of the water quality closer to the coast, within estuaries or small lakes with satellite data will become feasible. However for these inland and nearshore coastal waters, adjacency effects may hamper the correct retrieval of water quality parameters from remotely sensed imagery. Here, we present a sensor-generic adjacency pre-processing method, SIMilarity Environment Correction (SIMEC). The correction algorithm estimates the contribution of the background radiance based on the correspondence with the Near-INfrared (NIR) similarity spectrum. The performance of SIMEC was tested on MERIS FR images both above highly reflecting waters with high SPM loads, as well as dark lake waters with high CDOM absorption. The results show that SIMEC has a positive or neutral effect on the normalized remote sensing reflectance above optically-complex waters, retrieved with the MERIS MEGS or UR processor.

On the vertical structure and spectral characteristics of the marine Low-Level Jet	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH					11th Conference of Meteorology, Climatology and Atmospheric Physics	MAY 30-JUN 01, 2012	Athens, GREECE					The aim of this work is the study of the vertical structure and the spectral characteristics of the marine Low Level Jets (LLJs) which are associated with frontal events. The analyzed data are based on remote sensing (sodar) and in-situ instrumentation measurements, performed during summer 2003, in the frame of the Coupled Boundary Layers Air-Sea Transfer Experiment in Low Winds (CBLAST-Low), at Nantucket Island, MA, U.S.A. The study of the vertical structure of the lower marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer (MABL), during a ten day period, has shown that the first 100 to 200 m, is characterized by strongly stable atmospheric conditions which are modified to slightly stable or almost neutral at higher levels. The frequent development of LLJs was also observed and was associated with frontal events, depending on the meteorological conditions. In order to understand the influence of the different physical processes and to study the vertical distribution of the wind intensity variations at the various time scales of interest, the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) algorithm was applied to the time series of the wind data from the sodar, at different levels. Results are presented and discussed for certain LLJ cases, where the observed LLJs were persistent for several hours or days while the analysis of the wind speed data showed high amplitude variations corresponding to contributions not only from inertial but also from diurnal and meso-scale motions.

High-energy forces such as wind, tides, waves, and currents cause widespread erosion and morphodynamic instability along the shoreline. This investigation uses diverse images from multitemporal and multiresolution analyses and a Post-Processing Kinematic Global Positioning System (PPK GPS) survey as the primary resources to study the short and long-term effects of shoreline changes and the processes controlling the persistent horizontal and vertical erosion on the beach. We used moderate-resolution remote sensing images from 1973 to 2012 and high-resolution images from 2003 to 2011. Between 1973 and 2012 a total area of 121,494.52m(2) was affected by erosion and 37,266.58m(2) was affected by accretion. Shoreline progradation rates of 4.2m/year and recession rates of -3.7m/year were estimated for the period between 1973 and 1986 and mean erosion rates of 1.5m/year were estimated from 1986 to 2012. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) comparison resulting from different PPK GPS surveys showed a negative sediment balance of approximately -3,261.94m(3) in a plot of 12,500m(2) between May and September 2012. The coast has also been facing a drastically increased human influence in recent decades. In summary, this article aims to contribute information to support the mitigation of coastal erosion and to protect seaside infrastructure.																	0149-0419	1521-060X				JAN 2	2015	38	1					1	25		10.1080/01490419.2014.904257								WOS:000345365900001

A multidisciplinary approach based on remote sensing, fieldwork, and chemical analysis was adopted in order to identify the pressures facing the mangrove communities in Tarut Bay and subsequently evaluate its current environmental condition. The analysis focused on the 2011 to 2014 timeframe in particular. The results indicate that the mangrove communities in Tarut Bay cover currently around 11.32 square km. Two major mangrove cover changes were identified in the area during the studied period, with a net loss of around 0.675 square km happening in the interim. The analysis adopted the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to evaluate the temporal change in vegetation concentration. Moreover, the study evaluated the overall pollution condition of 19 mangrove communities in Tarut Bay to be medium based on the Pollution Load Index (PLI). Nevertheless, some of the mangrove communities in Tarut Bay are very healthy while others are very polluted and require immediate action to improve their pollution status. The findings of this work led to recommending mangrove improvement measures to address further deterioration and disappearance of mangrove communities, including the re-opening of natural inlets and avoiding residential developments on the mangrove coast.																	2194-9034						2015	47	W3					269	276		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-7-W3-269-2015								WOS:000380531900041

MULTI-SCALE MONITORING OF LANDSCAPE CHANGE AFTER THE 2011 TSUNAMI	36TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				36th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment	MAY 11-15, 2015	Berlin, GERMANY					The Great East Japan Earthquake (magnitude 9.0; occurred on 11th March 2011) and subsequent huge tsunami caused widespread damage along the Pacific Ocean coast of eastern Honshu, Japan. This research utilizes multi-resolution remote sensing images to clarify the impact on landscapes caused by this disaster, and also to monitor the subsequent survival and recovery process in the Sendai Bay region. The coastal landscape in the target area features a narrow strip of coastal sand barrier, historically stabilized by planted pine groves; backed by a low-lying plain that has traditionally been diked and converted to irrigated rice paddies. Farmsteads on the flat alluvial plain are surrounded by groves called "Igune", consisting primarily of conifers. MODIS data (250 m resolution) were employed to map the overall extent of inundation and damage on the regional landscape scale. The major damage caused by the tsunami, destruction of coastal pine forests and inundation or rice paddies on the plain, was identified at this level. Progressively finer scale analysis were then implemented using SPOT/HRG-2 (10 m resolution) data; GeoEye-1 fine resolution data (0.5 m) and very fine resolution aerial photographs (10 cm) and LiDAR. These results demonstrated the minute details of the damage and recovery process. Some patches of pine forest, for example, were seen to have survived, and some coastal plant communities were already recovering only a year after the disaster. Continuous monitoring using field work and remote sensing is required for balanced regional strategies that provide for economic and social recovery and as well as restoration of vegetation, biodiversity and vital ecosystem services.																	2194-9034						2015	47	W3					805	809		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-7-W3-805-2015								WOS:000380531900119

TSUNAMI AFFECTED FARMLAND EXTRACTION USING MORPHOLOGICAL PROFILES (MPs) METHOD BY SATELLITE IMAGES INCLUDING SAR AND VISIBLE-NEAR-INFRARED BAND DATA	36TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				36th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment	MAY 11-15, 2015	Berlin, GERMANY					The agricultural fields along the coast were submerged under the sea water after the 2011 off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku Japan Tsunami. The conventional method of detecting Tsunami reached area by SAR satellite data is to compare the data obtained between previous to and after the Tsunami. However such kind of SAR data should be prepared prior to the natural disaster, but in many disaster cases, people have often encountered difficulties in finding such kind of data observed in advance in some regions. Therefore it is desirable to find a way to detect the flood suffering farmlands caused by a Tsunami, using only data observed after the disaster event. The morphological profiles (MPs) method are tested using ALOS/PALSAR and AVNIR-2 data. This MPs method is proposed as the tool for extracting information about the size, shape and the orientation of structures in single-band remote sensing images and has been improved to establish the extended morphological profiles(EMP) dealing with full-spectral information in the multi-/hyper-spectral data (Benediktsson, J. A. et al., 2003,2005). The author's work is intended to apply this MPs method to combined single polarization SAR data and visual and near-infrared bands data. The results approximately coincide with the farmland regions actually reached by the Tsunami. This MPs method requires only data once obtained soon after a disaster, light computer resources and very short turnaround time. It should be suitable for the detection of Tsunami reached areas or tidal wave reached areas, caused by a Typhoon for example, using satellite data only once obtained after a disaster.																	2194-9034						2015	47	W3					871	875		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-7-W3-871-2015								WOS:000380531900130

GENERATING A LONG-TERM SERIES OF SST AND CHLOROPHYLL-A FOR THE COAST OF IRELAND	36TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				36th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment	MAY 11-15, 2015	Berlin, GERMANY					The use of remote sensing has increased greatly in recent years due to technological advances and its advantages in comparison with traditional methods. In the case of Ireland however the use of these techniques is not well established and only 17% of remote sensing studies are related to marine and coastal environments. As a first step, and taking into account that fisheries and aquaculture plays an important economic and social role in Ireland, a database of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) relating to the ICES fisheries management areas is being generated. Up to now three different products have been produced. These products correspond to the annual SST Climatology and annual SST Anomalies from 1982 to 2014, as well as the annual Chl-a Climatology taking into account the different life span of CZCS (1982-1986), SeaWIFS (1997-2010), MERIS (2002-2012) and MODIS-Aqua (2002-2014). Initially, the Chl-a Climatology was produced for each sensor individually while the creation of a continuous Chl-a series will be investigated in the future. Analysing the SST trends highlighted an increasing trend in SST values in Irish waters, a trend which was more pronounced in the northern areas (+0.54 degrees C in the last 10 years). Although there are differences between sensors, Chl-a concentration seems to present higher values in the Celtic Sea since 2009. Analysing the ICES Divisions individually highlighted that coastal areas presented the highest Chl-a concentrations, involving a clear differentiation in the optical properties of coastal and oceanic waters.																	2194-9034						2015	47	W3					933	940		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-7-W3-933-2015								WOS:000380531900139

The empirical XWAVE algorithm for estimation of significant wave height has been adopted for coastal application and implemented for NRT services. All available TS-X images in the German Bight collocated with buoy measurements (6 buoys) since 2013 were processed and analysed (total of 46 scenes/passages with 184 StripMap images). Sea state estimated from series of TS-X images cover strips with length of similar to 200km and width of 30km over the German Bight from East-Frisian Islands to the Danish coast. The comparisons with results of wave prediction model show a number of local variations due to variety in bathymetry and wind fronts.																	2194-9034						2015	47	W3					983	990		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-7-W3-983-2015								WOS:000380531900146

WATERLINE DETECTION AND MONITORING IN THE GERMAN WADDEN SEA USING HIGH RESOLUTION SATELLITE-BASED RADAR MEASUREMENTS	36TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				36th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment	MAY 11-15, 2015	Berlin, GERMANY					High resolution TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X as well as Sentinel-1 remote sensing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are used to determine and monitor the waterline in the Wadden Sea. In this very unique and dynamic coastal region in the southeastern North Sea, tidal flats extend several kilometers away from the coast during low tide with features like tidal inlets and sand banks. Under the influence of tidal water currents transporting large amounts of eroded material, inlets and sand banks move over time; heavy storms can even cause large variations in their extensions in merely a few hours. Observation of these obstacles is crucial for maritime security as high ship traffic is caused by the ports of Hamburg, Bremerhaven, Wilhelmshaven and others. Conventional monitoring campaigns with ships or airplanes are economically expensive and can only provide limited coverage. We present an automatic algorithm with Near Real-Time capability for extracting the waterline at the time of recording from SAR images, which allows for a fast and large scale determination of changes in coastal outlines. The comparison of recent acquisitions of TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1 to bathymetry data of the Elbe estuary obtained in 2010 reveals significant changes in tidal flat structures.

SIGNIFICANT WAVE HEIGHT DETERMINED FROM SEQUENCE OF X-BAND RADAR IMAGES USING TEAGER-HUANG TRANSFORM	36TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				36th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment	MAY 11-15, 2015	Berlin, GERMANY					This work introduces a nonlinear and data-dependant method for extracting the significant wave height from a sequence of X-band radar images, which is based on the Teager-Huang Transform (THH). The THH comprises two parts, which are empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and application of the Teager-Kaiser energy operator (TKEO). EMD is applied to decompose the images into various decompositions, which are narrow-banded and have mono-components; TKEO separates the aforementioned narrow-banded components into their amplitude and frequency. The standard deviation of the separated amplitude is related to Hs, and, the relation is obtained by calibrating radar data with in situ data (buoy). The separated frequencies reveal the orientation and intensity of data, which are directly related to the direction of the waves. For validation, the method was applied to sequences of radar images that were obtained from the west coast of Taiwan. The results obtained using the method indicate that THH can be used specifically to estimate Hs with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.34 m. Furthermore, the developed method can efficiently measure the direction of waves at each specific point in an image.																	2194-9034						2015	47	W3					1265	1268		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-7-W3-1265-2015								WOS:000380531900188

Self-Organized Synchronization Based on a Chirp-Sequence Waveform for an HF Ocean Radar Network	OCEANS 2015 - MTS/IEEE WASHINGTON	OCEANS-IEEE				OCEANS MTS/IEEE Conference	OCT 19-22, 2015	Washington, DC	MTS, IEEE				HF ocean radars are usually installed along the coast and deliver remote sensing information by transmitting a radio signal with an operating frequency between 3 and 30 MHz. The frequency band allows for a large coverage of ocean surface that could extend more than 200 kilometers offshore depending on the transmit frequency and other operating conditions. To provide a dense coverage of the sea surface, the installation of ocean radars in a radar network may require that the transmitting and receiving units of a radar network demand time synchronization between the units to perform correct space-time measurements of ocean parameters. In this paper, a self-organized synchronization for HF ocean radars is considered without the use of Global Positioning System (GPS) devices. In the case of multiple transmitters, the power peaks are observed in spectra simultaneously for each of the transmitters; hence the time shift can be estimated separately for each of them. The self-organized approach is very useful for the case of multiple transmitters and receivers in a radar network as well as in multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar configurations, which utilize the feasibility of occupying less space for a HF radar receive antenna while maintaining the high spatial resolution of the radar data.																	0197-7385		978-0-933957-43-5				2015																		WOS:000380550000373

Wave conditions are also topical from a research perspective, controlling processes such as coastal erosion and ocean mixing. Therefore, being able to characterize wave conditions on broad spatiotemporal scales is extremely valuable. A network of High-Frequency (HF) radar systems can provide measurements of wave conditions in near-real time along the coast where better observations are needed. Measurement of wave parameters such as significant wave height, wave period and wave direction is a secondary function of the SeaSonde HF radar. Waves are measured with SeaSonde HF radars from the second-order portion of the echo spectrum. The Doppler shift of the radio transmission from the SeaSonde contains information about the orbital velocity of the primary Bragg waves and the larger waves that they ride on. Since the wave data is dependent upon the occurrence of both Bragg and larger surface gravity waves, there is a minimum threshold for sea states in which reliable wave parameters can be determined. There is also a limiting factor for the radar in large sea states as the first-order spectra merge with the second-order and interpretation of the spectra becomes impossible with existing methods. We have tested methods for wave extraction and will present the results here. Our analysis explores the frequency-dependent threshold wave conditions for reliable wave parameter measurements, and which systems provide the best measurements. We also tested different radio waveform parameters to see which performed best in different environmental conditions. The study focuses on in-situ wave measurements from National Data Buoy Center (NOAA) buoys within the domain of the HF radar network, deployed offshore of Long Island and Delaware Bay, as well as mooring deployments of opportunity closer to the coast. Measurements will also be evaluated within the context of larger scale wave models routinely run in the area by NOAA. The threshold conditions determined by this study will guide the application of HF radar-based wave estimates to surf zone conditions by local weather forecast offices.																	0197-7385		978-0-933957-43-5				2015																		WOS:000380550000264

Recently, remote sensing techniques have been successfully applied in marine benthic mapping in coastal waters. However, the majority of these techniques have focused on either seagrasses meadows or coral reefs. There are a few studies that have been published validating a methodology for mapping SAV on brown macroalgae (Sargassum spp., Ecklonia spp.), seagrasses, and/or other macroalgae groups by spectral response from remote sensing. Hence, we studied the in-situ optical properties of living macroalgae, seagrasses, and rubble. The spectral characteristics of varied SAV groups were measured using the high resolution FieldSpec (R) 4 Hi-Res portable spectroradiometer. The study site selected was the Shoalwater Islands Marine Park, Rockingham, Western Australia as it is one of the fifteen biodiversity hotspots in Australia. Correlation and Principle Component Analysis were employed to evaluate the differences between SAV groups. The results have documented the spectral features of SAV and their associated habitats in Shoalwater Islands Marine Park, Western Australia, and developed a spectral library to distinguish among seagrass species and algae groups (green, red, and brown benthic macroalgae). The implications of this study will contribute to estimate and detect the distribution and seasonal variation of SAV on a broader scale.																	0197-7385		978-0-933957-43-5				2015																		WOS:000380550000227

The understanding of these interactions has gained more interest over the last years especially for port entrances and close to shore shipping activities. In contrast to in-situ measurements, remote sensing techniques have the advantage to provide area covering data of several parameters (waves, currents and bathymetry), observed at the same time. The wave and current monitoring system WaMoS II is a remote sensing system based on a nautical X-Band radar generally used for navigation and ship traffic control. Nautical radar are designed to monitor the sea surface continuously over a relative large area (similar to 10km2) with high spatial (similar to 7.5m) and temporal resolution (similar to 2s). In recent years more focus was put on retrieving current and wave data at that high resolution on an operational basis. In this paper a brief introduction into the high resolution current and water depth measurement principle of WaMoS II will be given. A data comparison will be shown from the South Coast of New Zealand. This site is characterised by strong prevailing tidal currents as well as very inhomogeneous, wave and current fields.																			978-1-4799-8301-8				2015																		WOS:000380439000015

Remote sensing technology becomes an important approach of monitoring changes in the coastline by virtue of its high efficiency, wide range and low cost. Taking the Beidaihe coast as an example, the coastline extraction of SAR and Landsat TM images is extracted based on the geometrical active contour model. This method through setting the initial contour, regards the movement of contour curve as synthesize of force, and minimizes the energy function. It makes the initial contour approximate to the real object boundary. The result shows that the method can effectively extract the continuous and complete coastline from different kinds of remote sensing images.																			978-1-4799-1717-4				2015							362	366										WOS:000380441000064

Estimation of long and short term shoreline changes along Andhra Pradesh coast using Remote Sensing and GIS techniques	8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ASIAN AND PACIFIC COASTS (APAC 2015)	Procedia Engineering				8th International Conference on Asian and Pacific Coasts (APAC 2015)	SEP 07-10, 2015	Chennai, INDIA	IIT Madras, APAC Council, COES, JSCE, KSCOE				Identifying shoreline changes and its variability is a fundamental task for various coastal studies undertaken by coastal scientists, engineers and coastal managers. ICMAM-PD has implemented a national project for monitoring the shoreline changes for entire Indian coast using satellite imageries to maintain a long-term database in GIS environment. In this paper an attempt has been made to implement a "shoreline proxy" for monitoring the shoreline changes along Andhra Pradesh coast for last 22 years (1990-2012). Multi-resolution satellite data such as Landsat TM, Landsat ETM+, IRS-P5 (Cartosat-1) and IRS-P6 (LISS-III & LISS-IV) were used to assess the short and long-term shoreline changes. The Standard Operating Protocols were followed for image rectification, shoreline extraction and the map accuracy as per NNRMS standard. The changes were classified as stable, erosion (low, medium and high) and accretion (low, medium and high). 974 km long Andhra coast was divided into 89 segments identical to Survey of India toposheets of 1: 25000 scale. The analysis revealed that 275 km long shoreline was under erosion, 417 km has shown accretion and 153 km coastline is under stable condition. Region like Korakupalaiyam, Pallikuppam, Toppalappalaiyam, Virrasettitannippandal, Vatturupallipalem (above the Upputeru River), Ramulapatisangam, Binginipalle, Rayaduruvu, Peddaboyanapalem, Ullapalem, Uppada etc are identified as high erosion prone areas. However, the regions like Bangarapalem, Yerraipetta, Pedhatheenarla, Kothachodupallipetta, Konapapapetta, and northern Kakinada were seen with low to moderate erosion. Pattapupalem, Pallepalem, Kesavapalem, Gundamala regions were noticed with moderate accretion. Southern coast i.e. Nellore to Sriharikotta is mostly stable or accreting nature. Further in northern parts, Ichchapuram to Beemunipatanam coast does not depict any significant change as it is covered with sand dunes and sandy beach. (C) 2015 The Authors.

IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF TROPICAL CYCLONE HUD HUD ON COASTAL REGION OF VISAKHAPATNAM, ANDHRA PRADESH, INDIA	ISPRS Joint International Geoinformation Conference 2015	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences	OCT 28-30, 2015	Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA					Tropical cyclone is a rapidly rotating storm system characterized by a low pressure center, strong winds, and a spiral arrangements of thunderstorms that produce heavy rain. Tropical cyclones typically form over large bodies of relatively warm water. On 6th October 2014 Hud Hud originates from a low pressure system that formed under the influence of an upper air cyclonic circulation in the Andaman Sea. On 9th October 2014 the IMD department classified the Hud Hud as a very severe cyclonic storm on IMD scale and category 4 on Staffir-Simpson scale. The cyclone hit the coast of Visakhapatnam on 12th October 2014 at wind speed of 175 km/h which caused extensive damage to the city and the neighbouring districts. The damage caused by Cyclone Hud Hud not only changed the landscape of the port city, but also made it the first city in the country to be directly hit by a cyclone since 1891 as per the records of the IMD. The remote sensing technique used here is NDVI. NDVI will separate vegetation and non-vegetation part. The NDVI will be classified in ERDAS and calculated the area using ARCGIS. The satellite data of 4th October 2014 show s before the cyclone, 14th October 2014 shows after the cyclone and 7th December 2014 after two month of cyclone.																	2194-9034						2015	II-2	W2					123	130		10.5194/isprsannals-II-2-W2-123-2015								WOS:000380584800018						
B	Hessner, K; Wallbridge, S; Dolphin, T			IEEE	Hessner, Katrin; Wallbridge, Steve; Dolphin, Tony			Validation of Areal Wave and Current Measurements Based on X-Band Radar	2015 IEEE/OES 11TH CURRENT, WAVES AND TURBULENCE MEASUREMENT (CWTM)					Current, Waves and Turbulence Measurement (CWTM), (IEEE/OES) Eleventh	MAR 02-06, 2015	St Petersburg, FL					Coastal waters are characterised by complex wave fields that are influenced by inhomogeneous bathymetries, and changing tidal-and wind-induced currents. Understanding these interactions is important for coastal engineering and environmental management. Remote sensing techniques, such as radar for flow field data collection, increase the amount of available information. Unlike in-situ techniques (e.g. buoys, or moored current meters), remote sensing can provide continuous observation of several parameters (waves, currents and bathymetry) simultaneously across a wide area. The wave and current monitoring system, WaMoS II, is a remote sensing system using standard nautical X-Band radars generally used for navigation and ship traffic control. Nautical radars are designed to monitor the sea surface continuously over a relative large area (similar to 10 km2) with high spatial (similar to 7.5 m) and temporal resolution (similar to 2 s). Under various conditions, signatures of the sea surface itself become visible in the near range (less than 3 nautical miles) of such radar images. These signatures include spatial and temporal information of the sea surface waves (wind/sea and swell), currents and in shallow water also about the local water depth. In recent years, development has focussed on retrieving current and wave data at that high resolution on an operational basis (Hessner et al., 2007 [ 1]; Hessner and Bell, 2009, Hessner et al. 2014). In this paper, a brief introduction will be given to the high resolution current and water depth measurement principles of WaMoS II. WaMoS II current and wave data will be shown from the Sizewell test site, where a system has been installed since September 2013. This site is located on the East coast of England, an area of coastline which has been intensively studied over many decades. The hydrodynamics of this area are characterised by strong prevailing tidal currents with current magnitudes between 1-1.5m/s and a strongly bi-directional wave climate. The WaMoS II system at this site, operates in connection with a Kelvin Hughes (Manta Digital) with a horizontally polarized 8 ft antenna and a radar repetition rate of 1.34s. The antenna is mounted 66m above sea level. The area of radar observation ranges from 150m to 4000m, off shore (0-180 degrees relative to N). The system delivers standard sea state measurements with an update rate of 2 min and high resolution current and depth information in a range up to 4 km with an update rate of 20 minutes and a spatial resolution of about 180m. The observation area is characterised by a straight North-Southward aligned coastline and an offshore sandbank with varying water depth between 5-15m. The localised effect of the bank on the wave and flow fields is thought to have significant impact at the shoreline. The complex hydrodynamics and spatially varying currents would be impossible to monitor at the appropriate scale with point measurements only. Here typical tidal states and sea state conditions will be discussed. For the validation of the WaMoS II wave and current measurements, reference point measurements acquired by ADCP sensors at 3 different locations in the radar view field were used. Data acquired within the working range of WaMoS II (Hs > 0.5m, wind speed > 5m/s) show an excellent agreement with reference data but also spatial wave and current variation due to the bathymetry. During the observation period the prevailing wave direction was East North East, but periods of South-East waves were also observed. The radar data revealed the complexity of the wave and flow field with respect to the interaction between tides, waves and bathymetry.																			978-1-4799-8419-0				2015																		WOS:000380426700009

Making accurate measurements of wave conditions will help validate wave models and will help with forecasts of the wave conditions over the next few days. The United States has put forth "A National Operational Wave Observation Plan" to meet this need. It has called for 133 wave measurements in the coastal zone. High Frequency radar systems that are already in place can be one type of sensor to fill this measurement gap. Seven 13 MHz HF radars collected wave data along the coast of New Jersey from February 1, 2012 to June 1, 2012. The measurements from the radars utilizing existing algorithms were compared with wave measurements from accelerometer measurements aboard National Buoy Data Center platforms. Since there were large distances between the comparison points we first determined what the correlation was amongst the various buoy platforms to gauge the variability within the region. This provided a baseline for the comparison between the HF radar measurements and the nearby buoy measurements. We then evaluated three new wave measurement algorithms at one of the radar stations to see if that improved the measurements. The correlation of the radar wave measurements with that of the buoy varied considerably. We then chose one radar station that had good correlation with the buoy measurement and tested new algorithms to extract the wave information from the radar spectra. In each case, the comparison between the in situ record with the new algorithm showed improvement. The measurement of wave information with the radar showed moderate correlation with the in situ measurements. The four algorithms each showed improvement over the existing one. HF radar could be a sensor to play a role in the US national waves plan.																			978-1-4799-8419-0				2015																		WOS:000380426700016

The high tide water levels were extracted as coastline approximations and the coastal types were made by manual interpretation based on Google earth high resolution images in this study. The results indicated that the coast changes mainly happened at the northern and eastern parts of the island. The artificial coast came up to 46.4 km with an increment about 8.8 km due to sea reclamation while the mudflat coast decreased about 18.1 km and faded away from 1999 to 2006. Then there was another increase of artificial coast due to returning ponds back to sea, and the sand coast also increased due to sand supply project from 2006 to 2013. Thus the artificial coast increased to 48.0 km and the sand coast increased from 10.1 km to 16.9 km. The total coastline decreased from 66.4 km to 57.0 km first but then increased back to 65.5 km during the whole period while the island area had a persistent growth from 128.5 km(2) to 140.0 km(2). The coastlines moved northward and seaward with less curves due to local constructions except the parts returning ponds back to sea. The rapid social and economic development raised great demand of land use as well as the environmental quality, which made sea reclamation and returning ponds back to sea the main causes of coast changes of Xiamen Island.																			978-1-4799-7749-9				2015							197	201										WOS:000380447800039

The eutrophication in the offshore area is greatly weakening the functions of ecological environment, aquiculture and tourism of water, which badly hinders the sustainable social and economic development of cities and the coast. Qinhuangdao is an important coastal tourism and port trade city in our country, and its environmental change and development trend of the offshore area will directly affect the future development of the city. This thesis mainly introduces the current situation of eutrophication in the offshore area of Qinhuangdao City in Hebei, studies how to make use of remote sensing monitoring method to develop the monitoring and evaluation of eutrophication. Meanwhile, it also analyzes relevant research status at home and abroad so as to offer some help to the monitoring and evaluation of eutrophication in the offshore area.																			978-1-315-66798-0; 978-1-138-02867-8				2015							1261	1264										WOS:000377647700240

For several years, a number of cartographical studies have been undertaken but they generally only cover limited areas and the methods used, as well as their accuracy, vary widely from one site to another. An original approach has been initiated for this purpose along the coast of Corsica (1 000 km of coastline); it has involved (i) surveying all the available data (293 identified maps), (ii) selecting and extracting the most relevant data (date and method of acquisition, accuracy), (iii) updating the data on surface habitats (e.g. upper limits of the Posidonia oceanica meadows) by means of remote sensing of recent images, (iv) homogenizing all the available data (according to the typology of benthic biocenoses of the Mediterranean), (v) assembling the full set of data within an easily incrementable Geographical Information System (GIS), and (v) proposing a scale of reliability making it possible to associate a degree of confidence to each point on the map. This approach has resulted in the production of a map covering the whole Corsican coastline down to 50 to 150 m depth (depending on the sector considered), including, where there is an overlap, only the data with the highest degree of reliability. The surface area mapped is estimated at around 300 000 ha, which makes it one of the largest recent maps ever produced for the Mediterranean. This approach provides a basis for determining the value attributed to the various existing maps and proposing the most accurate map. In addition, offers a basis for targeting priority sectors for the production of new maps.																			978-605-85652-3-4				2015							263	269										WOS:000377577200026

What was left of former settlements and historical land use was buried under sediments for centuries, but when the surface layer is driven away under the permanent action of wind, currents, and waves, they appear again at the Wadden Sea surface. However, the frequent flooding and, thereby, the strong erosion of the intertidal flats make any archaeological monitoring a difficult task, so that remote sensing techniques appear to be an efficient and cost-effective instrument for any archaeological surveillance of that area. We show that high-resolution space borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery with pixel sizes well below 1 m(2) can be used to complement archaeological surveys and that SAR images from the German TerraSAR/ TanDEM-X satellites clearly show remnants of farmhouse foundations and of former systems of ditches, dating back to the 14th and to the 16th/17th centuries. In particular, the new high-resolution TerraSAR-X acquisition mode ('staring spotlight') allows for the detection of various kinds of residuals of historical land use, some of which have been unknown so far.																			978-605-85652-3-4				2015							953	963										WOS:000377577200090

The Master Plan provides the strategic vision of Romanian Black Sea management, providing a prioritized, sustainable, long-term approach, oriented to manage and combat erosion consequences and implications on the environment, marine ecosystems, economic and social values of the coastal area. An important component is the local strategic monitoring for collection of data and information on coastal work performance. The surveillance of the shore evolution started since 1980, currently the measurements are based on GPS and remote sensing modern techniques (LIDAR), beach profiles and granulommetry. This paper analyzes the preliminary results of beach behavior in context of starting in 2013-2014 the coastal protection works. The integration of data is provided by a GIS system that improves their accessibility and their availability. GIS also provides efficient functions for rapid production of thematic or synthetic maps, detection of spatial changes, for the assessment of future evolution, and for impact simulations.																	1314-2704		978-619-7105-35-3				2015							1035	1042										WOS:000371600100129

Trans-ionospheric radio wave measurements sense the total electron content (TEC) along the signal propagation path. In this research, we introduce a novel GPS-based detection and estimation technique for remote sensing of atmospheric wave-induced TIDs including space weather phenomena induced by major natural hazard events, using TEC time series collected from worldwide ground-based dual-frequency GNSS (including GPS) receiver networks. We demonstrate the ability of using ground-and space-based dual-frequency GPS measurements to detect and monitor tsunami wave propagation from the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake and tsunami. Major wave trains with different propagation speeds and wavelengths were identified through analysis of the GPS remote sensing observations. Dominant physical characteristics of atmospheric wave-induced TIDs are found to be associated with specific tsunami propagations and oceanic Rayleigh waves. In this research, we focus on the analysis of tsunami-induced TIDs observed from the U.S. west coast. We compared GPS-based observations, corresponding model simulations and tsunami wave propagation. Results are shown to lead to a better understanding of the tsunami-induced ionosphere responses. Based on current distribution of Plate Boundary Observatory GPS stations, the results indicate that tsunami-induced TIDs may be detected about 60 minutes prior to tsunamis arriving at the U.S. west coast. It is expected that this GNSS-based technology will become an integral part of future early-warning systems.																	2331-5911	2331-5954					2015							3480	3484										WOS:000375211603054

In particular, the new high-resolution TerraSAR-X acquisition mode ('staring spotlight') allows for the detection of various kinds of residuals of historical landuse, some of which have been unknown so far.																	2153-6996		978-1-4799-7929-5				2015							1905	1908										WOS:000371696702003

The Secchi depth (Z(sd)) obtained for clear and turbid coastal waters in the region of Point Calimere (located at east coast of Southern India) is estimated through the semi-empirical approach which is based on the the remote sensing reflectance band ratio (R-rs(443/555). This study demonstrates a strong positive correlation between the band ratio R-rs(443/555) and the independent parameters of length attenuation coefficient (1/(c+K-d)), which positively governs the rate at which Coupling Coefficient (G) varies under a given illumination condition and hence, the Secchi transparency. The proper parameterization of beam attenuation coefficient c(m(-1)) and spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient K-d(m(-1)) is achieved at 531nm through the band ratio technique to capture the effect of the maximum light penetration. Moreover, the secondary parameter which governs the rate at which penetration of light occurs is modeled as the function of reflectance at 551nm (R(rs)551). The modeled Secchi Depth (Z(sd)) is found to be in good agreement with the measured values with significantly low errors and high slope and correlation coefficient.

The empirical XWAVE algorithm for estimation of significant wave height from X-band satellite data has been adopted for coastal application. All available TS-X images in the German Bight collocated with measurements of 6 buoys since 2013 were processed and analysed (53 passages with 196 StripMap images). One TS-X overflight covers strips with length of similar to 200km and width of 30km over the German Bight from EastFrisian Islands to the Danish coast with a sequence of 3-6 StripMap images. The comparisons with results of wave prediction model show a number of local variations due to variety in bathymetry and wind fronts. The developed Sea State Processor SSP includes XWAVE, pre-filtering of ships and other artefacts and checking results was implemented for NRT services. The comparison with insitu buoy measurements results in Scatter Index of 20% and RMSE of 0.25m.																	2153-6996		978-1-4799-7929-5				2015							2519	2522										WOS:000371696702155

From the methodological point of view, the horizontal wind speed (HWS) measured by both a reference lidar (i.e., "fixed") and a floating lidar (i.e., "moving") with and without a cardarnic frame is cross-examined by using standard statistical indicators and a compound pendulum model. Performance results are analysed both at laboratory level using a pitch/roll motion-simulation platform and at a sea-test measurement-campaign level some 250-m offshore Barcelona coast. Finally, simulations of the proposed pendulum-based model enables to tune-in and optimize cardanic-frame design parameters.

In this paper a closer look has been presented on the problem of interpreting information about the features and conditions of marine environment from images taken at the sea coast and shallow water. Using this method allows for example selection of the objects on the image according to the differences in shape. Processes occurring in the shallow water, especially in the vicinity of the coast, influences the entire environment thus they play very important role. For example sea surface currents depends on them. By means of the mentioned above method author s would like to investigate this phenomenon. The use of mathematical transformations in terms of grain size morphological parameters such as size distribution and density of grain size range of the particles in the medium can be calculated.

J	Ayanlade, A; Jegede, OO				Ayanlade, Ayansina; Jegede, O. O.			Evaluation of the intensity of the daytime surface urban heat island: how can remote sensing help?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND DATA FUSION												This study aimed at using remote sensing methodology to assess the daytime surface urban heat island (SUHI) in Lagos metropolis. Several studies have examined the SUHI, using point data from meteorological stations. However, it has been shown in the literature recently that it is practically impossible to accurately value the intensity of SUHI from ground meteorological measurement due to heterogeneity and complexity of surface temperature over land. Therefore a time series of Landsat data, from 1984 to 2012, were used in the present study to assess spatial and temporal variability in the contribution of source and sink landscape to daytime SUHI in Lagos. This study uses remote sensing methods because Lagos has a strong heterogeneity of land surface characteristics; with several drainage, vegetation, built-up and soil between the coast and mainland, thus the land surface temperature (LST) changes rapidly in space and time. The results from this study show differences in the contribution of source and sink landscape to SUHI. The main findings from the results show that source landscape contributes positively to the intensity of SUHI in Lagos metropolis. The results show a general increase in mean LST during the periods of study from 1984 to 2012. The north-west (NW) zone of Lagos has highest LST compared to other zones. In 1984, the mean LST of NW zone was 300.53 K, but increased to 301.85 K in 2000 and 302.85 K in 2012. Although contributions from the landscapes differ by zones and time, much more intensified LST was noted in the NW zone of the city. The study find out that change in landcover has been the most important driver of intensified SUHI in Lagos metropolis. NW zone recorded the highest increased in built-up area throughout the years: 320.32 km(2) in 1984, 535.28 km(2) in 2000 and 630.70 km(2) in 2012. This study demonstrates therefore that it is possible to assess spatial distribution and long-term temporal evolution of the LST in urban area, using remote sensing data. Also the results shows that remote sensing methods offer possibility for measuring LST over complete spatially averaged rather than point values. The results from this study further our understanding that not only the SUHI is frequent to cities in developed countries, but the effects are also obvious in several urban settlements in tropical countries.

The paper presents some results of a substantiation study on the hydro-geological and hydro-bio-geomorphic, river, delta, marine and coastal environment, as well as the ecosystem state assessment of this natural and built area from the Romanian Black Sea shore. The analysis/modeling actions and the simulation of the natural hydro-geomorphological processes, as well as the analysis processes modified / induced by the anthropogenic factor, including the probable impact/evolution assessment of the deltaic ecosystem / coastal affected ecosystem were developed, in order to highlight the viable solutions that enable an efficient and sustainable management and renaturation of the Romanian coastal vulnerable areas. The evolution of the marine agitation factors, which are of crucial importance in the deltas and lagoons formation, extending a multi-criteria complex analysis on the response processes of the coast to the action of the marine agitation factors with ecological impacts from interested area, is highlighted. Accordingly, the final results of the hydro-bio-geo-morphological processes study of the shallow area allow the intervention opinions and the efficient management of the biotic and abiotic resources from the coastal system, based on the changes knowledge at different scales of the climatic conditions determined by the environment and reflected in different coastal ecosystem status indicators.

Comparisons of coastline morphology from reliable ancient charts, modern bathymetric surveys and remote sensing data, show major changes (in some cases at kilometre-scale) related to the rapid erosion and formation of offshore sandy shoals, spits and beaches. These sediment bodies are linked to sediment supply from the Magdalena River. In 1935, after the emplacement of two jetties at the river mouth, sediment was channelled offshore and erosion ensued on the western part of the Magdalena delta. Spits and sandy shoals rapidly migrated down drift. As a result, a spit at Puerto Colombia - present on the 1935 and 1947 aerial photograms - progressively diminished and merged with the coastline between 1953 and 1959. South of this location, a new spit formed before 2000 and it presently shelters a marina at Puerto Velero. At Galerazamba, a 5 km-long spit at a high angle to the coastline, was present until 1864. It was replaced by a new spit, broadly parallel to shoreline, at some point before 1947. This feature was much smaller than the one previously observed and it has migrated down drift until the present. High rates of accretion were also observed around Isla Cascajo, a rocky island that caused the development of a rapidly growing tombolo. At Punta Canoas, a spit formed between 1947 and 1961 and, then migrated southwards.																	2211-0577		978-3-319-13716-2; 978-3-319-13715-5				2015	12						1	19		10.1007/978-3-319-13716-2_1	10.1007/978-3-319-13716-2							WOS:000367908700002

Ultrafine particles over Eastern Australia: an airborne survey	TELLUS SERIES B-CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL METEOROLOGY												Ultrafine particles (UFP) in the atmosphere may have significant impacts on the regional water and radiation budgets through secondary effects on cloud microphysics. Yet, as these particles are invisible for current remote sensing techniques, knowledge about their three-dimensional distribution, source strengths and budgets is limited. Building on a 40-yr-old Australia-wide airborne survey which provides a reference case study of aerosol sources and budgets, this study presents results from a new airborne survey over Eastern Australia, northern New South Wales and Queensland. Observations identified apparent changes in the number and distribution of major anthropogenic aerosol sources since the early 1970s, which might relate to the simultaneously observed changes in rainfall patterns over eastern Queensland. Coal-fired power stations in the inland areas between Brisbane and Rockhampton were clearly identified as the major sources for ultrafine particulate matter. Sugar mills, smelters and shipping along the coast close to the Ports of Townsville and Rockhampton were comparable minor sources. Airborne Lagrangian plume studies were applied to investigate source strength and ageing properties within power station plumes. Significant changes observed, compared to the measurements in the 1970s, included a significant increase in the number concentration of UFP related to coal-fired power station emissions in the sparsely populated Queensland hinterland coincident with the area with the most pronounced reduction in rainfall.

J	Sesli, FA; Caniberk, M				Sesli, Faik Ahmet; Caniberk, Mustafa			Estimation of the Coastline Changes Using LIDAR	ACTA MONTANISTICA SLOVACA												In recent years, sustainable development has been a very popular subject. Sustainable development allows economic growth, social welfare and environmental protection to enhance each other. The management of environmental resources in accordance with the principles of sustainable development has become crucial in many areas including coastal resources. Integrated Coastal Zone Management is one of the tools to achieve this goal. Coastal zones involve many different elements of development and interaction and these elements change due to natural or human factors. Temporal change in coastal zones is reflected on the coast line. Coast line advance and retreat cause major changes on coastal zones. One of the most basic elements of Integrated Coastal Zone Management is the accurate determination of coastal line. For this purpose, tools such as remote sensing, photogrammetry, terrestrial measurements, GPS technology and LIDAR systems, which have been actively used in recent years, are used. In this study, the use of LIDAR technology in order to examine coastline changes was investigated. The coast line was automatically determined using LIDAR measurements of the same area from 2007, 2008 and 2009, and change analysis was made.																	1335-1788						2015	20	3					225	233										WOS:000368369700008

A DISPARITY BETWEEN EROSIONAL HAZARD AND ACCRETION OF THE SUNDARBANS WITH ITS ADJACENT EAST COAST, BANGLADESH: A REMOTE SENSING AND GIS APPROACH	EARTH RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMOTE SENSING/GIS APPLICATIONS VI	Proceedings of SPIE				15th SPIE Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications VI	SEP 22-24, 2015	Toulouse, FRANCE	SPIE				The Sundarbans, UNESCO affiliated world heritage site and world largest mangrove forest covering with (similar to 10000) km(2) along the coastal areas of Bangladesh and India. Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries due to sea level rise caused by global warming. In the present situation world mangrove forest are declining at alarming rate. The extensions of this mangrove forest continuously changing with the nature of Bay of Bengal coast. This paper presents the contrast result of erosional hazard and accretion of Sundarbans with its adjacent east coast of Bangladesh. This study based on images of Landsat MSS, Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) from Landsat 8. Landsat images from 1980 to 2014 were analyzed. The result shows the net erosion rate of Sundarbans is higher than its adjacent east coast. The study area has been divided into two phases - Phase I and Phase II. Phase I represents only Sundarbans and Phase II represents adjacent east coast. These two phases has equal longitudinal distance. Many small channels and river supply water and sediment into the Sundarbans. The adjacent east coast of Sundarbans lies on the Meghana estuary that experienced with huge amount of sediment flow. The Sundarbans has been facing erosional stage with a rate of net erosion about 3 km(2)y(-1) whereas the adjacent east coast facing an accretional stage with rate of accretion about 1 km(2)y(-1). The highest erosion rate of Phase I (Sundarbans) was 10.61 km(2)y(-1) and highest erosion of Phase II adjacent east coast was 18-km(2)y(-1) in the period of 1989-1999. The highest accretion rate in the Sundarbans was 6.48 km(2)y(-1) in the period of 1999-2006 and in the Phase II, accretion rate was 16.43 km(2)y(-1) in the period of 1980-1989. The lowest erosion rate was 3 km(2)y(-1) in Phase I and 2.11 km(2)y(-1) in Phase II in the period of 1999-2006. The reworking area in phase I is about 37 km(2) and phase II is about 51 Km(2). So, water is highly active in adjacent east coast than Sundarbans. Though the mean sea level is increasing at a same rate in two different phases but the accretion and erosion rates are not same. From this study, it is established that Sundarbans has lost 113.31 km(2) of its land in the 34 years of study period whereas; adjacent east coast has gain about 35 km(2) lands. The rate of water discharges and sediment supply are not same in two different phases. It plays a vital role in erosion and accretion process. Therefore, Sundarbans are declining at frightening rate than its adjacent east coast.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-854-5				2015	9644								96441G	10.1117/12.2196386								WOS:000367470500029

As the closest island to connecting the continental shore of Zhejiang and the eastern Zhoushan Island after the project of Zhoushan Tran-Oceanic Bridges, it has experienced great changes during the past 40 years, and however little attention was paid to evaluate the coastline exploitation of Jintang Island. In this paper coastline positions were firstly extracted by combining histogram thresholding and band ratio techniques with visual interpretation supplemented, based on multitemporal medium-high resolution imagery from 1970 to 2011. And then the coastline exploitation degree for different periods was quantified from three index, coastline complexity, coastline artificial intensity and coastal use. The uncertainty for coastline extraction was controlled in one-pixel for each image. The results show that the position of coastline accreted seaward since 1970. As the natural coastline was straightened, the proportion of artificial coastline has surpassed the natural coastline after 1992. Until 2011, the dominant coastline type has been changed as artificial coastline, mainly covering urban/ industrial and port coast. The calculated coastline exploitation degree of Jintang Island in 1970, 1992, 2003 and 2011 is 0.637, 0.719, 0.734 and 0.929 respectively, showing an uptrend. Part 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 of the total coastline are relatively higher than other parts, and this generally coincides with the distribution of deep ports. It indicates that natural conditions and human policies may contribute to increasing coastline exploitation from 1970 to 2011. And Jintang Island is facing great human intervention for reclaiming more coastal land to develop the marine economy.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-854-5				2015	9644								96441O	10.1117/12.2193856								WOS:000367470500034

Neural Network Algorithms for Retrieval of Harmful Algal Blooms in the West Florida Shelf from VIIRS Satellite Observations and comparisons with other techniques, without the need for a fluorescence channel	REMOTE SENSING OF THE OCEAN, SEA ICE, COASTAL WATERS, AND LARGE WATER REGIONS 2015	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Remote Sensing of the Ocean, Sea Ice, Coastal Waters, and Large Water Regions	SEP 23, 2015	Toulouse, FRANCE	SPIE				New approaches are described that use of the Ocean Color Remote Sensing Reflectance readings (OC Rrs) available from the existing Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) bands to detect and retrieve Karenia brevis (KB) Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) that frequently plague the coasts of the West Florida Shelf (WFS). Unfortunately, VIIRS, unlike MODIS, does not have a 678 nm channel to detect Chlorophyll fluorescence, which is used in the normalized fluorescence height (nFLH) algorithm which has been shown to help in effectively detecting and tracking KB HABs. We report on using neural network (NN) algorithms, reported by us, and trained, using a wide range of suitably parametrized synthetic data typical of coastal waters, to form a multiband inversion algorithm which models the relationship between Rrs values at the 486, 551 and 671nm VIIRS bands against the values of phytoplankton absorption (a(ph)), CDOM absorption, non-algal particles (NAP) absorption and the particulate backscattering bb(p) coefficients, all at 443nm and permitting retrievals of these parameters. The NN retrieved a(ph443) in the WFS is in turn filtered by known limiting conditions on Chlorophyll concentration [Chla] and low backscatter properties associated with KB HABS in the WFS and used to identify, delineate and quantify them. Comparisons with in-situ measurements and other techniques including nFLH confirm the viability of both the NN retrievals and the filtering approaches devised.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-848-4				2015	9638								96380B	10.1117/12.2195339								WOS:000367320800009

Estimation of river discharge based on remote sensing of a river plume	REMOTE SENSING OF THE OCEAN, SEA ICE, COASTAL WATERS, AND LARGE WATER REGIONS 2015	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Remote Sensing of the Ocean, Sea Ice, Coastal Waters, and Large Water Regions	SEP 23, 2015	Toulouse, FRANCE	SPIE				Satellite remote sensing is an efficient tool to identify buoyant river plumes in the coastal ocean, formed by interaction between the river and the ambient sea waters. The observed spatial extent, shape and orientation of the plume are indicative of the respective river discharge. A new method of reconstructing the volume of river discharge using satellite imagery and numerical modelling is presented in this article. At the first step of the procedure, we use a high resolution satellite image of the coastal area adjacent to the examined river estuary to identify the buoyant plume. Then a number of required river, atmospheric and sea parameters (including river discharge) are prescribed for the hydrological model to simulate the spread of river discharge under this configuration. The characteristics of the simulated river plume are compared with the corresponding characteristics of the plume identified at the satellite image. Varying model forcing conditions and iteratively improving the accordance between these plumes we consequently specify the value of river discharge. The developed method was applied for the eastern coast of the Black Sea to evaluate the influence of the short-term and annual precipitation conditions on the variability of river discharge inflowing from the Russian coast to the Black Sea.

In the military field, the automatic detection of ships can be used to monitor ship dynamic in the harbor and maritime of enemy, and then analyze the enemy naval power. In civilian field, the automatic detection of ships can be used in monitoring transportation of harbor and illegal behaviors such as illegal fishing, smuggling and pirates, etc. In recent years, research of ship detection is mainly concentrated in three categories: forward-looking infrared images, downward-looking SAR image, and optical remote sensing images with sea background. Little research has been done into ship detection of optical remote sensing images with harbor background, as the gray-scale and texture features of ships are similar to the coast in high-resolution optical remote sensing images. In this paper, we put forward an effective harbor ship target detection method. First of all, in order to overcome the shortage of the traditional difference method in obtaining histogram valley as the segmentation threshold, we propose an iterative histogram valley segmentation method which separates the harbor and ships from the water quite well. Secondly, as landing ships in optical remote sensing images usually lead to discontinuous harbor edges, we use Hough Transform method to extract harbor edges. First, lines are detected by Hough Transform. Then, lines that have similar slope are connected into a new line, thus we access continuous harbor edges. Secondary segmentation on the result of the land-and-sea separation, we eventually get the ships. At last, we calculate the aspect ratio of the ROIs, thereby remove those targets which are not ship. The experiment results show that our method has good robustness and can tolerate a certain degree of noise and occlusion.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-900-9				2015	9675								967523	10.1117/12.2199814								WOS:000363280200075						
J	Donmez, C; Berberoglu, S; Cilek, A				Donmez, Cenk; Berberoglu, Suha; Cilek, Ahmet			SPATIAL VARIATIONS OF NPP IN DIFFERENT ALTITUDES AT A MEDITERRANEAN WATERSHED	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												The aim of study was to estimate the current net primary productivity (NPP) of Goksu River Basin (forest, grasslands, bare soil, agriculture) located at the Eastern Mediterranean coast of Turkey using remote sensing and a biogeochemical model. Four elevation zones between 0 to 2500 m were defined and spatial patterns of NPP in those elevation zones were assessed to understand the impacts of topographyon local spatial patterns of productivity. The model results are incoorporated with available topographic information in watershed level. The Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) model approach was used to estimate annual and monthly NPP. This model uses a light-use efficiency (LUE) factor, which is the efficiency of conversion of light energy into dry materials by plant, together with remotely sensed, climate (to express the effects of air temperature and water stress), soil and biotic data and ground measurements. Thus, a comprehensive spatial and temporal data set including temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, soil texture, percent tree cover, land cover type, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were used in modelling process. Percent tree cover was predicted using multi-temporal LANDSAT images by aggregating tree cover estimates made from high resolution Geo-EYE imagery in a regression tree algorithm. The results indicated several interesting trends between NPP and regional climate gradients. NPP was correlated strongly with solar radiation and precipitation during the growing season suggesting that water limitation as important variable controlling regional patterns of productivity.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2015	24	7					2264	2274										WOS:000363071700001

We compare the scanner to the altimeter and compare the differences between the two survey regions. We estimate and correct sensor roll from the scanner data using the hyperbolic response of the scanner over a flat surface. Measurement surveys had to be longer than 5 km north of Svalbard and longer than 15 km in Fram Strait before the statistical distribution in surface roughness from the scanner and altimeter became similar. The shape of the surface roughness probability distributions agrees with those of airborne electromagnetic induction measurements of ice thickness. The ice in Fram Strait had a greater mean surface roughness, 0.16 m vs 0.09 m, and a wider distribution in roughness values than the ice in the Nansen Basin. An increase in surface roughness with increasing ice thickness was observed over fast ice found in Fram Strait near the coast of Greenland but not for the drift ice.

Here we present results from helicopter-borne brightness temperature (TB) measurements in the Southern Ocean in October 2012 and in the Sea of Okhotsk in February 2009 carried out with a portable passive microwave (PMW) radiometer operating at a frequency of 36 GHz. The goal of these measurements is to aid evaluation of a satellite thin-ice thickness algorithm which uses data from the spaceborne Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer Earth Observing System AMSR-E) or the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-II (AMSR-II). AMSR-E and AMSR-II TB agree with the spatially collocated mean TB from the helicopter-borne measurements within the radiometers' precision. In the Sea of Okhotsk in February 2009, the AMSR-E 36 GHz TB values are closer to the mean than the modal TB values measured by the helicopter-borne radiometer. In an Antarctic coastal polynya in October 2012, the polarization ratio of 36 GHz vertical and horizontal TB is estimated to be 0.137 on average. Our measurements of the TB at 36 GHz over an iceberg tongue suggest a way to discriminate it from sea ice by its unique PMW signature.

In this study, we show the evolution of the planetary boundary layer based on in situ airborne measurements and ground-based remote sensing observations carried out during the MORE ( Marine Ozone and Radiation Experiment) campaign in June 2010. The campaign was held in a rural coastal Mediterranean region in Southern Italy. The study focuses on the observations made on 17 June. Vertical profiles of meteorological parameters and aerosol size distribution were measured during two flights: in the morning and in the afternoon. Airborne observations were combined with ground-based LIDAR, SODAR, microwave and visible radiometer measurements, allowing a detailed description of the atmospheric vertical structure. The analysis was complemented with data from a regional atmospheric model run with horizontal resolutions of 12, 4 and 1 km, respectively; back-trajectories were calculated at these spatial resolutions. The observations show the simultaneous occurrence of dust transport, descent of mid-tropospheric air and sea breeze circulation on 17 June. Local pollution effects on the aerosol distribution, and a possible event of new particles formation were also observed. A large variability in the thermodynamical structure and aerosol distribution in the flight region, extending by approximately 30 km along the coast, was found. Within this complex, environment-relevant differences in the back-trajectories calculated at different spatial resolutions are found, suggesting that the description of several dynamical processes, and in particular the sea breeze circulation, requires high-resolution meteorological analyses. The study also shows that the integration of different observational techniques is needed to describe these complex conditions; in particular, the availability of flights and their timing with respect to the occurring phenomena are crucial.				di Sarra, Alcide/J-1491-2016	di Sarra, Alcide/0000-0002-2405-2898; Junkermann, Wolfgang/0000-0002-7461-3024												0280-6509	1600-0889					2015	67								27721	10.3402/tellusb.v67.27721								WOS:000362822000001

The study area is characterized by the presence of limestones overlapping clayey terrains, thus favoring the presence of large rock spreading phenomena, which often evolve into block slides. Field surveys resulted in approximately 86 landslides, distributed between the coastline and structural cliffs which flank limestone plateaus. In order to support geomorphological investigations, a GPS (Global Position System) monitoring network was deployed over two coastal sites. Slow rates of surface deformations varying from few millimeters per year to some centimeters per year were recorded. Since the extension of the GPS network over the entire north-western coast and for such a high number of landslides is not feasible in terms of cost-benefit relations, we applied PSI (Persistent Scatterers Interferometry) to validate the geomorphological map. DinSAR data analysis confirmed the displacement rates measured by the GPS monitoring network and provided useful information about the style of activity of a large number of landslides affecting the north-western coastline of Malta. The outcomes supported the satisfactory capabilities of an integrated approach, which coupled conventional geomorphological procedures with monitoring techniques to bring out an exhaustive landslide inventory, even for slow or very slow mass movements, essential for related hazard assessment.

The expected sea water rise, due to ice melting of Polar Regions, is bound to affect the long coastal corridors flanking the eastern and western parts of India. Unfortunately, in spite of many warnings by the Nature in the form of unprecedented spells of cloud bursts during non monsoon seasons of 2012 and 2013 no steps have been initiated to safe guard erosion of our coasts that are inhabited by millions of people. Since both the administrative channels and the political mind set are not tuned to take preventive measures it is essential for the earth system scientists to prepare land erosion, land subsidence, saline water ingression details in space and time using remote sensing and GIS techniques. In this exercise the earth scientists and space scientists should evolve strategies that can convincingly produce models showing how the coastal corridor can be affected with varied intensity and magnitude of sea water rise, in time and space. Specific details of the expected ill effects on the coastal segments of Andhra Pradesh and parts of Tamilnadu will be discussed along with proposed remedial measures to strengthen the wind and tide barriers in these areas.																			978-3-319-09300-0; 978-3-319-09299-7				2015							521	525		10.1007/978-3-319-09300-0_98								WOS:000358989700098

The signals, recorded in April-December 2012, came from sources near the edge of the ice shelves, at distances of 230-500 km from TROLL. The sources, which moved westward with time, could be associated with four large, tabular icebergs, drifting between 15 degrees E and 8 degrees W. Combining the seismological data with information from satellite remote sensing, we find that one-third of the signals can be attributed to individual icebergs. The trajectories of three of the associated icebergs are known through iceberg-tracking databases, whereas the fourth, a fragment of one of the other three, is untracked, and only scarce information is available from satellite imagery. The observed seismic signals exhibit a wide variety of frequency characteristics, from unstructured episodes to occurrences of iceberg harmonic tremor. Although we are not able to determine the exact cause of the signals, we classify them into five classes on a phenomenological basis. This study demonstrates the potential of regional seismic networks for iceberg monitoring as supplementary resources to information obtained with remote-sensing technologies.

CLIMATE CHANGE AND EFFECTIVE FACTORS AND EVALUATION OF EDREMIT COASTAL AREAS	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												As is known, global warming is mentioned by many scientific institutions of UN. Since 1985, it is known that the temperature of the Planet increased of 1.5 degrees. So, UN takes attention to global climate change. This situation is also evaluated in climate conferences which performed 18 times and focused on precautions, because of the increase of temperature in the last 30 years. In this context, countries are cautioned about releasing CO,. This subject is socialised in different days and years. When coastal areas evaluated within the framework of the above considerations, they are important places where land and water integrated. Transporting pollution from soil to water and also from water to soil is important issue for coastal areas. In terms of particularly tourism activities and many other vital activities, coastal areas appear as a place which is the most widely used throughout the history of mankind and is being used. In this respect, Turkey always has been a potential place with a length of 8333 km coastline. Also, from past to present, our coasts continue to be used with maritime transport, fishing, and water-related industrial sector (such as thermal power plants), the second housing and tourism and likewise, activities. So, with this study, while considering status of coastal areas, we tried to make some determinations of the coast of Edremit Kucukkuyu and it identified regarding the measures and suggestions. In this study, the Gulf of Edremit 1985-2012 satellite images were evaluated by the method of remote sensing and environmental and sociocultural factors influencing coastal change have been presented. Thus, while putting forward the current state of the field, considered the development over the years. Based on global environmental problems, the situation was assessed for planning and also tried to develop recommendations for future planning decisions. In this research, as considering climate values within a certain period of time, developments are evaluated.																	1311-5065						2015	16	2					764	770										WOS:000357902500044

It is a major recreational resource and a host to unique ecosystems of beaches and partially vegetated sand dunes. Due to large recreational pressure, it is important to identify features of the bay bar that have to be preserved in order to keep this resource sustainable. We have conducted landscape and morphological mapping with WorldView-2 images. Methods included field research, analysis of multitemporal stereopairs and automated image interpretation to create maps of key areas of the Anapa Bay Bar. In our paper we showcase the map for a section of the Anapa Bay Bar created through visual image interpretation. It presents all morphological elements such as beaches, sand dunes, sand ridges and lowlands adjoining lagoons. Each element has its specific vegetation and sustainability against recreational pressure. We also present results of automated image analysis of seasonal dynamics of the beach and dunes on the basis of multitemporal imagery.				; Tutubalina, Olga/G-2008-2011	Krylenko, Marina/0000-0003-4407-0548; Tutubalina, Olga/0000-0001-8049-1724												0277-786X		978-1-62841-700-5				2015	9535								95351X	10.1117/12.2193682								WOS:000357980300068

Fisheries geographical information system for Greater Mumbai region in Maharashtra, India	INDIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES												Geographical information system (GIS) is an invaluable decision support tool, designed to address spatially related problems for management of natural resources. The power of GIS lies in its ability to visualise and relate various types of geo-referenced spatial and non-spatial data allowing users to analyse them. In India, use of GIS in fisheries management is yet to find its rightful place. An effort has been made in the present study to design and organise a fisheries spatial information system for Greater Mumbai region in Maharashtra to serve as a macro-level database for the planners and administrators, which can be used for querying, analysing and displaying datasets in the form of graphs and summarised tabular data for all the fisheries infrastructural facilities. This GIS will be of immense help to planners, managers and administrators in quick storing, retrieving and updating the required information for management of fisheries in Greater Mumbai region.																	0970-6011						2015	62	2					81	86										WOS:000357340700014

A number of beaches are subjected to erosion and lots of coastal properties are destroyed specially during SW monsoon season along the Mangalore coast in recent years. In order to protect the beaches and the properties, a number of seawalls - each ranging in length between 100 m and 2500 m - are built since 1980s. A very few of them built scientifically, but most of them are just dumping of granite blocks directly on the shoreline. In the present study, an attempt is made to understand long-term (1967-2013) shoreline changes as well as erosion / deposition patterns due to natural (including sea-level rise) and anthropogenic activities along this coast. The study area extends from Yermal in the north to Talpady in the south covering a total length of 45.63 km. Topomap of 1967 and multi-temporal satellite images have been analyzed using Remote Sensing and GIS techniques to demarcate shoreline positions and to assess the impact of anthropogenic and hydrological factors on coastal morphology of this region. An integrative approach of Remote Sensing and GIS techniques as well as seasonal field studies clearly illustrates the reasons for shoreline and beach morphological changes. Construction of seawalls has resulted in shifting of erosion sites from one place to another adjacent place, whereas, breakwaters have been acting as barriers for littoral drift. Overall, areas subjected to erosion are higher compared to those subjected to accretion in the study area. Applications of Remote Sensing and GIS have led to understanding shoreline and beach morphological changes. These have also provided data analysis tools and methods to evaluate the geospatial patterns in short-term and long-term changes. The results of this study will be useful for shoreline, coastal zone management and implementation of CRZ act. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The current study area falling in the coastal zone of central Tamil Nadu from Cuddalore in the north and Pichavaram in the south along the southeast coast of India. The study aims in assessing the coastal vulnerability for the Cuddalore-Pichavaram coastal tract since the area is affected more due to 2004 Tsunami, 2008 Nisha and 2011 Thane cyclones using Remote Sensing and GIS tools. Six various terrain and physical parameters such as Geomorphology, Land use/Land cover, coastal slope, Offshore bathymetry, shoreline change (1970-2013), mean Tidal height has been considered to calculate the Coastal Vulnerability Index(CVI) based on USGS classification and they show significant variations all along the coastal tract. Based on the CVI values calculated for the study area the coast is classified as five classes of vulnerability viz., very low, low, moderate, high, very high. The present study can be used as tool for coastal disaster management for future development. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Strom Surge Vulnerability And LU/LC Change Detection Analysis-In The Northern Parts Of Coramandal Coast, Tamilnadu	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WATER RESOURCES, COASTAL AND OCEAN ENGINEERING (ICWRCOE'15)	Aquatic Procedia				International Conference on Water Resources, Coastal and Ocean Engineering (ICWRCOE)	MAR 11-14, 2015	Natl Inst Technol Karnataka, Mangaluru, INDIA		Natl Inst Technol Karnataka			The Storm surge is one of the major calamities for the coastal regions all over the world. The effect of a storm surge is more intensified by the ignorance of the local people in the region due to their improper land use pattern followed by them. This is because of not knowing clearly about the coming storm, its intensity, or at least the zones that would be affected during a storm. The aim of the project is to delineate the zones for various surge levels and deriving the Qualitative risk map from land use map. During storm precipitation is also another major problem for not only in the path of the storm but also to the surrounding area. So by making an overlay analysis of the precipitation and the already derived risk map. To study the above problems, Remote Sensing and GIS is used to effectively to analyse the problems. The study area is the coastal region of Cuddalore and Puducherry, which is present in the northern part of the Coramandal Coast. Analysing the land use change from 1980 to 2009 has enabled us to watch the changes those are more risky during a surge and such changes are identified and delineated. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The spatial attribute of oceanographic data makes them highly suitable for GIS analysis as GIS provides a natural framework for the acquisition, storage, and analysis of georeferenced data. In the present study we estimate the recent SST trends using a satellite-based climatology to characterize changes in sea surface temperature along Kerala coast since 1985. These SST variations are mapped using thermal infrared remote sensing and microwave remote sensing satellites through day and night. SST measurements derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for 26 years (1985 to 2010) period were examined. The trend analysis of annual mean SST shows that inter-annual mode of SST variations dominates. An increasing trend of SST is observed in the off shore area of Kerala coast. The increasing trend about 0.2 degrees C per decade is observed in the study area. The higher rate of increment of SST in Kerala coast may be attributed to rapid industrialization, increase in air temperature. The SST analysis for Lakshadweep islands is also done and the results are compared with that of Kerala coast. It is found that the SST of Kerala coast is higher during day time and lower during night time which may be influenced by the presence of landmass nearby. While the SST variations of Lakshadweep area are part of the regional scale factors. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Shoreline delineation is difficult, time consuming, and sometimes impossible for entire coastal system when using traditional ground survey techniques. Recent advances in remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) techniques are overcoming the difficulties in extraction of shoreline position and detection of shoreline changes. In the present paper, an automatic shoreline detection method using histogram equalization and adaptive thresholding techniques is developed. The shoreline of Netravati-Gurpur rivermouth area along Mangalore coast, West Coast of India have been extracted from Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS P6) LISS-III (2005, 2007 and 2010) and IRS R2 LISS-III (2013) satellite images using developed automatic shoreline detection method. The delineated shorelines have been analyzed using Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), a GIS Software tool for estimation of shoreline change rates through two statistical techniques such as, End Point Rate (EPR) and Linear Regression Rate (LRR). The Bengre spit, Northern sector of Netravati-Gurpur river mouth is under accretion an average of 2.95 m/yr (EPR) and 3.07 m/yr (LRR) and maximum accretion obtained is 8.51 m/yr (EPR) and 8.69 m/yr (LRR). Southern sector, the Ullal spit is under erosion an average of -0.56 m/yr (EPR) and -0.59 m/yr (LRR). (C) 2015 The Authors.

The region is characterized by regular oscillations, but episodic El Nino-events introduce strong disturbances. Conceptual models based on observations, remote sensing data, and output of regional climate models are compared with data from a new station network. The results show regular oscillations of all climate variables on the annual and daily time scale. The daily cycle is probably associated with thermotidal forcings, causing gravity waves to emanate from the Andes Cordillera. Main factors are the interaction of large scale pressure systems like the Southeast Pacific High and the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). Also, there are regional factors: an extended sea-breeze system, the barrier-effect of the Andes, additional energy input by elevated radiation absorption at the mountain slopes, local wind systems, and the variations of the sea surface temperature. At the coast, a low-level jet works as a thermodynamic energy sink, suppressing deep convection and supporting the aridity. Those patterns are found in most of the station data and the processes of this climate can generally be confirmed. The overturning of this stable system with the onset of El Nino-conditions is possibly caused by disruptions of the regional circulation.																	1687-9309	1687-9317					2015									750181	10.1155/2015/750181								WOS:000353477800001

Indicators of vegetation productivity under a changing climate in British Columbia, Canada	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Understanding the relationship between vegetation and climate is essential for predicting the impact of climate change on broad-scale landscape processes. Utilizing vegetation indicators derived from remotely sensed imagery, we present an approach to forecast shifts in the future distribution of vegetation. Remotely sensed metrics representing cumulative greenness, seasonality, and minimum cover have successfully been linked to species distributions over broad spatial scales. In this paper we developed models between a historical time series of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite imagery from 1987 to 2007 at 1 km spatial resolution with corresponding climate data using regression tree modeling approaches. We then applied these models to three climate change scenarios produced by the Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis (CCCma) to predict and map productivity indices in 2065. Our results indicated that warming may lead to increased cumulative greenness in northern British Columbia and seasonality in vegetation is expected to decrease for higher elevations, while levels of minimum cover increase. The Coast Mountains of the Pacific Maritime region and high elevation edge habitats across British Columbia were forecasted to experience the greatest amount of change. Our approach provides resource managers with information to mitigate and adapt to future habitat dynamics. Forecasting vegetation productivity levels presents a novel approach for understanding the future implications of climate change on broad scale spatial patterns of vegetation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Gupta, M				Gupta, Mukesh			Contribution of Raman Scattering in Remote Sensing Retrieval of Suspended Sediment Concentration by Empirical Modeling	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												In this paper, the author investigates the effect of Raman scattering on remotely sensed suspended sediment concentration (SSC) through the analysis of various SSC retrieval models in the coastal waters (Case 2) of the Bay of Bengal. A higher Raman contribution is observed in waters containing less SSC and chlorophyll-a concentration. Tassan's model, which used three wavelengths, i.e., 490, 555, and 670 nm, is able to account for Raman contribution at three emission wavelengths. The analysis showed the highest similar to 14% fraction in the computed SSC and 8.4% fraction in the reflectance (at 555 nm) due to Raman scattering. A fraction of similar to 14% in the SSC due to Raman scattering is significant and should be addressed in SSC retrieval models. More channels (wavelengths) are required to adequately account for the Raman contribution for estimating SSC from the remote sensing reflectance. The inclusion of blue and infrared wavelengths in the empirical models of SSC retrieval is suggested as a topic of future research, because the excitation and emission do occur at these respective wavelengths.

Ecological recovery in an Arctic delta following widespread saline incursion	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Arctic ecosystems are vulnerable to the combined effects of climate change and a range of other anthropogenic perturbations. Predicting the cumulative impact of these stressors requires an improved understanding of the factors affecting ecological resilience. In September of 1999, a severe storm surge in the Mackenzie Delta flooded alluvial surfaces up to 30 km inland from the coast with saline waters, driving environmental impacts unprecedented in the last millennium. In this study we combined field monitoring of permanent sampling plots with an analysis of the Landsat archive (1986-2011) to explore the factors affecting the recovery of ecosystems to this disturbance. Soil salinization following the 1999 storm caused the abrupt dieback of more than 30 000 ha of tundra vegetation. Vegetation cover and soil chemistry show that recovery is occurring, but the rate and spatial extent are strongly dependent on vegetation type, with graminoid- and upright shrub-dominated areas showing recovery after a decade, but dwarf shrub tundra exhibiting little to no recovery over this period. Our analyses suggest that recovery from salinization has been strongly influenced by vegetation type and the frequency of freshwater flooding following the storm. With increased ocean storm activity, rising sea levels, and reduced sea ice cover, Arctic coastal ecosystems will be more likely to experience similar disturbances in the future, highlighting the importance of combining field sampling with regional-scale remote sensing in efforts to detect, understand, and anticipate environmental change.																	1051-0761	1939-5582				JAN	2015	25	1					172	185		10.1890/14-0239.1								WOS:000348667900015	26255366

Using field spectral and TSS data (5.8-577.2 mg/l) collected from estuary and coast of China, we calibrated (N = 40) and validated (N = 20) the 6 TSS retrieval models in forms of single band (B1 or B2), difference of the two bands, sediment index, band ratio and log-ratio by the least-squares technique. Results showed that the quadratic model of log-ratio is of the best accuracy (Calibration: R-2 = 0.752, N = 40. Validation: TSS > 31 mg/l, RMSE = 37.9 mg/l, N = 12; TSS <= 31 mg/l, RMSE = 3.25 mg/l, N = 8). We also found that the spectral log-ratio values increased with the increasing of TSS when TSS < 31 mg/l, but decreased with increasing TSS when TSS > 31 mg/l. The findings of quadratic curve vertex (log-ratio: similar to 1.58) in the proposed TSS model indicated that the spectral log-ratio may be sensitive to TSS of both low and high concentrations. We further applied the preferred model to retrieve TSS concentration from the MODIS 250-m images in turbid estuarial and clear coastal waters, and obtained a good mapping accuracy from the result (TSS > 31 mg/l: RMSE = 38.6 mg/l, MRE = 24.7%, N = 17; TSS <= 31 mg/l: RMSE = 2.1 mg/l, MRE = 19.5%, N = 11). The vertex-based methodology of TSS model developed in the study is applicable in mapping TSS concentrations that are of a wide range variation in estuarine and coastal water bodies based on MODIS 250-m image, and as well to maximize its application potential due to high imaging frequency (two times during daytime) and appropriate space resolution of MODIS images. Therefore, the method can be used to detect the high temporal variability of TSS during tidal cycle. As such, the application of MODIS-water quality detection technology can be extended to coastal sediment movement. (C) 2014 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).

Evaluation of coastal erosion and accretion processes along the southwest coast of Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu using geospatial techniques	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The impact of coastal erosion has adversely affected the socioeconomic conditions of the coastal community worldwide. The coastal environment is experiencing a wide range of natural and anthropogenic pressure in India. This study was carried out along the southwest coast of Kanyakumari, South India using multitemporal Landsat satellite images from 1999 to 2011. The long-term coastal erosion and accretion rates have been calculated for the periods between 1999 and 2011, and the subsequent short-term changes were performed during 1999-2000, 2005-2006, and 2010-2011. Thus, the long-term coastal changes indicate that the net erosion rate is higher on the coasts of Kanyakumari, Kovalam, Manavalakurichi, Mandaikadu, and Thengapattinam; the values are 0.118, 0.105, 0.127, 0.133, and 0.017 m(2), respectively. Meanwhile, the annual erosion rate of these areas is 10,000, 9,000, 11,000, and 1000 m(2)/year. The coastal zones Ganapathipuram and Enayamputhandurai have experienced accretion; the net accretion rate is 0.271 and 0.081 m(2), respectively. Coastal beaches, beach ridges, and marine terraces are predominantly disturbed by the hydrodynamic processes including wave action, littoral current, and intervention of littoral drift by the artificial coastal structures like groins, revetments, and seawalls. Moreover, the study area has been demarcated with site-specific erosion and accretion zones based on the frequent seaward or landward coastline fluctuation through geospatial technique.

Airborne acquisition of digital bathymetric data provides a wealth of information that can be interpreted in different ways. This paper considers the pros and cons of computerized autoclassifications versus cognitive interpretations of seafloor features. The continental shelf off the southeast Florida coast contains LADS (laser airborne depth sounding) surveys that are here used to compare and contrast automated classifications of bathymetry with cognitive differentiation of marine geomorphological features. There are advantages and disadvantages associated with each approach, and the choice of methods depends on the purpose or goals of the project. Once seafloor features have been cognitively discerned from enhanced, color ramped, and vertically exaggerated bathymetry, machine classifications can be compared with known units. Using ArcGIs (R) ArcMap software, five- and seven-class unsupervised isocluster autoclassifications were found to moderately represent known bottom topography, whereas the interactive supervised autoclassification closely approximated cognitively discerned bathymetric patterns. Hand-drawn or digitized cognitively derived maps were more generalized than supervised computerized classifications based on training fields. Overall, both methods were found to be beneficial approaches, as they complement each other.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JAN	2015	31	1					1	16		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-14A-00006.1								WOS:000347868900001

Using the unique spectral signature of guano to identify unknown seabird colonies	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Despite the threats faced by seabirds in both terrestrial and marine habitats, even basic knowledge of the locations of colonies, population sizes and trends is lacking for many remote areas of the world. Recent studies have shown that the guano of Adelie penguins can be identified from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) imagery and used to map colonies on coasts around continental Antarctica. Our study highlights a new technique based on the unique spectral signature of guano that can be used to discriminate seabird colonies from background geology and vegetation in a wider range of natural environments, including the vegetated and zoologically-diverse region of the Antarctic Peninsula; moreover, the method was effective for all densely colonial, surface-nesting seabirds. Using Landsat ETM imagery, we correctly identified all known seabird colonies of over 50 pairs in the area of Marguerite Bay. Almost all other areas with a similar spectral signature that were outside known breeding areas were single pixels that were readily distinguishable from genuine colonies. If these were excluded, only 4.1% of pixels appeared to represent unknown breeding or roosting sites, and warrant further investigation. The spatial extent of the guano provided a general guide to the number of individuals present, but further work would be required to determine the accuracy of this method for estimating population size. Spectral profiles of guano collected by satellite and hand-held spectrometers were compared with available data in spectral libraries and did not match with any known geological profile. There may also be potential for discriminating colonies of different species that differ in phenology and show seasonal changes in diet by the carefully-timed acquisition of suitable satellite imagery. We conclude that the remotely-sensed guano signature is a good indicator of the location of seabird breeding or roosting sites, with potentially wide application to other areas of the world.

However, these products lack information on the community structure of the phytoplankton, which is crucial for ecological modelling and ecosystem studies. To assess the usefulness of existing methods to differentiate phytoplankton functional types (PFT) or phytoplankton size classes from satellite data, in-situ phytoplankton samples collected in the Western Iberian coast, on the North-East Atlantic, were analysed for pigments and absorption spectra. Water samples were collected in five different locations, four of which were located near the shore and another in an open-ocean, seamount region. Three different modelling approaches for deriving phytoplankton size classes were applied to the in situ data. Approaches tested provide phytoplankton size class information based on the input of pigments data (Brewin et al., 2010), absorption spectra data (Ciotti et al., 2002) or both (Uitz et al., 2008). Following Uitz et al. (2008), results revealed high variability in microphytoplankton chlorophyll-specific absorption coefficients, ranging from 0.01 to 0.09 m(2) (mg chl)(-1) between 400 and 500 nm. This spectral analysis suggested, in one of the regions, the existence of small cells (<20 mu m) in the fraction of phytoplankton presumed to be microphytoplankton (based on diagnostic pigments). Ciotti et al. (2002) approach yielded the highest differences between modelled and measured absorption spectra for the locations where samples had high variability in community structure and cell size. The Brewin et al. (2010) pigment-based model was adjusted and a set of model coefficients are presented and recommended for future studies in offshore water of the Western Iberian coast.

The analysis and assessment of vulnerability was done through the application of multi-criteria evaluation approach in a geographical information system environment with inputs from remotely sensed images. Other input data sources include SRTM DEM, census details, city maps and field study. Flood vulnerability mapping in the study area is fundamental in flood risk management. Among the three vulnerability zones, the very high and high vulnerable zones together constituted 8.6 % of the total area of the city.

However, coastal vulnerability assessments require a complex dataset including human and socio-economic factors. In this study, we investigated coastal vulnerability index (CVI) to map the vulnerability of Tuticorin coast toward coastal erosion using remote sensing data and geographical information techniques based on a multi-indicator approach. Gulf of Mannar located along the southeast coast of India and declared as a marine national park with high ecological diversity faces threat due to anthropogenic interventions as a result of industrialization, sand and coral mining, etc. CVI highlights the vicinity where the physical effects may be the greatest. Beach width was considered as an additional parameter, since a large number of coastal habitations were present adjacent to the beach along the study area. Coastal erosion, slope and relative sea level rise are the major factors affecting the coastal vulnerability in Tuticorin. CVI scores were categorized into four classes, viz., low, moderate, high and very high risk. Out of 84-km coastal stretch, 15 % falls under high risk, 12 % moderate vulnerability and 73 % the low vulnerable category. This approach provides an insight to assess the vulnerability and the degree of potential threat to the coastal system in order to prioritize actions and to develop adaptation measures.																	0921-030X	1573-0840				JAN	2015	75	2					1713	1729		10.1007/s11069-014-1394-y								WOS:000346407100033

The coastal dry land masses (continent or islands) are joined by water: rivers, swamps, marshes or the sea: a continent divided by water'. When the chronology of the social dynamics surrounding the Caribbean Sea are scrutinized, the pattern that emerges is of land - based economies and dispersed hunter - gatherer sites starting around 14kBP, but there is no evidence of settlement along the coasts or exploitation of marine resources until around 8kBP on the continents, or 7 -5kBP on the islands. These dates coincide with a general sea level stabilization at 3 - 5 m below msl around 7kya. As sea level rose, shallow coastal areas flooded, transforming the hydrology, oceanography and morphology of the coastlines. Given the rate of eustatic sea-level rise during the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene, much of the early coastal landscapes around the American continents and the Caribbean Islands should be currently submerged, along with the evidence of human use of ancient coasts. The dry sites we today assume as early reflect settlement patterns that correspond to a relatively late configuration of the coastal morphology. However, underwater archaeology in the Caribbean has mostly focused on wrecks, if on anything at all, with practically no attention being paid to drowned landscapes. No marine geophysics analysis has been applied to underwater archaeology in the Caribbean so far. Given that early evidence of human activity should be submerged and possibly buried, the application of acoustic remote sensing techniques is the most time and cost effective survey method. Among these, high - resolution multi-channel and 3D seismic reflection surveying, in particular 3D Chirp systems, have proven to be very useful for the investigation of drowned landscapes as they can provide detailed stratigraphic information and visualization of buried archaeological objects. Even though no local studies have been conducted yet, this presentation focuses on the northeastern corner of the Caribbean Archipelago, at the contact between the Greater and the Lesser Antilles (Mona Passage, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands and the Anegada Passage), identifying areas with the highest potential for preservation of submerged landscapes and associated sites, from a geoarchaeological perspective. While side-scan sonars are useful to observe the sea floor and to identify shipwrecks or fishing technology, I emphasize on the potential of seismic surveys with sub-bottom profilers for the identification of buried ancient landscapes and associated sites, particularly in shallow, low-energy environments. This type of study and preliminary evaluation will serve as a basis to establish a solid collaborative research program that will permit a more complete understanding of the socio-natural dynamics of the peopling of the Caribbean region.																			978-1-4673-7019-6				2015																		WOS:000412164600058

Mapping of coastal aquifer vulnerable zone in the south west coast of Kanyakumari, South India, using GIS-based DRASTIC model	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The south west coast of Kanyakumari district in Tamil Nadu, India, is significantly affected by seawater intrusion and diffusion of pollutants into the aquifers due to unregulated beach placer mining and other anthropogenic activities. The present study investigates the vulnerability of the coastal aquifers using Geographic Information System (GIS)-based DRASTIC model. The seven DRASTIC parameters have been analyzed using the statistical equation of this model to demarcate the vulnerable zones for aquifer contamination. The vulnerability index map is prepared from the weighted spatial parameters, and an accounting of total index value ranged from 85 to 213. Based on the categorization of vulnerability classes, the high vulnerable zones are found near the beach placer mining areas between Manavalakurichi and Kodimanal coastal stretches. The aquifers associated with settlements and agricultural lands in the middle-eastern part have experienced high vulnerability due to contaminated water bodies. Similarly, the coastal areas of Thengapattinam and Manakudi estuary and around the South Tamaraikulam have also been falling under high vulnerability condition due to backwater and saltpan. In general, the nearshore region except the placer mining zone and the backwater has a moderately vulnerable condition, and the vulnerability index values range from 149 to180. Significantly, the northern and northeastern uplands and some parts of deposition zones in the middle-south coast have been identified as low to no vulnerable conditions. They are structurally controlled by various geological features such as charnockite, garnet biotite gneiss and granites, and sand dunes, respectively. The aquifer vulnerability assessment has been cross-verified by geochemical indicators such as total dissolved solids (TDS), Cl-, HCO3-, and Cl-/HCO3- ratio. The high ranges of TDS (1,842-3,736 mg/l) and Cl-(1,412-2,112 mg/l) values are well correlated with the observed high vulnerable zones in the study area. The Cl-/HCO3- ratio (7.13 to 12.18) of the high vulnerable zone obviously indicates deterioration of the aquifer contamination. Sensitivity analysis has also been performed to evaluate sensitivity of the individual DRASTIC parameters to aquifer vulnerability. This reveals the net recharge rate and groundwater table depth are becoming more sensitive to aquifer contamination. It is realized that the GIS is an effective platform for aquifer vulnerability mapping with reliable accuracy, and hence, the study is more useful for sustainable water resource management and the aquifer conservation.

J	Yuvaraj, E; Dharanirajan, K; Jayakumar, S; Saravanan				Yuvaraj, E.; Dharanirajan, K.; Jayakumar, S.; Saravanan			Geomorphic settings of mangrove ecosystem in South Andaman Island: A geospatial approach	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												Mangroves are habitats in the coasts of tropics and subtropics, hence the geomorphology of the coast prevails in both the ocean and the land processes. To study the geomorphic setting of mangroves, it is necessary to explore both the topography of the land and the bathymetry of the sea. In this study, the geomorphic setting of mangroves in the South Andaman Island has been studied in detail using remote sensing and GIS technology. The ortho-rectified IRS satellite image was used to identify and to map the mangroves and the associated features using the visual interpretation technique. Using the GIS technique, topographic and bathymetric DEMs (Digital Elevation Models) were created to understand the geomorphology and its influence on the mangrove ecosystem. This DEM was interpreted with mangrove distribution and its associated features to create the DTM (Digital Terrain Model) of the mangrove ecosystem. Topography and bathymetry of the coast result in three dominant features like rivers, tides and waves, which play a role in shaping the geomorphic settings of mangroves, which are classified into five major types. In this study, it is identified that all the five categories of major geomorphic settings of the mangrove community exist in the south Andaman. In the field surveys, ground truth of topographic elevation, mangrove species, and associated coastal land cover features were identified and confirmed in these geomorphic settings. It is concluded that topography and bathymetry settings of the island play an indispensable role in this fragile mangrove ecosystem.																	0253-4126	0973-774X				DEC	2014	123	8					1819	1830		10.1007/s12040-014-0503-3								WOS:000347512600008						
J	Choung, Y; Yun, HS				Choung, Yunjae; Yun, Hong Sik			Development of a Coastal Surface Monitoring System Using High-Resolution Images Taken in Haeundae, South Korea	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Coastal erosion causes loss of properties in coastal areas, and rip currents are the main factor causing coastal erosion. The use of remote sensing data is efficient for conducting coastal erosion research due to its advantages for acquiring the geometric and spectral information of coastal surfaces without human accessibility. This research aims to develop the coastal surface monitoring system (CSMS) using the high-resolution images taken in Haeundae, South Korea. Multiple mapping and image processing techniques are included in the methodology for developing CSMS. First, the coastlines are extracted from the images using the clustering algorithm and the data conversion technique. Buffering is applied along the generated coastlines to create the coast zone, and then the multiple materials in the coast zone are identified using the clustering algorithm. Next, constant intervals are set on the generated coastlines to create coast segments. Then the major material in each segment is determined by comparing the numbers of pixels in the clusters. Finally, different-colored coastlines are generated to show the major material in each segment. The developed CSMS can be used for monitoring coastal erosion caused by rip currents.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				WIN	2014					72		190	195		10.2112/SI72-034.1								WOS:000347275100034

Wave parameters (height, period, direction and short-wave/wind direction) were derived and compared with measurements made by a neighboring buoy and local weather stations. Wind direction and current velocity maps were produced and the interactions of winds and currents discussed. Significant oscillations in wave parameters were observed, which appear to be due to forcing by tidal current velocity variations. The oscillations in waveheight are explained using hydrodynamic analysis and derived amplitudes are compared with radar measurements.																	2072-4292					DEC	2014	6	12					12094	12117		10.3390/rs61212094								WOS:000346795300020

Jennifer; Kwok, Peter K.; Williams, Jeffrey			Heterogeneity among motorists in traffic-congested areas in southern California	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE												Estimation of congestion costs, presumed to be one of the largest external costs of automobile travel, is typically based on a single value of time delay for motorists in metropolitan areas. However, the estimation may be wrong if the profiles of motorists are different at different times of day. This study uses a survival model to examine the demographic and socioeconomic profiles of motorists at different times of day at congested locations in southern California, by using on-road remote-sensing measurements and license plates images obtained in 2007 and 2008 by the California South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD). More than 80,000 vehicles were observed from fifteen selected study sites over fifteen days. Their plates, through anonymized registration records, revealed addresses at the census block group level, which have homogenous profiles by construction. Motorists' profiles at different times of day display large variation, however, according to extended Cox model with a non-parametric baseline hazard, which is used to accommodate both the time-invariant and time-varying effects of the covariates. This study thus proposes a new approach to examine heterogeneity among motorists. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Coastal erosion causes significant economic and ecological problem. There is continuing serious coastal erosion along the Karasu coastline. This study reports on the process of determining the extent of the coastal erosion using satellite images from different time periods and the analysis of the risk to the environment. The change in the coastline over a 26-year period from 1987 to 2013 was determined using satellite images. In this study, significant coastline movements were detected for a 26-year period. For this study, the Karasu coastline was subdivided into 7 sections for analyses the coastal erosion risk. The risk of each section can be determined by using the classic risk. The results showed that both sides of the river outfall and the coastline have a moderate risk level with the area of the breakwater has a low risk.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				DEC	2014	18	6					673	682		10.1007/s11852-014-0343-y								WOS:000346412600007

Such deposits are valuable for reconstructing sea level fluctuations and recording tectonic reactivation along the passive margin of South America. Despite this relevance, much effort remains to be invested in discriminating these units in their various areas of occurrence. The main objective of this work is to develop and test a new methodology for semi-automated mapping of Neogene and late Quaternary sedimentary deposits in northeastern Brazil integrating geophysical and remote sensing data. The central onshore Paraiba Basin was selected due to the recent availability of a detailed map based on the integration of surface and subsurface geological data. We used airborne gamma-ray spectrometry (i.e., potassium-K and thorium-Th concentration) and morphometric data (i.e., relief dissection, slope and elevation) extracted from the digital elevation model (DEM) generated by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The procedures included: (a) data integration using geographic information systems (GIS); (b) exploratory statistical analyses, including the definition of parameters and thresholds for class discrimination for a set of sample plots; and (c) development and application of a decision-tree classification. Data validation was based on: (i) statistical analysis of geochemical and airborne gamma-ray spectrometry data consisting of K and Th concentrations; and (ii) map validation with the support of a confusion matrix, overall accuracy, as well as quantity disagreement and allocation disagreement for accuracy assessment based on field points. The concentration of K successfully separated the sedimentary units of the basin from Precambrian basement rocks. The relief dissection morphometric variable allowed the discrimination between the Barreiras Formation and the Post-Barreiras Sediments. In addition, two units of the latter (i.e., PB1 and PB2) previously mapped in the field were promptly separated based on Th concentration. A regression analysis indicated that the relationship between geophysical and geochemical values obtained for the FBI, PB2 and Barreiras Formation is significant (R-squared = 0.91; p-value <0.05). Map validation presented a high overall accuracy of 84%, with a coefficient of quantity disagreement of 12% and a coefficient of allocation disagreement of 8%. These results indicate that the methodology applied in the central onshore Paraiba Basin can be successfully used for mapping the Barreiras Formation and Post-Barreiras Sediments in other areas of the Brazilian coast. The ability to rapidly and precisely map these units using such methodology could reveal their geographic distribution along the northeastern coast of Brazil. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Modeling soil parameters using hyperspectral image reflectance in subtropical coastal wetlands	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Developing spectral models of soil properties is an important frontier in remote sensing and soil science. Several studies have focused on modeling soil properties such as total pools of soil organic matter and carbon in bare soils. We extended this effort to model soil parameters in areas densely covered with coastal vegetation. Moreover, we investigated soil properties indicative of soil functions such as nutrient and organic matter turnover and storage. These properties include the partitioning of mineral and organic soil between particulate (>53 mu m) and fine size classes, and the partitioning of soil carbon and nitrogen pools between stable and labile fractions. Soil samples were obtained from Avicennia genninans mangrove forest and Juncus roemerianus salt marsh plots on the west coast of central Florida. Spectra corresponding to field plot locations from Hyperion hyperspectral image were extracted and analyzed. The spectral information was regressed against the soil variables to determine the best single bands and optimal band combinations for the simple ratio (SR) and normalized difference index (NDI) indices. The regression analysis yielded levels of correlation for soil variables with R-2 values ranging from 0.21 to 0.47 for best individual bands, 0.28 to 0.81 for two-band indices, and 0.53 to 0.96 for partial leastsquares (PLS) regressions for the Hyperion image data. Spectral models using Hyperion data adequately (RPD > 1.4) predicted particulate organic matter (POM), silt+ clay, labile carbon (C), and labile nitrogen (N) (where RPD = ratio of standard deviation to root mean square error of cross-validation [RMSECV]). The SR (0.53 mu m, 2.11 mu m) model of labile N with R-2 = 0.81, RMSECV = 0.28, and RAD = 1.94 produced the best results in this study. Our results provide optimism that remote-sensing spectral models can successfully predict soil properties indicative of ecosystem nutrient and organic matter turnover and storage, and do so in areas with dense canopy cover.

J	Johnston, MW; Purkis, SJ				Johnston, Matthew W.; Purkis, Sam J.			Are lionfish set for a Mediterranean invasion? Modelling explains why this is unlikely to occur	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												The Atlantic invasion of Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois volitans/P. miles) has been as swift as it has been disastrous. Lionfish are non-native to the Mediterranean, but an invasion is perhaps even more likely than for the Atlantic. First, as for the Atlantic, there are many major cities on the coast of the Mediterranean (where aquarium-keeping is a common practice and chances of accidental and deliberate releases are high), and second, lionfish are native to the Red Sea, to which the Mediterranean is connected via the Suez Canal. Furthermore, there have already been four records of lionfish in the Mediterranean and so the pretext for an invasion is already in place. Up until now, however, it has been difficult to gauge the likelihood of an infestation of lionfish in the Mediterranean as, unlike the Atlantic, this sea has not been examined in terms of its hydrodynamics, ocean climate, and bathymetry, all factors known to be relevant to assessing the possibility of invasion. Motivated by this knowledge-gap, this study used remote sensing and computer modeling to investigate the connectivity between areas along the Mediterranean coastline that fulfill the necessary physical criteria to serve as potential lionfish habitat. Model results from the Mediterranean were compared and contrasted to those from the Atlantic and eastern Pacific. The Atlantic was considered because the lionfish invasion there has been voracious. Meanwhile, the eastern Pacific is interesting as a site without native lionfish, but with plenty of opportunity for their introduction, but no invasion yet recorded. Results indicated that, unlike in the Atlantic, connectivity among potential lionfish habitats in the Mediterranean was low in the study and comparable to that in the eastern Pacific. Although oceanographic conditions in the Mediterranean were found unfavorable for wide dispersion of lionfish larvae, hotspots where numerous lionfish sightings would forewarn an impending invasion were identified. This paper can therefore serve as a guide to the most efficient monitoring of lionfish in the Mediterranean and to where removal efforts should be concentrated, should the species become established.

Decadal changes (2003-2013) in configuration, geomorphology and erosion and accretion pockets along the spit were traced and compared. A 170m long subsurface profile across the spit from shoreline to river shore was generated using GPR. Historical satellite images from 1973 to 2013 illustrate a rapid transformation of a linear sand bar into a matured spit. The growth trend over the period 2003-2013 shows mainly accretion along the seashore and erosion along the river shore. Three dynamic hot spot locations were noticed where erosion and accretion were alternately dominating. The radar facies clearly distinguishes zones of fluvial, dune and inter-tidal dominance and substantiates the interpretation of the satellite images. This study indicates spit formation following build up and emergence of a submerged shoal due to fluvial sedimentation, after which an equilibrium between erosion and accumulation was reached. The data indicate that the growth of the spit has reached its mature stage and only lateral oscillation of the spit is likely in the future unless sizable disturbances caused by either tectonic or anthropogenic processes influence this region.

Specifically, this study examines the probabilities of R-M exceeding 25mmh(-1) (P25) in intense TCs. The 25mmh(-1) R-M is the 90th percentile of all R-M observations during the study period. The descending order of P25 observed from intense TCs for the six major ocean basins is: the North Indian Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Northwest Pacific Ocean, the South Pacific Ocean, the South Indian Ocean, and the East-central Pacific Ocean. The six major basins have been subdivided into 29 sub-basins to discern regional variability of R-M. P25 increases with increasing TC category in all major basins, except for the South Pacific. Sub-basins with intense TCs that produce extreme rainfall rate maxima include the Bay of Bengal, the South Philippine Sea, the East China Sea, the north coast of Australia, southeast Melanesia, and the Northwest Atlantic. Sub-basins with a higher proportion of category 5 (CAT5) observations than category 3 (CAT3) observations tend to have a greater P25 beyond 60km from the storm center.																	0272-3646	1930-0557				NOV 2	2014	35	6					478	496		10.1080/02723646.2014.964353								WOS:000343815400002

Succession of micro- and nanoplankton groups in ageing upwelled waters off Namibia	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												The phytoplankton composition was investigated on a cross-shore transect in the Northern Benguela upwelling system in August and September 2011. Micro- and nanorganisms were microscopically analysed and assigned to appropriate phytoplankton groups. The distribution of diatoms, dinoflagellates, coccolithophores and nanoflagellates along the transect was studied in order to reflect the phytoplankton succession. Typical phytoplankton communities indicating different stages of succession were found in relation to the distance to the coast and in relation to the aged upwelled water. Three succession stages could be well defined and verified by satellite data in the newly upwelled water, matured water and aged offshore water. The different stages were distinguished not only by the significant differences in the nutrient concentrations but also by the dominating species and phytoplankton life forms. A mixed population of dinoflagellates, coccolithophores and microflagellates was observed in the newly upwelled water. Small diatom cells (Cylindrotheca closterium) marked the transition to the matured water at about 40 km from the shore. A diatoms to dinoflagellates ratio up to 33 and biomasses up to 250 mu gCl(-1) were characteristic for the matured stage, between 40 km and 250 km from the coast. As observed by satellite data, highly productive water bands intrude the water masses which also represent this stage. They were characterized by accumulated biomasses dominated by diatoms (Pseudo-nitzschia seriata group). Diatoms to dinoflagellates ratios less than 1 and maximum biomasses of 15 mu gCl(-1) characterized the aged water at the later stage of succession. Abundances of dinoflagellates smaller than 10 mu m increased just after the decline of the diatoms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Interplay of diverse environmental settings and their influence on the plankton community off Myanmar during the Spring Intermonsoon	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												The northern Andaman Sea including the Myanmar waters is one of the least studied regions of the northern Indian Ocean. The freshwater and suspended sediments carried by Ayeyawady/Irrawaddy, the peculiar surface circulation, coastline morphology and shallow bathymetry in the Gulf of Mottama facilitate several diverse environmental settings in the study region. In order to understand the environmental settings and their linkages to the plankton community in the study region, this paper combined in situ data of 'First India-Myanmar Joint Oceanographic Expedition' with satellite oceanography observations. The study period was the Spring Intermonsoon (March-May), which was characterized by high tidal activity in the Gulf of Mottama region (tidal height 6-8 m) causing strong tidal currents and re-suspension of sediments. The tidal currents and eastward advection of Ayeyawady influx caused the lowest salinity, highest concentration of nutrients, suspended sediments and chlorophyll a in the Gulf of Mottama region. Conversely, high salinity, highest temperature, lowest nutrients and suspended sediments prevalent in the offshore waters of the northern Andaman Sea induced a massive bloom of Trichodesmium elythraeum, which was mostly in the declining phase during the observation. The in situ and satellite remote sensing data clearly showed that the T. erythraeum bloom observed in the offshore waters was closely linked to a warm core eddy. The decomposition of the bloom favored swarms of siphonophores and hydromedusae through atrophic link involving copepods and appendicularians. Aided by satellite remote sensing data and multivariate statistical tools, five diverse environmental settings have been identified in the study domain. The analysis showed a close coupling between phytoplankton biomass and nutrients with their higher values in the Gulf of Mottama, off Rakhine, Ayeyawady and Thanintharyi region as compared to the offshore waters in the northern Andaman Sea. The zooplankton community dominated by copepods and chaetognaths preferred regions with high salinity, chlorophyll, deep mixed layer and low suspended sediments as existed off Rakhine, Ayeyawady and Thanintharyi regions. The study evidences, for the first time, the spatial segregation of environmental settings and its linkages to the plankton community off Myanmar during the Spring Intermonsoon.

It offers the potential to scale-up ground-based, local environmental monitoring efforts to document disturbance types, and characterize their extents and frequencies at regional scales. Here we present a simple, but effective means of visually assessing landscape disturbances in northern environments using trend analysis of Landsat satellite image stacks. Linear trends of the Tasseled Cap brightness, greenness, and wetness indices, when composited into an RGB image, effectively distinguish diverse landscape changes based on additive color logic. Using a variety of reference datasets within Northwest Territories, Canada, we show that the trend composites are effective for identifying wildfire regeneration, tundra greening, fluvial dynamics, thermokarst processes including lake surface area changes and retrogressive thaw slumps, and the footprint of resource development operations and municipal development. Interpretation of the trend composites is aided by a color wheel legend and contextual information related to the size, shape, and location of change features.

J	Kaiser, MF				Kaiser, Mona Fouad			Disturbance of Hydrodynamic Regime in the Mediterranean Coastal Zone of Egypt	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Engineering structures induce variations in the physical parameters of incident waves approaching coastlines, affecting the rate of longshore sediment transport and the patterns of shoreline change. Landsat Thematic Mapper images acquired from 1990 to 2005 and field measurements were utilized to perform mathematical modeling along Mediterranean coastal zones in Egypt. The K-1 transport coefficient values used to calibrate the models ranged from 0.05 to 0.9. To accommodate changes in the physical conditions, a second calibration was required. The Ki transport coefficient values determined by the second calibration ranged from 0.1 to 0.7. These results indicate that the hydrodynamic regime along the Nile Delta coastal zones during 1995-2000 (verification) and 2000-2005 (second calibration) was disturbed by the effect of engineering works. Therefore, the calibration parameters used in simulations before 1995 are not appropriate for use after 1995. These findings demonstrate how the physical parameters of waves and currents are disturbed after some protective structures are modified.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				NOV	2014	30	6					1260	1267		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12-00247.1								WOS:000344828400015

Precursory signals associated with the 2010 M8.8 Bio-Bio earthquake (Chile) and the 2010 M7.2 Baja California earthquake (Mexico)	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Recently, new theories on underground geophysical and geochemical interactions which had been reported to occur during the preparation stages of earthquakes and the remotely measurable variations have been put to test and some warning factors were suggested as earthquake precursors. Data vendors are providing daily basis information from the earth's surface by combining remote sensing data and in situ observations. In this paper, we analyze atmospheric, oceanic, and surface changes in the ocean, coast, and land lying near the epicenters of two recent major earthquakes. The changes are studied in terms of the regional fault locations which have been reported by the U.S. Geological Survey as the shake triggering geological structures. Our detailed analyses showed anomalous increases of surface latent heat flux (SLHF) for both the earthquakes. Meaningfully limited to the geographical extents of the regional active faults, the SLHF variation patterns suggest pre-seismic activity 2-3 weeks before the main events. The agreement of these variations with abnormalities in other climatic and surface factors like relative humidity and temperature represents an unusual situation during the same period as well. Spatiotemporal variations of chlorophyll-a was also studied as another earthquake indicator. Abnormal rises in these factors are possibly caused by the formation of micro-cracks, heat production, evaporation, ionization, and upwelling of nutrient-rich water produced by preseismic activity prior to the main events.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				NOV	2014	7	11					4889	4897		10.1007/s12517-013-1117-9								WOS:000344476700033						
J	Etellisi, EA; Deng, YM				Etellisi, Ehab A.; Deng, Yiming			Oil spill detection: imaging system modeling and advanced image processing using optimized SDC algorithm	SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING												Oil spill on the sea surface might happen without any previous caution and is seen relatively often. Efficient and effective oil spill monitoring and detection can reduce response time, minimize remediation costs and limit dangerous impacts to the environment. An innovative satellite-based oil pollution detection framework is demonstrated in this paper, including satellite imaging system modeling-communication link configuration, noise model for image transmission and preprocessing. Finally, an optimized sequential detection of change-based image object detection algorithm is proposed to detect oil spill on the ocean surface from the enhanced remote sensing data. Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer images of the Gulf of Mexico accident from NASA between May and June 2010 are adopted for testing in our framework. The results of this research show that the proposed algorithms can effectively distinguish the spill covering vast areas of the marine environment even with severe additive noise and have good separation properties against complex signatures, such as the vicinity to the irregular coast or foggy and cloudy weather conditions.																	1863-1703	1863-1711				NOV	2014	8	8					1405	1419		10.1007/s11760-012-0371-8								WOS:000344621800001

The Eyjafjallajokull volcanic system, Iceland: insights from electromagnetic measurements	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL												Electromagnetic (EM) measurements were performed 1 yr after the most recent eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano (2010 March May), southern Iceland, to investigate the geometries of structures of the volcano system through imaging lateral and vertical electrical resistivity variations. High quality magnetotelluric (MT) and transient EM data were acquired at 26 sites around Eyj4allajokull and the southern part of Myrdalsjokull (the glacier covering the Katla volcano). For some locations the steep topography has influence on the MT responses, but this can be compensated by static shift correction using the transient EM data and/or including topography in the modelling mesh. As expected, qualitative indicators, such as phase tensor ellipses and induction arrows, infer a concentration of conductive material beneath Eyjafjallajokull. 2-D resistivity models are presented from data along three profiles: Along the river valley of MarkarfljOt in the north, along the coast to the south of Eyjafjallaj Anil and across the mountain ridge Fimmvorauhals between Eyj4allajokull and Katla. In numerous previous studies elsewhere in Iceland a conductive layer at about 10-30 km depth was identified. From our data, such a conductor is also present in the northeastern part of the investigated area. Additionally, all profiles show a conductive, near-surface layer at about 1-2 km depth, as seen previously for example at the Hengill geothermal region. A connection between those two conductive layers is indicated by the resistivity models, and the dyke (flank eruption) and the conduit (summit eruption) appear as vertical conductive structures. It is uncertain if the vertical connection is permanent or a transient feature as consequence of the eruptive sequences. Subsequent measurements are required when the volcano system is quiescent.																	0956-540X	1365-246X				NOV	2014	199	2					1187	1204		10.1093/gji/ggu322								WOS:000343411700040						
J	Gharibreza, M; Habibi, A; Imamjomeh, SR; Ashraf, MA				Gharibreza, Mohammadreza; Habibi, Alireza; Imamjomeh, Sayed Reza; Ashraf, Muhammad Aqeel			Coastal processes and sedimentary facies in the Zohreh River Delta (Northern Persian Gulf)	CATENA												The Zohreh River Delta is one of the largest deltaic plains along the northern coast of the Persian Gulf. This delta is located near an international navigation corridor, which is affected by long-term delta progradation. Therefore, the research objectives of this study were to determine the coastal sedimentary processes of the Zohreh River Delta and to detect the evolutionary trend of the deltaic plain at the northern Persian Gulf. The research method was formulated to achieve objectives herein, including field measurements, numerical modeling, remote sensing and laboratory analyses. The results showed that flash floods and turbidity currents transport sediment to the deltaic area, and tidal currents play an important role in sediment redistribution and in the high diversity of sedimentary facies. Flood plains, tidal flats, crevasse splays, nebka, and sabkha are the most important sedimentary facies in the study area. Gypsum and salt crystal are frequently grown in supratidal and intertidal zones because of a dominantly arid climate. The river and tidal currents are responsible for an annual sediment transport of 321,310 m(3), while the sediment transport by littoral drift is calculated to be 81,000 m(3) annually. MIKE-21 (a coastal modeling software) revealed that 80% of the sediment is transferred into the subtidal zone and the remaining 20% is deposited at the river mouth. Applications of GIS tails showed that the mean annual sedimentation rate at the river mouth and the long-term shoaling rate have been 0.07 m and 2.45 m, respectively. The rate of long-term progradation of the delta implies an increase of sediment supply from the catchment area due to land use changes and river bank erosion. A key part of this research is presenting the implications of the permanent shoaling trend which is prograding toward the international shipping corridor at the north of the Persian Gulf.

J	Rapinel, S; Clement, B; Magnanon, S; Sellin, V; Hubert-Moy, L				Rapinel, Sebastien; Clement, Bernard; Magnanon, Sylvie; Sellin, Vanessa; Hubert-Moy, Laurence			Identification and mapping of natural vegetation on a coastal site using a Worldview-2 satellite image	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Identification and mapping of natural vegetation are major issues for biodiversity management and conservation. Remotely sensed data with very high spatial resolution are currently used to study vegetation, but most satellite sensors are limited to four spectral bands, which is insufficient to identify some natural vegetation formations. The study objectives are to discriminate natural vegetation and identify natural vegetation formations using a Worldview-2 satellite image. The classification of the Worldview-2 image and ancillary thematic data was performed using a hybrid pixel-based and object-oriented approach. A hierarchical scheme using three levels was implemented, from land cover at a field scale to vegetation formation. This method was applied on a 48 km(2) site located on the French Atlantic coast which includes a classified NATURA 2000 dune and marsh system. The classification accuracy was very high, the Kappa index varying between 0.90 and 0.74 at land cover and vegetation formation levels respectively. These results show that Wordlview-2 images are suitable to identify natural vegetation. Vegetation maps derived from Worldview-2 images are more detailed than existing, ones. They provide a useful medium for environmental management of vulnerable areas. The approach used to map natural vegetation is reproducible for a wider application by environmental managers.

The two geophysical contaminants enter the sidelobes of the Aquarius antenna and bias the coastal SSS low: the emission from the land surface and the radiofrequency interference (RFI). Away from about one Aquarius pixel (150 km) from the coastline, the Aquarius SSS is fairly insensitive (less than about 0.2 psu) to the radiometric details of the method to correct for the land emission. The ascending orbits appear to be affected by unfiltered RFI much less than the descending tracks. The Aquarius SSS along the ascending tracks is low over the ECS by 0.40-0.93 psu (with respect to the in situ data during the two separate 7 day periods) and is biased low by 0.41-1.07 psu (accuracy, or the time-mean of difference from the regional model along three Aquarius tracks over a 18 month period). The presence of the ascending and descending differences in the Aquarius SSS, and the spatially widespread bias suggest that the bias is attributed to the unfiltered RFI originating from strong point sources (rather than to the land contamination from weak distributed sources, or to other seasonally varying geophysical contaminants). Despite the bias, the Aquarius data describe well the temporal and spatial variability of the ECS SSS. The temporal trend and magnitude of salinity changes agree remarkably between Aquarius and a regional numerical model, during both the freshwater discharge season from the Yangtze river and the rest of the year. The precision of the Aquarius observation in the ECS is comparable with the Aquarius mission requirement (0.2 psu one-sigma for a monthly average over the open ocean). The river discharge rate correlates with the Aquarius SSS with the coefficient of 0.71 on a seasonal scale with the discharge leading the SSS changes. The Aquarius SSS increases away from the coast, in response to the river outflow. The interannual changes in the Aquarius SSS capture the effect of the regional drought in summer 2013.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				OCT	2014	119	10					7016	7028		10.1002/2014JC009983								WOS:000345499700029

Because MERIS standard SPM concentration retrieval saturates at about 50 g m(-3), we developed an alternative method for turbid nearshore waters. The method consists in the combination of the Semi-Analytical Atmospheric and Bio-Optical (SAABIO) atmospheric correction with a regional bio-optical algorithm based on a linear relationship between SPM concentration and the reflectance band ratio at 865 and 560 nm. MERIS FR-derived SPM concentrations were validated from 10 up to 300 g m(-3), and then merged with oyster ecophysiological responses to provide a spatial picture of the impact of SPM concentration on oyster-farming sites. Our approach demonstrates the potential of high resolution satellite remote sensing for aquaculture management and shellfish-farming ecosystems studies.

Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Gyres in Oriented Lakes on the Arctic Coastal Plain of Northern Alaska Based on Remotely Sensed Images	REMOTE SENSING												The formation of oriented thermokarst lakes on the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska has been the subject of debate for more than half a century. The striking elongation of the lakes perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction has led to the development of a preferred wind-generated gyre hypothesis, while other hypotheses include a combination of sun angle, topographic aspect, and/or antecedent conditions. A spatio-temporal analysis of oriented thermokarst lake gyres with recent (Landsat 8) and historical (Landsat 4, 5, 7 and ASTER) satellite imagery of the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska indicates that wind-generated gyres are both frequent and regionally extensive. Gyres are most common in lakes located near the Arctic coast after several days of sustained winds from a single direction, typically the northeast, and decrease in number landward with decreasing wind energy. This analysis indicates that the conditions necessary for the Carson and Hussey (1962) wind-generated gyre for oriented thermokarst lake formation are common temporally and regionally and correspond spatially with the geographic distribution of oriented lakes on the Arctic Coastal Plain. Given an increase in the ice-free season for lakes as well as strengthening of the wind regime, the frequency and distribution of lake gyres may increase. This increase has implications for changes in northern high latitude aquatic ecosystems, particularly if wind-generated gyres promote permafrost degradation and thermokarst lake expansion.

J	Michel, A; Flament, T; Remy, F				Michel, Aurelie; Flament, Thomas; Remy, Frederique			Study of the Penetration Bias of ENVISAT Altimeter Observations over Antarctica in Comparison to ICESat Observations	REMOTE SENSING												The aim of this article is to characterize the penetration bias of the ENVIronmental SATellite (ENVISAT) radar altimeter over the Antarctic ice sheet through comparison with the more accurate measurements of the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) altimeter at crossover points. We studied the difference between ENVISAT and ICESat fluctuations over six years. We observed the same patterns between the leading edge width and the elevation difference. Both parameters are linked, and the major bias is due to the lengthening of the leading edge width due to the radar penetration. We show that the elevation difference between both altimeters and the leading edge width are linearly well-linked with a 0.8 Pearson correlation coefficient, whereas the slope effect over the coasts is difficult to analyze. When we analyze each crossover point temporal evolution locally, the linear correlation between the leading edge width and the elevation difference is between -0.6 and -1. Fitting a linear model between them, we find a reliability index greater than 0.7 for the Antarctic Plateau and Dronning Maud Land, which confirms that the penetration effect has a linear influence on the retrieved height. Moreover, we present results from SARAL/AltiKa (launched in February 2013) that confirm SARAL/AltiKa accuracy and the promising information it will provide.																	2072-4292					OCT	2014	6	10					9412	9434		10.3390/rs6109412								WOS:000344458000013

Analysis of long-term coastline changes of islands is however limited due to unavailable data and the cost of field work. In this study, high-resolution images taken from 1970-2011 at an interval of about 10 years and topographic maps were collected to determine coastline changes and their drivers in the Zhoushan Islands, China. Results show that nearly all inhabited islands appeared to have noteworthy seaward expansion during the past four decades. Coastline change rates varied among islands, and the annual change rate of Zhoushan Island (the main island) reached 12.83 +/- 0.17 m/year during the same period. Since 2003, the study area has been dominated by artificial coast. The proportion of harbor/port and urban/industrial coast has significantly increased, while rocky coasts and shelter-farm coasts have shrunk greatly. Preliminary analysis of drivers for these coastline changes across the Zhoushan Islands highlights the roles of human policies during different periods as well as location, which were the dominant factors controlling the great spatial and temporal complexity of coastline changes of the major islands. Sediment supply from the Yangtze River decreased after the completion of the Three Gorges Dam in 2003; however, the Zhoushan coast rapidly accreted seaward during the last decade and the artificial siltation, coastal engineering, and harbor dredging materials could be responsible for the observed coastline changes. Pressured by rapid development of the port industry, the Zhoushan coast may face unprecedented challenges in coastal use in the near future. This research provides the basic background information for future studies on coastal protection and management.																	2072-4292					OCT	2014	6	10					9930	9950		10.3390/rs6109930								WOS:000344458000036

The distribution and variability of low-level cloud in the North Atlantic trades	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												In the North Atlantic trades, variations in the distribution of low-level cloud are rich. Using two years of observations from a remote-sensing site located on the east coast of Barbados, the vertical distribution of cloud and its contribution to low-level cloud amount are explored. The vertical distribution of first-detected cloud-base heights is marked by a strong peak near the lifting condensation level (LCL) from passive optically thin shallow cumuli. Cloud with a base near this level dominates the total cloud cover with a contribution of about two-thirds. The other one-third comes from cloud with its cloud base further aloft at heights > 1 km, such as cumulus edges or stratiform cloud below the trade inversion. Cloud found aloft, regardless of where its base is located, contains more variance, in particular near the inversion and on time-scales longer than a day. In turn, cloud near the LCL is surprisingly invariant on longer time-scales, although consistent with existing theories. Because this component does not systematically vary, changes in cloud cover in response to changes in meteorology or climate may be limited to changes in its contribution from cloud aloft.

Investigation of Low-Cloud Characteristics Using Mesoscale Numerical Model Data for Improvement of Fog-Detection Performance by Satellite Remote Sensing	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												The comprehensive relationship between meteorological conditions and whether low water cloud touches the surface, particularly at sea, is examined with the goal of improving low-cloud detection by satellite. Gridpoint-value data provided by an operational mesoscale model with integration of Multifunction Transport Satellite-2 data can provide sufficient data for statistical analyses to find general parameters that can discern whether low clouds touch the surface, compensating for uncertainty due to the scarcity of observation sites at sea and the infrequent incidence of fog. The analyses reveal that surface-touching low clouds tend to have lower cloud-top heights than those not touching the surface, although the frequency distribution of cloud-top height differs by season. The bottom of the Gamma > Gamma(m) layer (where Gamma and Gamma(m) are the vertical gradient and the moist-adiabatic lapse rate of the potential temperature, respectively) with surface-touching low-cloud layers tends to be very low or almost attached to the surface. In contrast, the tops of low-cloud layers not touching the surface tend to occur near the bottom of the Gamma > Gamma(m) layer. Mechanisms to correlate these meteorological conditions with whether low clouds touch the surface are inferred from investigations into the vertical structure of equivalent potential temperature. These results indicate that the temperature difference between cloud-top height and the surface can be an appropriate parameter to infer whether low clouds touch the surface. It is also suggested that only a little addition of meteorological ancillary data, such				Nakajima, Takashi/C-2747-2009													1558-8424	1558-8432				OCT	2014	53	10					2246	2263		10.1175/JAMC-D-13-0363.1								WOS:000343528400003

While traditional field mapping techniques, such as towed video and diver surveys, are still commonly employed for generating highly detailed maps of seafloor habitat, acoustic and satellite remote sensing have proven to be efficient alternatives for generating habitat maps. To date remote sensing using satellite imagery has dominated mapping efforts over coral reefs and other tropical ecosystems with fewer studies applied in temperate marine regions where acoustic studies are more common. Few studies exist that have assessed the performance of high resolution satellite imagery in mapping seafloor habitat in temperate regions. This paper compares the efficacy of high resolution satellite imagery (WorldView-2) and a single-beam acoustic ground discrimination system (QTC View V) for mapping the distribution of submerged aquatic vegetation at a site within the Gwaii Haanas National Marine Conservation Area (GHNMCA) off the north coast of British Columbia, Canada. Ground-truth data for training and validation were collected using a towed underwater video camera. Prior to classification the WorldView-2 image (8 bands, 2 m resolution) was processed following orthorectification, atmospheric correction, glint correction, land and optically deep water masking. An acoustic survey was conducted using a 200 kHz echosounder and data were processed and interpolated using QTC IMPACT software. The WorldView-2 imagery performed best in mapping habitat in regions shallower than 3 m, obtaining a total accuracy 75%, where it could identify the distribution of green algae (Ulva spp.), brown algae (Fucus spp.) and eelgrass (Zostera marina). The 200 kHz data were unable to detect the distribution of brown and green algae but were able to map the distribution of eelgrass as well as a subtidal red algae (Chondrocanthus exasperatus) (total accuracy 80%). A final habitat map containing all habitat types present at the study site was produced using the output from both datasets. The study resulted in recommendations for remote mapping of submerged vegetation in temperate coastal area. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Sargassum beds play a range of ecological roles in coastal waters, but their sustainability is threatened by pollution and reclamation within ASEAN countries with rapid economic growth. Before conservation initiatives can be implemented, it is necessary to establish their present distribution. These beds can be mapped using the noncommercial satellite, ALOS, which can provide multiband images using high spatial resolution optical sensors (sensitive to 10 m(-2) plots), AVNIR-2. These images are of sufficient quality for examining coastal ecosystems and, in this study, for mapping the Sargassum beds in the waters off the coast of Sattahip, Chon Buri Province, Thailand. This coastal zone is a natural marine park reserve and protected from human activities such as fishery and reclamation. Biomass data were obtained in January, February, March, and December 2009 from quadrat sampling. The biomass of Sargassum aquifolium (Turner) C. Agardh at a bottom depth of 1 m and 1.5-2 m was determined to be 7.73 and 92.75 g dw m(-2), while that of Sargassum oligocystum Montagne was found to be 44.05 and 87.97 g dw m(-2), respectively. Ground truth data were obtained in February and October 2012 from serial images taken by manta tow. Supervised classification is a procedure for identifying spectrally similar areas on an image by identifying "training" sites of known targets and then extrapolating those spectral signatures to other areas of unknown targets. By applying this methodology, the Sargassum beds off Sattahip can be detected with an accuracy of about 70%. It is estimated that the error is caused by mixel effects of the bottom substrates in individual pixels, each of which covers an area of 10 x 10 m. Our results indicate that the images captured by ALOS AVNIR-2 are informative and useful for mapping the -Sargassum beds in Southeast Asia.																	0006-8055	1437-4323				OCT	2014	57	5					367	377		10.1515/bot-2014-0015								WOS:000343111500004

Examining Change Detection Approaches for Tropical Mangrove Monitoring	PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING												This study evaluated the effectiveness of different band combinations and classifiers (unsupervised, supervised, object-oriented nearest neighbor, and object-oriented decision rule) for quantifying mangrove forest change using multitemporal Landsat data. A discriminant analysis using spectra of different vegetation types determined that bands 2 (0.52 to 0.6 mu m), 5 (1.55 to 1.75 mu m), and 7(2.08 to 2.35 mu m) were the most effective bands for differentiating mangrove forests from surrounding land cover types. A ranking of thirty-six change maps, produced by comparing the classification accuracy of twelve change detection approaches, was used. The object-based Nearest Neighbor classifier produced the highest mean overall accuracy (84 percent) regardless of band combinations. The automated decision rule-based approach (mean overall accuracy of 88 percent) as well as a composite of bands 2, 5, and 7 used with the unsupervised classifier and the same composite or all band difference with the object-oriented Nearest Neighbor classifier were the most effective approaches.																	0099-1112	2374-8079				OCT	2014	80	10					983	993		10.14358/PERS.80.10.983								WOS:000342551800013

Biogeography and phenology of satellite-measured phytoplankton seasonality in the California current	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Thirteen years (1998-2010) of satellite-measured chlorophyll a are used to establish spatial patterns in climatological phytoplankton biomass seasonality across the California Current System (CCS) and its interannual variability. Multivariate clustering based on the shape of the local climatological seasonal cycle divides the study area into four groups: two with spring-summer maxima representing the northern and southern coastal upwelling zones, one with a summer minimum offshore in mid-latitudes and a fourth with very weak seasonality in between. Multivariate clustering on the seasonal cycles from all 13 years produces the same four seasonal cycle types and provides a view of the interannual variability in seasonal biogeography. Over the study period these seasonal cycles generally appear in similar locations as the climatological clusters. However, considerable interannual variability in the geography of the seasonal cycles is evident across the CCS, the most spatially extensive of which are associated with the 1997-1999 El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) signal and the 2005 delayed spring transition off the Oregon and northern and central California coasts. We quantify linear trends over the study period in the seasonal timing of the two seasonal cycles that represent the biologically productive coastal upwelling zones using four different metrics of phenology. In the northern upwelling region, the date of the spring maximum is delaying (1.34 days yr(-1)) and the central tendency of the summer elevated chlorophyll period is advancing (0.63 days yr(-1)). In the southern coastal upwelling region, both the initiation and cessation of the spring maximum are delaying (1.78 days yr(-1) and 2.44 days yr(-1), respectively) and the peak is increasing in duration over the study period. Connections between observed interannual shifts in phytoplankton seasonality and physical forcing, expressed as either basin-scale climate signals or local forcing, show phytoplankton seasonality in the CCS to be influenced by changes in the seasonality of the wind mixing power offshore, coastal upwelling in the near-shore regions and basin-scale signals such as ENSO across the study area.

Atmospheric processes responsible for generation of the 2008 Boothbay meteotsunami	NATURAL HAZARDS												We investigated the atmospheric processes and physics that were active during a tsunami-like event hitting Boothbay Harbor area (Maine, USA) on 28 October 2008. The data collected by tide gauges, ground and sounding stations and meteo-ocean buoys in the area were analyzed, together with satellite and radar images. The atmospheric processes were reproduced by the weather research and forecasting model, verified by in situ and remote sensing data. A cold front moved over the area at the time of the event, with embedded convective clouds detected by satellite and radar data and the internal gravity waves (IGWs) detected by radar and reproduced by the model at the rear of the frontal precipitation band. According to the model, the IGWs that passed over Boothbay Harbor generated strong ground air-pressure oscillations reaching 2.5 hPa/3 min. The IGWs were ducted towards the coast without significant dissipation, propagating in a stable near-surface layer capped by an instability at approximately 3.5 km height and satisfying all conditions for their maintenance over larger areas. The intensity, speed and direction of the IGWs were favourable for generation of a meteotsunami wave along the Gulf of Maine shelf. Operational observation systems were not capable of sufficiently capturing the ground disturbance due to a too coarse sampling rate, while the numerical model was found to be a useful tool in eventual future detection and warning systems.

Distributions of invertebrate larvae and phytoplankton in a coastal upwelling system retention zone and peripheral front	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Near-coastal retention of larvae affects the ecology of many marine species. In coastal upwelling ecosystems having strong offshore transport, larval ecology is greatly influenced by nearshore retention in bays and in the lee of headlands. Further, frontal dynamics along the periphery of retention zones can drive larval accumulation and transport. The purpose of this study is to examine larval distributions and associated processes across a retention zone and its peripheral front in the coastal upwelling environment of Monterey Bay, California, USA. During fall 2009 an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) was used to observe environmental variability at high resolution and acquire targeted water samples. Invertebrate larvae in samples were subsequently identified and quantified using molecular methods. To infer ecological processes we examine larval distributions in relation to environmental processes revealed by the AUV data and the greater regional observing system. As a window into biological-physical interactions that may concentrate motile larvae in convergence zones, we examine more extensive in situ and remote sensing observations that describe distribution patterns of motile phytoplankton. During the 10-day study intensification of upwelling caused flow of cold water into the bay and formation of an upwelling front. Drifter and satellite observations showed retention of near-surface water within the bay inshore of the front, where a bloom of motile phytoplankton intensified. Larval distributions were related to processes inferred at a range of scales. At the scale of the retention zone, dense phytoplankton accumulations indicated concentration of motile plankton in a convergence zone created by flow toward the coast, as well as nutritional support for larvae. At the scale of the front, velocity and water property measurements indicated convergence between cold deep-shelf water transported shoreward along shoaling bathymetry and the overlying warm surface water, influencing plankton accumulation and vertical transport. At the finest scales resolved, aerial photography revealed banded accumulations of dense phytoplankton bloom patches and narrow foam lines, common indicators of small-scale convergence zones and consistent with internal wave processes. Exceptionally high larval concentrations were detected in samples from locations affected by frontal and internal wave dynamics. This study illustrates how autonomous feature recognition and targeted sampling with an AUV, applied within the greater context of multidisciplinary observation across regional to small scales, can advance plankton ecology research.

Satellite remote sensing reveals coastal upwelling events in the San Matias Gulf-Northern Patagonia	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Coastal upwelling events are effective in fluxing nutrients upward to the euphotic layer, thus promoting the growth of marine phytoplankton. Satellite data may provide useful information to detect and characterize upwelling events in regions of sparse in-situ observations. We analyze the coastal upwelling process on the western San Maths Gulf, on the northern continental shelf of Argentina, based on the analysis of remote sensing and in-situ data. Upwelling events are characterized by their frequency of occurrence and magnitude. During the austral summer we found roughly 6 upwelling-favorable wind events per year. Satellite derived sea surface temperature (SST) data provide evidence of upwelling in 85% of the cases between 2000 and 2008. Analysis of specific events provides clues on the wind forcing characteristics required to generate upwelling, and on characteristic space and time scales of the process. On February 2005 SST data reveal a narrow coastal band (similar to 10 km) of relative cold water extending similar to 100 km along the west coast of SMG. The SST in this band was 1.5 degrees C lower than further offshore. Near bottom temperature fluctuations from in-situ daily observations collected at two nearshore locations are significantly correlated with along-shore wind stress, suggesting that coastal upwelling is a dominant process controlling high-frequency temperature fluctuations near-shore. A simple quantitative estimate reveals a volume of upwelled water reaching the sea surface of about 10(10) m(3) during one relatively intense upwelling event.

J	Mannino, A; Novak, MG; Hooker, SB; Hyde, K; Aurin, D				Mannino, Antonio; Novak, Michael G.; Hooker, Stanford B.; Hyde, Kimberly; Aurin, Dirk			Algorithm development and validation of CDOM properties for estuarine and continental shelf waters along the northeastern U.S. coast	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												An extensive set of field measurements have been collected throughout the continental margin of the northeastern U.S. from 2004 to 2011 to develop and validate ocean color satellite algorithms for the retrieval of the absorption coefficient of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (a(CDOM)) and CDOM spectral slopes for the 275:295 nm and 300:600 nm spectral range (S-275:295 and S-300:600). Remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) measurements computed from in-water radiometry profiles along with a(CDOM)(lambda) data are applied to develop several types of algorithms for the SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua ocean color satellite sensors, which involve least squares linear regression of a(CDOM)(X) with (1)R-rs band ratios, (2) quasi-analytical algorithm-based (QAA-based) products of total absorption coefficients, (3) multiple R-rs bands within a multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis, and (4) diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d). The relative error (mean absolute percent difference; MAPD) for the MLR retrievals of a(CDOM)(275), a(CDOM)(355), a(CDOM)(380), a(CDOM)(412) and a(CDOM)(443) for our study region range from 20.4 to 23.9% for MODIS-Aqua and 27.3-30% for SeaWiFS. Because of the narrower range of CDOM spectral slope values, the MAPD for the MLR S-275:295 and S-300:600 algorithms are much lower ranging from 9.9% and 9.1% for SeaWiFS, respectively, and 8.7% and 9.7% for MODIS, respectively. Multi-year, seasonal and spatial MODIS-Aqua and SeaWiFS distributions of Claw, S-275:295 and S-300:600 processed with these algorithms are consistent with field measurements and the processes that impact CDOM levels along the continental shelf of the northeastern U.S. Several satellite data processing factors correlate with higher uncertainty in satellite retrievals of a(CDOM), S-275:295 and S-300.600 within the coastal ocean, including solar zenith angle, sensor viewing angle, and atmospheric products applied for atmospheric corrections. Algorithms that include ultraviolet R-rs bands provide a better fit to field measurements than algorithms without the ultraviolet R-rs bands. This suggests that satellite sensors with ultraviolet capability could provide better retrievals of CDOM. Because of the strong correlations between CDOM parameters and DOM constituents in the coastal ocean, satellite observations of CDOM parameters can be applied to study the distributions, sources and sinks of DOM, which are relevant for understanding the carbon cycle, modeling the Earth system, and to discern how the Earth is changing.

The impacts of the great Mississippi/Atchafalaya River flood on the oceanography of the Atchafalaya Shelf	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Rivers are the primary means by which water, sediment, and dissolved material are transported from the continents to the ocean. Despite previous advances, much remains to be learned about the dynamics of large shelf-discharging rivers, and their functional differences with deep water-discharging rivers, particularly with respect to the distribution of sediments in the coastal zone. The great Mississippi/Atchafalaya River flood of 2011 provided an excellent opportunity to examine the impacts of a large, shelf-discharging river on the coastal ocean, and the role that event pulses from such rivers play in the delivery of sediment to the inner continental shelf. Vessel-based surveys were conducted on the inner-continental shelf within the Atchafalaya and Mississippi River plume regions, providing in situ measurements of salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, particle size, and current velocity profiles. MODIS satellite images and Be-7 measurements were used to assist in data interpretation. We demonstrate that the Atchafalaya River plume produced intense vertical gradients in temperature, salinity, oxygen and turbidity. This occurred despite the shallow bathymetry of this system and the presence of winds, which alternated between onshore to offshore, and that might have otherwise mixed systems with less freshwater. Sedimentation rates along the inner-continental shelf were about 5-10 times greater than those measured previously during smaller "typical" floods. This large deposit is likely to be preserved, at least in the near term, because sedimentation occurred beyond normal depths of wave reworking and the intense stratification induced by this flood likely reduced mixing at the time of sedimentation. A sediment budget for this system reveals that sediment fluxes to the coastal zone during 2011 were similar to those observed in previous years, suggesting that this system is supply limited, rather than transport limited. As such, we postulate that the major impact of this flood was to change the location of the depocenter of Atchafalaya River sediments, rather than increase the annual flux of sediments to the coastal zone. These findings imply that extreme flood events may not be an ideal analog for coastal restoration along this deltaic coast. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Monitoring Coastal Changes along Damietta Promontory and the Barrier Beach toward Port Said East of the Nile Delta, Egypt	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Monitoring the coastal changes along Nile Delta coast is a very interesting task It provides an opportunity to implement strategic coastal planning and resource potentiality. Studying sequential periods of thematic mapper (TM) satellite, SPOT, and Egysat-1 images covering the periods from 1973, 1984, 1987, 1991, 2003, 2007, to 2011 for the coastal strip between Damietta and Port Said helps us understand the behavior of this coast in terms of physical and human processes. Human processes are apparently reflected in several faces of erosion/accretion with consequent shoreline changes. The resulting rates and forms of coastal change are unbelievable and unexpected. Average rates of shoreline change from -35 m/y to 40 m/y were measured from the satellites and verified from the ground depending on the implemented protection measures and shoreline orientation in relation to marine processes. We divided the studied coastal strip accordingly into four major sectors. The long sector (sector 4) between Damietta and Port Said (45 km length) is studied through four stations carefully selected in early studies taking into consideration the same processes and the position of newly constructed oil and gas facilities. After the construction of a seawall east of the Damietta branch outlet, Damietta spit shows considerable changes. New areas of erosion and accretion have developed with average rates of -61.45 m/y and 94.82 m/y, respectively, and SE migration of 78.3 m/y. Managing coastal development and reviewing the strategy of constructing oil and gas facilities along the Damietta Port Said barrier beach are very important tasks. This coast is very narrow, threatened by wave storms, and, most significantly, it is eroding (-18.7 m/y at Station 1 and -9.5 m/y at Station 3). The presence of such facilities may also accelerate the subsidence of this narrow coast. At the same time several promising and ambitious projects suitable for this coastal environment are waiting for investors; one of these projects concerns the triangle of Damietta spit.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SEP	2014	30	5					993	1005		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12-00112.1								WOS:000342967700011

An interdisciplinary team of physical and social scientists, coastal restoration managers, and fishers/resource harvesters of affected coastal Louisiana communities collaborated on this study, with the goal of enhancing restoration decision making by engaging local ecosystem knowledge holders in the process. Together they investigated the feasibility and benefits of integrating the traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of a coastal population with geospatial technology and scientific data sets to assess how the resulting knowledge might inform project planning and implementation for coastal restoration. The primary goal was to provide coastal resource managers with a more comprehensive and transferrable method of assessing localized stakeholder priorities and translating that information into a format compatible with or comparable to products of existing coastal restoration decision-support tools for Louisiana. Through the Sci-TEK process, TEK is recorded in a natural, egalitarian setting and is converted into geographic information system (GIS) models that can facilitate incorporation into the existing restoration-planning process. This is achieved by using remote sensing, science-based data sets, and GIS to produce mapping products that represent the local fishers' and harvesters' TEK. The collaborative team developed a method for effective stakeholder engagement and a process for producing mapping products to aid in restoration location prioritization using information derived and prioritized with TEK. The current model of engagement via public meetings can generate extensive transcripts of public opinion, but it is limited in terms of scope and stakeholder representation. The information obtained with this model is also difficult to incorporate into the scientific toolbox used to make decisions about restoration. By mapping TEK we translated this knowledge into a usable data set layer that incorporates quality control and can be confidently used in combination with existing data sets. Moreover the researchers used the stakeholder engagement process to help address the general lack of understanding by physical scientists and managers/decision makers of the value of TEK, and to illustrate how this participatory process helps to bridge the communication gap that typically exists between scientists and traditional knowledge holders.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SEP	2014	30	5					1081	1099		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-13-00214.1								WOS:000342967700019

The Gallinazo Group (100 B.C. AD. 700) was an early city home to a population of between 10,000 and 14,400 people living in a network of agglutinated houses, plazas, public buildings, and alleyways. In 2008, detailed analysis of the site was undertaken, integrating traditional excavation techniques, soil coring, magnetometry, and ground-penetrating radar to gain a better understanding of the urban morphology of the site. The results of this fieldwork were extremely successful, with large areas of the urban layout being mapped in great detail.

Based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on-board aqua platform (MODIS Aqua) data andsynoptic observations in the Red Sea, Chl a varies from north to south, with the northern part appearing to be oligotrophic. This is likely due to the absence of strong mixing and low nutrient intrusion in comparison to the southern part during winter. In the Gulf of Aden, the emergence of upwelling cell is clearly evident along the coast of Yemen, and is only distinct from the summer-autumn seasons. Most notable is the pulsating nature of the upwelling, with warm and cold events clearly distinguished with phytoplankton response to this physical forcing also evident. The phytoplankton biomass distribution varies considerably between the two regions of study. In both study areas, water temperature and prevailing winds control nutrient concentrations.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				SEP	2014	33	9					93	99		10.1007/s13131-014-0527-1								WOS:000341334500011						
J	Khan, SD; Huang, Z; Karacay, A				Khan, Shuhab D.; Huang, Zheng; Karacay, Ayca			Study of ground subsidence in northwest Harris county using GPS, LiDAR, and InSAR techniques	NATURAL HAZARDS												Subsidence has been affecting many cities around the world, such as Nagoya (Japan), Venice (Italy), San Joaquin Valley and Long Beach (California), and Houston (Texas). This phenomenon can be caused by natural processes and/or human activities, including but not limited to carbonate dissolution, extraction of material from mines, soil compaction, and fluid withdrawal. Surface deformation has been an ongoing problem in the Houston Metropolitan area because of the city's location in a passive margin where faulting and subsidence are common. Most of the previous studies attributed the causes of the surface deformation to four major mechanisms: faulting, soil compaction, salt tectonics, and fluid withdrawal (groundwater withdrawal and hydrocarbon extraction). This work assessed the surface deformation in the greater Houston area and their possible relationship with fluid withdrawal. To achieve this goal, data from three complimentary remote sensing techniques Global Positioning System (GPS), Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar were used. GPS rates for the last 17 years show a change in surface deformation patterns. High rates of subsidence in the northwestern areas (up to similar to 4 cm/year) and signs of uplift in the southeast are observed (up to 2 mm\year). High rates of subsidence appear to be decreasing. Contrary to previous studies in which the location of subsidence appeared to be expanding toward the northwest, current results show that the area of subsidence is shrinking and migrating toward the northeast. Digital elevation model generated from airborne LiDAR, revealed changes between salt domes and their surrounding areas. The persistent scatterer interferometry was performed using twenty-five (25) European remote sensing-1/2 scenes. Rates of change in groundwater level and hydrocarbon production were calculated using data from 261 observation wells and 658 hydrocarbon wells. A water level decline of 4 m/year was found in area of highest subsidence, this area also show similar to 70 million m(3)/year of hydrocarbon extraction. This study found strong correlation between fluid withdrawals and subsidence. Therefore, both groundwater and hydrocarbon withdrawal in northwest Harris County are considered to be the major drivers of the surface deformation.																	0921-030X	1573-0840				SEP	2014	73	3					1143	1173		10.1007/s11069-014-1067-x								WOS:000340492700001						
J	Shaji, J				Shaji, J.			Coastal sensitivity assessment for Thiruvananthapuram, west coast of India	NATURAL HAZARDS												The densely populated coastline of Thiruvananthapuram district of Kerala, along the southwest coast of India, is sensitive to sea surge and severe coastal erosion. The December 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami had inundated several parts of this coastal zone, indicating nature of sensitivity. The present study is an attempt to develop a coastal sensitivity index (CSI) for Thiruvananthapuram coast within the framework of coastal sediment cells. Seven variables, namely (a) coastal slope, (b) geomorphology, (c) shoreline change, (d) mean sea-level rise, (e) nearshore slope, (f) significant wave height and (g) mean tide range, were adopted in calculation of CSI (the square root of the product of the ranked variables divided by the number of variables). Remote sensing data, topographic maps supported by field work and data from numerical models are used in geographic information system environment to generate CS index for each kilometer segment of this 76-km coastline. This study reveals that 72 % of the Thiruvananthapuram coastline falls in the high sensitive category. This exercise, first of its kind for Kerala coast will be useful for disaster mitigation and management.																	0921-030X	1573-0840				SEP	2014	73	3					1369	1392		10.1007/s11069-014-1139-y								WOS:000340492700012

Coscinodiscus radiatus, Chaetoceros lorenzianus and the pennate diatom Thalassiothrix frauenfeldii was investigated in the context of its impact on phytoplankton and microzooplankton (the loricate ciliate tintinnids) in the coastal regions of Sagar Island, the western part of Sundarban mangrove wetland, India. Both number (15-18 species) and cell densities (12.3 x 10(3) cells l(-1) to 11.4 x 10(5) cells l(-1)) of phytoplankton species increased during peak bloom phase, exhibiting moderately high species diversity (H' = 2.86), richness (R' = 6.38) and evenness (E' = 0.80). The diatom bloom, which existed for a week, had a negative impact on the tintinnid community in terms of drastic changes in species diversity index (1.09-0.004) and population density (582.5 x 10(3) to 50 x 10(3) ind m(-3)). The bloom is suggested to have been driven by the aquaculture activities and river effluents resulting high nutrient concentrations in this region. An attempt has been made to correlate the satellite remote sensing-derived information to the bloom conditions. MODIS-Aqua derived chlorophyll maps have been interpreted. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Pickens, BA; King, SL				Pickens, Bradley A.; King, Sammy L.			Linking multi-temporal satellite imagery to coastal wetland dynamics and bird distribution	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Ecosystems are characterized by dynamic ecological processes, such as flooding and fires, but spatial models are often limited to a single measurement in time. The characterization of direct, fine-scale processes affecting animals is potentially valuable for management applications, but these are difficult to quantify over broad extents. Direct predictors are also expected to improve transferability of models beyond the area of study. Here, we investigated the ability of non-static and multi-temporal habitat characteristics to predict marsh bird distributions, while testing model generality and transferability between two coastal habitats. Distribution models were developed for king rail (Rallus elegans), common gallinule (Gallinula galeata), least bittern (Ixobrychus exilis), and purple gallinule (Porphyrio martinica) in fresh and intermediate marsh types in the northern Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Texas, USA. For model development, repeated point count surveys of marsh birds were conducted from 2009 to 2011. Landsat satellite imagery was used to quantify both annual conditions and cumulative, multi-temporal habitat characteristics. We used multivariate adaptive regression splines to quantify bird-habitat relationships for fresh, intermediate, and combined marsh habitats. Multi-temporal habitat characteristics ranked as more important than single-date characteristics, as temporary water was most influential in six of eight models. Predictive power was greater for marsh type-specific models compared to general models and model transferability was poor. Birds in fresh marsh selected for annual habitat characterizations, while birds in intermediate marsh selected for cumulative wetness and heterogeneity. Our findings emphasize that dynamic ecological processes can affect species distribution and species-habitat relationships may differ with dominant landscape characteristics. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Pu, RL; Bell, S; Meyer, C				Pu, Ruiliang; Bell, Susan; Meyer, Cynthia			Mapping and assessing seagrass bed changes in Central Florida's west coast using multitemporal Landsat TM imagery	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Some seagrass meadows in coastal shallow waters have displayed large scale changes in seagrass spatial extent and hurricanes and/or tropical storms have been suggested as factors responsible for reduction in coverage. Taking advantage of the incidence of three tropical storms passing near a study site along the central west Florida coast within a two-month period in 2004, we evaluated whether satellite remote sensing techniques (Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery) are useful for assessing dynamics of seagrass (=submerged aquatic vegetation: SAV) cover/abundance in response to these multiple disturbances. We also examined whether an image preprocessing procedure, which included water column correction, applied to the Landsat TM images could further improve the classification and mapping of detailed SAV coverage. We compared a historical set of Landsat TM images, acquired in Fall 2003 and Fall and late Summer 2005, which were processed to classify %SAV cover into five classes using a maximum likelihood classifier. Importantly, our experimental results demonstrated that the application of the image preprocessing procedures led to an overall accuracy 2-14% improvement in SAV classification due to water column correction compared to that currently reported in the literature when similar Landsat TM data are utilized. Based upon the classification results mapped from the TM images and as well as a similar classification of SAV interpreted from aerial photographs collected before and after the passage of these same storms, SAV coverage over the study areas was found to increase about 6% (integrating SAV losses and gains) by 2005/2006 in comparison to cover levels present prior to the repeated storm activity. We conclude that heavy rains during 2004 along with physical disturbance from gale force winds from the tropical storms/hurricanes did not produce any SAV bed loss at the study site that was sustained for more than one year after multiple storm passage.

First, the authors identified the extent of tsunami inundation zone by field measurement and satellite remote sensing. A specific index for optical satellite images was applied for the extraction of tsunami inland penetration calibrated with the ground truth data (field survey data). Second, an integrated investigation of field measurement and aerial photo and video inspections with spatial information sciences was performed to understand the hydrodynamic aspect of tsunami inland penetration with a form of tsunami flow velocity and hydrodynamic force, and the preliminary results lead to new understandings of structural vulnerability against the 2011 tsunami with a form of tsunami fragility curve and an implication for land use management and relocation planning to reconstruct resilient coastal communities.

The Coleroon river flow and its effect on the Pichavaram mangrove ecosystem	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												The fresh water reaching an estuary fluctuates on many scales and the fluctuation in the flow over a time period is also due to the anthropogenic activities like construction of dams, diversions and upstream withdrawals. These fluctuations may have profound effects on the estuarine ecosystem, which usually has remarkable biological productivity and diversity. A desktop analysis is carried out by compiling historical records of discharge and other hydrological information to study the dynamics of the river Coleroon, a distributary of the Cauvery River, Tamil Nadu, India. Remote sensing analysis was carried out on images ranging from the years 1977 to 2008 and the changes in the Pichavaram mangrove areas adjoining the Coleroon were studied by comparing the results with the freshwater flow into the ecosystem. Environmental flow analysis indicates that the minimum flow needed for a healthy mangrove system in Pichavaram is 750.75 cumecs; however, this is currently achieved only 12 % of the time. The reduction in freshwater flow over the years has resulted in loss of species diversity and degradation of the mangroves; this needs to be corrected immediately to conserve the Pichavaram mangrove ecosystem.

Observations and modeling of surf zone transverse finger bars at the Gold Coast, Australia	OCEAN DYNAMICS												The occurrence and characteristics of transverse finger bars at Surfers Paradise (Gold Coast, Australia) have been quantified with 4 years of time-exposure video images. These bars are attached to the inner terrace and have an oblique orientation with respect to the coastline. They are observed during 24 % of the study period, in patches up to 15 bars, with an average lifetime of 5 days and a mean wavelength of 32 m. The bars are observed during obliquely incident waves of intermediate heights. Bar crests typically point toward the incoming wave direction, i.e., they are up-current oriented. The most frequent beach state when bars are present (43 % of the time) is a rhythmic low-tide terrace and an undulating outer bar. A morphodynamic model, which describes the feedback between waves, currents, and bed evolution, has been applied to study the mechanisms for finger bar formation. Realistic positive feedback leading to the formation of the observed bars only occurs if the sediment resuspension due to roller-induced turbulence is included. This causes the depth-averaged sediment concentration to decrease in the seaward direction, enhancing the convergence of sediment transport in the offshore-directed flow perturbations that occur over the up-current bars. The longshore current strength also plays an important role; the offshore root-mean-square wave height and angle must be larger than some critical values (0.5 m and 20(a similar to), respectively, at 18-m depth). Model-data comparison indicates that the modeled bar shape characteristics (up-current orientation) and the wave conditions leading to the bar formation agree with data, while the modeled wavelengths and migration rates are larger than the observed ones. The discrepancies might be because in the model we neglect the influence of the large-scale beach configuration.				de Swart, Huib/A-3771-2010; Ribas, Francesca/B-2955-2015; Calvete Manrique, Daniel/B-9593-2009	Ribas, Francesca/0000-0003-4701-5982; Calvete Manrique, Daniel/0000-0002-5402-5137												1616-7341	1616-7228				AUG	2014	64	8					1193	1207		10.1007/s10236-014-0719-4								WOS:000340361100008

In Canada, the National Aerial Surveillance Program (NASP) extensively monitors and collects information on oily discharges using remote sensing devices. Despite the availability of data from NASP and other surveillance programs internationally, there is a paucity of spatial analyses of oil pollution patterns, particularly in their association with human marine pursuits. The objective of this paper is to analyze the association between observed oily discharges and human maritime activities in the Canadian Pacific Ocean. This study used Poisson regression to spatially model detected oily discharges with marine traffic, coastal facilities and proximity to coast. Further, it developed localized ('regional') models to address spatial heterogeneity. The models identify recreational activities, passenger traffic, commercial traffic, fisheries, and proximity to the coast as predictors of observed oily discharges. The regional models yield more accurate and reliable estimates of local associations, and identify more parsimonious sets of predictors for each region. By identifying and accounting for human activities most associated with oily discharge patterns, the models developed in this study could be used to estimate pollution rates in areas with less surveillance, and identify areas where NASP coverage may need to be increased. Spatially explicit rates estimated by these models can be used to monitor the effectiveness of programs and policy aimed at reducing discharge rates of oily pollution. This study can be used as a model approach for extending the analysis to the other coasts of Canada, using available NASP data. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Delineation of Coastal Marsh Types Along the Central Texas Coast	WETLANDS												Tidally influenced wetlands along the Texas coast provide important habitat for wintering waterfowl and myriad other fish and wildlife species. Because habitat values may differ among marsh salinity zones (e.g., waterfowl food resources and use are greatest in fresh and intermediate marsh), the spatial distribution of marsh types is important for understanding the capacity of coastal landscapes to support waterfowl and other wildlife populations and informing coastal restoration priorities. Additionally, documenting spatial patterns of coastal marsh types is necessary for projecting future landscape change and examining impacts of environmental processes (e.g., tropical storms, sea level rise). We used a helicopter-based vegetation survey and remotely sensed imagery to delineate marsh types along the central Texas coast into four categories: fresh, intermediate, brackish, and saline. We recorded vegetation composition at 342 sample points and combined these data with Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery to perform a supervised classification of marsh types throughout our 122,995 ha survey area. Our initial coarse classification delineating coastal marsh from other habitat types was 92 % accurate. Intermediate, brackish, and saline marsh each comprised about 30 % of the coastal marsh in our study area. Freshwater marsh comprised < 1 % and may have been underrepresented within the coastal zone due to placement of the inland boundary of our study area. Our final classification of marsh types was 77.2 % accurate which will provide a framework for further delineation efforts. We offer several considerations for future coastal marsh delineation efforts along the Texas coast.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				AUG	2014	34	4					653	660		10.1007/s13157-014-0531-4								WOS:000340097600003

Based on maps generated by the National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity (CONABIO for its Spanish acronym), three land cover change indicators were estimated: net change, stability of location, and stability of residence. Analyses were made at national and regional (Northern Pacific, Central Pacific, Southern Pacific, Gulf of Mexico, and Yucatan Peninsula) scales, and for the 17 states presenting mangroves. At the national level during the studied period we observed a 10 % net loss of mangrove. At the state level, 13 states lost area, three gained area, and one showed no change in mangrove cover. According to the indicators of location stability and residence stability, the lowest values were recorded in four states within the Pacific Ocean coast (Jalisco, Colima, Guerrero, and Oaxaca), while the highest values corresponded to two states of the Gulf of Mexico (Tamaulipas and Tabasco). Many of the changes in mangrove cover we detected were attributed to crop and animal husbandry activities, and to anthropic infrastructure.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				AUG	2014	34	4					747	758		10.1007/s13157-014-0539-9								WOS:000340097600011

These sensors, developed for ocean remote sensing, provide an additional source of information for ship detection and tracking, by virtue of their over-the-horizon coverage capability and continuous-time mode of operation. Unfortunately, they exhibit many shortcomings that need to be taken into account, such as poor range and azimuth resolution, high nonlinearity, and significant presence of clutter. In this paper, radar detection, multi-target tracking, and data fusion (DF) techniques are applied to experimental data collected during an HF-radar experiment, which took place between May and December 2009 on the Ligurian coast of the Mediterranean Sea. The system performance is defined in terms of time on target (ToT), false alarm rate (FAR), track fragmentation, and accuracy. A full statistical characterization is provided using one month of data. The effectiveness of the tracking and DF procedures is shown in comparison to the radar detection algorithm. In particular, the detector's FAR is reduced by one order of magnitude. Improvements, using the DF of the two radars, are also reported in terms of ToT as well as accuracy.

Debris-flow dominance of alluvial fans masked by runoff reworking and weathering	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Arid alluvial fan aggradation is highly episodic and fans often comprise active and inactive sectors. Hence the morphology and texture of fan surfaces are partly determined by secondary processes of weathering and erosion in addition to primary processes of aggradation. This introduces considerable uncertainty in the identification of formative processes of terrestrial and Martian fans from aerial and satellite imagery. The objectives of this study are (i) to develop a model to describe the sedimentological and morphological evolution of inactive fan surfaces in arid settings, and (ii) to assess the relative importance of primary processes of aggradation and secondary processes of weathering and reworking for surface morphology and sedimentology and for the stratigraphic record. We studied an alluvial fan characterized by a recently active sector and a long-abandoned, inactive sector along the coast of the hyperarid Atacama Desert. Here, rates of primary geomorphic activity are exceptionally low because of extreme aridity, while weathering rates are relatively high because of the effects of coastal fogs. Longterm processes of fan aggradation and reworking were determined through sedimentological facies analysis of stratigraphic sections. Ground surveys for textural and morphological patterns at the fan surface were integrated with remote-sensing by an Unmanned Airborne Vehicle (UAV). Discharges and sediment-transport capacities were calculated to estimate the efficiency of secondary runoff in reshaping the inactive fan sector. Stratigraphic sections reveal that the fan was dominantly aggraded by debris flows, whereas surface morphology is dominated by debris-flow signatures in the active sector and by weathering and runoff on the inactive sector. On the latter, rapid particle breakdown prevents the formation of a coarse desert pavement. Furthermore, relatively frequent local runoff events erode proximal debris-flow channels on the inactive sector to form local lag deposits and accumulate fine sediment in low-gradient distal channels, forming a well-developed drainage pattern that would suggest a runoff origin from aerial images. Nevertheless, reworking is very superficial and barely preserved in the stratigraphic record. This implies that fans on Earth and Mars that formed dominantly by sporadic mass flows may be masked by a surface morphology related to other processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It is located in the northeast portion of the province of Cordoba. The maximum water level is the topic of this work, which is defined using the combined effect of the historical maximum water level measured on the coast and the maximum storm elevation (considering both wind and waves) estimated for recurrences of 25, 50 and 100 years. The analysis of the series of water levels made it possible to determine the historical maximum level measured in the lagoon. This value was recorded in 2003 as a height of 71.9 meters above sea level (masl). The maximum storm level is defined by both the action of the wind and waves generated by the storm. Specific software and empirical formulas were used to obtain these estimates. To propagate the waves on the beach profile, the bathymetry of the lagoon was rebuilt using remote sensing techniques. To this end, terrain elevation data were used from space surveys derived from radar and from thematic maps based on Landsat images with the digital extraction of water contours. The results indicate that the maximum flood that could occur in Laguna Mar Chiquita, on the southern coast of the system, is 73.5 masl with a recurrence of 100 years. It is important to conduct this analysis for systems with large fluctuations in water levels, such as the one presented here.																	0187-8336	2007-2422				JUL-AUG	2014	5	4					119	133										WOS:000344438300007

Here, we present a method for calculating WIV in late Pleistocene Yedoma deposits and Holocene thermokarst basin deposits at four study areas in Siberia and Alaska. Ice-wedge polygons and thermokarst mound (baydzherakh) patterns were mapped on different landscape units using very high-resolution (0.5 m/pixel) satellite imagery (WorldView-1 and GeoEye-1). In a geographic information system (GIS) environment, Thiessen polygons were automatically created to reconstruct relict ice-wedge polygonal networks, and field and published data on ice-wedge dimensions were used to generate three-dimensional subsurface models that distinguish between epi- and syngenetic ice-wedge geometry. The results reveal significant variations in WIV between the study sites and within certain terrain units. Calculated maximum WIV ranges from 31.4 to 63.2 vol% for Yedoma deposits and from 6.6 to 13.2 vol% for thermokarst basin deposits. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In this study, we zoned 32 provinces of China into five surface water deficiency levels based on surface water deficit index derived from the Chinese meteorological satellite FY-2C images. The result shows that China is facing serious water shortage crisis with only 15.44% of total area without water deficiency, which is located in the south and southeast coast. More than 60% of total area of China suffered from severe or extremely water deficiency, which are mainly distributed in western and northern regions. Jingjinji area (namely Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei province), which is a special region with high amount of gross domestic product and relative abundant water resources, is suffering from severe water deficiency. It revealed that water resources were interacted with regional development and water management should consider local conditions. To Jingjinji area, water management should focus on adjustment of industrial structure, urban expansion control and scientific water resources allocation. In general, the surface water deficit index based water deficiency zoning will be of significant value to be applied in water resources management at regional scales.																	0097-8078	1608-344X				JUL	2014	41	4					372	378		10.1134/S0097807814040150								WOS:000341762800003

Large-scale bloom of Akashiwo sanguinea in the Northern California current system in 2009	HARMFUL ALGAE												Significant seabird mortality on the Oregon (OR) and Washington (WA) coast in 2009 has been attributed to a massive bloom of the dinoflagellate Akashiwo sanguinea (K. Hirasaka) G. Hansen & O. Moestrup. Initial, albeit limited, observations suggested this bloom began in WA and reached OR waters through southward transport. Here, we explore a combination of remote sensing products and an exceptional latitudinal dataset of plankton counts collected in the surfzone and offshore in OR and WA coastal waters. Records of satellite ocean color for this period support the new finding that blooms were concurrent in OR and WA waters, with no evidence for latitudinal propagation as had been previously suggested. Plankton analyses further indicate that there was a rapid and synchronized increase of A. sanguinea between late August and mid-September of 2009 along wide swaths of the OR and WA coasts. Bloom onset occurred during a prolonged quiescent and warm period in late August-early September, near the end of the March-October upwelling phase. An upwelling event in October likely contributed to foam production through vertical mixing of A. sanguinea rich waters. Bloom intensity peaked earlier and at higher levels in WA waters as compared to OR with cell concentrations exceeding 1.5 x 10(6) cells L-1 (WA) and similar to 350,000 cells L-1 (OR). In OR samples, A. sanguinea cells comprised upwards of 90% of dinoflagellate cell counts and similar to 30% of total phytoplankton cells. At some locations, A. sanguinea persisted well into November-December of 2009, during which time satellite sea surface temperature records indicated anomalously warm surface waters (up to similar to 5 degrees C greater than climatological means). Taken together, the data reveal a HAB event of a magnitude unprecedented in over a decade of observations. We hypothesize that these blooms originated from either a cryptic cyst bed and/or a pelagic seed bank of viable vegetative cells. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We determined land use changes in salty-alkali areas and changes in biological habitats by using remote sensing techniques and geographic information systems (GIS). We determined temporal changes in different types of land by using 1/20,000 scaled aerial photos of the research area from 1963 and 1996 and Quickbird satellite images with 61-cm resolution from 2005 and 2010. We noted existing biological changes in the same period by associating them with different land use types. At the end of the research, we studied changes to biological habitats in wetlands in coastal Gediz Delta due to the pressures of urban and industrial settlements and agricultural areas. According to the data, between 1963 and 2010 there was a similar to 84.40% increase in urban-industrial settlements, a similar to 13.74% increase in agricultural areas, and a similar to 65.59% increase in saltpan areas. On the other hand, there was a similar to 37.65% decrease in habitat and nutrition areas of biological variations (bird habitat, wetland flora, and fauna), a similar to 41.54% decrease in coastal-sand dune-salty alkali areas, and a similar to 30.63% decrease in swamp and wetland areas. As a result of these changes, numerous species in the wetlands have died or decreased.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JUL	2014	30	4					756	764		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12-00011.1								WOS:000339366800009

This study aimed to develop a time-series model of the N-T relationship from automated, continuous hourly observations over two years on the coast of Halifax, Canada. The model demonstrated time-series variability of the N-T relationship at a coastal station on the Nova Scotia Shelf, with adjusted R-2=0.999 4 and RMSE=0.025 7. The maximum residual value was 0.077. The annual temperature variations described a sine curve, and daily, weekly, and monthly variations fluctuated within the normal ranges, controlled by the local climate. The annual variation of nitrate concentration formed nearly a sine curve. Heavy or long-lasting rainfall increased nitrate concentration by 4 to 30-fold in 24 h, and then the increased nitrogen was quickly depleted by phytoplankton growth in 10 to 48 h. In general, biological activity was a key factor in causing nitrate concentration change, dependent mainly on seawater temperature. The power function of the N-T relationship observed in our study area could be used to quickly estimate sea surface nitrate concentration, in combination with temperature data obtained by remote sensing.																	0254-4059	1993-5005				JUL	2014	32	4					879	885		10.1007/s00343-014-3136-0								WOS:000339046200015

The first SPM climatology over this region is provided and the SPM temporal variation schemes (irregular variability, seasonal variability, and long term trend) are described using the Census-X-11 time series decomposition method. The different spatio-temporal patterns are then analyzed with regard to regional oceanographic and hydrologic conditions. The origin of the processes controlling the seasonality of the Mekong Delta plume is characterized. The increase of turbidity observed from June to December, starts with the Mekong sediment inputs which are maximum during the summer monsoon (the water discharge reaches its maximum in September/October). While the Mekong water discharge decreases, the concentration of suspended sediment keeps increasing in coastal waters during the following two/three months (November to January). This increase is explained by resuspension effects occurring in the shallow coastal areas. Due to higher wave energy and oblique orientation of the waves breaking near the coast, the winter monsoon triggers a high level of agitation and high value of resuspended material concentration which are submitted to a longshore current directed towards the South-West Deposition (in front of the Delta) and erosion (northern and southern areas of the delta) areas are identified in good agreement with recent results obtained from a prognostic model. While the temporal variability is strongly dominated by the seasonal component, a long term trend of about -5% SPM concentration per year is observed in the pro-delta area and is attributed to the decrease of the Mekong river sediment output during the high flow season.

J	Liu, CY; Chao, JL; Gu, W; Li, LT; Xu, YJ				Liu Chengyu; Chao Jinlong; Gu Wei; Li Lantao; Xu Yingjun			On the surface roughness characteristics of the land fast sea-ice in the Bohai Sea	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												The surface roughness characteristics (e. g., height and slope) of sea ice are critical for determining the parameters of an electromagnetic scattering, a surface emission and a surface drag coefficients. It is also important in identifying various ice types, retrieval ice thickness, surface temperature and drag coefficients from remote sensing data. The point clouds (a set of points which are usually defined by X, Y, and Z coordinates that represents the external surface of an object on earth) of land fast ice in five in situ sites in the eastern coast Bohai Sea were measured using a laser scanner-Trimble GX during 2011-2012 winter season. Two hundred and fifty profiles selected from the point clouds of different samples have been used to calculate the height root mean square, height skewness, height kurtosis, slope root mean square, slope skewness and slope kurtosis of them. The root mean square of the height, the root mean square of the slope and the correlation length are about 0.090, 0.075 and 11.74 m, respectively. The heights of 150 profiles in three sites manifest the Gaussian distribution and the slopes of total 250 profiles distributed exponentially. In addition, the fractal dimension and power spectral density profiles were calculated. The results show that the fractal dimension of land fast ice in the Bohai Sea is about 1.132. The power spectral densities of 250 profiles can be expressed through an exponential autocorrelation function.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				JUL	2014	33	7					97	106		10.1007/s13131-014-0509-3								WOS:000338098400012

High-resolution X-Band radar measurements of currents, bathymetry and sea state in highly inhomogeneous coastal areas	OCEAN DYNAMICS												In this paper, high-resolution wave, current and water depth fields derived by marine X-Band radar are presented for a coastal region of extreme tidal currents in the presence of inhomogeneous bathymetry at the south coast of New Zealand's North Island. The current and water depth information for the presented location covers an area of approximately 13 km(2) with a spatial resolution of 225 m and an update rate of 3 min. The sea state data provides a spatial representation of coastal effects like wave shoaling and refraction forced by bathymetry and current interaction. The near-surface current measurements about 3 km off the coast show expected tidal current pattern with maximum northwest/southeast current of 1.5-2 m/s alongshore. This is in agreement with currents from the RiCOM hydrodynamic model. The spatial resolution of the observed current field exhibits in addition small-scale current features caused by the influence of the local bathymetry. These data demonstrate the insight to be gained in complex, high-energy coastal situations through the use of high-resolution remote sensing techniques.

While remote sensing has been applied to quantify the spatial distribution of such macroalgae, it is generally not used for their monitoring. We examined the day-to-day and seasonal dynamics of macroalgal cover on a sandy intertidal flat using visible and near-infrared images from a time-lapse camera mounted on a tower. Benthic algae were identified using supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised classification techniques, validated with monthly ground-truthing over one year. A supervised classification (based on maximum likelihood, using training areas identified in the field) performed best in discriminating between sediment, benthic diatom films and macroalgae, with highest spectral separability between macroalgae and diatoms in spring/summer. An automated unsupervised classification (based on the Normalised Differential Vegetation Index NDVI) allowed detection of daily changes in macroalgal coverage without the need for calibration. This method showed a bloom of macroalgae (filamentous green algae, Ulva sp.) in summer with >60% cover, but with pronounced superimposed day-to-day variation in cover. Waves were a major factor in regulating macroalgal cover, but regrowth of the thalli after a summer storm was fast (2 weeks). Images and in situ data demonstrated that the protruding tubes of the polychaete Lanice conchilega facilitated both settlement (anchorage) and survival (resistance to waves) of the macroalgae. Thus, high-frequency, high resolution images revealed the mechanisms for regulating the dynamics in cover of the macroalgae and for their spatial structuring. Ramifications for the mode, timing, frequency and evaluation of monitoring macroalgae by field and remote sensing surveys are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Monitoring of ocean surface algal blooms in coastal and oceanic waters around India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) sensor MODIS-Aqua provides an important tool for reliable observations of the changing ocean surface algal bloom paradigms in coastal and oceanic waters around India. A time series of the MODIS-Aqua-derived OSABI (ocean surface algal bloom index) and its seasonal composite images report new information and comprehensive pictures of these blooms and their evolution stages in a wide variety of events occurred at different times of the years from 2003 to 2011, providing the first large area survey of such phenomena around India. For most of the years, the results show a strong seasonal pattern of surface algal blooms elucidated by certain physical and meteorological conditions. The extent of these blooms reaches a maximum in winter (November-February) and a minimum in summer (June-September), especially in the northern Arabian Sea. Their spatial distribution and retention period are also significantly increased in the recent years. The increased spatial distribution and intensity of these blooms in the northern Arabian Sea in winter are likely caused by enhanced cooling, increased convective mixing, favorable winds, and atmospheric deposition of the mineral aerosols (from surrounding deserts) of the post-southwest monsoon period. The southward Oman coastal current and southwestward winds become apparently responsible for their extension up to the central Arabian Sea. Strong upwelling along this coast further triggers their initiation and growth. Though there is a warming condition associated with increased sea surface height anomalies along the coasts of India and Sri Lanka in winter, surface algal bloom patches are still persistent along these coasts due to northeast monsoonal winds, enhanced precipitation, and subsequent nutrient enrichment in these areas. The occurrence of the surface algal blooms in the northern Bay of Bengal coincides with a region of the well-known Ganges-Brahmaputra Estuarine Frontal (GBEF) system, which increases supply of nutrients in addition to the land-derived inputs triggering surface algal blooms in this region. Low density (initiation stage) of such blooms observed in clear oceanic waters southeast and northeast of Sri Lanka may be caused by the vertical mixing processes (strong monsoonal winds) and the occurrence of Indian Ocean Dipole events. Findings based on the analyses of time series satellite data indicate that the new information on surface algal blooms will have important bearing on regional fisheries, ecosystem and environmental studies, and implications of climate change scenarios.

The flux significance for the arid vicinity around the Dead Sea is decisive not only for a sustainable management in terms of water availability for future generations but also for the resilience of the unique ecosystems along its coast. Coping with different challenges interdisciplinary methods like (i) hydrogeochemical fingerprinting, (ii) satellite and airborne-based thermal remote sensing, (iii) direct measurement with gauging station in ephemeral wadis and a first multilateral gauging station at the river Jordan, (iv) hydro-bio-geochemical approach at submarine and shore springs along the Dead Sea and (v) hydro(geo)logical modelling contributed to the overall aim. As primary results, we deduce that the following: (i) Within the drainage basins of the Dead Sea, the total mean annual precipitation amounts to 300 mm a(-1) west and to 179 mm a(-1) east of the lake, respectively. (ii) The total mean annual runoff volumes from side wadis (except the Jordan River) entering the Dead Sea is approximately 58-66 x 10(6) m(3) a(-1) (western wadis: 7-15 x 10(6) m(3) a(-1); eastern wadis: 51 x 10(6) m(3) a(-1)). (iii) The modelled groundwater discharge from the upper Cretaceous aquifers in both flanks of the Dead Sea towards the lake amounts to 177 x 106 m(3) a(-1). (iv) An unexpected abundance of life in submarine springs exists, which in turn explains microbial moderated geo-bio-chemical processes in the Dead Sea sediments, affecting the highly variable chemical composition of on- and offshore spring waters. The results of this work show a promising enhancement of describing and modelling the Dead Sea basin as a whole. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Despite the status of marine protected area and World Heritage listing of the GBR, local seagrass meadows are under stress from reduced water quality levels; with reduction in the amount of light available for seagrass photosynthesis defined as the primary cause of seagrass loss throughout the GBR. Methods have been developed to map GBR plume water types by using MODE quasi-true colour (hereafter true colour) images reclassified in function of their dominant colour. These data can be used as an interpretative tool for understanding changes in seagrass meadow health (as defined in this study by the seagrass area and abundance) at different spatial and temporal scales. We tested this method in Cleveland Bay, in the northern GBR, where substantial loss in seagrass area and biomass was detected by annual monitoring from 2007 to 2011. A strong correlation was found between bay-wide seagrass meadow area and biomass and exposure to turbid Primary (sediment-dominated) water type. There was also a strong correlation between the changes of biomass and area of individual meadows and exposure of seagrass ecosystems to Primary water type over the 5-year period. Seagrass meadows were also grouped according to the dominant species within each meadow, irrespective of location within Cleveland Bay. These consolidated community types did not correlate well with the exposure to Primary water type, and this is likely to be due to local environmental conditions with the individual meadows that comprise these groupings. This study proved that remote sensing data provide the synoptic window and repetitivity required to investigate changes in water quality conditions over time. Remote sensing data provide an opportunity to investigate the risk of marine-coastal ecosystems to light limitation due to increased water turbidity when in situ water quality data is not available or is insufficient.

Assessment of shoreline changes along Karnataka coast, India using GIS & Remote sensing techniques	INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES					5th Indian National Conference on Harbour and Ocean Engineering (INCHOE)	FEB 05-07, 2014	CSIR NIO, Goa, INDIA		CSIR NIO			Present analysis revealed that about 70% of the coastline was either stable or accreting in nature, whereas remaining 30% region was experiencing varying magnitude of erosion. Change rate was classified in three categories indicating the accretion, low erosion and high erosion locations. High rate of erosion was observed all along the river mouth of northern side of northern Karnataka Rivers i.e. Kalinadi, Haladi, Sharavati, Swarna etc. While the southern side of the Kalinadi River is noticed with high accretion. Erosion and accretion pattern observed along the coast is influenced mainly by the coastal process and riverine inputs. Short term analysis was also carried out along the Karnataka coast. In Karwar region, the south of Kalinadi River shows accretion during the period of 1989-2000; whereas, the same area shows erosion pattern during the period of 2000-2006. This may be due to variation in coastal processes, land runoff and geomorphologic units influencing the coast. About 168 km of coastline was found to be accreting in nature with an average rate of 1.5 m/yr followed by 71km coastal stretch with mild erosion of an average rate of 1.0 m/yr. It was also observed that the erosion was found in isolated pockets throughout the coast. The variation in river,mouth morphology was quite significant. The present study demonstrates that combined use of satellite imagery and statistical method such as weighted linear regression can be a reliable method for shoreline change analysis.																	0379-5136	0975-1033				JUL	2014	43	7					1286	1291										WOS:000209743200027

Characteristics of annual, seasonal, and diurnal precipitation in the Southeastern United States derived from long-term remotely sensed data	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												The objective of this paper is to investigate long-term inter-annual, seasonal, and diurnal rainfall characteristics in the Southeastern United States. In order to capture precipitation features at high resolution, we use precipitation estimates from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM); the TRMM Precipitation Radar (TPR 2A25: 0.05 degrees Chi 0.05 degrees/daily) and the TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA 3B42: 0.25 degrees Chi 0.25 degrees/3-h) datasets to create a 13-year rainfall climatology. The higher resolution climatology (2A25) displays a greater ability to capture more localized landform precipitation features when compared with 3B42. On an annual basis, the Southeastern US is characterized by a succession of cold and warm precipitation regimes. The cold season is characterized by higher rain intensity West of 82 degrees W (roughly Atlanta, GA) and the warm season is characterized by higher rain intensity over the coastal areas. The cold/warm rainfall regime duality is modulated by local topographic characteristics that prevail along a W-E direction. During the cold season, the, diurnal cycle of precipitation is characterized by a quasi-constant repartition of rain events throughout the day and an absence of land/ocean contrast. On the contrary for summertime there is a strong land/ocean signature with a predominance of late morning/early afternoon (12:00-15:00LST) rainfall over ocean and afternoon/early evening (15:00-18:00LST) precipitation events over land that account for more than 25% of the daily events along the coasts. Differences are observed for the Florida peninsula, where the diurnal cycle displays an afternoon maximum of variable intensity due to sea breeze effects regardless of the season.

Modeling COSMO-SkyMed measurements of precipitating clouds over the sea using simultaneous weather radar observations	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												Several satellite missions employing X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) have been activated to provide high-resolution images of normalized radar cross-sections (NRCS) on land and ocean for numerous applications. Rainfall and wind affect the sea surface roughness and consequently the NRCS from the combined effects of corrugation due to impinging raindrops and surface wind. X-band frequencies are sensitive to precipitation: intense convective cells result in irregularly bright and dark patches in SAR images, masking changes in surface NRCS. Several works have modeled SAR images of intense precipitation over land; less adequately investigated is the precipitation effect over the sea surface. These images are analyzed in this study by modeling both the scattering and attenuation of radiation by hydrometeors in the rain cells and the NRCS surface changes using weather radar precipitation estimates as input. The reconstruction of X-band SAR returns in precipitating clouds is obtained by the joint utilization of volume reflectivity and attenuation, the latter estimated by coupling ground-based radar measurements and an electromagnetic model to predict the sea surface NRCS. Radar signatures of rain cells were investigated using X-band SAR images collected from the COSMO-SkyMed constellation of the Italian Space Agency. Two case studies were analyzed. The first occurred over the sea off the coast of Louisiana (USA) in summer 2010 with COSMO-SkyMed (CSK (R)) ScanSar mode monitoring of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Simultaneously, the NEXRAD S-band Doppler radar (KLIX) located in New Orleans was scanning the same portion of ocean. The second case study occurred in Liguria (Italy) on November 4, 2011, during an extraordinary flood event. The same events were observed by the Bric della Croce C-band dual polarization radar located close to Turin (Italy). The polarimetric capability of the ground radars utilized allows discrimination of the composition of the precipitation volume, in particular distinguishing ice from rain. Results shows that for space-borne SAR at X-band, effects due to precipitation on water surfaces can be modeled using coincident ground-based weather radar measurements. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Chen, P; Pan, DL; Mao, ZH				Chen, Peng; Pan, Delu; Mao, Zhihua			Fluorescence measured using a field-portable laser fluorometer as a proxy for CDOM absorption	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The colored fraction of dissolved organic matter, CDOM, directly influences water optical properties and spectral quality, playing an important role in aquatic ecosystems, optical remote sensing and carbon circulation in the sea. Measuring in situ CDOM absorption coefficient, however, is difficult because it requires prefiltration of water samples. A field-portable laser fluorometer for fast acquisition of in situ CDOM fluorescence data without sample filtering was developed. Using the instrument in the Yangtze River estuary, the East China Sea coast, the West Lake, and the Qiandao Lake, good estimates of CDOM absorption were obtained from in situ fluorescence measurements. High correlation (r = 0.94) was observed between CDOM absorption coefficient and fluorescence normalized to Raman scattering in diverse water types. Comparison of different methods for measuring CDOM fluorescence was carried out. Fluorescence measured by in situ laser fluorometer compared very well to the values obtained using more sophisticated laboratory spectrophotofluorometer; a significant relationship (r = 0.95) was identified between the two methods. Spatial distributions of CDOM in the Yangtze River estuary and its adjacent sea compiled from discrete samples analyses were presented. A linear relationship was identified between CDOM fluorescence and salinity in surface water, reflecting the potential of CDOM fluorescence to be used as a passive tracer of freshwater input. The in situ measurement results demonstrated the utility of the laser fluorometer for rapid acquisition of high-resolution profiles, and that the work resulting from sample filtration or storage can be avoided.

Modeling Marbled Murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) Habitat Using LiDAR-Derived Canopy Data	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) is an emerging remote-sensing tool that can provide fine-scale data describing vertical complexity of vegetation relevant to species that are responsive to forest structure. We used LiDAR data to estimate occupancy probability for the federally threatened marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) in the Oregon Coast Range of the United States. Our goal was to address the need identified in the Recovery Plan for a more accurate estimate of the availability of nesting habitat by developing occupancy maps based on refined measures of nest-strand structure. We used murrelet occupancy data collected by the Bureau of Land Management Coos Bay District, and canopy metrics calculated from discrete return airborne LiDAR data, to fit a logistic regression model predicting the probability of occupancy. Our final model for stand-level occupancy included distance to coast, and 5 LiDAR-derived variables describing canopy structure. With an area under the curve value (AUC) of 0.74, this model had acceptable discrimination and fair agreement (Cohen's k = 0.24), especially considering that all sites in our sample were regarded by managers as potential habitat. The LiDAR model provided better discrimination between occupied and unoccupied sites than did a model using variables derived from Gradient Nearest Neighbor maps that were previously reported as important predictors of murrelet occupancy (AUC = 0.64, k = 0.12). We also evaluated LiDAR metrics at 11 known murrelet nest sites. Two LiDAR-derived variables accurately discriminated nest sites from random sites (average AUC = 0.91). LiDAR provided a means of quantifying 3-dimensional canopy structure with variables that are ecologically relevant to murrelet nesting habitat, and have not been as accurately quantified by other mensuration methods.

J	Hua, LZ; Tang, LN; Cui, SH; Yin, K				Hua, Lizhong; Tang, Lina; Cui, Shenghui; Yin, Kai			Simulating Urban Growth Using the SLEUTH Model in a Coastal Peri-Urban District in China	SUSTAINABILITY												China's southeast coastal areas have witnessed rapid growth in the last two decades, owing mostly to their economic and social attractions. In this paper, we chose Jimei, a coastal peri-urban district of Xiamen city on the southeast coast of China, as a study area to explore the district's growth dynamics, to predict future sprawl during the next decade and to provide a basis for urban planning. The SLEUTH urban growth model was calibrated against historical data derived from a series of Landsat TM 5 satellite images taken between 1992 and 2007. A Lee-Sallee value of 0.48 was calculated for the district, which is a satisfactory result compared with related studies. Five coefficients of urban growth, diffusion, spread, breed, slope resistance and road gravity had values of 25, 68, 86, 24 and 23, respectively, in 2007. The growth coefficients (i.e., urban character) can capture urban growth characteristics in Jimei district. The urban DNA revealed that, over the study period, urban growth in the district was dominated both by urbanization through establishment of new urban centers, and by expansion outward from existing urban centers. In contrast to interior cities, in which expansions are dramatically shaped by actual road patterns, urban expansion in the district was likely constrained by the nearby coastline. Future urban growth patterns were predicted to 2020 assuming three different development scenarios. The first scenario simulated a continuation of historical urban growth without changing current conditions. The second scenario projected managed growth in which urban growth is limited by a layer with areas excluded from urbanization, which is the future development plan for Jimei district and Xiamen city. The third scenario depicted a growth with maximum protection in which growth was allowed to continue, similar to the second scenario, but with lower diffusion and spread coefficients applied to the growth pattern. The third scenario demonstrated that valuable land could be saved, which is the most desirable outcome for Jimei urban development. The study showed that SLEUTH can be an extremely useful tool for coastal city managers to explore the likely outcomes of their city development plans.

J	Alvarez, O; Guo, QH; Klinger, RC; Li, WK; Doherty, P				Alvarez, Otto; Guo, Qinghua; Klinger, Robert C.; Li, Wenkai; Doherty, Paul			Comparison of elevation and remote sensing derived products as auxiliary data for climate surface interpolation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Climate models may be limited in their inferential use if they cannot be locally validated or do not account for spatial uncertainty. Much of the focus has gone into determining which interpolation method is best suited for creating gridded climate surfaces, which often a covariate such as elevation (Digital Elevation Model, DEM) is used to improve the interpolation accuracy. One key area where little research has addressed is in determining which covariate best improves the accuracy in the interpolation. In this study, a comprehensive evaluation was carried out in determining which covariates were most suitable for interpolating climatic variables (e.g. precipitation, mean temperature, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature). We compiled data for each climate variable from 1950 to 1999 from approximately 500 weather stations across the Western United States (32 degrees to 49 degrees latitude and -124.7 degrees to -112.9 degrees longitude). In addition, we examined the uncertainty of the interpolated climate surface. Specifically, Thin Plate Spline (TPS) was used as the interpolation method since it is one of the most popular interpolation techniques to generate climate surfaces. We considered several covariates, including DEM, slope, distance to coast (Euclidean distance), aspect, solar potential, radar, and two Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) products derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). A tenfold cross-validation was applied to determine the uncertainty of the interpolation based on each covariate. In general, the leading covariate for precipitation was radar, while DEM was the leading covariate for maximum, mean, and minimum temperatures. A comparison to other products such as PRISM and WorldClim showed strong agreement across large geographic areas but climate surfaces generated in this study (ClimSurf) had greater variability at high elevation regions, such as in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.																	0899-8418	1097-0088				JUN	2014	34	7					2258	2268		10.1002/joc.3835								WOS:000337558200011

Shoreline dynamics and littoral transport around the tidal inlet at Pulicat, southeast coast of India	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Pulicat is India's second largest brackish water lagoon with its mouth opening in the Bay of Bengal. The dynamics of the tidal inlet at Pulicat has been reported in this study on the basis of long term analysis using satellite remote sensing aided with Geographical Information System (GIS) and berm crest data. In addition, the short term analysis was carried out using monthly in situ Global Positioning System (GPS) profiling and sediment grain size analysis. The study of the shoreline dynamics along the inlet using the Linear Imaging Self - Scanning Sensor (LISS) - III along with the Survey of India toposheet of 1954 reveals that the inlet once with a single mouth is divided into two, over the period of time with the southern mouth migrating towards north with an inconsistent migration pattern of the northern mouth. The overall extent of migration is found to be within 3 km. The outcome of the 25 year berm crest data starting from 1978 revealed the coastline around Pulicat is eroding upto 1990 and thereafter it is accreting with the net shoreline erosion rate of 20.34 m/yr. The monthly in situ beach profiling studies from August 2004 to July 2005 revealed that the Pulicat inlet follows a variable migratory pattern with a shift of upto 914 m North during August to December with a reversal migration of 600 m thus leading to a net migration towards the north. The grain size analysis has unravelled the sediment transport around Pulicat inlet. The study of the inlet using satellite imagery during monsoon has clearly justified the dominant fresh water inflow regulatory force over the tidal forces and the positive influence of the Tsunami on opening the inlet during monsoon failure.

Shoreline changes in response to sea level rise along Digha Coast, Eastern India: an analytical approach of remote sensing, GIS and statistical techniques	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												Shoreline is one of the rapidly changing linear features of the coastal zone which is dynamic in nature. The issue of shoreline changes due to sea level rise over the next century has increasingly become a major social, economic and environmental concern to a large number of countries along the coast, where it poses a serious problem to the environment and human settlements. As a consequence, some coastal scientists have advocated analyzing and predicting coastal changes on a more local scale. The present study demonstrates the potential of remote sensing, geospatial and statistical techniques for monitoring the shoreline changes and sea level rise along Digha coast, the eastern India. In the present study, multi-resolution and multi temporal satellite images of Landsat have been utilized to demarcate shoreline positions during 1972, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010. The statistical techniques, linear regression, end-point rate and regression coefficient (R-2) have been used to find out the shoreline change rates and sea level change during the periods of 1972-2010. Monthly and annual mean sea level data for three nearby station viz., Haldia, Paradip and Gangra from 1972 to 2006 have been used to this study. Finally, an attempt has been made to find out interactive relationship between the sea level rise and shoreline change of the study area. The results of the present study show that combined use of satellite imagery, sea level data and statistical methods can be a reliable method in correlating shoreline changes with sea level rise.

J	Potter, C				Potter, Christopher			Monitoring the production of Central California coastal rangelands using satellite remote sensing	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												There is a long history of livestock grazing on the California Central Coast, dating back over 150 years. In this study, methods were reviewed and results presented for analysis of NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensor data to monitor year-to-year variation of forage production on Central Coast rangelands around Big Sur, California. Time series plots from 2000 to 2012 of vegetation greenness for ten rangeland sites showed similar inter-annual patterns in satellite yield index (SYI) values. Most sites reached their maximum greenness levels each year in early May. The year with the highest observed SYI level across most sites was 2005. In the northern portion of the region (north of Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park), 2007 was the year with the lowest observed SYI level, whereas in the southern allotments, 2007 was a year with a relatively high SYI level. These methods have the potential to monitor the differing seasonal growing cycles of rangeland production across the area of individual grazing allotments on the Central Coast. Such a cost-effective and timely approach is required for conservation monitoring in the Big Sur coastal ecosystems where rapid climate change may shift vegetation cover in favor of more extensive rangelands at the expense of forested lands.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				JUN	2014	18	3					213	220		10.1007/s11852-014-0308-1								WOS:000336739500006						
J	Pardo-Pascual, JE; Almonacid-Caballer, J; Ruiz, LA; Palomar-Vazquez, J; Rodrigo-Alemany, R				Pardo-Pascual, Josep E.; Almonacid-Caballer, Jaime; Ruiz, Luis A.; Palomar-Vazquez, Jesus; Rodrigo-Alemany, Rauel			Evaluation of storm impact on sandy beaches of the Gulf of Valencia using Landsat imagery series	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The impact of storms on sandy beaches and the subsequent recovery process is described from an analysis of the shoreline positions obtained from Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery. Shoreline extraction is based on an algorithm previously proposed by the authors that enables a positioning accuracy of 5 m root mean square error (RMSE). The impact of six storms registered over a period of seven months (between November 2001 and May 2002) and the beach recovery processes until December 2002 across a 100 km segment of the Gulf of Valencia on the Spanish Mediterranean coast were analysed by comparing 12 shoreline positions. The multiple shoreline positions obtained from Landsat images provide very useful information for describing the impact of storms and the recovery process across large segments of microtidal coast. This enables the identification of differences not only in the magnitude of change produced by a particular event but also in the cumulative effect associated with several storm events, and in the study of how the beach recovery process takes place. The results show a high level of spatial variability. Beaches with steep slopes experienced fewer changes than shallow slopes. The existence of well developed foredunes in some areas minimised the reduction in the beach width after the storms. Coastal orientation was another important factor in explaining storm impact and the recovery process. This factor affects not only the way the waves interact with the beaches but also the sediment longshore transport: beach regeneration is slower when the transport of sediments is limited by artificial infrastructures (groins, jetties, ports) or natural sediment traps (headlands). The main limitations of using the proposed methodology to obtain the shoreline position from Landsat images are related to: (i) the precision in the shoreline detection; (ii) the nature of the indicator obtained, that is, the water/land interface; and (iii) the registration instant defined by the image acquisition time. However, the high frequency of the data acquisition and the possibility to cover large coastal areas bring a new perspective that enriches other methods and tools used by coastal scientists.

Environmental monitoring of El Hierro Island submarine volcano, by combining low and high resolution satellite imagery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												El Hierro Island, located at the Canary Islands Archipelago in the Atlantic coast of North Africa, has been rocked by thousands of tremors and earthquakes since July 2011. Finally, an underwater volcanic eruption started 300 m below sea level on October 10, 2011. Since then, regular multidisciplinary monitoring has been carried out in order to quantify the environmental impacts caused by the submarine eruption. Thanks to this natural tracer release, multisensorial satellite imagery obtained from MODIS and MERIS sensors have been processed to monitor the volcano activity and to provide information on the concentration of biological, chemical and physical marine parameters. Specifically, low resolution satellite estimations of optimal diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration under these abnormal conditions have been assessed. These remote sensing data have played a fundamental role during field campaigns guiding the oceanographic vessel to the appropriate sampling areas. In addition, to analyze El Hierro submarine volcano area, WorldView-2 high resolution satellite spectral bands were atmospherically and deglinted processed prior to obtain a high-resolution optimal diffuse attenuation coefficient model. This novel algorithm was developed using a matchup data set with MERIS and MODIS data, in situ transmittances measurements and a seawater radiative transfer model. Multisensor and multitemporal imagery processed from satellite remote sensing sensors have demonstrated to be a powerful tool for monitoring the submarine volcanic activities, such as discolored seawater, floating material and volcanic plume, having shown the capabilities to improve the understanding of submarine volcanic processes.

J	Bentamy, A; Croize-Fillon, D				Bentamy, Abderrahim; Croize-Fillon, Denis			Spatial and temporal characteristics of wind and wind power off the coasts of Brittany	RENEWABLE ENERGY												The main objective of this paper is to thoroughly examine the remotely sensed wind characteristics around the coasts of Brittany as well as some more specific areas. The offshore wind power potential is then assessed. To achieve this objective, information on wind speed and direction with sufficient spatial and temporal sampling under all weather conditions and during day and night is required. This study uses more than 12 years (December 1999 December 2012) of consistent remotely sensed data retrieved from the ASCAT and QuikSCAT scatterometers to estimate the conventional moments and associated wind distribution parameters. The latter are comparable to wind observations from meteorological stations. Furthermore, combining in-situ and scatterometer wind information enables an improved assessment of the spatial and temporal wind structures at specific locations of interest to be made. The wind statistical results are used to study the spatial and temporal patterns of the wind power. Although the main parameters characterizing wind power potential such as mean, variability, maximum energy, wind speed and intra-annual exhibit seasonal features, significant inter-annual variability is also depicted. Furthermore, differences are found between the wind power estimated for northern and for southern Brittany. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Remote sensing of selected water-quality indicators with the hyperspectral imager for the coastal ocean (HICO) sensor	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) offers the coastal environmental monitoring community an unprecedented opportunity to observe changes in coastal and estuarine water quality across a range of spatial scales not feasible with traditional field-based monitoring or existing ocean colour satellites. HICO, an Office of Naval Research-sponsored programme, is the first space-based maritime hyperspectral imaging instrument designed specifically for the coastal ocean. HICO has been operating since September 2009 from the Japanese Experiment Module - Exposed Facility on the International Space Station (ISS). The high pixel resolution (approximately 95m at nadir) and hyperspectral imaging capability offer a unique opportunity for characterizing a wide range of water colour constituents that could be used to assess environmental condition. In this study, we transform atmospherically corrected ISS/HICO hyperspectral imagery and derive environmental response variables routinely used for evaluating the environmental condition of coastal ecosystem resources. Using atmospherically corrected HICO imagery and a comprehensive field validation programme, three regionally specific algorithms were developed to estimate basic water-quality properties traditionally measured by monitoring agencies. Results indicated that a three-band chlorophyll a algorithm performed best (R-2=0.62) when compared with in situ measurement data collected 2-4hours of HICO acquisitions. Coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) (R-2=0.93) and turbidity (R-2=0.67) were also highly correlated. The distributions of these water-quality indicators were mapped for four estuaries along the northwest coast of Florida from April 2010 to May 2012. However, before the HICO sensor can be transitioned from proof-of-concept to operational status and its data applied to benefit decisions made by coastal managers, problems with vicarious calibration of the sensor need to be resolved and standardized protocols are required for atmospheric correction. Ideally, the sensor should be placed on a polar orbiting platform for greater spatial and temporal coverage as well as for image synchronization with field validation efforts.																	0143-1161	1366-5901				MAY 3	2014	35	9					2927	2962		10.1080/01431161.2014.894663								WOS:000334905200001						
J	Reimold, WU; Koeberl, C				Reimold, Wolf Uwe; Koeberl, Christian			Impact structures in Africa: A review	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												More than 50 years of space and planetary exploration and concomitant studies of terrestrial impact structures have demonstrated that impact cratering has been a fundamental process - an essential part of planetary evolution - ever since the beginning of accretion and has played a major role in planetary evolution throughout the solar system and beyond. This not only pertains to the development of the planets but to evolution of life as well. The terrestrial impact record represents only a small fraction of the bombardment history that Earth experienced throughout its evolution. While remote sensing investigations of planetary surfaces provide essential information about surface evolution and surface processes, they do not provide the information required for understanding the ultra-high strain rate, high-pressure, and high-temperature impact process. Thus, hands-on investigations of rocks from terrestrial impact craters, shock experimentation for pressure and temperature calibration of impact-related deformation of rocks and minerals, as well as parameter studies pertaining to the physics and chemistry of cratering and ejecta formation and emplacement, and laboratory studies of impact-generated lithologies are mandatory tools. These, together with numerical modeling analysis of impact physics, form the backbone of impact cratering studies. Here, we review the current status of knowledge about impact cratering - and provide a detailed account of the African impact record, which has been expanded vastly since a first overview was published in 1994. No less than 19 confirmed impact structures, and one shatter cone occurrence without related impact crater are now known from Africa. In addition, a number of impact glass, tektite and spherule layer occurrences are known. The 49 sites with proposed, but not yet confirmed, possible impact structures contain at least a considerable number of structures that, from available information, hold the promise to be able to expand the African impact record drastically - provided the political conditions for safe ground-truthing will become available. The fact that 28 structures have also been shown to date NOT to be of impact origin further underpins the strong interest in impact in Africa. We hope that this review stimulates the education of students about impact cratering and the fundamental importance of this process for Earth - both for its biological and geological evolution. This work may provide a reference volume for those workers who would like to search for impact craters and their ejecta in Africa. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Profiling Sea Ice with a Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar (MABEL)	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY												The sole instrument on the upcoming Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat-2) altimetry mission is a micropulse lidar that measures the time of flight of individual photons from laser pulses transmitted at 532 nm. Prior to launch, the Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar (MABEL) serves as an airborne implementation for testing and development. This paper provides a first examination of MABEL data acquired on two flights over sea ice in April 2012: one north of the Arctic coast of Greenland and the other in the east Greenland Sea. The phenomenology of photon distributions in the sea ice returns is investigated. An approach to locate the surface and estimate its elevation in the distributions is described, and its achievable precision is assessed. Retrieved surface elevations over relatively flat leads in the ice cover suggest that precisions of several centimeters are attainable. Restricting the width of the elevation window used in the surface analysis can mitigate potential biases in the elevation estimates due to subsurface returns at 532 nm. Comparisons of nearly coincident elevation profiles from MABEL with those acquired by an analog lidar show good agreement. Discrimination of ice and open water, a crucial step in the determination of sea ice freeboard and the estimation of ice thickness, is facilitated by contrasts in the observed signal-background photon statistics. Future flight paths will sample a broader range of seasonal ice conditions for further evaluation of the year-round profiling capabilities and limitations of the MABEL instrument.

The measurement of digital elevation model-derived river sinuosity was carried out for 846 km(2) of the basin area of Meenachil River. The drainage networks of 10 major sub-watersheds and four mini-watersheds were delineated using remote sensing data-geocoded false colour composite of Indian Remote Sensing satellite (IRS)-1D (LISS III) data with a spatial resolution of 23.5 m-coupled with the Survey of India toposheets (1:50,000). The calculation of the sinuosity indexes were carried out using Arc GIS (8.3 version) software. Hydraulic sinuosity indexes, topographic sinuosity index and standard sinuosity index were calculated. The study depicts the remarkable correlation between theoretical data sets with field observations and the influence of tectonic control on river planforms.

Impacts of wave energy and littoral currents on shoreline erosion/accretion along the south-west coast of Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu using DSAS and geospatial technology	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The present study investigates the impact of wave energy and littoral current on shorelines along the south-west coast of Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu, India. The multi-temporal Landsat TM, ETM+ images acquired from 1999 to 2011 were used to demarcate the rate of shoreline shift using GIS-based Digital Shoreline Analysis System. The statistical analysis such as net shoreline movement and end point rate were determined from the multi-temporal shoreline layers. Moreover, the wave energy and seasonal littoral current velocity were calculated for each coastal zone using mathematical equations. The results reveal that the coastal zones, which include Kanyakumari, Kovalam, Manavalakurichi and Thengapattinam coasts, consisting of maximum wave energy along with high velocity of littoral current, have faced continuous erosion processes. The estimated wave energy along these zones ranges from 6.5 to 8.5 kJ/km(2) and the observed current velocity varies from 0.22 to 0.32 m/s during south-west and north-east monsoons. The cumulative effect of these coastal processes in the study area leads to severe erosion that is estimated as 300.63, 69.92, 54.12 and 66.11 m, respectively. However, the coastal zones, namely Rajakkamangalam, Ganapathipuram, Muttam and Colachel, have experienced sediment deposits due to current movement during the north-east monsoon. However, the trend changes during the south-west monsoon as a result of sediment drift through backwash. The spatial variation of shoreline and its impact on wave energy and the littoral current have been mapped using the geo-spatial technology. This study envisages the impact of coastal processes on site-specific shorelines. Hence, the study will be effective for sustainable coastal zone management.

J	Chellamani, P; Singh, CP; Panigrahy, S				Chellamani, Prabakaran; Singh, Chandra Prakash; Panigrahy, Sushma			Assessment of the health status of Indian mangrove ecosystems using multi temporal remote sensing data	TROPICAL ECOLOGY												Mangroves are highly productive intertidal ecosystems in tropical and subtropical regions. Despite the established importance of mangroves to the coastal environment, degradation of this system continues mainly due to anthropogenic pressure. Over the past few decades, satellite remote sensing has been used to map and monitor changes of mangrove forests worldwide. This study was aimed at characterizing the health status of the Indian mangrove on the basis of multiyear, multi-season, remote sensing data. Normalized Difference Vegetation index (NDVI) from Systeme Pour I Observation de la Terre - Vegetation (SPOT-VGT) coinciding with the stress period (March - May) for one decade (1999 - 2008) was subjected to maximum value compositing (MVC). This was used to develop a four-category health index status based on threshold values. Results showed that around 38 % and 27 % of tibial mangrove in India belonged to very-healthy and healthy categories, respectively. In general the health index was lower in western coast mangroves compared to east coast. The health index was highest for the island mangrove systems (Andaman and Nicobar), and lowest along the Gujarat coast.																	0564-3295					MAY	2014	55	2					245	253										WOS:000331430100009

The aim of this study is to investigate temporal variations in total suspended matter (TSM) distribution along a coastal region using Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), the world's first geostationary ocean color observation satellite. TSM concentrations and water-leaving reflectance measured on the coastal water surface in southern Gyeonggi Bay were used to develop an empirical TSM algorithm. TSM maps were generated from the GOCI images at hourly intervals to examine temporal variations in TSM concentrations. Validation of the maps (via comparisons with in situ measurements) showed that the empirical TSM algorithm had been effectively employed. A comparison with the MODIS-derived TSM concentration also supported the reliability of the maps. GOCI-derived TSM at 1-h intervals successfully represented hourly variations in TSM according to the tidal status. In conclusion, the temporal dynamics of sediment movement with the tidal cycle can be effectively estimated on the west coast of the Korean Peninsula using GOCI.

Cyanobacteria blooms are a major concern in this region due to water quality issues interfering with the conservation of the whole ecosystem. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations can be extremely high (up to about 500 mg/m(3) in some cases) during cyanobacteria blooms, which are often associated with a surface accumulation of algae. The Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) was used to acquire 52 images covering the summers of 2004 to 2011. These images were analyzed to map Chl-a concentrations and the presence of scum using two different band ratio algorithms applied to atmospherically-corrected data. The results identify wind speed as the main driving factor in the surface accumulation of algae, as well as in the spatial distribution of Chl-a. The utility of microwave images was also assessed, as since any cloud cover obviously hampers the use of optical data. Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) images were collected synchronously with the MERIS data and the normalized radar cross-section (NRCS) signal was corrected for the contribution of wind for the purposes of correlating the results with the MERIS-derived Chl-a concentrations. In general, there was a stepwise decrease in the NRCS for high values of Chl-a (>50 mg/m3) with wind speeds in the range of 2 to 6 m/s. Under these conditions, our results demonstrate that optical and microwave signals can be used in combination to improve our understanding of cyanobacteria blooming.

The dramatic decrease in river sediment load has attracted considerable scientific interest to this area, but few studies have paid attention to the shoreline dynamics. This study uses Landsat images spanning from 1987 to 2010 and an orthogonal transect method, which was previously developed by the authors, to model the spatial and temporal characteristics of shoreline change and explore its relationship to reduced river sediment load by use of regression analysis on three different spatial scales. Results show a general decrease in the average rates of shoreline change throughout the entire study period. The maximum average shoreline change rate of +115.5 m/year occurred in the 1987-1990 interval and the minimum rate of +20.4 m/year occurred from 2006 to 2008. Based on average rates of shoreline change, the coast of Dongtan was divided into three segments: the erosion segment, eastern accretion segment, and northern accretion segment. The temporal pattern of the northern accretion segment is almost completely opposite to that of the eastern accretion segment. The strongest-correlation transects are located on the northern side of the eastern tip of Dongtan and the next strongest transects are located on the south side. Other transects have a very low correlation. Transect 19 near the easternmost tip of Dongtan has a near zero correlation (r(2) = 0.0045) but has the fastest accretion rate, and in general an increase in the shoreline change rate. The average rate of shoreline change and the net accretion area in Dongtan as a whole are significantly associated with sediment discharge at Datong Station (r(2) = 0.69 and 0.75, respectively). This implies that shoreline accretion in Dongtan will probably slow down gradually, if the river sediment load continues to decrease in the future. The shoreline change rates achieved using our approach are consistent with previous studies, but the relationship with the river sediment load is different from results in a previous study on intertidal wetland based on bathymetric maps. The results and methods may be helpful in coastal management and understanding the evolution of the entire delta from the perspective of shoreline change. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Stratigraphic analysis applied on the recognition of the interface between marine and fluvial depositional systems	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					INTERNATIONAL COASTAL SYMPOSIUM DURBAN, KWAZULU-NATAL, SOUTH AFRICA THE OYSTERBOX UMHLANGA	APR 13-18, 2014	Durban, SOUTH AFRICA					Coastal areas contain interfaces between complex depositional systems as a consequence of the convergence of marine and continental environments. The knowledge of such complex depositional systems is important in understanding of coastal evolution and for coastal management. The present study deals with the subsurface identification of interfaces between fluvial and beach/shallow marine systems, using Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR). GPR profiles were measured along dip direction, at two sites on the coastal plain of Santa Catarina state (Pinheira and Passo de Tones), where deposits of fluvial and beach/foredune ridge systems occur. GPR data showed that fluvial and beach deposits are interdigitated in subsurface, with reflectors showing different downlap directions. The results of this study allow a more complete knowledge of the complex interfaces between marine and continental systems. Also, the identification of hidden older fluvial deposits in the subsurface of coastal plains gives important geoteclinical information to be considered in the use and occupation of coastal areas and during prospection for placer deposits.

A +/- 14 degrees subset of the backscattered power data associated with the topography measurements is used to produce independent measurements of rain rate and sea surface mean square slope at 10-s intervals. Theoretical calculations of rain attenuation at the WSRA 16.15-GHz operating frequency using measured drop size distributions for both mostly convective and mostly stratiform rainfall demonstrate that the WSRA absorption technique for rain determination is relatively insensitive to both ambient temperature and the characteristics of the drop size distribution, in contrast to reflectivity techniques. The variation of the sea surface radar reflectivity in the vicinity of a hurricane is reviewed. Fluctuations in the sea surface scattering characteristics caused by changes in wind speed or the rain impinging on the surface cannot contaminate the rain measurement because they are calibrated out using the WSRA measurement of mean square slope. WSRA rain measurements from a NOAA WP-3D hurricane research aircraft off the North Carolina coast in Hurricane Irene on 26 August 2011 are compared with those from the stepped frequency microwave radiometer (SFMR) on the aircraft and the Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) National Mosaic and Multi-Sensor Quantitative Precipitation Estimation (QPE) system.

J	Potter, C				Potter, Christopher			Microclimate influences on vegetation water availability and net primary production in coastal ecosystems of Central California	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Field sampling and satellite remote sensing were used to test the hypothesis that site microclimate variability leading to divergent soil water use by vegetation types is closely associated with variability in annual net primary productivity (NPP) at the landscape scale. A simulation model based on satellite observations of seasonal phenology was used to estimate NPP of grassland, shrubland, and conifer forest vegetation types on the Central California coast near Big Sur. Daily microclimate at the soil surface was monitored over 4 years (2008-2011) for each vegetation type to infer soil moisture controls on plant production. Grassland soils were found to have lower soil organic matter content and were subjected to extreme radiation and wind events, and thereby dry-down faster with daily spring-summer warming than do shrubland or redwood forest soils. This reduced moisture microclimate affected the water stress on grassland plants to reduce NPP fluxes from April to October each year on the Central Coast far sooner than for shrubland or redwood stands. Results from this study suggested that the satellite-observed canopy greenness variations represented can be used to quantify plant production in coastal ecosystems at the landscape scale of defined microclimate variation.

Timing and Patterns of the ENSO Signal in Africa over the Last 30 Years: Insights from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index Data	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												A more complete picture of the timing and patterns of the ENSO signal during the seasonal cycle for the whole of Africa over the three last decades is provided using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Indeed, NDVI has a higher spatial resolution and is more frequently updated than in situ climate databases, and highlights the impact of ENSO on vegetation dynamics as a combined result of ENSO on rainfall, solar radiation, and temperature. The month-by-month NDVI-Nino-3.4 correlation patterns evolve as follows. From July to September, negative correlations are observed over the Sahel, the Gulf of Guinea coast, and regions from the northern Democratic Republic of Congo to Ethiopia. However, they are not uniform in space and are moderate (~0.3). Conversely, positive correlations are recorded over the winter rainfall region of South Africa. In October-November, negative correlations over Ethiopia, Sudan, and Uganda strengthen while positive correlations emerge in the Horn of Africa and in the southeast coast of South Africa. By December with the settlement of the ITCZ south of the equator, positive correlations over the Horn of Africa spread southward and westward while negative correlations appear over Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and South Africa. This pattern strengthens and a dipole at 18 degrees S is well established in February-March with reduced (enhanced) greenness during ENSO years south (north) of 18 degrees S. At the same time, at ~2 degrees N negative correlations spread northward. Last, from April to June negative correlations south of 18 degrees S spread to the north (to 10 degrees S) and to the east (to the south of Tanzania).

One of the subsystems of SatBaltyk, a Polish research project for maritime observation, is dedicated to coastal monitoring. It focuses on recording and forecasting the consequences of storm events along the Baltic's Polish shoreline. Three sites (7-12 km-long sections of dune coast) were selected for detailed research: the Dziwnow Spit, Jamno and Bukowo lakes' spits and part of the Hel Peninsula. Work started in 2010 and will continue until 2015. A numerical model, XBeach, was implemented in order to provide forecasts of several parameters, i.e. beach flooding, dune erosion, suspension of matter in the water after storm and rip current occurrence. It combines external data with in situ measurements by the researchers. Many pieces of equipment were installed for this research: a satellite receiving station, underwater probe ADCP (Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler), a tide gauge, a hyperspectral radiometer and two video cameras for constant shoreline observation. The system is currently being calibrated and verified; an online visualisation available to the public is due to be launched as a long-lasting outcome of the project.

Among these are questions regarding the origins of the Wilkes Subglacial Basin, the Gamburtsev Mountains, the Wilkes Land Anomaly, subglacial lakes, subglacial topography, and the enigmatic Mertz and Ninnis Glaciers. Located immediately inland of George V Coast at the northern extremity of the Wilkes Subglacial Basin, the Mertz and Ninnis Glaciers display characteristics that have posed questions of their sizes, their accompanying subglacial topography, their existence in tandem within the continental ice sheet and their extensions as glacier tongues offshore in the Southern Ocean. The present study examines in particular the underlying craterform morphology as the potential explanation for these several features based upon surveys of the subglacial topography, which include ground-based geophysical survey, airborne radiosound survey, airborne geophysical survey, and satellite remote sensing of the geomorphology beneath the continental ice sheet. On the basis of these investigations, we propose that the Mertz and Ninnis Glaciers are the result of parallel channelizing subglacial valleys and that the entire Mertz and Ninnis Glacier complex is a function of meteorite crater morphology beneath the East Antarctic continental ice sheet.

Local absorption and scattering properties were used to derive surface SPM maps from 84 cloud-free ENVISAT MERIS FR reflectance images of the Westerschelde estuary (51 degrees 30' N, 3 degrees 30' E) for the period 2006-2008, and validated with in situ SPM at fixed stations (r = 0.89 for geometric means). The distinctly different SPM maps were categorized for different tidal and seasonal conditions. Resulting composites reveal spatial patterns in SPM as a function of semi-diurnal tidal phase, fortnightly tidal phase, or season. For the estuary proper, tidal and seasonal effects on the variation of SPM are similar in magnitude. Observed controls for surface SPM are distance to shallow source area, tidal current velocity, and advection of North Sea and estuarine surface waters. Turbidity maxima appear only during favourable tidal and meteorological conditions. For the Westerschelde, the bias introduced by sun-synchronous sampling causes low water image acquisitions to uniquely coincide with spring tides, and high water images with neap tides. Cloud-free images were associated with low wind velocities. Simulations from a mud transport model confirmed the overestimation of geometric mean SPM from the tidal aliasing, and underestimation from fair weather. This resulted in a net relative error of -8% at the wave-exposed mouth, but biases cancelled out in the upper estuary. We argue that local biases should be considered when interpreting water quality products for estuaries and coasts around the world. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

Application of hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance data to photochemical rate calculations in the Duplin River, a tidal river on the coast of Georgia, USA	GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING												Estuaries are photochemically dynamic environments with high carbon loads and relatively small areas. The small area poses problems for large-scale satellite-based remote sensing calculations, where the resolution is too coarse to distinguish land from water. Airborne remote sensing instruments have the potential to reveal the dynamics of these areas with fine-scale resolution. In June 2006, hyperspectral remote sensing imagery, using an AISA Eagle instrument, was collected over the tidal Duplin River, Georgia, USA. A dark-water updated version of the SeaUV algorithm was applied to the AISA remote sensing image to determine diffuse attenuation constants in the ultraviolet and calculate surface photochemical production rates of two inorganic products - carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). For an average day in June at the study site, the modeled photoproduction rates for CO2 and CO averaged similar to 7x10(-1)nmolC/day/cm(3) and similar to 3.5x10(-2)nmolC/day/cm(3), respectively.																	1548-1603	1943-7226				MAR 4	2014	51	2			SI		199	211		10.1080/15481603.2014.895583								WOS:000333870200006

Multi-satellite SAR data acquired at different radar bands (L, C, and X band, from ALOS PALSAR, from ERS SAR, Radarsat-2 and ENVISAT ASAR, and from TerraSAR-X, respectively) were used to investigate whether they can be jointly used for crude sediment classification on dry-fallen intertidal flats and for detecting benthic fauna such as blue mussel or oyster beds. In this respect, we show that both multi-satellite and multi-temporal analyses provide valuable input for the routine monitoring of exposed intertidal flats on the German North Sea coast, the latter already improving the identification of the spatial extent of mussel (oyster) beds. In addition, we demonstrate that high-resolution SAR is capable of detecting residuals of historical land use in areas that were lost to the sea during major storm surges in the 14th and 17th centuries.

Recent advances in remote-sensing technology allow us to view fishing practices from space and mitigate gaps in catch reporting. Here, we use Google Earth to count intertidal fishing weirs off the coast of six countries in the Persian Gulf, otherwise known as the Arabian Gulf. Although the name of this body of water remains contentious, we use the name used in Google Earth. Combining, in a Monte Carlo procedure, the number of weirs (after correcting for poor resolution and imagery availability) with assumptions about daily catch and fishing season lengths, we estimate that 1900 (79) weirs contribute to a regional catch up to six times higher than the officially reported catches of 5260 t. These results, which speak to the unreliability of officially reported fisheries statistics, provide the first example of fisheries catch estimates from space, and point to the potential for remote-sensing approaches to validate catch statistics and fisheries operations in general.																	1054-3139	1095-9289				MAR-APR	2014	71	3					450	454		10.1093/icesjms/fst178								WOS:000334694300003

Assessment of reservoir sedimentation effect on coastal erosion in the case of Nestos River, Greece	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH												Coastal erosion that is generated by the reduction of the annual sediment yield at river outlets, due to the construction of reservoirs, constitutes one of the main environmental problems in many parts of the world. Nestos is one of the most important boundary rivers, flowing through Bulgaria and Greece, characterized by its great biodiversity. In the Greek part of the river, two reservoirs, the Thisavros Reservoir and the Platanovrysi Reservoir, have already been constructed and started operating in 1997 and 1999, respectively. The present paper constitutes the first attempt where the assessment of reservoir sedimentation effect on the coastal erosion for the case of the Nestos River delta and the adjacent shorelines is addressed in detail, through mathematical modeling, modern remote sensing techniques and field surveying. It is found that the construction and operation of the considered reservoirs have caused a dramatic decrease (about 83%) in the sediments supplied directly to the basin outlet and indirectly to the neighbouring coast and that this fact has almost inversed the erosion/accretion balance in the deltaic as well as the adjacent shorelines. Before the construction of the reservoirs, accretion predominated erosion by 25.36%, while just within five years after the construction of the reservoirs, erosion predominates accretion by 21.26%.

Combined use of imagery and LiDAR may improve the assessment of wildfire impacts compared to imagery alone. Estimation of tree mortality at the plot scale could serve for more rapid, broad-scale, and lower cost post-fire assessments than feasible through field assessment. We assessed the accuracy of classifying color-infrared imagery in combination with post-fire LiDAR, and with differenced (pre- and post-fire) LiDAR, in estimating plot percent mortality in a second-growth coast redwood forest near Santa Cruz, CA. Percent mortality of trees greater than 25.4 cm DBH in 47 permanent 0.08 ha plots was categorized as low (<25%), moderate (25%-50%), or high (>50%). The model using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) was 74% accurate; the model using NDVI and post-fire LiDAR was 85% accurate, while the model using NDVI and differenced LiDAR was 83% accurate. The addition of post-fire LiDAR data provided a modest increase in accuracy compared to imagery alone, which may not justify the substantial cost of data acquisition. The method demonstrated could be applied to rapidly estimate tree mortality resulting from wildfires at fine to moderate scale.

J	Wang, JJ; Tang, DL				Wang, Jiu-Juan; Tang, Dan Ling			Phytoplankton patchiness during spring intermonsoon in western coast of South China Sea	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Jet-like phytoplankton blooms usually occur off the southwestern coast of the South China Sea (SCS) caused by strong winds during summer monsoons. However a jet-like phytoplankton patch was observed in the western SCS in the spring intermonsoon of 2010 in both field and remote sensing data. The present study investigated the biological processes associated with this spring phytoplankton patchiness. The data showed that chlorophyll a concentrations increased in the surface water, extending out to the SCS, and the depth of the subsurface chlorophyll maximum uplifted from 75 m to 50 m depth; low dissolved oxygen, low pH and nutrient enrichment (nitrate + nitrite and soluble reactive phosphate) were observed in the subsurface water (50 to similar to 200 m depth). Data analysis showed that variations in chlorophyll a, nutrients and temperature in the water column were related to wind-stress curl: the spatial distribution pattern and vertical structure of the phytoplankton patchiness were controlled by vertical flux of nutrients caused by curl-driven upwelling through Ekman pumping. There was a high correlation between chlorophyll a concentration and wind-stress curl where the influence of nutrient influx from the coast was limited. This study shows the importance of wind-stress curl in providing nutrients to support phytoplankton growth during the spring intermonsoon along the western coast of SCS. It may help to better understand the role of wind in marine biological processes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Hof, A; Wolf, N				Hof, Angela; Wolf, Nils			Estimating potential outdoor water consumption in private urban landscapes by coupling high-resolution image analysis, irrigation water needs and evaporation estimation in Spain	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												In the past two decades, the Spanish Mediterranean coast has experienced urban and demographic growth through the expansion of low-density residential areas characterized by ornamental gardens, swimming pools, and lawns. To determine the potential outdoor water demand, land cover data were mapped from high-resolution WorldView-2 imagery along a climatic gradient from Mallorca, in the Balearic Islands, to Andalusia in Spain. WorldView-2 imagery was analyzed by adopting object-based feature extraction to generate spatial information layers as additional input features (predictor variables) for supervised per-pixel classification. Swimming pools and gardens planted with turf grass, trees and shrubs were mapped automatically with high levels of overall accuracy, ranging from 88.98% to 96.13%. The resulting GIS (geographic information systems)-ready vector layer was used to calculate net irrigation requirements with the landscape coefficient method and to assess evaporative loss from swimming pools. The method and results can be used by urban planners, water managers, property owners and others to assess the implications of landscaping styles for water demand. Net irrigation requirements (April-September) range from 2335 m(3)/ha to 6330 m(3)/ha compared to 5400 m(3)/ha per year in irrigated agriculture in Spain. Per unit area, the same outdoor landscaping produces a 45.5% higher net irrigation requirement and 21.6% more evaporation from swimming pools along the climatic gradient. The combination of high-resolution image analysis and the landscape coefficient method captures the relevant information for the identification and quantification of outdoor water consumption in private urban landscapes.

Shoreline change rate estimation and its forecast: remote sensing, geographical information system and statistics-based approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The present study indicates that coastal geomorphology is controlled by the natural processes and anthropogenic activities. The changes in shoreline positions of Udupi coast, western India, are investigated for a period of 98 years using multi-dated satellite images and topographic maps. The study area has been divided into four littoral cells and each cell into a number of transects at uniform intervals. Further, past shoreline positions have been demarcated and future positions are estimated for 12 and 22 years. The shoreline change rate has been estimated using statistical methods-end point rate, average of rates and linear regression-and cross-validated with correlation coefficient and root-mean-square error (RMSE) methods. Resultant changes from natural processes and human interventions have been inferred from the estimated values of the back-calculated errors. About 53 % of transects exhibit +/- 10 m RMSE values, indicating better agreement between the estimated and satellite-based shoreline positions, and the transects closer to the cell boundaries exhibit similar to 57 % uncertainties in shoreline change rate estimations. Based on the values of correlation coefficient and RMSE, the influence of natural processes and human interventions on shoreline changes have been calculated. The cells/transects dominated by natural processes record low RMSE values, whereas those influenced by human interventions show lower correlation coefficient and higher RMSE values. The present study manifests that the results of this study can be very useful in quantifying shoreline changes and in prediction of shoreline positions.					Jayappa, K.

The coastline of Istiaia (North Evia, Greece) has been chosen for this study as several areas of accretion and erosion have been identified during the past few decades. We combined different types of datasets, extracted from high resolution panchromatic aerial photographs and traced the contemporary shoreline by high accuracy surveying with Real Time Kinematics (RTK) GPS equipment. The interpretation of all shorelines required geo-statistical analysis in a Geographical Information System. A large number of high resolution morphological sections were constructed normally to the coast, revealing erosional and depositional parts of the beach. Retreating and extension rates were calculated for each section reaching the values of 0.98 m/yr and 1.36 m/yr, respectively. The results proved to be very accurate, allowing us to expand the developed methodology by using more complete time-series of remote sensing datasets along with more frequent RTK-GPS surveying.

J	Teggi, S; Despini, F				Teggi, Sergio; Despini, Francesca			Estimation of subpixel MODIS water temperature near coastlines using the SWTI algorithm	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Satellite derived water surface temperature maps are widely used in many environmental studies and applications. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is among the widely used sensors in this field and sea surface temperature (SST) is one of the standard quantities derived from MODIS imagery. However, MODIS SST maps have limited applications in near-shore and coastal environments due to inadequate spatial resolution of 1 km. This problem means that the MODIS pixels closer than 1 km from the shore are mixed pixels, i.e. they include by both water and land, and must be discarded from the SST map. In this work SWTI (Sharpening Water Thermal Imagery) methods were applied to MODIS thermal imagery for the first time. The information required by SWTI regarding cover fractions and perpendicular vegetation index was obtained from the MODIS images in the Visible-Near Infrared bands at a spatial resolution of 250 m. In this way, the SST MODIS maps were extended to a minimum distance of 250 m from the shore. The SWTI results were evaluated using as a reference the SST computed from two ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) images acquired simultaneously to the MODE images and covering the same areas. The applied validation methodology provides an evaluation of the deviations introduced by SWTI separated from the pre-existing differences between MODIS SST and ASTER SST upscaled to 250 m. For sea coast environments, SWTI was able to compute the SST of more than 80% of the pixels close to the shore at a spatial resolution of 250 m. This represents an increase of 67% compared to the number of pixels obtainable using a simple downscaling method based on polynomial interpolation; in areas with lagoons and estuaries the increases were + 70% and + 60% respectively. The ASTER SST comparison showed that the SST bias and the unsystematic deviation introduced by SWTI were Delta(s) <= 0.45 K and sigma(epsilon(S)) <= 0.88 K respectively, corresponding to a total deviation TD <= 0.97 K. SWTI is written in the IDL language and could be adapted for automatic application to MODIS images. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Singh, RK; Shanmugam, P				Singh, Rakesh Kumar; Shanmugam, Palanisamy			A novel method for estimation of aerosol radiance and its extrapolation in the atmospheric correction of satellite data over optically complex oceanic waters	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Atmospheric correction of satellite ocean color imagery in sediment-laden and algal bloom waters remains to be a challenging task because of the inefficiency of present methods to accurately assess aerosol radiances in the near-infrared (NIR) bands and extrapolate these into the visible spectrum. This study presents a novel method for estimation and extrapolation of aerosol radiances in MODIS-Aqua bands over optically complex oceanic waters dominated by suspended sediments and algal blooms. The Rayleigh-corrected radiance at 748 nm, after correcting the influence of the elevated radiance contributed by suspended sediments and algal blooms, is employed in the present method to estimate aerosol radiance in a MODIS-Aqua band centered at 531 nm. Then, the normalized Gaussian distribution function is used to extrapolate aerosol radiance over the entire wavebands (from 412 to 748 nm). This method retrieves water-leaving radiances L-w(lambda) nearly comparable to those of the NIR scheme for extremely clear waters (chlorophyll <0.15 mg m(-3)) with an error of <5% which is an acceptable limit for such waters. Evaluation of the performance of the new method with NIR and NIR-SWIR switching schemes using in-situ L-w(lambda) measurements from highly turbid waters off Point Calimere (on the southeast coast of India) and other regional waters (NOMAD in-situ L-w(lambda) data) shows an apparent improvement in L-w(lambda) retrievals with the new method over NIR and NIR-SWIR switching schemes (i.e., with a decrease in mean relative error by 22.59% and 23.06% respectively). The performance of the new method is demonstrated for several MODIS-Aqua imageries of optically contrasted and complex waters (containing different in-water and floating algal blooms), and yields physically realistic water-leaving (or surface-leaving) radiances in all visible bands. By contrast, the NIR and NIR-SWIR switching schemes show large distortions in L-w(lambda) structures with large negative values across the visible bands. These results suggest that the new method will have important implications for satellite remote sensing of optically complex waters, since the accuracy of bio-geophysical products derived from such data mainly depends on the water-leaving radiance products delivered by the atmospheric correction algorithm.

Large-scale impact of Saharan dust on the North Atlantic Ocean circulation	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The potential for a dynamical impact of Saharan mineral dust on the North Atlantic Ocean large-scale circulation is investigated. To this end, an ocean general circulation model forced by atmospheric fluxes is perturbed by an idealized, seasonally varying, net shortwave flux anomaly, as it results from remote sensing observations of aerosol optical thickness representing Saharan dust load in the atmosphere. The dust dynamical impact on the circulation is assessed through a comparison between perturbed and an unperturbed run. Results suggest that, following the dust-induced shortwave irradiance anomaly, a buoyancy anomaly is created in the Atlantic offshore the African coast, which over the course of the time propagates westward into the interior Atlantic while progressively subducting. Changes in the large-scale barotropic and overturning circulations are significant after 3 years, which coincides with the elapsed time required by the bulk of the buoyancy perturbation to reach the western boundary of the North Atlantic. Although small in amplitude, the changes in the meridional overturning are of the same order as interannual-to-decadal variability. Variations in the amplitude of the forcing lead to changes in the amplitude of the response, which is almost linear during the first 3 years. In addition, a fast, but dynamically insignificant, response can be observed to propagate poleward along the eastern boundary of the North Atlantic, which contributes to a nonlinear response in the subpolar region north of 40 degrees N.

Interferometry of infragravity waves off New Zealand	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Wave interferometry is a remote sensing technique, which is increasingly employed in helioseismology, seismology, and acoustics to retrieve parameters of the propagation medium from two-point cross-correlation functions of random wavefields. Here we apply interferometry to yearlong records of seafloor pressure at 28 locations off New Zealand's South Island to investigate propagation and directivity properties of infragravity waves away from shore. A compressed cross-correlation function technique is proposed to make the interferometry of dispersive waves more robust, decrease the necessary noise averaging time, and simplify retrieval of quantitative information from noise cross correlations. The emergence of deterministic wave arrivals from cross correlations of random wavefields is observed up to the maximum range of 692 km between the pressure sensors in the array. Free, linear waves with a strongly anisotropic distribution of power flux density are found to be dominant in the infragravity wavefield. Lowest-frequency components of the infragravity wavefield are largely isotropic. The anisotropy has its maximum in the middle of the spectral band and decreases at the high-frequency end of the spectrum. Highest anisotropy peaks correspond to waves coming from portions of the New Zealand's shoreline. Significant contributions are also observed from waves propagating along the coastline and probably coming from powerful sources in the northeast Pacific. Infragravity wave directivity is markedly different to the east and to the west of the South Island. The northwest coast of the South Island is found to be a net source of the infragravity wave energy.

Observations on bio-optical properties of a phytoplankton bloom in coastal waters off Cochin during the onset of southwest monsoon	INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES												A phytoplankton bloom dominated by Chaetoceros spp. was detected in the Arabian Sea, off Cochin coast during May 2009 coinciding the onset of southwest monsoon with an average chlorophyll a concentration of 8.42 mg m(-3) at four stations (A, C, D & E) of total 7 stations studied in coastal waters situated between latitudes 9 degrees 54'-10 degrees 02' N and longitudes 76 degrees 05'-76 degrees 12' E. All the stations were resampled after seven days and found that the average chlorophyll a concentration at the bloom stations has decreased to 2.91 mg m(-3). The inherent optical properties (chlorophyll a, specific phytoplankton absorption coefficient, chlorophyll scattering coefficient) of water were analyzed from the study area. The physico-chemical parameters like dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity and nutrients were estimated for surface waters in these stations using standard methods. The phytoplankton of the study area was identified and their density was recorded. The phytoplankton community composed primarily of diatom Chaetoceros sp. in all the stations, with a percentage composition greater than 55 at the bloom. The highest phytoplankton. density recorded was 4,89,578 cell no./1 at station D. Samples from the bloom showed higher specific phytoplankton absorption coefficient [a*(c)(lambda)] than other stations. a*(c)(435) varied from 4.11 to 5.68 m(2)mg(-1) and a*(c) (665) from 1.45 to 1.80 m(2)mg(-1). A survey on purse seine fishery showed a higher pelagic catch in close proximity to the bloom area during this period. Further investigation of absorption properties of blooms using remote sensing at complex case II waters is needed to interpret bio-optical properties as well as fisheries. The present study is the first attempt of this kind off Cochin coast.																	0379-5136	0975-1033				FEB	2014	43	2					289	296										WOS:000334392900020

In our previous paper, a bistatic ocean wave remote sensing system by GPS was proposed to estimate the characteristics of sea swell near a harbor, and was also evaluated by numerical simulations. In the next phase, a prototype system has been developed and some basic experiments have been carried out in a coastal area in order to evaluate the system experimentally. In this paper, we will outline the prototype system. The system mainly consists of an array antenna, a front-end, and an estimator for ocean wave characteristics. Next, we explain that the estimator for ocean wave characteristics can identify each signal reflected from the ocean waves. Finally, the experiments show that the prototype system can receive the reflected signals from the sea-surface near the coast, and estimate the wave period and wavelength in the direction of the array antenna.																	0916-8516	1745-1345				FEB	2014	E97B	2					519	527		10.1587/transcom.E97.B.519								WOS:000331343500031

Vegetation response to hydrologic and geomorphic factors in an arid region of the Baja California Peninsula	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Remotely sensed imageries were used to analyze the response of desert vegetation to physiographic factors and accumulated precipitation in drier and wetter years within a region of > 16,500 km(2) sampled with 5,000 random pixels of 30 m. Vegetation development was indexed by the annual maximum values for greenness (SAVI) and canopy water content (NDII). Precipitation was interpolated from the 0.25A degrees grid of the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission satellite-based estimates, showing a regional average of similar to 55 mm in the wetter year. The vegetation indices were only weakly related to total precipitation, often in a negative sense. Terrain factors that most often affected the vegetation indices, in multiple regression models, were Topographic Wetness Index, elevation, and slope gradient; these often had different signs for SAVI and for NDII. Models for NDII on intrusive igneous rocks gave better results than on extrusive igneous rocks. The strongest patterns in vegetation development were the contrast among Pacific coast, Cordillera, and Gulf coast subregions and the generally stronger results for NDII than SAVI.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				FEB	2014	186	2					1009	1021		10.1007/s10661-013-3435-5								WOS:000329647300030	24078051

The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California, USA forms the upstream component of the largest estuary on the Pacific coast of the Americas. It is a Mediterranean system in steep ecological decline under threat from current and potential climate changes. Goal: Illustrate how climate change impacts on an already fragile system can be monitored with new, advanced remote sensing methods. Describe how remote sensing data can improve monitoring of ecosystem changes. Use examples from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California to illustrate some of the types of ecosystem changes that are expected with climate change, such as changing species composition and dominance, changes in environmental conditions like salinity, water and air temperatures, and precipitation patterns. Show how imaging spectroscopy can provide information about the dynamics of native and invasive estuarine plant communities. Data: Airborne HyMap imaging spectroscopy data of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta collected in June for the years 2004 through 2008. Approximately 65 flightlines covered the Delta each year with 3 x 3 m spatial resolution. Concurrent field data recorded geographical locations and phenology of different aquatic plant species. Airborne LiDAR data rasterized at 1 x 1 m, collected in winter 2007 for the entire Delta, was used to calculate light interception by riparian tree canopies. Analysis method: We used hyperspectral image analysis in various classification algorithms to perform vegetation type and species mapping, and estimate plant densities and functional traits. A radiative transfer model was applied to LiDAR data to estimate the effects of riparian tree canopies on the irradiance budget of the surface waters of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta as a surrogate for potential water temperature increases. Results: New remote sensing techniques and data detected and measured the density and other functional traits of plant communities and species in this delta. Examining the year-to-year locations of pixels containing invasive species shows that they have high rates of persistence, and that the predicted increases in water temperature may improve the habitat conditions for invasive aquatic plant species. Other changes, such as altered precipitation patterns, may affect the hydrograph of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and its turbidity that could further improve the habitat for non-native species, although sea level rise and increasing upstream salinity might produce the opposite effect. Conclusions: The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and Estuary face ecosystem problems that are characteristic of most Mediterranean estuaries. Interactions between the biological and physical conditions in the Delta affect the trajectory of dominance by native and invasive aquatic plant species. Trends in growth and community characteristics associated with predicted impacts of climate change (sea level rise, warmer temperatures, changes in the hydrograph with high winter and low summer outflows) do not provide simple predictions. Individually, the impact of specific environmental changes on the biological components can be predicted, however it is the complex interactions of biological communities with the suite of physical changes that make predictions uncertain. Systematic monitoring of these estuarine environments is critical to achieving sustainable management of these ecosystems and providing the data needed to document and understand change and to identify successful adaptation strategies.

Due to short time terrestrial formation, shallow buried depth and high salinity groundwater, soil salinization is serious and has negative influence on crop growth stages in the Yellow River delta. Traditional method for phenology detection using situ data is far more costly and time consuming, moreover, hard to available for all the fields. Soil salinization differs from place to place. The phenological stage varies from low salinization area to high salinization area. MODIS data provides the possibility for regional dynamic monitoring in a timely and accurate way due to its repeated acquisition and broad area coverage. Aim of this study is to detect major phenology and analyze the spatial distribution characters of phenology affected by soil salinization for winter wheat in the Yellow River delta region based on the MODIS NDVI time-series data. Savitzky-Golay filter procedure was selected to denoise. Decision tree method was used to classify winter wheat from other crops and natural vegetation before phenology detection. Phenology was specified by using defined dynamic threshold method. The phenology of green-up stage, heading stage, and harvesting stage was detected. This study concludes that green-up date generally came in early March, headed in early May and harvested in early June. The overall average green-up date occurred in March 4, heading date in May 7 and harvesting date in June 2. The detection result was consistent with the ground observations result on the whole. The spatial distribution of phenology showed a gradual postponement from inland to coast. Heading date and harvesting stage inland might be about 3 days in advance than those near the sea. Green-up stage inland might be about 6 to 10 days earlier than near the coast. Green-up stage was significantly influenced by soil salinity comparing to heading date and harvesting date. Method proposed in this paper can be used in phenology detection for winter wheat in Yellow River delta region, which has important guiding significance for crop condition evaluation and phenology detection in other coastal salinization area.																	2334-3168						2014							489	493										WOS:000363278300098

This may form the baseline against which future changes can be measured. Measurements of SST also serve as an entry point to characterize the water dynamics along the African coast and to understand where and when changes have taken place, such that possible short-to medium term scenarios can be developed and used as management tools for precautionary measures. Significant advances in TIR technology have been achieved to build the necessary confidence in satellite-based SST measurements for research, as well as for operational and commercial purposes. An effective dissemination of these EO value added products to African institutions and policy-makers is a key condition for long-term sustainability of coastal and marine resources. The chapter presents a variety of applications using TIR images and SST data that have contributed to develop the necessary knowledge and competences that are critical for the implementation of conservation and management strategies at continental, regional and national scales.																			978-94-017-8008-7; 978-94-017-8007-0				2014							55	73		10.1007/978-94-017-8008-7_3	10.1007/978-94-017-8008-7							WOS:000362071100004						
B	Alpers, W		Barale, V; Gade, M		Alpers, Werner			Remote Sensing of African Coastal Waters Using Active Microwaves Instrument	REMOTE SENSING OF THE AFRICAN SEAS												Active microwave instruments flown on satellites to remotely sense the ocean are the radar altimeter, the scatterometer, and the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). While radar altimeter data are mainly used as input for general ocean circulation models and for wind and global wave forecast, scatterometer and SAR data are well suited to investigate singular events in the marine boundary layer and in the ocean. Examples of atmospheric and oceanic phenomena observed by scatterometers and SARs over African coastal waters are presented. Concerning atmospheric phenomena, first near-surface wind fields derived from scatterometer data acquired over a cylone in the Mozambique Channel and over a wind front west of Morocco are presented. Then SAR images showing sea surface signatures of an atmospheric front, atmospheric gravity waves and a wind jet are presented. Quantitative information on the near-surface wind field is derived from two of the four SAR images shown. Concerning oceanic phenomena, three SAR images are presented. The first two SAR images show sea surface signatures of internal waves generated in the Strait of Gibraltar and at the Atlantic shelf west of Morocco and the third one shows sea surface signatures of biogenic surface films in the upwelling region off the coast of Senegal.																			978-94-017-8008-7; 978-94-017-8007-0				2014							75	94		10.1007/978-94-017-8008-7_4	10.1007/978-94-017-8008-7							WOS:000362071100005

A 5-year (2003-2007) series of Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) images was chosen to identify (spectrally) the major constituents of coastal waters under the influence of river discharges. The percent contributions of yellow substance, i.e. coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM), chlorophyll-like pigments of phytoplankton (CHL) and suspended detritus (DET) to the total reflectance (approximated by the sum of reflectances at 443, 555 and 670 nm) were calculated. Ternary plots of these percentages provided some general indications about the relative proportions of CDOM, CHL and DET, according to the impact attributed to each water constituent. The analysis showed that water constituents follow trends linked to the "marine" seasons of the area. The CHL and DET contributions seem to correlate with the timing of cooler (upwelling) periods, while CDOM seems to correlate better with that of warmer periods. The relationship with the Sassandra river runoff is not as evident, even though CDOM increased contributions appear to mirror the weakening of upwelling and the discharge of local rivers. This broad ecosystem outline should be extended to the entire Cote d'Ivoire coastline, to better classify marine waters impacted by upwelling processes or anthropogenic pollution due to river runoff.																			978-94-017-8008-7; 978-94-017-8007-0				2014							135	148		10.1007/978-94-017-8008-7_7	10.1007/978-94-017-8008-7							WOS:000362071100008

Satellite derived Sea Surface Temperature was applied to study upwelling processes in relation to the driving trade winds. The investigations were focussed on the intensity and horizontal extent, the temporal and spatial variability including inter-annual and climate scales. Ocean colour satellite data allow investigation of the response of surface water to the nutrient input into the euphotic zone by upwelling processes. Observations in the area revealed, that the phytoplankton development starts with species absorbing light in the visible spectral range (diatoms and dinoflagellates) and may end in persistent shallow surface filaments with light scattering algae blooms. These blooms of coccolithophores identified by different in situ methods changed the water colour by strong particle scattering to milky turquoise discolorations. Further milky turquoise discolorations were identified as sulphur plumes. Low wind periods support the degradation of organic matter and the development of hydrogen sulphide in the bottom layer. After the onset of the trade winds and the offshore transport of surface water hydrogen sulphide enriched waters reaches with the near-bottom counter current the coast. Upwelling transports the water to the surface where the hydrogen sulphide will be oxidised to elemental sulphur. An algorithm was developed to identify and separate the sulphur plumes from algae blooms and other features on the basis of highly spectrally resolved satellite data from the MERIS sensor. The algorithm identified only coastal plumes as sulphur and that offshore plumes are formed by coccolithophores. The sulphur season is the boreal spring starting in February and reaching the maximum in April.

Strong evaporation rates above the current core and the Retroflection reduce the number of cloud-free observations from Infra-Red sensors, while microwave radiometers and altimeters measurements suffer from the proximity of the current to the coast in the northern region. Infra-Red observations of the Agulhas Current significantly improved with the launch of the Meteosat Second Generation satellite, but Infra-Red Sea Surface Temperature datasets still suffer from inadequate cloud masking algorithms, particularly in regions of strong temperature gradient. Despite both Sea Surface Height and Sea Surface Temperature observations being severely compromised in the northern Agulhas current, a synergetic use of merged altimetry and high frequency Infra-Red Sea Surface Temperature imagery provides a means to track deep-sea eddies, document their influence on the Agulhas Current and helps us improve our understanding of the Agulhas Current variability.

The annual winter sea ice in the Bohai Bay has become a natural disaster which affects the port manipulation, shipping transportation severely. At present, the remote sensing technology has been very mature in sea ice monitoring. As one of the most important multispectral data source in China, HJ satellite data is commonly used in every aspect of marine, resources and environment. In this paper, we takes the HJ-1A/B CCD data as the data source to monitor the sea ice happened on Bohai bay west coast along Tianjin City in early 2010. By a standard technology method composed of data preprocessing, unsupervised classification, object-oriented classification, post-classification etc., we get the sea ice extraction results rapidly and accurately. By analyzing and contrasting the different period's results, we monitor and trend the sea ice growth which is accordant with the actual situation. The remote sensing image of HJ-1A/B data with high time-space resolution can provide powerful technical support for the analysis of the real-time sea ice monitoring and it's meaningful for port construction and shipping transportation.																			978-1-4799-5835-1				2014							558	562										WOS:000361018900104

Atmospheric composition and thermodynamic retrievals from the ARIES airborne TIR-FTS system - Part 2: Validation and results from aircraft campaigns	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												This study validates trace gas and thermodynamic retrievals from nadir infrared spectroscopic measurements recorded by the UK Met Office Airborne Research Interferometer Evaluation System (ARIES) - a thermal infrared, Fourier transform spectrometer (TIR-FTS) on the UK Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM) BAe-146 aircraft. Trace-gas-concentration and thermodynamic profiles have been retrieved and validated for this study throughout the troposphere and planetary boundary layer (PBL) over a range of environmental variability using data from aircraft campaigns over and around London, the US Gulf Coast, and the Arctic Circle during the Clear air for London (ClearfLo), Joint Airborne IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) Validation Experiment (JAIVEx), and Measurements, process studies, and Modelling (MAMM) aircraft campaigns, respectively. Vertically resolved retrievals of temperature and water vapour (H2O), and partial-column retrievals of methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O-3) (over both land and sea) were compared to corresponding measurements from high-precision in situ analysers and dropsondes operated on the FAAM aircraft. Average degrees of freedom for signal (DOFS) over a 0-9 km column range were found to be 4.97, 3.11, 0.91, 1.10, and 1.62 for temperature, H2O, CH4, CO, and O-3, respectively, when retrieved on 10 vertical levels. Partial-column mean biases (and bias standard error) between the surface and similar to 9 km, when averaged across all flight campaigns, were found to be 0.7(+/-0.3) K, 479(+/-56) ppm, 11(+/-2) ppb, 3.3(+/-1.0) ppb, and C3.5(+/-1.0) ppb, respectively, whilst the typical a posteriori (total) uncertainties for individually retrieved profiles were 0.4, 9.5, 5.0, 21.2, and 15.0 %, respectively. Averaging kernels (AKs) derived for progressively lower altitudes show improving sensitivity to lower atmospheric layers when flying at lower altitudes. Temperature and H2O display significant vertically resolved sensitivity throughout the column, whilst trace gases are usefully retrieved only as partial-column quantities, with maximal sensitivity for trace gases other than H2O within a layer 1 and 2 km below the aircraft. This study demonstrates the valuable atmospheric composition information content that can be obtained by ARIES nadir TIR remote sensing for atmospheric process studies.

J	Lee, JFJ; Williams, J				Lee, Jing-Fong Jennifer; Williams, Jeffrey			New Way to Utilize Remote Sensing Data Automated Road Travel Survey	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD												Travel behavior analysis and demand models have been relying on data collected from households through questionnaires. This study demonstrated a combined analysis of the license plates obtained through remote sensing of vehicle emissions, Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) address records, and census proxies of those addresses, referred to collectively as an automated road travel survey (ARTS). This study demonstrated an application of the ARTS method to the analysis of the income distribution of motorists in Los Angeles, California, at a spatially and temporally disaggregated level. The demonstration used the data of 1 day from a single study site obtained in 2007 by the California South Coast Air Quality Management District. By a match of 4,704 license plate images to California DMV registration records, anonymized individual ownership records were obtained. The missing demographic and socioeconomic profiles of vehicle owners were supplemented with census data at the level of census block groups. In contrast to household-based methods such as traditional travel surveys, ARTS provided several advantages: (a) the precise time log of the trips, (b) fewer missing data because correct license numbers are registered for most of the vehicles passing a monitoring site, and (c) data for any desired length of monitoring time at minimal cost. When linked to ownership databases, remote sensing data opened new avenues for research into travel behavior, complementary to travel surveys.																	0361-1981	2169-4052					2014		2460					15	21		10.3141/2460-02								WOS:000351656900002

A large number of highresolution TerraSAR-X and Radarsat-2 images of five test areas along the German North Sea coast were acquired in 2012 and 2013 and form the basis for the present investigation. Depending on the type of sediment, but also on the water level and on environmental conditions (wind speed) exposed sediments may show up on SAR imagery as areas of enhanced, or reduced, radar backscattering. The (multi-temporal) analysis of series of such images allows for the detection of mussel beds, and our results show evidence that also single-acquisition, multi-polarization SAR imagery can be used for that purpose.																	2153-6996		978-1-4799-5775-0				2014							1218	1221		10.1109/IGARSS.2014.6946651								WOS:000349688101169

Through time, both temporal and spatial resolution of the sea ice data offered to the end users improved. In this line of thought, the IcePAC project aims to offer, in the actual context of climate change, concise and both spatially and temporally precise information on sea ice most probable behavior, especially along the coastal regions, where high-resolution information is hardly available. To achieve that goal, we propose two probabilistic models based on frequency analysis. First, a regional scale (12.5 km) model built from passive microwave imagery will provide ice probability information for the complete spatial domain. Secondly, a local scale (250 m) model, built using optical MODIS and SAR Radarsat-1 ice maps data will help give precise information along the coastal regions. In the end, both models are to be available for queries through an online web mapping interface.																	2153-6996		978-1-4799-5775-0				2014							3961	3964		10.1109/IGARSS.2014.6947352								WOS:000349688105132

A Saharan dust event transported significant amounts of mineral dust into the troposphere along the path of the tropic wave Invest 99L, which formed into Hurricane Sandy. The Terra/Aqua-MODIS observations clearly define the spatial distribution of the coarse/fine aerosols, while the CALIPSO observations of Sandy development provide a clear view, vertical structure and aerosols type of the dust-laden layer. CALIPSO aerosol types map revealed the varying dust abundance before, during and after Sandy development. Six zones between the West African coast and the central Caribbean were examined during the period that the mineral dust moved across the mid-Atlantic.

Tidal flat reflectance is sensitive to conditions that constantly change and cause variation of interstitial water contents along with exposure time, remnant water, etc. It is difficult to retrieve sediment grain size from optical reflectance alone without correcting the tidal condition effects. In this study, the tidal flat surface reflectance model according to grain size is proposed by two-step PCA transformation to remove tidal effects. The proposed method showed a potential to classify sediment by grain size regardless of exposure time and tidal conditions. We applied the method to nine scenes of LANDSAT TM images acquired between 1988 and 2009. The preliminary results well demonstrated that the proposed approach is effective to monitor changes of grain size distribution at a large scale independent of tidal conditions. However, this method has a limitation particularly over the vegetated areas and sand shoals mainly because of strong reflection in the NIR channels compared with other areas. For the validation, this study requires further field survey to obtain more in-situ data.

Estonia has a shoreline length of approximately 3800 km, due to many islands, bays, and peninsulas. Coast monitoring with traditional surveying methods would be time consuming and expensive. Remote sensing by means of airborne laser scanning (ALS) could be an alternative to traditional coastal surveying methods. Accordingly, the aim of the study is to determine whether ALS data can be used to quantify volume changes along shorelines. The case study utilizes ALS data acquired by the Estonian Land Board in 2008-2011. The ALS flights are conducted in different altitudes (yielding a varying point density) and seasons (spring, summer). Study shows also that accuracy of readily available ALS data products may not be suited for the most demanding applications. Certain computational principles and methods need to be applied for remove systematical biases between different ALS campaigns. The methods and algorithms that where developed and tested during this study yield sub-decimetre accuracy for detecting contemporary coastal processes. Thus, ALS data can be used as an alternative to traditional coastal monitoring methods.																			978-609-457-640-9				2014										10.3846/enviro.2014.208								WOS:000349542000209

The New Caledonia lagoon lies in the Southwestern Tropical Pacific around 21 degrees 30' S and 166 degrees 30' E, with a great marine biodiversity in UNESCO Heritage coral reefs, benthic sea grass, and benthic communities. They are largely connected to the open ocean in the southern and eastern parts, but only by narrow passes in the southwest part. The trophic state is linked to spatial variations in flushing times. High run offs due to rain carrying abundant chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and particle loads may greatly impact the functioning of ecosystems while rivers and sewage effluents may induce localized impacts. Two oceanographic cruises (CALIOPE 1 in 2011 and CALIOPE 2 in 2014) were carried out off the Eastern Coast of New Caledonia during a calm dry period and during high winds, respectively. Multi-and hyper-spectral marine reflectance was measured with a SIMBADA instrument and a TRIOS radiometer system, together with inherent optical properties (total and CDOM absorption coefficients with a PSICAM, in situ absorption and scattering with an AC9, backscattering with a Hydroscat-6). Fluorescence of CDOM (EEM/PARAFAC) was measured on collected 0.2 mu m filtered samples. In 2014, Satlantic and FieldSpec hyper-spectral radiometers were available for in-water profiling of upwelling radiance and downwelling irradiance and above-water reflectance measurements, respectively. Inherent and apparent optical data from the two cruises are compared and used to estimate ocean color algorithms performance and evaluate a Linear Matrix Inversion method, providing tools for remote sensing on this highly under-sampled coastal region of New Caledonia.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-62841-328-1				2014	9261								UNSP 92610M	10.1117/12.2073309								WOS:000348837900014

Automatic Detection of Marine Surfactants by MODIS Sunglint Imagery: A Study Case of Biogenic Films off the Southeastern Coast of Brazil	OCEAN REMOTE SENSING AND MONITORING FROM SPACE	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Ocean Remote Sensing and Monitoring from Space	OCT 15-16, 2014	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	SPIE, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Natl Aeronaut & Space Adm, Minist Earth Sci				Global monitoring of marine surfactants is important for understanding the heat, particle, momentum, and gas exchanges between the ocean and atmosphere. Observing the sunglint, i.e., the specular reflection between Sun, sea surface, and sensor, which intensity depends on the geometry of acquisition, has the potential to improve surfactants detection. The basis of the approach is that surfactants modify surface roughness, therefore the probability distribution of observing reflection by wave facets in the sensor field-of-view. An automatic method to detect surfactants from optical imagery under Sun glint conditions is presented. The method consists in comparing modeled normalized radiance (for clean water and surfactant contaminated water) with observed values. Application to MODIS imagery acquired off the Southwest Coast of Brazil in January 2003 demonstrates the method's feasibility, revealing the presence of biogenic films formed by Trichodesmium colonies. The presence of the N-2 fixing cyanobacteria was verified independently from in-situ measurements and ocean color remote sensing. An advantage of the glint-based method over detection methods using SAR imagery is the good spatial resolution (250 m) and the capability to detect surfactants at low wind speeds (< 2 m/s), impractical to SAR sensors due to the absence of Bragg scattering. Discriminating the type of surfactant, i.e., biogenic versus mineral, requires additional information, such as spectral marine reflectance.

In this study, to establish a comprehensive monitoring system of HAB outbreaks (particularly Cochlodinium polykrikoides blooms) in the southern coast of Korea (SCK), we tested the several proposed red-tide detection methods using SeaWiFS and MODIS ocean color data. Temporal and spatial information of red tide events from 2002 to 2013 were obtained from the National Fisheries Research and Development of Korea (NFRDI), which were matched with synchronously obtained satellite-derived ocean color data. The spectral characteristics of C. polykrikoides red tides were that increased phytoplankton absorption at 443 nm and pigment backscattering 555 nm resulted in a steeper slope between 488 and 555 nm with a hinge point at 488 (or 490) nm. On the other hand, non-red tide water, typically were presented by broader radiance spectra between the blue and green bands were associated with reduced pigment absorption and backscattering. The analysis of ocean color imageries that captured C. polykrikoides red tide blooms showed discolored waters with enhanced pigment concentrations, high chlorophyll, fluorescence, absorption at 443 nm. However, most red tide detection algorithms found a large number of false positive but only a small number of true positive areas. These proposed algorithms are not useful to distinguish true red tide water from complex non-red tide water. Our proposed method substantially reduces the false signal rate (false positive) from strong absorption at short wavelengths and provide a more reliable and robust detection of C. polykrikoides blooms in the SCK from the space.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-328-1				2014	9261								UNSP 92610P	10.1117/12.2068978								WOS:000348837900017

The GOCI has a local coverage area of the western Pacific Ocean including Bohai, Yellow Sea and East Sea of China. Jiaozhou Bay is a semienclosed basin in the western part of the Yellow Sea, which is an important representative of gulf ecosystem in the North Temperate Zone. The GOCI data can provide useful information with an-hour temporal and 500-m spatial resolutions for monitoring oceanic and atmospheric process in Jiaozhou Bay. The performance of the atmospheric and optical algorithms of GOCI was evaluated by comparing with the simultaneous data from MODIS/Aqua. The match-up products include remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) and chlorophyll-a concentration ([chl-a]) and they were derived by GDPS software for GOCI data and SeaDAS software for MODIS and GOCI data, respectively, using default atmospheric correction and bio-optical algorithms. Our analyses show that GOCI products (i.e., R-rs(490), R-rs(555) and [chl-a]) are compared well with MODIS products. GOCI shows a potential capability of oceanography investigations in Jiaozhou Bay and Qingdao coastal area. The consistency of Rrs between GOCI and MODIS is relatively good but significant difference was observed in [chl-a] especially in Jiaozhou Bay. Moreover, it is suggested to improve GOCI standard atmospheric correction algorithm for high turbid water and cloud detection to increase data utilization.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-328-1				2014	9261								926118	10.1117/12.2069114								WOS:000348837900028

There are lots of coral islands in the south sea of China. Remote sensing survey for the coastline not only can reassert the necessity and importance of coral protection, but also can provide basic data and scientific basis for island ecologic protection, reasonable utilization of land resources. The study area named Zhao Shu Island lies in Jintong Islands of Xisha. It is a coral island which has people inhabited. Using WorldView-2 satellite remote sensing images as data sources we carry out three phases of coastline investigation and monitoring. The satellite data phases are 2002, 2010 and 2013. Firstly, affirm the bands valuable for color composition on the basis of spectral and correlation analysis. Then extract the coastline by a series of image process, such as image correction, fusion, waterline extraction and coastline revision. Finally determine the coastline types and length by artificial interpretation. The results show that the island length is gradually smaller, which means the island area is reducing. The beach bedrock coast in northern island was eroded seriously especially during the period between 2010 and 2013. In addition, the shoal head shape in the western island changed a lot.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-385-4				2014	9299								UNSP 929904	10.1117/12.2069483								WOS:000349376400004

In this paper we use a case study to show how we monitor the Portuguese coast, between the period 2000 to 2014, using free available multi-temporal Landsat imagery (ETM+ and OLI sensors). First, all the multispectral images are panshaperned to meet the 15 meters spatial resolution of the panchromatic images. Second, using the Modification of Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and kmeans clustering method we extract the raster shoreline for each image acquisition time. Third, each raster shoreline is smoothed and vectorized using a penalized least square method. Fourth, using an image composed by five synthetic bands and an unsupervised classification method we extract the primary sand dunes. Finally, the visual comparison of the thematic primary sand dunes maps shows that an effective monitoring system can be implemented easily using free available remote sensing imagery data and open source software (QGIS and Orfeo toolbox).

Hyperspectral band selection and Classification of Hyperion image of Bhitarkanika mangrove ecosystem, eastern India	REMOTE SENSING FOR AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS, AND HYDROLOGY XVI	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XVI was part of the International Symposium on Remote Sensing	SEP 22-25, 2014	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS	SPIE				Tropical mangrove forests along the coast evolve dynamically due to constant changes in the natural ecosystem and ecological cycle. Remote sensing has paved the way for periodic monitoring and conservation of such floristic resources, compared to labour intensive in-situ observations. With the laboratory quality image spectra obtained from hyperspectral image data, species level discrimination in habitats and ecosystems is attainable. One of the essential steps before classification of hyperspectral image data is band selection. It is important to eliminate the redundant bands to mitigate the problems of Hughes effect that are likely to affect further image analysis and classification accuracy. This paper presents a methodology for the selection of appropriate hyperspectral bands from the EO-1 Hyperion image for the identification and mapping of mangrove species and coastal landcover types in the Bhitarkanika coastal forest region, eastern India. Band selection procedure follows class based elimination procedure and the separability of the classes are tested in the band selection process. Individual bands are de-correlated and redundant bands are removed from the bandwise correlation matrix. The percent contribution of class variance in each band is analysed from the factors of PCA component ranking. Spectral bands are selected from the wavelength groups and statistically tested. Further, the band selection procedure is compared with similar techniques (Band Index and Mutual information) for validation. The number of bands in the Hyperion image was reduced from 196 to 88 by the Factor-based ranking approach. Classification was performed by Support Vector Machine approach. It is observed that the proposed Factor-based ranking approach performed well in discriminating the mangrove species and other landcover units compared to the other statistical approaches. The predominant mangrove species Heritiera fomes, Excoecaria agallocha and Cynometra ramiflora are spectral identified and the health status of these species are assessed by the selected band. Further, the performance of this band selection approaches are evaluated in multi-sensor image fusion for better mapping of mangrove ecosystems, wherein spatial resolution is enhanced while retaining the optimal number of hyperspectral bands.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-302-1				2014	9239								UNSP 923914	10.1117/12.2067483								WOS:000348312800030

To get a general spatial picture of the water quality of the Romanian coast, it is not only time consuming, but also hard to measure with traditional in situ sampling. To solve these issues, methods have been developed to use close range spectral measurements for accurate and cheap assessments in real-time for the concentrations of Chlorophyll-a, Total Suspended Matter and water transparency. This paper presents the applicability of a state-of-the-art hand-held hyper-spectral sensor and a simple water transparency indicator for monitoring water quality. The fieldwork was conducted during the summer of 2013 on the Romanian coast of the Black Sea. The same techniques are used to calculate these parameters from satellite images (MODIS). The validation results and potential applications of the instruments will be discussed.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-302-1				2014	9239								UNSP 923913	10.1117/12.2067415								WOS:000348312800029

Detecting biogenic pollution in Rybinsk Reservoir from satellite data and contact measurements	REMOTE SENSING OF THE OCEAN, SEA ICE, COASTAL WATERS, AND LARGE WATER REGIONS 2014	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Remote Sensing of the Ocean, Sea Ice, Coastal Waters, and Large Water Regions	SEP 24-25, 2014	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS	SPIE				The problem of excessive algae bloom in Volga River and adjacent reservoirs has long been acknowledged. Massive algae bloom causes serious economic damage and represents a threat to water inhabitants as well as man's life and health. From ecological point of view, cyanobacteria are the most dangerous algae type. The detection of areas most affected by algae bloom using remote sensing instruments was performed on the basis of data obtained from the following sensors: TM Landsat-5; ETM+ Landsat-7; OLI Landsat-8; Envisat MERIS and ASAR. Landsat data were used to compile color composites and select bands, the combination of which provides the best detection results. Visible satellite data were found to better manifest eutrophication zones with predomination of cyanobacteria. Envisat MERIS was used to compile suspended matter concentration charts providing rough estimates of algae content. Envisat ASAR data were compared with quasi-simultaneous visible range data. In-situ measurements of algae properties in Rybinsk Reservoir have been performed for many years by researchers of the I.D. Papanin Inland Water Biology Institute located on its coast. They regularly perform cruises to collect water samples and determine phytoplankton content. Joint analysis of Landsat-7/8 and contact data resulted in good correlation of both bloom areas of diatoms, which predominated in June 2013, and those of cyanobacteria, the lifecycle peak of which was recorded in late August - early September.

Acting as the 'backbone' of the west coast of the peninsula, the NSE stretches from the Malaysian-Thai border in the north to the border with neighbouring Singapore in the south, linking several major cities and towns along the way. North-South Expressway in Malaysia contributes to the country economic development through trade, social and tourism sector. Presently, the highway is good in terms of its condition and connection to every state but some locations need urgent attention. Stability of slopes at these locations is of most concern as any instability can cause danger to the motorist. In this paper, two study locations have been analysed; they are Gua Tempurung (soil slope) and Jelapang (rock slope) which are obviously having two different characteristics. These locations passed through undulating terrain with steep slopes where landslides are common and the probability of slope instability due to human activities in surrounding areas is high. A combination of twelve (12) landslide conditioning factors database on slope stability such as slope degree and slope aspect were extracted from IFSAR (interoferometric synthetic aperture radar) while landuse, lithology and structural geology were constructed from interpretation of high resolution satellite data from World View II, Quickbird and Ikonos. All this information was analysed in geographic information system (GIS) environment for landslide susceptibility mapping using probabilistic based frequency ratio model. Consequently, information on the slopes such as inventories, condition assessments and maintenance records were assessed through total expressway maintenance management system or better known as TEMAN. The above mentioned system is used by PLUS as an asset management and decision support tools for maintenance activities along the highways as well as for data quality checking and integrity. In this study, TEMAN data were further analysed and subsequently integrated with landslide susceptible map for Gua Tempurung and Jelapang area in Perak.

Remote sensing of the El Hierro submarine volcanic eruption plume	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Submarine volcanic eruptions took place at the island El Hierro (Canary Islands) between October 2011 and March 2012. The event produced plumes of discoloured waters due to the discharge of volcanic matter, magmatic gases, and hydrothermal fluids. The expelled materials, which behaved like oceanic tracers, were detected from the site of the volcano to the open sea by remote-sensing techniques using different level-2 (L2) products of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. In order to assess the effect of the anomalous turbidity, three atmospheric correction schemes were evaluated: SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS) standard, near-infrared-shortwave-infrared (NIR-SWIR), and Management Unit of the North Sea Mathematical Models (MUMM). The comparison between them verified that the SeaDAS standard atmospheric correction was the most suitable. The downwelling diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (K-d(490)) was used as a measure of plume intensity in comparison with other submarine volcanic eruptions. The MODIS-derived K-d(490) values verified that the intensity of the El Hierro plume was moderate. Only in some specific situations did the values barely exceed 0.4 m (1). The remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs) was used for the characterization of the affected waters. The R-rs spectra also allowed a comparison with other volcanic and sulphide events reported in previous studies. Similarities were found, both with submarine volcanic eruptions in the southwestern Pacific and with sulphide events at the Namibian coast, in composition and properties of optically active water constituents. A classification schema based on K-d(490) values and R-rs ratios was developed and used in connection with MODIS red-green-blue (RGB) composites as well as surface current velocities from altimeter missions to investigate the spatio-temporal development of the volcanic plume. The spreading and transport of volcanic material observed at the ocean surface was caused by the predominant surface currents coupled with different mesoscale eddies. Discoloured waters were identified more than 200 km away from the eruption site. Field data from oceanographic surveys verified the high concentration of sulphur compounds in affected waters and confirmed the overestimation by the MODIS default algorithm of chlorophyll-a concentrations in the volcanic plume.

On direct passive microwave remote sensing of sea spray aerosol production	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												This study addresses and attempts to mitigate persistent uncertainty and scatter among existing approaches for determining the rate of sea spray aerosol production by breaking waves in the open ocean. The new approach proposed here utilizes passive microwave emissions from the ocean surface, which are known to be sensitive to surface roughness and foam. Direct, simultaneous, and collocated measurements of the aerosol production and microwave emissions were collected aboard the FLoating Instrument Platform (FLIP) in deep water similar to 150 km off the coast of California over a period of similar to 4 days. Vertical profiles of coarse-mode aerosol (0.25-23.5 mu m) concentrations were measured with a forward-scattering spectrometer and converted to surface flux using dry deposition and vertical gradient methods. Back-trajectory analysis of eastern North Pacific meteorology verified the clean marine origin of the sampled air mass over at least 5 days prior to measurements. Vertical and horizontal polarization surface brightness temperature were measured with a microwave radiometer at 10.7 GHz frequency. Data analysis revealed a strong sensitivity of the brightness temperature polarization difference to the rate of aerosol production. An existing model of microwave emission from the ocean surface was used to determine the empirical relationship and to attribute its underlying physical basis to microwave emissions from surface roughness and foam within active and passive phases of breaking waves.

However, clouds are transparent to microwaves, and satellites with L-band radiometers have recently been put into orbit to monitor sea surface salinity (SSS). Previous studies have used the mixing of fluvial colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) near coasts, where the mixing is approximately conservative over short time scales, to estimate SSS. In this study, the usual relationship between CDOM and salinity in the ECS has been used in reverse to estimate CDOM from remotely sensed SSS in the ECS and compare that CDOM with MODIS data. The SSS data used are 7 day composites from NASA's Aquarius/SAC-D satellite which has an L-band radiometer. The challenges in using this approach are that 1) Aquarius SSS has coarse spatial resolution (150 km), and 2) the ECS has numerous anthropogenic sources of radiofrequency interference which adds noise to the L-band signal for the SSS retrievals. Despite the limits in the method, CDOM distribution in the ECS can be estimated under cloudy conditions. In addition to all-weather retrievals, an additional advantage of the approach is that the algorithm provides an estimate of CDOM absorption that is unaffected by the spectrally similar detritus absorption that can confound optical remote sensing estimates of CDOM.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-048-8				2014	9111								UNSP 91110A	10.1117/12.2052951								WOS:000343862700008

EVALUATION OF SUSTAINABILITY INDICES AND INDICATORS IN THE PAPHOS DISTRICT AREA IN CYPRUS	SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT (RSCY2014)	Proceedings of SPIE				2nd International Conference on Remote Sensing and Geoinformation of the Environment (RSCy)	APR 07-10, 2014	Paphos, CYPRUS	Cyprus Remote Sensing Soc, Cyprus Univ Technol, European Space Agcy, Cyprus Sci & Tech Chamber, Dept Meteorol & Minist Def, Minist Coomun & Works, Dept Elect Commun, Agr Res Inst, Hellas Sat, Neapolis Univ, Frederick Univ, European Cooperat Sci & Technol, Intergraph, Geosystems Hellas, Li Cor, Spectra Vista Corp, Cyprus Assoc Civil Engineers, Agisoft, QuestUAV, Smart Events, Pegeia Municipal, Municipal Pafos				During the last decades most of the coastal zones across the Mediterranean Sea concentrates population around polescities owing to the mass movement of people from the rural areas to urban areas. The extensive tourism development across the coast generates demand of new work positions and pressurizes the environment. The economic development increase the natural capital of the study areas increase the covered with buildings and infrastructures areas and as a consequence reduce the quality of life. All the above effects modify the density of the buildings and infrastructures, push and eliminate the free green covered areas and other open spaces. In order to measure the effects on the environment and the quality of life a composite index is developed which arises using combined indices using economical, social and environmental criteria. The above components give a realistic indicator of the effects on the environment. This unique index arises as a function of the ratios of a per capital income a ratio of cover area by the uncovered area and the density of people per unit area. Usually when the wealth is increased the demand of energy and goods also increased and the damage on environment becomes bigger. This paper explores how the application of sustainability indices can be used as a tool to assess the quality of life. The use of GIS and remote sensing is highlighted to support the application of the existing sustainability indices.

Remote gas plume sensing and imaging with NASA's Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES)	NEXT-GENERATION SPECTROSCOPIC TECHNOLOGIES VII	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Next-Generation Spectroscopic Technologies VII	MAY 05-06, 2014	Baltimore, MD	SPIE				The hyperspectral thermal emission spectrometer was developed under NASA's instrument incubator program and has now completed three deployments. The scan head uses a state-of-the-art Dyson spectrometer cooled to 100K coupled to a quantum well infrared photodetector array held at 40K. The combination allows for 256 spectral channels between 7.5 mu m and 12 mu m with 512 cross track spatial pixels. Spectral features for many interesting gases fall within the instrument passband. We first review the pre-flight calibration and validation process for HyTES using a suite of instrumentation. This includes a smile measurement at two wavelengths (8.18 mu m and 10.6 mu m) as well as a concentration determination using large aperture gas cells. We then show positive gas plume detection at ranges >1000m for various cases: Ammonia gas detection from Salton Sea fumaroles, Methane detection from staged releases points in Wyoming as well as naturally occurring methane hot spots off the coast of Santa Barbara.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-038-9				2014	9101								91010V	10.1117/12.2049005								WOS:000342581800027

W.; Chang, Lisa T. -C.; Li, Yubin			Rainfall Prediction for Landfalling Tropical Cyclones: Perspectives of Mitigation	TYPHOON IMPACT AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT	Advances in Natural and Technological Hazards Research											The torrential rainfall associated with landfalling tropical cyclones (TCs) often represents the major impact to coastal regions, but at the same time an enormous challenge to meteorologists and forecasts. This chapter first discusses the complex dynamical processes involved in TC landfalls, which are related to the increased surface roughness and reduced surface moisture fluxes of land. The result is often certain patterns of convection and rainfall asymmetry in the landfalling TCs, but these patterns are not well explained by current theories or conceptual models. With emphasis of development of rainfall prediction techniques according to the needs of mitigation, the requirements on the skill of rainfall forecasts from the perspectives of mitigation are reviewed. Then, the operation and performance of several statistical TC rainfall models are discussed including the rainfall climatology-persistence model (R-CLIPER) for the Taiwan area. A topographic component is developed for R-CLIPER through multiple regression analyses, which improves the model's performance in reproducing the local extreme rain that is lacking in the original model. Finally, the importance of utilizing remote-sensing data in TC rainfall prediction is discussed, and how TC rainfall statistical models can be applied to risk analyses under the consideration of global changes.																			978-3-642-40695-9; 978-3-642-40694-2				2014	40						175	201		10.1007/978-3-642-40695-9_8	10.1007/978-3-642-40695-9							WOS:000338255800009						
J	Sambah, A; Miura, F				Sambah, Abu Bakar; Miura, Fusanori			Remote sensing and spatial multi-criteria analysis for tsunami vulnerability assessment	DISASTER PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT												Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess the vulnerability of the Kesennuma area in Japan to a tsunami disaster and to map the area of inundation. Design/methodology/approach - Digital elevation model (DEM) data and ALOS image were used to create maps of the parameters of this study area: elevation, slope, coastal proximity, river, and land use. An analytical hierarchy process was used to assign weights to each parameter and a spatial multi-criteria analysis was applied through cell-based modelling for vulnerability mapping. Findings - The vulnerability map shows that 17.679 km(2) of the area could be inundated by a tsunami. High vulnerability areas were mostly found in coastal areas with a sloping coast and a cape area. A low elevation and the presence of rivers or water channels are factors that increase the impact of tsunamis. Inundation areas were predicted to spread in areas identified as having either high vulnerability or slightly high vulnerability. Research limitations/implications - Because of the limited geospatial data, the authors encourage further studies using DEM data with a high spatial resolution. Practical implications - The results of this research can be used as basic information for disaster mitigation and urban planning in coastal areas. Originality/value - This research creates a new approach for assessing which areas could be inundated by tsunamis, based on the vulnerability map generated through remote sensing and spatial multi-criteria analysis. Moreover, the parameters used are very close to those of actual inundation maps.

Effect of optically active substances and atmospheric correction schemes on remote-sensing reflectance at a coastal site off Kochi	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The present study focused on understanding the variability of optically active substances (OASs) and their effect on spectral remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs). Furthermore, the effect of atmospheric correction schemes on the retrieval of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) from satellite data was also analysed. The OASs considered here are chl-a, coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and total suspended matter (TSM). Satellite data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Aqua satellite was used for this study. The two atmospheric correction schemes considered were: multi-scattering with two-band model selection NIR correction (hereon referred as 'A1') and Management Unit of the North Sea Mathematical Models (MUMM) correction and MUMM NIR calculation (hereafter referred as 'A2'). The default MODIS bio-optical algorithm (OC3M) was used for the retrieval of chl-a. Analysis of OASs showed that chl-a was the major light-absorbing component, with highly variable distribution (0.006-25.85 mg m(-3)). Absorption due to CDOM at 440 nm (aCDOM440) varied from 0.002 to 0.31 m(-1) whereas TSM varied from 0.005 to 33.44 mg l(-1). The highest concentration of chl-a was observed from August to November (i. e. end of the southwest monsoon and beginning of the northeast monsoon), which was attributed to coastal upwelling. The average value of aCDOM440 was found to be lower than the global mean. A significant negative relationship between aCDOM440 and salinity during the southwest monsoon indicated that much of the CDOM during this season was derived from river discharge. Spectral Rrs was found to be strongly linked to the variability in chl-a concentration, indicating that chl-a was the major light-absorbing component. Satellite-derived spectral Rrs was in good agreement with that in situ when chl-a concentration was lower than 5 mg m(-3). The validation of chl-a, derived from in situ Rrs, showed moderate performance (correlation coefficient, R-2 = 0.64; log(10)(RMSE) = 0.434; absolute percentage difference (APD) = 43.6% and relative percentage difference (RPD) = 42.33%). However the accuracy of the algorithm was still within acceptable limits. The statistical analysis for atmospheric correction schemes showed improved mean ratio of measured to estimated chl-a ('r' = 1.6), log10(RMSE) (0.49), APD (25.46%), and RPD (17.57%) in the case of A1 as compared with A2, whereas in the case of A2, R-2 (0.56), slope (0.26), and intercept (0.27) were better as compared with A1. The two atmospheric correction schemes did not show any significant statistical difference. However the default atmospheric correction scheme (A1) was found to be performing comparatively better probably due to the fact that the concentration of TSM and CDOM was much lower to overcome the impact of chl-a.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2014	35	14			SI		5434	5447		10.1080/01431161.2014.926420								WOS:000340477400011

To calibration curve as the foundation, the CDOM samples concentration of various sources was determined after analyzing CDOM sample from Dalian coast of the northern Yellow Sea sewage into the sea and natural sea. Based on the comparative analysis on CDOM fluorescence fingerprint, the main component of water CDOM were determined. The results showed that in Dalian coastal waters of the northern Yellow Sea, the main component of CDOM in natural seawater is tryptophan and in urban sewage discharged into the sea are tryptophan, tyrosine, and humic acid. On the basis of comprehensive analysis of CDOM fluorescence and absorption spectral, the thinking of synergy inversion of CDOM absorption spectral slope S by connecting fluorescence and ocean color remote sensing is put forward.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-176-8				2014	9158								91580Y	10.1117/12.2063749								WOS:000338580600033

Understanding community-habitat associations of temperate reef fishes using fine-resolution bathymetric measures of physical structure	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Multibeam sonar (MBS) hydro-acoustic technology allows for inexpensive, broad-scale, fine-resolution assessment of marine fish habitats. Parallel advancements in geographic information systems and new analytical techniques are providing researchers with the ability to generate informative surrogate predictors of biodiversity and species responses. The aim of this study was to determine whether fine-scale bathymetric derivatives of MBS survey data could be effectively applied as surrogates to explain spatial patterns in reef fish diversity and species-habitat relationships. In the absence of direct metrics of habitat, these derivatives might prove to be effective tools for marine spatial planning. Species-habitat relationships were examined across a marine reserve on the south-eastern coast of Tasmania at fine spatial scales using boosted regression tree analyses. The most important explanatory variables of community diversity were those describing the degree of reef aspect deviation from east and south (seemingly as a proxy for swell exposure), reef bathymetry (depth), plane and slope. Models could account for up to 30% of the spatial variability in measures of species diversity. Responses in species abundance and occurrence to habitat structure appeared to be largely species-specific at the scales investigated. Models accounted for up to 67% and 58% of the abundance and occurrence, respectively, for the southern hulafish Trachinops caudimaculatus. Our results demonstrate that multibeam-derived metrics of reef habitat structure, employed in combination with modern modelling approaches, have the potential to explain and predict fine-resolution patterns in temperate reef fish community structure. This knowledge is urgently required to effectively manage marine ecosystems and conserve biodiversity and fisheries resources.

J	Martino, S; Mazzanti, P				Martino, S.; Mazzanti, P.			Integrating geomechanical surveys and remote sensing for sea cliff slope stability analysis: the Mt. Pucci case study (Italy)	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												An integrated approach to the geomechanical characterization of coastal sea cliffs was applied at Mt. Pucci (Gargano promontory, Southern Italy) by performing field-based geomechanical investigations and remote geostructural investigations via a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS). The consistency of the integrated techniques allowed to achieve a comprehensive and affordable characterization of the main joint sets on the sea cliff slope. The observed joint sets were considered to evaluate the proneness of the slope to rock failures by attributing safety factor (SF) values to the topple- and wedge-prone rock blocks under three combined or independent triggering conditions: (a) hydrostatic water pressures within the joints, (b) seismic action, and (c) strength reduction due to weathering of the joint surfaces. The combined action of weathering and water pressures within the joints was also considered, resulting in a significant decrease in the stability. Furthermore, remote survey analyses via InfraRed Thermography (IRT) and Ground Based Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (GBInSAR) were performed to evaluate the role of the surveyed joint sets in inducing instabilities in the Mt. Pucci sea cliff. The results from the remote surveys: (i) GBInSAR monitoring revealed permanent displacements coupled to cyclic daily displacements, these last ones detected in certain sectors of the cliff wall; (ii) the thermal images allowed us to identify anomalies that correspond well to the main joints and to the slope material released due to recent collapses.

The study area is Pascagoula City on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, USA. Results showed that inclusion of shaded ISA as the response variable improved the model performance by reducing average error (AE) from 10.17 to 9.36%. Modelling with model-based atmospherically corrected imagery as predictors further reduced AE to 9.27%. The regression tree model using summer imagery as predictors (summer model) finally improved AE to 8.56%, compared with 9.28%, 9.50%, and 8.80% when using early spring, late spring, and autumn images as predictors, respectively; therefore the summer model was considered the optimal model. It was further applied to other seasonal images (i.e. early spring, late spring, and autumn images, as predictors) and the AE was 9.93%, 10.09%, and 9.12%, respectively, showing low seasonal sensitivity within this region. The findings in our study improved the modelling accuracy and expanded the scope of its future application in ISA estimation.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2014	35	10					3722	3740		10.1080/01431161.2014.915594								WOS:000337621700001						
J	Zhang, XF; Hu, FX; Zhang, J; Tang, DL				Zhang, Xinfeng; Hu, Fuxiang; Zhang, Jian; Tang, Danling			Northward drift of suspended sediments in the Yangtze estuary in spring	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The spatial distribution of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in spring (February-April) from 2007 to 2013 in the Yangtze (Changjiang) estuary and coastal seas was analysed using remote-sensing data. The results indicated that areas of high SSC drifted northwards along the coast about 100 km away from the Yangtze estuary. SSC increased considerably in both mass and area in 2013. The first principal component analysis (PCA) pattern explained the dominant spatial distribution pattern of SSC in the study area. This highly clustered controlling pattern may have been caused by the joint effects of Yangtze diluted water (YDW), the Taiwan Warm Current (TWC), coastal currents, northeasterly winds, and the shallow coastal shelf. The SSC dispersed and extended into a wide area, and the main range of sediment concentration was located in an area the shape of a trapezium (31.9 degrees N-33.8 degrees N, 122 degrees E-125.5 degrees E, 30.7 degrees N-32.6 degrees N). YDW and the TWC could be the main reason for this northward drift of SSC. The long-term sinking of suspended sediment in clustered areas may have contributed considerably to the formation of the shallow coastal shelf above the 60 m isobath.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2014	35	11-12			SI		4114	4126		10.1080/01431161.2014.916455								WOS:000337623200013

Japanese scallop (Mizuhopecten yessoensis) culture is economically important for the coastal communities of Dalian, China, and Funka Bay, Japan. In this study, we combined satellite remote-sensing data, in situ observations, and a suitable aquaculture site selection model to explore the interactions between marine environments and climate variability over a recent 10-year period (2003-2012). Our selection of appropriate zones in these two Far Eastern regions and our analyses of climatic event (Arctic Oscillation (AO), winter East Asian monsoon (EAM), and El Nino/La Nina Southern Oscillation (ENSO)) and meteorological (precipitation, temperature, and wind) data allowed us to determine the impacts of climate change on regional coastal environments and prospects for scallop aquaculture. These analyses showed that AO and EAM strongly influenced the aquaculture areas on the Dalian coast through their effects on temperature during winter. We also determined that wind was the main driving force behind regional environmental changes during spring. Conversely, ocean conditions and suitable areas in Funka Bay changed rapidly relative to oceanic and atmospheric circulation. In Funka Bay, areas appropriate for scallop aquaculture and variations in chlorophyll-a concentration (which reflect the availability of algal food for scallops) were strongly correlated with ENSO, precipitation, and air temperature. These correlations demonstrate the influence of oceanic and atmospheric parameters on the productivity of scallop aquaculture in Funka Bay. Adaptation to oceanic and atmospheric changes should be considered when developing plans and management strategies for coastal scallop aquaculture in northeast Asia.

These fronts were mainly produced by upwelling off eastern Hainan Island, through which cold, high-salinity, high-density, and nutrient-rich bottom water was brought to the surface and subsurface and then transported to the northeast of Hainan Island by the along-shore currents. The fronts are anisotropic, with a dominant orientation SSW-NNE. A three-dimensional ocean model forced by the Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) winds was employed to study the three-dimensional structure of these fronts as well as the relationship between the fronts and upwelling or summer monsoon. The results show that the front intensity (cross-frontal gradient) is strongly correlated with the along-shore local winds, and has a strong seasonal and a weak inter-annual variation with a maximum of about 0.5 degrees C km (1) at the subsurface (about 15 m) rather than the surface.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2014	35	11-12			SI		4441	4451		10.1080/01431161.2014.916443								WOS:000337623200031

Recent accumulation variability in northwest Greenland from ground-penetrating radar and shallow cores along the Greenland Inland Traverse	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Accumulation is a key parameter governing the mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet. Several studies have documented the spatial variability of accumulation over wide spatial scales, primarily using point data, remote sensing or modeling. Direct measurements of spatially extensive, detailed profiles of accumulation in Greenland, however, are rare. We used 400 MHz ground-penetrating radar along the 1009 km route of the Greenland Inland Traverse from Thule to Summit during April and May of 2011, to image continuous internal reflecting horizons. We dated these horizons using ice-core chemistry at each end of the traverse. Using density profiles measured along the traverse, we determined the depth to the horizons and the corresponding water-equivalent accumulation rates. The measured accumulation rates vary from similar to 0.1 m w.e. a(-1) in the interior to similar to 0.7 m w.e. a(-1) near the coast, and correspond broadly with existing published model results, though there are some excursions. Comparison of our recent accumulation rates with those collected along a similar route in the 1950s shows a similar to 10% increase in accumulation rates over the past 52 years along most of the traverse route. This implies that the increased water vapor capacity of warmer air is increasing accumulation in the interior of Greenland.

Feasibility of Ocean Acoustic Waveguide Remote Sensing ( OAWRS) of Atlantic Cod with Seafloor Scattering Limitations	REMOTE SENSING												Recently reported declines in the population of Atlantic cod have led to calls for additional survey methods for stock assessments. In combination with conventional line-transect methods that may have ambiguities in sampling fish populations, Ocean Acoustic Waveguide Remote Sensing (OAWRS) has been shown to have a potential for providing accurate stock assessments (Makris N.C., et al. Science 2009, 323, 1,734-1,737; 54th Northeast Regional Stock Assessment Workshop (54th SAW) US Department of Commerce, Northeast Fisheries Science Center, 2012). The use of OAWRS technology enables instantaneous wide-area sensing of fish aggregations over thousands of square kilometers. The ratio of the intensity of scattered returns from fish versus the seafloor in any resolution cell typically determines the maximum fish detection range of OAWRS, which then is a function of fish population density, scattering amplitude and depth distribution, as well as the level of seafloor scattering. With the knowledge of oceanographic parameters, such as bathymetry, sound speed structure and attenuation, we find that a Rayleigh-Born volume scattering approach can be used to efficiently and accurately estimate seafloor scattering over wide areas. From hundreds of OAWRS measurements of seafloor scattering, we determine the Rayleigh-Born scattering amplitude of the seafloor, which we find has a f(2.4) frequency dependence below roughly 2 kHz in typical continental shelf environments along the US northeast coast. We then find that it is possible to robustly detect cod aggregations across frequencies at and near swim bladder resonance for observed spawning configurations along the U.S. northeast coast, roughly the two octave range 150-600 Hz for water depths up to roughly 100 m. This frequency range is also optimal for long-range ocean acoustic waveguide propagation, because it enables multimodal acoustic waveguide propagation with minimal acoustic absorption and forward scattering losses. As the sensing frequency moves away from the resonance peak, OAWRS detection of cod becomes increasingly less optimal, due to a rapid decrease in cod scattering amplitude. In other environments where cod depth may be greater, the optimal frequencies for cod detection are expected to increase with swim bladder resonance frequency.																	2072-4292					JAN	2014	6	1					180	208		10.3390/rs6010180								WOS:000335555900009

The wetlands dry out completely every summer and progressively flood again throughout the fall and winter seasons. Given the flatness of Donana's topography, the wind drag action can induce the flooding or emergence of extensive areas, detectable in remote sensing images. Envisat/ASAR scenes acquired before and during strong and persistent wind episodes enabled the spatial delineation of the wind-induced water displacement. A two-dimensional hydrodynamic model of Donana wetlands was built in 2006 with the aim to predict the effect of proposed hydrologic restoration actions within Donana's basin. In this work, on-site wind records and concurrent ASAR scenes are used for the calibration of the wind-drag modeling by assessing different formulations. Results show a good adjustment between the modeled and observed wind drag effect. Displacements of up to 2 km in the wind direction are satisfactorily reproduced by the hydrodynamic model, while including an atmospheric stability parameter led to no significant improvement of the results. Such evidence will contribute to a more accurate simulation of hypothetic or design scenarios, when no information is available for the atmospheric stability assessment.

J	Semmens, K; Ramage, J				Semmens, Kathryn; Ramage, Joan			Melt Patterns and Dynamics in Alaska and Patagonia Derived from Passive Microwave Brightness Temperatures	REMOTE SENSING												Glaciers and icefields are critical components of Earth's cryosphere to study and monitor for understanding the effects of a changing climate. To provide a regional perspective of glacier melt dynamics for the past several decades, brightness temperatures (T-b) from the passive microwave sensor Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) were used to characterize melt regime patterns over large glacierized areas in Alaska and Patagonia. The distinctness of the melt signal at 37V-GHz and the ability to acquire daily data regardless of clouds or darkness make the dataset ideal for studying melt dynamics in both hemispheres. A 24-year (1988-2011) time series of annual T-b histograms was constructed to (1) characterize and assess temporal and spatial trends in melt patterns, (2) determine years of anomalous T-b distribution, and (3) investigate potential contributing factors. Distance from coast and temperature were key factors influencing melt. Years of high percentage of positive T-b anomalies were associated with relatively higher stream discharge (e.g., Copper and Mendenhall Rivers, Alaska, USA and Rio Baker, Chile). The characterization of melt over broad spatial domains and a multi-decadal time period offers a more comprehensive picture of the changing cryosphere and provides a baseline from which to assess future change.																	2072-4292					JAN	2014	6	1					603	620		10.3390/rs6010603								WOS:000335555900026

Cascading water underneath Wilkes Land, East Antarctic ice sheet, observed using altimetry and digital elevation models	CRYOSPHERE												We describe a major subglacial lake drainage close to the ice divide in Wilkes Land, East Antarctica, and the subsequent cascading of water underneath the ice sheet toward the coast. To analyse the event, we combined a data from several sources and subglacial topography. We estimated the total volume of water that drained from Lake Cook(E2) by differencing digital elevation models (DEM) derived from ASTER and SPOT5 stereo imagery acquired in January 2006 and February 2012. At 5.2 +/- 1.5 km(3), this is the largest single subglacial drainage event reported so far in Antarctica. Elevation differences between ICESat laser altimetry spanning 2003-2009 and the SPOT5 DEM indicate that the discharge started in November 2006 and lasted approximately 2 years. A 13m uplift of the surface, corresponding to a refilling of about 0.6 +/- 0.3 km(3), was observed between the end of the discharge in October 2008 and February 2012. Using the 35-day temporal resolution of Envisat radar altimetry, we monitored the subsequent filling and drainage of connected subglacial lakes located downstream of Cook(E2). The total volume of water traveling within the theoretical 500-km-long flow paths computed with the BEDMAP2 data set is similar to the volume that drained from Lake Cook(E2), and our observations suggest that most of the water released from Lake Cook(E2) did not reach the coast but remained trapped underneath the ice sheet. Our study illustrates how combining multiple remote sensing techniques allows monitoring of the timing and magnitude of subglacial water flow beneath the East Antarctic ice sheet.

Using remote sensing to enhance modelling of fine sediment dynamics in the Dutch coastal zone	JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS												Modelling fine sediment dynamics, including transport, deposition and re-suspension, is very complex. This led to studies that validate the modelled suspended particulate matter (SPM) based on in-situ measurements. While in-situ measurements are often sparse in time and space, satellite measurements provide us with higher spatial and temporal resolution. This information can be used to validate and enhance the model's capability of predicting the spatial and temporal distribution of SPM. In this paper, the SPM retrieved from the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) on board European Space Agency's ENVISAT spacecraft is used to carry out a thorough calibration and validation of the SPM description provided by the Delft3DWAQ model of the Southern North Sea for the year 2007. In an uncertainty analysis framework, the key model parameters affecting the SPM distributions were first identified in predefined physical regions. The sensitivity of the model to slight changes in those parameters is tested and the spatial and temporal errors compared to remote sensing images were identified and a new set of parameters has been suggested and further subjected to uncertainty to define prediction intervals of the SPM distribution at a number of locations. The so-called adapted model has been validated against independent data and has shown a decrease in errors, particularly along the Dutch coast.																	1464-7141	1465-1734					2014	16	2					458	476		10.2166/hydro.2013.211								WOS:000333684400015

A Remote Sensing Perspective on Shoreline Modification, Canal Construction and Household Trajectories at Pineland along Florida's Southwestern Gulf Coast	ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROSPECTION												In 2011, we initiated a geophysical survey of the Pineland Site Complex. The complex is comprised of two imposing residential midden-mound groups, two sand burial mounds and several linear (and other) middens along previous shorelines, and a canal system that not only integrated features within the site complex, but also served to connect it to the interior of Pine Island and beyond. For 25 years, archaeologists associated with the Florida Museum of Natural History have conducted extensive investigations at the Complex, clarifying the site's intertwined environmental and human histories. Our research presented here provides additional data to confirm some of the hypotheses generated by this previous research. The geophysical results support previous ideas regarding formation and occupation of former shorelines by Pineland's early fisher-gatherer-hunters. Second, they provide better definition of a small, later-period secondary canal, a component of the canal system. Most notably, the geophysical survey provides a basis for studying changes in household composition over time via the identification of house patterns in the resulting imaged data. We provide some speculations regarding this shift in residence patterns, suggesting that alterations may have been coeval with environmental changes. These changes may have set the stage for subsequent large-scale cooperative labour projects, such as Pineland's waterways.

J	Carr, JR; Stokes, C; Vieli, A				Carr, J. Rachel; Stokes, Chris; Vieli, Andreas			Recent retreat of major outlet glaciers on Novaya Zemlya, Russian Arctic, influenced by fjord geometry and sea-ice conditions	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Substantial ice loss has occurred in the Russian High Arctic during the past decade, predominantly on Novaya Zemlya, yet the region has been studied relatively little. Consequently, the factors forcing mass loss and the relative contribution of ice dynamics versus surface melt are poorly understood. Here we evaluate the influence of atmospheric/oceanic forcing and variations in fjord width on the behaviour of 38 glaciers on the northern ice cap, Novaya Zemlya. We compare retreat rates on land- versus marine-terminating outlets and on the Kara versus Barents Sea coasts. Between 1992 and 2010, 90% of the study glaciers retreated and retreat rates were an order of magnitude higher for marine-terminating outlets (52.1 m a(-1)) than for land-terminating glaciers (4.8 m a(-1)). We identify a post-2000 acceleration in marine-terminating glacier retreat, which corresponded closely to changes in sea-ice concentrations. Retreat rates were higher on the Barents Sea coast, which we partly attribute to lower sea-ice concentrations, but varied dramatically between individual glaciers. We use empirical data to categorize changes in along-flow fjord width, and demonstrate a significant relationship between fjord width variability and retreat rate. Results suggest that variations in fjord width exert a major influence on glacier retreat.

The uncertainties of these products are poorly quantified in the Yellow Sea (YS) and East China Sea (ECS), which are well known for their optical complexity and turbidity in terms of both oceanic and atmospheric optical properties. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the primary ocean-color products from three major ocean-color satellites, namely the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), and Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS). Through match-up analysis with in situ data, it is found that satellite retrievals of the spectral remote sensing reflectance R-rs(lambda) at the blue-green and green bands from MERIS, MODIS and SeaWiFS have the lowest uncertainties with a median of the absolute percentage of difference (APD(m)) of 15-27% and root-mean-square-error (RMS) of 0.0021-0.0039 sr(-1), whereas the R-rs(lambda) uncertainty at 412 nm is the highest (APD(m) 47-62%, RMS 0.0027-0.0041 sr(-1)). The uncertainties of the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) tau(a), diffuse attenuation coefficient for downward irradiance at 490 nm K-d(490), concentrations of suspended particulate sediment concentration (SPM) and Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) were also quantified. It is demonstrated that with appropriate in-water algorithms specifically developed for turbid waters rather than the standard ones adopted in the operational satellite data processing chain, the uncertainties of satellite-derived properties of K-d(490), SPM, and Chl-a may decrease significantly to the level of 20-30%, which is true for the majority of the study area. This validation activity advocates for (1) the improvement of the atmosphere correction algorithms with the regional aerosol optical model, (2) switching to regional in-water algorithms over turbid coastal waters, and (3) continuous support of the dedicated in situ data collection effort for the validation task.

J	Choi, Y				Choi, Y.			The impact of satellite-adjusted NOx emissions on simulated NOx and O-3 discrepancies in the urban and outflow areas of the Pacific and Lower Middle US	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												We analyze the simulation results from a CMAQ model and GOME-2 NO2 retrievals over the United States for August 2009 to estimate the model-simulated biases of NOx concentrations over six geological regions (Pacific Coast = PC, Rocky Mountains = RM, Lower Middle = LM, Upper Middle = UM, Southeast = SE, Northeast = NE). By comparing GOME-2 NO2 columns to corresponding CMAQ NO2 columns, we produced satellite-adjusted NOx emission ("GOME2009") and compared baseline emission ("BASE2009") CMAQ simulations with GOME2009 CMAQ runs. We found that the latter exhibited decreases of -5.6%, -12.3%, -21.3%, and -15.9% over the PC, RM, LM, and SE regions, respectively, and increases of +2.3% and +10.0% over the UM and NE regions. In addition, we found that changes in NOx emissions generally mitigate discrepancies between the surface NOx concentrations of baseline CMAQ and those of AQS at EPA AQS stations (mean bias of +19.8% to -13.7% over PC, -13.8% to -36.7% over RM, +149.7% to -1.8% over LM, +22.5% to -7.8% over UM, +31.3% to -7.9% over SE, and +11.6% to +0.7% over NE). The relatively high simulated NOx biases from baseline CMAQ over LM (+149.7%) are likely the results of over-predictions of simulated NOx emissions, which could shed light on those from global/regional Chemical Transport Models. We also perform more detailed investigations on surface NOx and O-3 concentrations in two urban and outflow areas, PC (e.g., Los Angeles, South Pasadena, Anaheim, La Habra and Riverside) and LM (e.g., Houston, Beaumont and Sulphur). From two case studies, we found that the GOME2009 emissions decreased surface NOx concentrations significantly in the urban areas of PC (up to 30 ppbv) and in those of LM (up to 10 ppbv) during the daytime and that simulated NOx concentrations from CMAQ with GOME2009 compare well to those of in-situ AQS observations. A significant reduction in NOx concentrations resulted in a comparable increase in surface O-3 concentrations in the urban areas of PC (up to 30 ppbv) and the resulting simulated O-3 concentrations compare well with in-situ surface O-3 observations over South Pasadena, Anaheim, and Riverside. Over Houston, Beaumont, and Sulphur, large reductions in NOx emissions from CMAQ with GOME2009 coincides with large reduced concentrations of simulated NOx. These concentrations are similar to those of the EPA AQS NOx observations. However, the resulting simulated increase in surface O-3 at the urban stations in Houston and Sulphur exacerbated preexisting high O-3 over-predictions of the baseline CMAQ. This study implies that simulated low O-3 biases in the urban areas of PC are likely caused by simulated high NOx biases, but high O-3 biases in the urban areas of LM cannot be explained by simulated high NOx biases over the region. This study also suggests that both in-situ surface NOx and O-3 observations should be used simultaneously to resolve issues pertaining to simulated high/low O-3 bias and that remote-sensing data could be used as a constraint for bottom-up emissions. In addition, we also found that daytime O-3 reductions over the outflow regions of LM following large reductions in NOx emissions in the urban areas are significantly larger than they are over outflow regions of PC. These findings provide policymakers in the two regions with information critical to establishing strategies for mitigating air pollution.																	1680-7316	1680-7324					2014	14	2					675	690		10.5194/acp-14-675-2014								WOS:000330853800011

Aspects of quality control of wind profiler measurements in complex topography	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												It is well known in the scientific community that some remote sensing instruments assume that sample volumes present homogeneous conditions within a defined meteorological profile. At complex topographic sites and under extreme meteorological conditions, this assumption may be fallible depending on the site, and it is more likely to fail in the lower layers of the atmosphere. This piece of work tests the homogeneity of the wind field over a boundary layer wind profiler radar located in complex terrain on the coast under different meteorological conditions. The results reveal the qualitative importance of being aware of deviations in this homogeneity assumption and evaluate its effect on the final product. Patterns of behavior in data have been identified in order to simplify the analysis of the complex signal registered. The quality information obtained from the homogeneity study under different meteorological conditions provides useful indicators for the best alternatives the system can offer to build wind profiles. Finally, the results are also to be considered in order to integrate them in a quality algorithm implemented at the product level.																	1867-1381	1867-8548					2014	7	1					135	148		10.5194/amt-7-135-2014								WOS:000330945400010

Investigated quantities are: 1) the algal-2 pigment index, alg2; 2) the composite-absorption coefficient of yellow substance and non-pigmented particles at 442 nm, a(dg); and 3) the concentration of the total suspended matter, TSM. Regional data products are created using ocean color inversion schemes based on MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) neural nets trained with field measurements from the Coastal Atmosphere and Sea Time Series (CoASTS) and Bio-Optical mapping of Marine Properties (BiOMaP) programs. MLP input is the remote sensing reflectance Res at MERIS center-wavelengths specifically selected for different water types in view of minimizing the perturbing effects of inaccurate atmospheric correction on the retrieval of regional data products. A new method is also proposed to define the applicability of regional MLPs to input Res. Results indicate that MERIS alg2 values tend to overestimate the equivalent quantity computed with MLP regional algorithms. The agreement between MERIS and regional TSM data products is significantly better than that reported for alg2 and ad, especially for BLKS. Findings highlight the relevance of using regional inversion schemes to evaluate standard products over extended oceanographic regions as a complement to the analysis of match-ups between marine products measured in situ and derived from space-born data.

JOHN'S	OCEANS-IEEE				Oceans Conference	SEP 14-19, 2014	St Johns, CANADA					Personnel-based aerial surveys have demonstrated their capability for monitoring marine animal populations. That being said, not many studies have been conducted on smaller shark species in coastal waters, where they can become a threat to beach-goers and possibly be killed by beach protection netting. In this paper we report our findings on real-time, automated detection of great white shark dummy targets using a multispectral imager. 2.5 x 1.2 m plywood shark cutouts were submerged to 1 m, 2 m, and 3 m below the surface in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego, CA. 66 passes were conducted over the course of three days, resulting in an average probability of detection of 84.8%. Automatic detection was mostly limited by water turbidity in this test, but other environmental conditions such as wind, wave speed and period, and sun glint also had an effect on detection. The high probability of detection and low false alarm rate from this study are an indication that using an automated remote sensing system could be an effective alternative to personnel-based aerial surveys.																	0197-7385		978-1-4799-4918-2				2014																		WOS:000369848800156						
J	Virdis, SGP				Virdis, Salvatore Gonario Pasquale			An object-based image analysis approach for aquaculture ponds precise mapping and monitoring: a case study of Tam Giang-Cau Hai Lagoon, Vietnam	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Monitoring and mapping shrimp farms, including their impact on land cover and land use, is critical to the sustainable management and planning of coastal zones. In this work, a methodology was proposed to set up a cost-effective and reproducible procedure that made use of satellite remote sensing, object-based classification approach, and open-source software for mapping aquaculture areas with high planimetric and thematic accuracy between 2005 and 2008. The analysis focused on two characteristic areas of interest of the Tam Giang-Cau Hai Lagoon (in central Vietnam), which have similar farming systems to other coastal aquaculture worldwide: the first was primarily characterised by locally referred "low tide" shrimp ponds, which are partially submerged areas; the second by earthed shrimp ponds, locally referred to as "high tide" ponds, which are non-submerged areas on the lagoon coast. The approach was based on the region-growing segmentation of high- and very high-resolution panchromatic images, SPOT5 and Worldview-1, and the unsupervised clustering classifier ISOSEG embedded on SPRING non-commercial software. The results, the accuracy of which was tested with a field-based aquaculture inventory, showed that in favourable situations (high tide shrimp ponds), the classification results provided high rates of accuracy (> 95 %) through a fully automatic object-based classification. In unfavourable situations (low tide shrimp ponds), the performance degraded due to the low contrast between the water and the pond embankments. In these situations, the automatic results were improved by manual delineation of the embankments. Worldview-1 necessarily showed better thematic accuracy, and precise maps have been realised at a scale of up to 1:2,000. However, SPOT5 provided comparable results in terms of number of correctly classified ponds, but less accurate results in terms of the precision of mapped features. The procedure also demonstrated high degrees of reproducibility because it was applied to images with different spatial resolutions in an area that, during the investigated period, did not experience significant land cover changes.

The coastal variability at the sea-land interface, for a period of several decades, has been revisited on the basis of the historical remote sensing images/maps, and obtained results were the base of an online Coastal Atlas for the Romanian Black Sea Coast.																	1314-2704		978-619-7105-12-4				2014							93	98										WOS:000371300000012

DYNAMIC LAND USE AND COASTLINE CHANGES IN ACTIVE ESTUARINE REGIONS - A STUDY OF SUNDARBAN DELTA	ISPRS TECHNICAL COMMISSION VIII SYMPOSIUM	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				ISPRS Technical Commission VIII Symposium	DEC 09-12, 2014	Hyderabad, INDIA	ISPRS Tech Commiss, Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Indian Soc Remote Sensing, Indian Soc Geomat				Alteration of natural environment in the wake of global warming is one of the most serious issues, which is being discussed across the world. Over the last 100 years, global sea level rose by 1.0-2.5 mm/y. Present estimates of future sea-level rise induced by climate change range from 28 to 98 cm for the year 2100. It has been estimated that a 1-m rise in sea-level could displace nearly 7 million people from their homes in India. The climate change and associated sea level rise is proclaimed to be a serious threat especially to the low lying coastal areas. Thus, study of long term effects on an estuarine region not only gives opportunity for identifying the vulnerable areas but also gives a clue to the periods where the sea level rise was significant and verifies climate change impact on sea level rise. Multi-temporal remote sensing data and GIS tools are often used to study the pattern of erosion/accretion in an area and to predict the future coast lines. The present study has been carried out in the Indian Sundarbans area. Major land cover/land use classes has been delineated and change analysis of the land cover/land use feature was performed using multi-temporal satellite images (Landsat MSS, TM, ETM+) from 1973 to 2010. Multivariate GIS based analysis was carried out to depict vulnerability and its trend, spatially. Digital Shoreline change analysis also was attempted for two islands, namely, Ghoramara and Sagar Islands using the past 40 years of satellite data and validated with 2012 Resourcesat-2 LISS III data.																	2194-9034						2014	40-8						133	139		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-8-133-2014								WOS:000368425300020

Single source surface energy balance model was used to derive surface energy balance parameters. Agro climatic region wise monthly information of terrestrial, energy balance and meteorological parameters were derived during June-September from decadal analysis of MODIS data (2003-2012) over India (68-100 degrees E, 5-40 degrees N) at 5 km spatial resolution. Information on rainfall was obtained from gridded rainfall data (1 degrees x 1 degrees spatial resolution) from Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). The spatiotemporal variability of the parameters such as rainfall, evapotranspiration (ET), evaporative fraction (EF), soil water index (SWI), land surface temperature (LST) and air temperature (T-a) showed strong influence on seasonal LE fluctuation. LE showed positive linear coupling with ET (0.52 <R-2 <= 0.91), EF (0.79 <= R-2 <= 0.96), SWI (0.80 <= R-2 <= 0.93) and negative exponential coupling with LST (0.63 <= R-2 <= 0.87), T-a (0.55 < R-2 <= 0.83). The pixel based knowledge of the parameters was incorporated into hierarchical decision rule algorithm and pixel-by-pixel segmentation of monthly coupling of LE versus parameters (ET, EF, SWI, LST, T-a) was generated. The rainfall zonations in a spatiotemporal domain were done based on the LE couplings that clearly demarcated the highest (West Coast Plains and Hills Region, Himalayan region), moderate (Gangetic Plains and Hills Regions, and the Plateau and Hills Regions) and lowest rainfall (Western dry region) areas. The transition of zone-wise availability of rainfall (both surplus and deficient) can be very well understood from the seasonal dynamics of the LE couplings.																	2194-9034						2014	40-8						339	345		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-8-339-2014								WOS:000368425300053

OIL SPILL MAP FOR INDIAN SEA REGION BASED ON BHUVAN- GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM USING SATELLITE IMAGES	ISPRS TECHNICAL COMMISSION VIII SYMPOSIUM	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				ISPRS Technical Commission VIII Symposium	DEC 09-12, 2014	Hyderabad, INDIA	ISPRS Tech Commiss, Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Indian Soc Remote Sensing, Indian Soc Geomat				Oil spills in the ocean are a serious marine disaster that needs regular monitoring for environmental risk assessment and mitigation. Recent use of Polarimetric SAR imagery in near real time oil spill detection systems is associated with attempts towards automatic and unambiguous oil spill detection based on decomposition methods. Such systems integrate remote sensing technology, geo information, communication system, hardware and software systems to provide key information for analysis and decision making. Geographic information systems (GIS) like BHUVAN can significantly contribute to oil spill management based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. India has long coast line from Gujarat to Bengal and hundreds of ports. The increase in shipping also increases the risk of oil spills in our maritime zone. The availability of RISAT-1 SAR images enhances the scope to monitor oil spills and develop GIS on Bhuvan which can be accessed by all the users, such as ships, coast guard, environmentalists etc., The GIS enables realization of oil spill maps based on integration of the geographical, remote sensing, oil & gas production/infrastructure data and slick signatures detected by SAR. SAR and GIS technologies can significantly improve the realization of oil spill footprint distribution maps. Preliminary assessment shows that the Bhuvan promises to be an ideal solution to understand spatial, temporal occurrence of oil spills in the marine atlas of India. The oil spill maps on Bhuvan based GIS facility will help the ONGC and Coast Guard organization.																	2194-9034						2014	40-8						1085	1090		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-8-1085-2014								WOS:000368425300171

Besides the ecological and economic importance of being able to accurately measure currents, the US Coast Guard uses HF radar to make decisions involved in search and rescue operations. Currently, 5 MHz or long-range HF radar systems output radial vector files that are calculated using a 180-minute averaging interval. Reducing the averaging interval to 60 minutes could improve accuracy in areas where the current changes significantly over this 3 hour averaging interval. To test this, the track of a real drifter was compared to the track of two virtual drifters over a 48-hour period. One virtual drifter was tracked using HF radar total surface currents derived from radial measurements averaged over the default 180-minute interval and the other using HF radar data averaged over the 60-minute interval. Distance between real drifter and virtual was determined for both cases. For the first 24-hour period, both HR radar intervals had similar differences between the real drifter and the virtual. The largest difference was approximately 5 km, and the smallest was less than 2 km. The next 24 hours were less similar with the HF radar for the 60-minute interval being more accurate. For example, the 180 minute interval, the distances between the virtual and real drifter reached a maximum of approximately 12 km while the maximum difference for the HF radar averaged over 60 minute intervals was only 7km. The improvement of accuracy when switching the HF radar over to 60 minute intervals has implications in the broad sense for studies looking at biological and ecological species as well as for transportation at sea but where this difference maybe most important is in the ability to narrow a search area during US Coast Guard Search and Rescue missions.																	0197-7385		978-1-4799-3646-5				2014																		WOS:000412588000098

Simulations offshore Somali coast and in a South Mediterranean Sea region showed that both low and high resolution acquisitions are feasible. For the low resolution mode a probability of successful image formation no matter the azimuth position of the receiving UAS has been estimated at nearly 100%. Whereas, for the high resolution mode it decreases to about 90%, which, if deemed unsatisfactory for the application, leads to the need for UAS to adapt its route to the actual Galileo satellite coverage.

The application of airborne thermal data exploits thermal contrasts that exist between discharging groundwater and background sea surface temperatures of the Dead Sea. Using these contrasts, 72 discharge sites were identified from which only 42 were known from previous in situ measurements undertaken at terrestrial springs by the Israel Hydrological Service. Six of these sites represent submarine springs and at a further 24 locations groundwater appears to seep through the sediment. Although the abundance of groundwater seepage sites suggests a significant, but so far unknown groundwater source, the main contribution appears to originate from terrestrial springs. In an attempt to provide a quantitative approach for terrestrial springs, a linear bootstrap regression model between in situ spring discharge and respective thermal discharge plumes (r(2) = 0.87 p < 0.001) is developed and presented here. While the results appear promising and could potentially be applied to derive discharge values at unmonitored sites, several influence factors need to be clarified before a robust and reliable model to efficiently derive a complete quantitative picture of groundwater discharge can be proposed.

Mangrove biomass estimation in Southwest Thailand using machine learning	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Mangroves play a disproportionately large role in carbon sequestration relative to other tropical forest ecosystems. Accurate assessments of mangrove biomass at the site-scale are lacking, especially in mainland Southeast Asia. This study assessed tree biomass and species diversity within a 151 ha mangrove ecosystem on the Andaman Coast of Thailand. High-resolution GeoEye-1 satellite imagery, medium resolution ASTER satellite elevation data, field-based tree measurements, published allometric biomass equations, and a suite of machine learning techniques were used to develop spatial models of mangrove biomass. Field measurements derived a whole-site tree density of 1313 trees ha(-1), with Rhizophora spp. comprising 77.7% of the trees across forty-five 400 m(2) sample plots. A support vector machine regression model was found to be most accurate by cross-validation for predicting biomass at the site level. Model-estimated above-ground biomass was 250 Mg ha(-1); below-ground root biomass was 95 Mg ha(-1). Combined above-ground and below-ground biomass for the entire 151-ha stand was 345 (+/- 72.5) Mg ha(-1), equivalent to 155 (+/- 32.6) Mg C ha(-1). Model evaluation shows the model had greatest prediction error at high biomass values, indicating a need for allometric equations determined over a larger range of tree sizes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Remote sensing of surface visibility from space: A look at the United States East Coast	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Measurement of surface visibility is important for the management of air quality, human health, and transportation. Currently, visibility measurements are only available through ground-based instrumentation, such as the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS), and therefore lack spatial coverage. In analogy to the recent work of using satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) to derive surface dry aerosol mass concentration at continental-to-global scale for cloud-free conditions, this study evaluates the potential of AOD retrieved from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for deriving surface visibility. For this purpose of evaluation the truncated (up to similar to 16 km or 10 miles) and discrete (at the interval no less than 0.4 km or 1/4 mile) visibility data from hourly operational weather reports are not suitable, and the ASOS-measured one-minute raw surface extinction coefficient (b(ext)) values have to be used. Consequently, a method for quality control on the b(ext) data is first developed to eliminate frequent problems such as extraneous points, poor calibration, and bad formatting, after which reliable b(ext) data are obtained to estimate the surface visibility. Subsequent analysis of the AOD and b(ext) relationship on the East Coast of the United States reveals their average linear correlation coefficient (R) of 0.61 for all twelve (2000-2011) years of data at 32 ASOS stations, with the highest R value in summer and the lowest values in fall and winter. Incorporation of the Goddard Earth Observing System, Version 5 (GEOS-5) modeled vertical profile of aerosols into the derivation of visibility from AOD is evaluated for two methods, one scaling the modeled surface b(ext) with the ratio of MODIS AOD to the modeled AOD, and another scaling the ratio of modeled AOD in the boundary layer to total columnar AOD with the MODIS AOD and assuming well-mixed aerosol extinction in the boundary layer. Analysis with three summers (2003-2004, 2006) of available GEOS-5 data and ASOS data reveals that the second method is superior, and generates a regression model that, after independent evaluation for summer 2005, is found to be statistically robust with R of 0.70 and a mean bias of 0.32 km in derived visibility. This study is among the first to demonstrate the potential of using satellite-based aerosol product over land to operationally derive surface visibility. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

During 2012, large-scale climate modes indicated the CCS remained in a cool, productive phase present since 2007. The upwelling season was delayed north of 42 degrees N, but regions to the south, especially 33 degrees to 36 degrees N, experienced average to above average upwelling that persisted throughout the summer. Contrary to the indication of high production suggested by the climate indices, chlorophyll observed from surveys and remote sensing was below average along much of the coast. As well, some members of the forage assemblages along the coast experienced low abundances in 2012 surveys. Specifically, the concentrations of all life-stages observed directly or from egg densities of Pacific sardine, Sardinops sagax, and northern anchovy, Engraulis mordax, were less than previous years' survey estimates. However, 2013 surveys and observations indicate an increase in abundance of northern anchovy. During winter 2011/2012, the increased presence of northern copepod species off northern California was consistent with stronger southward transport. Krill and small-fraction zooplankton abundances, where examined, were generally above average. North of 42 degrees N, salps returned to typical abundances in 2012 after greater observed concentrations in 2010 and 2011. In contrast, salp abundance off central and southern California increased after a period of southward transport during winter 2011/2012. Reproductive success of piscivorous Brandt's cormorant, Phalacrocorax penicillatus, was reduced while planktivorous Cassin's auklet, Ptychoramphus aleuticus was elevated. Differences between the productivity of these two seabirds may be related to the available forage assemblage observed in the surveys. California sea lion pups from San Miguel Island were undernourished resulting in a pup mortality event perhaps in response to changes in forage availability. Limited biological data were available for spring 2013, but strong winter upwelling coastwide indicated an early spring transition, with the strong upwelling persisting into early summer.

In 2012, shipboard surveying and satellite remote sensing were used to monitor the whole blooming process. The blooms originated in Rudong sea area of the South Yellow Sea where bloom patches were of dark green and filamentous thalli were the dominant morphology. The scale of the blooms reached its peak size in Rizhao sea area of the North Yellow Sea, and decreased promptly and became insignificant in Qingdao coast where the blooms turned yellow, mostly with air sac blades. Meanwhile, vegetative cells of the green tide algae changed into cytocysts gradually from which germ cells were released as the blooms drifted northward. Additionally, chlorophyll contents and fluorescence activity of free-floating thalli in the North Yellow Sea were both significantly lower than that in the South Yellow Sea. Those studies presented here contributed to increasing our understanding about how the green tide declined gradually in the North Yellow Sea. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Results from Matched Filtering (MF) and Linear Spectral Unmixing (LSU) methods showed good match and revealed that the spatial distributions of gypsum, clastic sediments, and quartz sand have nearly similar pattern as determined from Landsat 7 ETM + and ASTER data. These results also show good correspondence between spectra of sample and image. The present results also revealed good matching between the results obtained from MF, LSU, spectral analyses, and X-ray diffraction (XRD).																	0255-660X	0974-3006				DEC	2013	41	4					833	844		10.1007/s12524-013-0291-2								WOS:000326935700010

The short Po River pulses in August result in the surface advection of riverine water, nutrients and phytoplankton from the western to the eastern side of the Adriatic. This surface spreading exhibits inter-annual variability depending on the riverine discharge in the preceding period. The Po River discharge pulse in August 2010 in particular resulted in an extraordinary tongue-like advection of riverine water, nutrients, and phytoplankton towards the Eastern Adriatic coast. The phenomenon was detected using both satellite imagery and classical oceanographic measurements. In the advective water, toxic dinoflagellates were most abundant in August 2010, when the influence of the Po was greatest.

J	Recondo, C; Peon, JJ; Zapico, E; Pendas, E				Recondo, Carmen; Jose Peon, Juan; Zapico, Eva; Pendas, Enrique			Empirical models for estimating daily surface water vapour pressure, air temperature, and humidity using MODIS and spatiotemporal variables. Applications to peninsular Spain	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												In this article, we present empirical models for estimating daily surface water vapour pressure (e(0)), air temperature (T-a), and relative humidity (RH) over cloud-free land areas in peninsular Spain using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and spatiotemporal variables. The models were obtained and validated using daily mean, maximum, and minimum e(0), T-a, and RH data (year 2010) from 331 ground-level meteorological stations and the diurnal Terra-MODIS data in peninsular Spain, but the methodology can easily be extrapolated and used to obtain algorithms for other regions around the world. The best e(0) models are based on total precipitable water (W) estimations obtained by MOD05 or IMAPP WVNIR products and the spatiotemporal variables of longitude (), distance to the coast (d(coast)), and Julian day (JD). Other models based on Sobrino's W algorithm or on Recondo's e(0) algorithm for Asturias (in northern Spain) were also tested. The best T-a models are based on land surface temperature (LST) obtained by the MOD11 LST or IMAPP LST products and on other remote-sensing variables, such as W and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the spatiotemporal variables , JD, and height (h). Models based on Sobrino's LST algorithms were also tested. RH can be derived directly from e(0) and T-a or from models similar to those used to obtain e(0) and T-a. Models based on the NASA standard products MOD05 and MOD11 LST are slightly better than those based on IMAPP products, but the advantage of IMAPP products for our purposes is that they can be generated in almost real time from the data obtained by the MODIS antenna at the University of Oviedo. IMAPP models obtain the following: R-2=0.83-0.79-0.70 and RSE=1.62-1.59-1.76 hPa for e(0mean), e(0max), and e(0min); and R-2=0.91-0.91-0.80 and RSE=1.96-2.25-3.00K for T-mean, T-max, and T-min. Worse results are obtained for RH: R-2=0.49-0.39 and RSE=7.21-9.75% for RHmin and RHmean, with no correlation found for RHmax. Model validations yield R-2 and RSE values similar to those obtained in the models, with an RMSD=1.86-1.99-2.21 hPa for e(0mean), e(0max), and e(0min); an RMSD=2.05-2.40-2.95K for T-mean, T-max, and T-min; and RMSD=8-11% for RHmin and RHmean. The bias is small in all cases:<0.2 hPa for e(0), 0.1K for T-a, and|1|% for RH. From the results of this article, we propose substituting the traditionally used RH variable with the e(0) variable to be used as meteorological variable in environmental risk models such as, for example, fire risk models.

A recently developed method for detecting inundated areas based on integrated remotely sensed data (i.e., Radarsat-1, aerial imagery, LiDAR, Landsat 7 ETM+) was applied to assess the performance of the tidal model. The analysis demonstrates the applicability of the method and its agreement with traditional performance assessment techniques such as harmonic resynthesis and water level time series analysis. Based on the flooded/non-flooded coastal areas estimated by the integrated remotely sensed data, the model is able to adequately reproduce the extent of inundation within four sample areas from the coast along the Florida panhandle, correctly identifying areas as wet or dry over 85% of the time. Comparisons of the tidal model inundation to synoptic (point-in-time) inundation areas generated from the remotely sensed data generally agree with the results of the traditional performance assessment techniques. Moreover, this approach is able to illustrate the spatial distribution of model inundation accuracy allowing for targeted refinement of model parameters.																	2072-4292					NOV	2013	5	11					5662	5679		10.3390/rs5115662								WOS:000328626900014

Mapping the world's tropical cyclone rainfall contribution over land using the TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												A study was performed to characterize over land precipitation associated with tropical cyclones (TCs) for basins around the world based upon the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS). From 1998 to 2009, data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) product 3B42, showed that TCs accounted for 5.5%, 7.5%, 6%, 9.5%, and 8.9% of the annual precipitation for impacted over land areas of the Americas, East Asia, South and West Asia, Oceania, and East Africa respectively, and that TC contribution decreased significantly within the first 150 km from the coast. Locally, TCs contributed on average to more than 25% and up to 61% of the annual precipitation budget over very different climatic areas with arid or tropical characteristics. East Asia represented the higher and most constant TC rain (118 mm yr(-1)19%) normalized over the area impacted, while East Africa presented the highest variability (108 mm yr(-1)60%), and the Americas displayed the lowest average TC rain (65 mm yr(-1)24%) despite a higher TC activity. Furthermore, the maximum monthly TC contribution (8-11%) was found later in the TC season and depended on the peak of TC activity, TC rainfall, and the domain transition between dry and wet regimes if any. Finally, because of their importance in terms of rainfall amount, the contribution of TCs was provided for a selection of 50 urban areas experiencing cyclonic activity. Results showed that for particularly intense years, urban areas prone to cyclonic activity received more than half of their annual rainfall from TCs.

The launch of the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite with the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) significantly enhances our capability to monitor and detect light outages with the well-calibrated day/night band (DNB) and to use light loss signatures as indication of regional power outages. This study explores the use of the DNB in quantifying light outages due to the derecho storm in the Washington DC metropolitan area in June 2012 and Hurricane Sandy at the end of October 2012 on the East Coast of U.S. The results show that the DNB data are very useful in detecting power outages by quantifying light loss, but it also has some challenges due to clouds, lunar illumination, and straylight effect. Comparison of light outage and recovery trend determined from DNB data with power company survey shows reasonable agreement, demonstrating the usefulness of DNB in independently verifying and complementing the statistics from power companies.

J	Matrosov, SY				Matrosov, Sergey Y.			Characteristics of Landfalling Atmospheric Rivers Inferred from Satellite Observations over the Eastern North Pacific Ocean	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Narrow elongated regions of moisture transport known as atmospheric rivers (ARs), which affect the West Coast of North America, were simultaneously observed over the eastern North Pacific Ocean by the polar-orbiting CloudSat and Aqua satellites. The presence, location, and extent of precipitation regions associated with ARs and their properties were retrieved from measurements taken at 265 satellite crossings of AR formations during the three consecutive cool seasons of the 2006-09 period. Novel independent retrievals of AR mean rain rate, precipitation regime types, and precipitation ice region properties from satellite measurements were performed. Relations between widths of precipitation bands and AR thicknesses (as defined by the integrated water vapor threshold of 20 mm) were quantified. Precipitation regime partitioning indicated that cold precipitation with a significant amount of melting precipitating ice and warm rainfall conditions with limited or no ice in the atmospheric column were observed, on average, with similar frequencies, though the cold rainfall fraction had an increasing trend as AR temperature decreased. Rain rates were generally higher for the cold precipitation regime. Precipitating ice cloud and rainfall retrievals indicated a significant correlation between the total ice amounts and the resultant rain rate. Observationally based statistical relations were derived between the boundaries of AR precipitation regions and integrated water vapor amounts and between the total content of precipitating ice and rain rate. No statistically significant differences of AR properties were found for three different cool seasons, which were characterized by differing phases of El Nino-Southern Oscillation.

The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image covers about 400 km x 400 km of a coastal area of the Yellow Sea. The sea surface imprints of AGW show the patterns of both a transverse wave along the coastal plain and a diverging wave in the lee of Mount Laoshan (1133-m peak), which indicate that terrain forcing affects the formation of AGW. The AGW have a wavelength of 8-10 km and extend about 100 km offshore. Model simulation shows that these waves have an amplitude over 3 km. Finer-scale (similar to 2 km) brushlike roughness features perpendicular to the coast are also observed, and they are interpreted as MABL rolls. The FFT analysis shows that the roll wavelengths vary spatially. The two-way interactive, triply nested grid (9-3-1 km) Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) simulation reproduces AGW-generated wind perturbations that are in phase at all levels, reaching up to the 700-hPa level for the diverging AGW and the 900-hPa level for the transverse AGW. The WRF simulation also reveals that dynamic instability, rather than thermodynamic instability, is the cause for the MABL roll generation. Differences in atmospheric inflection-point level and instability at different locations are reasons why the roll wavelengths vary spatially.

G.; Wang, Q.; Sgouros, G.; Wang, S.; Halios, Ch			Investigating the Summertime Low-Level Jet Over the East Coast of the USA: A Case Study	BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY												The vertical structure of the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) and the summertime low-level jet (LLJ) along the east coast of the U.S.A. was studied in the framework of a joint expedition (CBLAST-Low), carried out during the summer of 2003 (31 July-27 August) at Nantucket island, Massachusetts, U.S.A. Analyzing measurements from radiosondes, in-situ and remote sensing systems, it was found that within the lower part of the stable MABL, intermittent and persistent LLJ events were frequently observed. Evidence is presented implying that the analyzed jet case was induced by the interaction of a slow-moving cyclone over north-eastern U.S.A. and the stationary high pressure system over the Atlantic Ocean, as well as by the sloping inversion of the MABL. Focused on a 5-day period of persistent south-westerly (marine) flow, the analysis of sodar and radiosonde data revealed the presence of a stable layer associated with increased static stability just before the emergence of low-level flow acceleration. As indicated by the Richardson number profiles, the increased stability of the lower MABL suppressed turbulence, allowed the decoupling of LLJ from friction, providing a favourable environment for the development of inertial oscillations. Significant amplitudes of inertial motions, which were confirmed by the application of a Hilbert-Huang transform, are associated with the acceleration at the LLJ's core, due to the frontal events and the subsequent frictional decoupling, both leading to a modification of the large-scale flow structure.

J	Choi, M; Han, S				Choi, Minha; Han, Seungjae			Remote sensing imageries for land cover and water quality dynamics on the west coast of Korea	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												As human activities influence land cover changes, the environment on human life such as water quality, has been impacted. In particular, huge constructions or reclamation projects are responsible for dramatic land cover changes. The Saemangeum area in South Korea has been one of the largest reclamation projects to progress nearly in two decades. In this study, Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus images were used to classify land cover types in the Saemangeum area. A change detection method was utilized to determine the impacts of the reclamation project. While wetland, grassland, and urban areas were increased, forest, water, and agricultural areas were decreased during the reclamation progress. Water quality analysis related to the land cover changes was conducted to determine the influence of reclamation construction on the environment. Chemical oxygen demand and suspended sediment variability were significantly impacted by the sea current changes after the dyke construction. On the contrary, water temperature and dissolved oxygen were affected by the seasonal influences rather than the reclamation construction. Total nitrogen and total phosphorus were influenced by the fertilizers and pesticides as a result of agricultural activity. The trends of suspended sediment from Landsat images were similar with those from the ground observation sites and also impacted by the dyke construction.																	0167-6369					NOV	2013	185	11					9111	9124		10.1007/s10661-013-3240-1								WOS:000325116500027	23685982

Changes in mangrove forests around Douala, Cameroon, have been documented using aerial photography between 1974 and 2009. The distribution pattern of tree species was also assessed in 2009 following the point-centered quarter method (PCQM+) protocol. Pristine mangroves observed in 1974 had been disturbed markedly in 2003 and 2009. Some of the pre-existing mangroves were entirely replaced by settlements, road, and crops (maize, bean, banana, oil palm, green vegetables, and sugar cane plantations). From 1974 to 2003, 39.86 % of mangrove forests have disappeared; the net loss of 22.10 % occurred between 2003 and 2009 alone. Mangrove forest area had decreased 53.16 % around Douala over a 35-year period from 1974 to 2009 concurrent with a substantial increase of settlements (60 %), roads (233.33 %), agriculture areas (16 %), non-mangrove areas (193.33 %), and open water (152.94 %). Field survey showed that almost one third of the quadrants in the remaining mangrove forest were empty. The disrupted mangrove forest has an overall mean height, absolute density, and basal area of 19.80 m, 158 trees ha(-1), and 110.44 m(2) ha(-1), respectively. In comparison with scientific literature on mangrove degradation, this puts the mangroves around Douala at the top of the "peri-urban mangrove degradation" list. In addition, beyond listing of mangrove plants on the Red List of Threatened Species which will seldom lead to widely distributed species being listed, we call for the creation of a Red List of Locally Threatened Ecosystems, which in contrast is likely to list mangroves as an ecosystem under critical risk of (local) extinction in many countries around the globe, in particular, peri-urban sites.																	1559-2723					NOV	2013	36	6					1181	1192		10.1007/s12237-013-9638-8								WOS:000325099900007

Aquarius and SMOS detect effects of an extreme Mississippi River flooding event in the Gulf of Mexico	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Sea surface salinity (SSS) measurements from the Aquarius/Satelite de Aplicaciones Cientificas (SAC)-D satellite and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission were used to document the freshening associated with the record 2011 Mississippi River flooding event in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Assessment of the salinity response was aided by additional satellite observations, including chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and ocean surface currents, and a passive tracer simulation. Low SSS values associated with the spreading of the river plume were observed 1-3months after peak river discharge which then receded and became unidentifiable from satellite observations 5months after maximum discharge. The seasonal wind pattern and general circulation of the GoM dramatically impacted the observed salinity response, transporting freshwater eastward along the Gulf coast and entraining low salinity waters into the open GoM. The observed salinity response from Aquarius was consistent with SMOS SSS, chl-a concentrations, and the passive tracer simulation in terms of the pathway and transit time of the river plume spreading. This study is the first successful application of satellite SSS to study salinity variation in marginal seas.

We used a recently developed semi-empirical radiative transfer model combined with a multi-wavelength switching algorithm for the SSC retrieval from MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) satellite data. This method can successfully retrieve SSC from satellite data in turbid estuarine and coastal waters with a wide range of sediment concentrations (20-2500 mg l(-1)) and is robust for quantifying realistic patterns of the surface sediment dynamics. The seasonal and annual variability of the MERIS-derived SSC from 2003 to 2010 were analysed in this work. Five regions-of-interest (ROIs) in the Yangtze estuary and coast are included in the analysis: the upper estuary, the lower estuary, the outer estuary, the Hangzhou Bay and the Qidong shore. The results reveal that the SSC of the upper estuary has significant seasonal and annual variations in response to seasonal cycling and annual fluctuation of the river discharge. A long-term continuing decrease of river discharge may cause an overall decline of the SSC in the entire estuary and adjacent areas. The existence of horizontal exchanges of the sediments between the Yangtze estuary and the Jiangsu coast implies that the decreased fluvial sediment loads of the estuary may partially be compensated by supplementing contributions from other origins.

Introduction to the special issue: The field tradition in geomorphology	GEOMORPHOLOGY												In recognition of the critical role of field observations in the ongoing development of our discipline, the 43rd annual Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium (BGS) celebrated The Field Tradition in Geomorphology. By organizing a conference devoted to this theme, we sought to honor the contributions of pioneering, field-based geomorphologists and to encourage our community to contemplate how field work might continue to provide unique insight into a new, more technologically-driven era. For example, given recent advances in remote sensing methods such as LiDAR, what kind of added value can field work provide? Similarly, how can field-based studies contribute to societally relevant, large-scale questions related to climate change and sustainable management of the Earth system? Motivated by such questions, the 2012 BGS was convened in Jackson Hole, WY, a new, Western location that enabled participation by Rocky Mountain and west coast research groups underrepresented at previous Binghamton symposia. Also, in keeping with the field tradition theme, the 2012 BGS emphasized field trips, including a rafting excursion down the Snake River and an overview of the tectonic and glacial history of Jackson Hole. The on-site portion of the symposium consisted of invited oral and poster presentations and contributed posters, including many by graduate students. Topics ranged from an historical overview of the development of geomorphic thinking to long-term sediment tracer studies to a commentary on the synergy between LiDAR and field mapping. This special issue of Geomorphology consists of papers by invited authors from the 2012 BGS, and this overview provides some context for these contributions. Looking forward, we hope that the 43rd annual BGS will stimulate further discussion of the role of field work as the discipline of geomorphology continues to evolve, carrying on the field tradition into the future.

Coastal erosion triggered by a shipwreck along the coast of Goa, India	CURRENT SCIENCE												Temporal satellite imageries (1999, 2001, 2003, 2006, 2008 and 2011), wave model (DHI) results and field measurements have been used to evaluate whether the grounded ship MV River Princess played a role in triggering erosion along the famous Candolim-Sinquerim beaches of Goa. Coastal sand dunes bore the maximum impact. The cause of the erosion is unique. The orientation of the ship with respect to the coastline, its length, the distance of the ship from the coastline and, more importantly, the direction of the waves prevailing over the region suggest that the wreck acted like an offshore breakwater and triggered erosion along this coast. A tombolo was also formed on the lee side of the vessel, a process that eventually led to the formation of an accretion zone on the lee side. The zone of deposition is evidenced by the presence of a sand bar which gets partially exposed during low tide. As the littoral current along this coast is southward, the sand bar blocked the southward littoral drift. As a consequence, the sand depletion that followed subsequently induced erosion of the sea front. The extent of net erosion has been estimated at around 0.10934 sq. km (109,340 sq. m) during the past 12 years. A stretch of 1.5 km of the coast has receded by a maximum of 85 m. In economic terms, the loss of prime property is estimated at minimum 28 crore rupees. The direct impact of the wreck in eroding the coast is more explicit during the SW monsoon. The powerful intensity of winds and higher significant wave height (H-s = 2.59 m) during the SW monsoon deteriorate the shore front that is now devoid of sand dunes and, as a consequence, has gradually become fragile due to severe erosion.																	0011-3891					OCT 10	2013	105	7					990	996										WOS:000326360300029

In the applied method for vulnerability analysis, linguistic variables, fuzzy partitions, intervals and parametric analysis that characterize fuzzy modeling were used. After analyzing the levels of vulnerability to coastal erosion along the shoreline in the cities of Recife and Jaboatao dos Guararapes at the coast of Pernambuco, the following results were achieved: 33.33% of the coastline has low vulnerability while, 38.15% moderate vulnerability, 14.26% high vulnerability and, 14.26% very high vulnerability.

In this context we present a methodology for effective monitoring and mapping of Posidonia oceanica (PO) meadows in turbid waters using remote sensing techniques tested by means of LAI (Leaf Area Index) point sea truth measurements. Preliminary results using Daedalus airborne sensor are reported referring to the PO meadows at Civitavecchia site (central Tyrrhenian sea) where vessel traffic due to presence of important harbors and huge power plant represent strong impact factors. This coastal area, 100 km far from Rome (Central Italy), is characterized also by significant hydrodynamic variations and other anthropogenic factors that affect the health of seagrass meadows with frequent turbidity and suspended sediments in the water column. During 2011-2012 years point measurements of several parameters related to PO meadows phenology were acquired on various stations distributed along 20 km of coast between the Civitavecchia and S. Marinella sites. The Daedalus airborne sensor multispectral data were preprocessed with the support of satellite (MERIS) derived water quality parameters to obtain here improved thematic maps of the local PO distribution.

Multi-linear regression analysis was performed to estimate SSS and the Brown and Minnet algorithm was used for the SST. The extracted parameters were validated using in situ measurement taken with Hydro-Lab equipment. The extracted parameters from MODIS images reveal the signature values which establish the relationships between these parameters, and thus delineating the potential fish zonation (PFZ) map. These developed models will help for accurate monitoring of large coverage areas at low cost and within short period of time. Furthermore, such models will allow the prediction of the total fish catch in different seasons, thus contributing to fish industry management and marketing. This research recommends the use of PFZ map for mass scale fish harvesting in short time for larger areas. Finally, the research has developed a potential fish zone model amalgamating all the above parameters. The PFZ mapping was carried out off the coast of Semporna, Sabah as there were sufficient fish catch data for accuracy assessment. The R was computed as 0.93 and the higher fish catch areas have coincided very well with the higher PFZ values, meaning the tool is ready for use for operational near real-time fish forecasting.

The analysis of morphological and geobotanical units was carried out by applying processing and interpretation methods to optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, combined with data on water salinity, maximum flood height, sedimentary facies data, rainfall and river discharge. The temporal analysis of morphological and geobotanical units suggests the relative stabilization of savannah, varzea' and mangrove areas during the drier period and increasing tidal amplitude between 1987 to 1997. The wetter period and decreasing tidal amplitude between 1997 to 2008 led to an increase in the area of varzea' and lakes over savannah, and the expansion of mangroves mainly over the inundated field and tidal mud/mixed flats. Therefore, the decrease in rainfall index during the drier period is well-correlated with the reduction of the Calcoene River discharge and jointly with increasing tidal amplitude favored the increase of migration rate of the mud bank and erosion profile along the littoral. It was followed by the increase of the Calcoene River discharge and jointly with decreasing tidal amplitude during the wetter period, favoring the development of mangroves on muddy substrates near the coastline.

The measurement period offered a unique opportunity for conducting detailed investigations of the optical properties of aerosols associated with different air mass regimes including background maritime and those contaminated by anthropogenic air pollution and mineral dust. What appears to be the first time for this region, a shortwave optical closure experiment (lambda = 550 nm) for both scattering and absorption was attempted over a 12-day period during which aerosols exhibited the most change. Constraints to the optical model included combined SMPS and APS number concentration data for a continuum of fine and coarse-mode particle sizes up to PM2.5. We also take advantage of an IMPROVE chemical sampler to help constrain aerosol composition and mass partitioning of key elemental species including sea-salt, particulate organic matter, soil, non sea-salt sulfate, nitrate, and elemental carbon. Achieving full optical closure is hampered by limitations in accounting for the role of water vapor in the system, uncertainties in the instruments and the need for further knowledge in the source apportionment of the model's major chemical components. Nonetheless, our results demonstrate that the observed aerosol scattering and absorption for these diverse air masses are reasonably captured by the model, where peak aerosol events and transitions between key aerosols types are evident. Signatures of heavy polluted aerosol composed mostly of ammonium and non sea-salt sulfate mixed with some dust with transitions to background sea-salt conditions are apparent in the absorption data, which is particularly reassuring owing to the large variability in the imaginary component of the refractive indices. Consistency between the measured and modeled optical parameters serves as an important link for advancing remote sensing and climate research studies in dynamic aerosol-rich environments like Dongsha.

J	Bruck, M; Lehner, S				Bruck, Miguel; Lehner, Susanne			Coastal wave field extraction using TerraSAR-X data	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												The main highlights of TerraSAR-X (TS-X) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery are a higher resolution of up to 1 m, when compared to conventional C-band SAR data, and a reduction of nonlinear imaging effects of a moving target by lower platform altitude. Thus, ocean waves with wavelength <30 m are detectable. This makes TS-X particularly useful to observe coastal areas where complex bathymetry strongly impacts the approaching waves. TS-X images acquired in different coastal areas are presented, including three case studies at the German coast. Wave fields (significant wave height and peak wavelength) are derived from the TS-X imagery using the proposed XWAVE algorithm and compared not only to in situ buoy wave measurements but also to results of a high-resolution numerical wave model. The objective is to study the quality of significant wave height field estimation in the spatial domain in highly variable conditions, which are typically dominant in coastal areas. The results show that the empirical XWAVE algorithm allows estimating wave fields from TS-X data with high resolution, thus showing the spatial information on wave variations. Therefore, it is a new useful tool to characterize sea state in coastal areas by remote sensing. (c) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.

Long-Term Trends in Motor Vehicle Emissions in US Urban Areas	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												A fuel-based approach is used to estimate long-term trends (1990-2010) in carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from motor vehicles. Non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) are estimated using ambient NMHC/CO ratios after controlling for nonvehicular sources. Despite increases in fuel use of similar to 10-40%, CO running exhaust emissions from on-road vehicles decreased by similar to 80-90% in Los Angeles, Houston, and New York City, between 1990 and 2010. The ratio of NMHC/CO was found to be 0.24 +/- 0.04 mol C/mol CO over time in Los Angeles, indicating that both pollutants decreased at a similar rate and were improved by similar emission controls, whereas on-road data from other cities suggest rates of reduction in NMHC versus CO emissions may differ somewhat. Emission ratios of CO/NOx (nitrogen oxides = NO + NO2) and NMHC/NOx decreased by a factor of similar to 4 between 1990 and 2007 due to changes in the relative emission rates of passenger cars versus diesel trucks, and slight uptick thereafter, consistent across all urban areas considered here. These pollutant ratios are expected to increase in future years due to (1) slowing rates of decrease in CO and NMHC emissions from gasoline vehicles and (2) significant advances in control of diesel NOx emissions.

Due to the complexity in this type of coast, it is difficult to extract the coastline with traditional automated mapping approaches. In this paper, we present an automated methodobject-based region growing integrating edge detection (OBRGIE) for the extraction of this type of coastline. In this method, a new object feature named OMI (object merging index) is proposed to separate land and sea. The OBRGIE method was applied to Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) (pixel size 30m) and Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT-5) (pixel size 10 m) images of two coastal segments with lengths of 272.7 km and 35.5 km respectively, and the accuracy of the extracted coastlines was assessed in comparison with the manually delineated coastlines. The mean and RMSE (root mean square error) are 16.0 m and 16.4 m respectively for the TM images, and 8.0 m and 8.6 m, respectively, for the SPOT-5 images, indicating that the proposed method derives coastlines with pixel accuracy. The OBRGIE method is also found to be robust to the segmentation scale parameter, and the OMI feature is much more effective than the spectral attribute in separating land and sea in aquaculture coasts. This method may provide an inexpensive means of fast coastline mapping from remotely sensed imagery with relatively fine-to-moderate spatial resolution in coastal sectors with intense human interference.																	2072-4292					SEP	2013	5	9					4470	4487		10.3390/rs5094470								WOS:000328613300015

Rocky shore ecosystems comprise a mosaic of habitat types and therefore require good technology to extract fine-scale spatial data on habitat extent and quality. Airborne topographic light detection and ranging data and 0.1-m resolution digital aerial photography were used to map and quantify distinct habitats that influence the distribution of biodiversity on rocky shores. The objectives of this study were to create and test the accuracy of a classification system for the rocky shore habitat, to develop remote sensing techniques useful for the conservation of intertidal rocky shores, and to create detailed digital terrain models for five headlands in the Solitary Island Marine Park, mid-north coast, New South Wales, Australia. The intertidal rocky shore habitats were classified according to tidal heights and substrate type. Ground-truthing of remote sensing data was carried out by visual surveys during low tide. Error assessments using precision analysis and classification accuracy tests confirmed the reliability of the technique with <5% error. The data generated from this research can be used as a platform for spatial analysis of this environment, including modelling changes in biodiversity under different climate change scenarios.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SEP	2013	29	5					1184	1190		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12-00142.1								WOS:000326304800020

A quantitative description of the morphology of deltas is fundamental to address how they react to changes in climate forcing and human pressure. In particular, it is interesting to ask how the distributary patterns we observe in coastal areas around the world result from processes and external forcing acting on deltas, and how such patterns might be related to deltaic function, vulnerability, and resilience. Using the example of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Jamuna Delta, we show that the statistics of island size, shape factor, aspect ratio, and nearest-edge distance show distinct spatial patterns. Comparison between regions identified by our statistical analysis and a physiographic zonation of the delta suggests that the planform extracted from satellite imagery carries the signature of processes responsible for delta formation and evolution and of vegetation. The tidal region is characterized by high channel density, small islands, and short nearest-edge distance (shortest straight-line distance to the nearest water). The results suggest that regions of the delta characterized by presence of vegetation and active transport of water and sediment are statistically distinct from less active regions. Further, we perform a weighted connectivity analysis of the channel patterns based on channel width. The analysis suggests that channels connecting the upper portion of the delta to the coast do not play a significant role in the transport of water and sediment.

An Algorithm for Estimating Suspended Sediment Concentrations in the Coastal Waters of India using Remotely Sensed Reflectance and its Application to Coastal Environments	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												This study presents an empirical relationship of suspended sediment concentrations (SSCs) in the coastal waters, which is derived from the conventional methods, to radiometer remote sensing reflectance values (R-rs) and satellite data in coastal waters of Kerala. An algorithm is then developed to utilize both in situ SSCs measured from conventional methods and R-rs values. This algorithm is validated with the SSCs retrieved from Oceansat-2 Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) data. A significant coefficient of determination (R-2=0.62) is observed between the SSCs measured in situ and satellite derived SSCs. Reflectance values from more than two spectral wavelength bands are also employed to test the accuracy of results. Satellite derived SSCs range from 1- 40 mg/L in the coastal waters off Cochin, southwest India. The regional algorithm developed for the study area gives better results than Tassan's algorithm, and this algorithm can be used in estimation of SSC for coastal waters of western India.

Bathymetric Modeling from Satellite Imagery via Single Band Algorithm (SBA) and Principal Components Analysis (PCA) in Southern Caspian Sea	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Remotely sensed imagery is proving to be a useful tool to estimate water depths in coastal zones. Bathymetric algorithms attempt to isolate water attenuation and hence depth from other factors by using different combinations of spectral bands. In this research, images of absolute bathymetry using two different but related methods in a region in the southern Caspian Sea coasts has been produced. The first method used a Single Band Algorithm (SBA) and assumed a constant water attenuation coefficient throughout the blue band. The second method used Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to adjust for varying water attenuation coefficients without additional ground truth data. PCA method (r=-0.672394) appears to match our control points slightly better than single band algorithm (r=-0.645404). It is clear that both methods can be used as rough estimates of bathymetry for many coastal zone studies in the southern Caspian Sea such as near shore fisheries, coastal erosion, water quality, recreation siting and so forth. The presented methodology can be considered as the first step toward mapping bathymetry in the southern Caspian Sea. Further research must investigate the determination of the nonlinear optimization techniques as well as the assessment of these models' performance in the study area.

J	Pu, RL; Bell, S				Pu, Ruiliang; Bell, Susan			A protocol for improving mapping and assessing of seagrass abundance along the West Central Coast of Florida using Landsat TM and EO-1 ALI/Hyperion images	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Seagrass habitats are characteristic features of shallow waters worldwide and provide a variety of ecosystem functions. Remote sensing techniques can help collect spatial and temporal information about seagrass resources. In this study, we evaluate a protocol that utilizes image optimization algorithms followed by atmospheric and sunglint corrections to the three satellite sensors [Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) Advanced Land Imager (ALI) and Hyperion (HYP)] and a fuzzy synthetic evaluation technique to map and assess seagrass abundance in Pinellas County, FL, USA. After image preprocessed with image optimization algorithms and atmospheric and sunglint correction approaches, the three sensors' data were used to classify the submerged aquatic vegetation cover (%SAV cover) into 5 classes with a maximum likelihood classifier. Based on three biological metrics [%SAV, leaf area index (LA!), and Biomass] measured from the field, nine multiple regression models were developed for estimating the three biometrics with spectral variables derived from the three sensors' data. Then, five membership maps were created with the three biometrics along with two environmental factors (water depth and distance-to-shoreline). Finally, seagrass abundance maps were produced by using a fuzzy synthetic evaluation technique and five membership maps. The experimental results indicate that the HYP sensor produced the best results of the 5-class classification of %SAV cover (overall accuracy = 87% and Kappa = 0.83 vs. 82% and 0.77 by ALI and 79% and 0.73 by TM) and better multiple regression models for estimating the three biometrics (R-2 = 0.66, 0.62 and 0.61 for %SAV, LAI and Biomass vs. 0.62, 0.61 and 0.55 by ALI and 0.58, 0.56 and 0.52 by TM) for creating seagrass abundance maps along with two environmental factors. Combined our results demonstrate that the image optimization algorithms and the fuzzy synthetic evaluation technique were effective in mapping detailed seagrass habitats and assessing seagrass abundance with the 30-m resolution data collected by the three sensors.

Evolution of spit morphology: a case study using a remote sensing and statistical based approach	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												The dynamics and factors responsible for morphological changes of spits viz., Uliyargoli-Padukere, Oddu Bengre and Kodi Bengre, southern Karnataka, India, are investigated using multi-dated satellite images and topographic maps during the last 95-years (1910-2005). Variations and overall rate of changes in length, area and coefficient of determination (R-2) of each spit are calculated separately for two periods (1910 and 1967 as base years) to find out whether there is any significant trend in the case of change in length and area in all the three spits that are under study. Linear trend lines are fitted using a least squares method and the statistical significance is considered at 80 % level of confidence. The results recorded significant changes in spit morphology, especially in length and area if 1910 and 1967 are considered separately as base years, are may be due to non-availability of data set between 1910 and 1967 period. The study reveals that coastal processes, such as SW-monsoon influenced strong currents and longshore drifts are the main process for formation and growth of spits, whereas rivers influence/drift also plays significant role. The statistical uncertainty estimation in spits morphology is prevalent wherever the coast is affected by human interventions. The study demonstrates that combined use of satellite imagery and statistical techniques can be effectively used to understand the evolution of spits morphology.					Jayappa, K.

Assessment of Coastal Erosion Vulnerability around Midnapur-Balasore Coast, Eastern India using Integrated Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Digha coastal region in the northeastern part of the Bay of Bengal is potentially vulnerable to erosional hazard. The present study assessed the coastal erosion vulnerability along this 65 km long coastal stretch located between Rasulpur (Midnapur) and Subarnarekha (Balasore) estuarine complex, which had been subjected to anthropogenic intervention. Multi-resolution Landsat satellite imagery were used for shoreline change study from 1972 to 2010. During this period, accretion was recorded updrift of artificial structures, viz, seawall, groin, pylons and jetties; while, extensive erosion was recorded in downdrift areas of these structures. Assessment was subsequently divided into four categories ranging from "high erosion" to "accretion". Data from several sources were compiled to map landuse and human activities in the coastal zone. This map was divided into four categories, ranging from "very high capital" to "no capital" landuse. Population density map of the surrounding coastal villages was generated using census data, and divided into four categories ranging from "high density area" to "very low density area". Subsequently, coastal erosion vulnerability was assessed by combining coastal retreat with landuse type and population density in this study area using simple vector algebraic technique. Zones of vulnerability of different magnitude (viz., very high, high, moderate, and low) have been identified. Furthermore, calculation of "imminent collapse zone (ICZ)" shows that maximum values are around artificial structures and anthropogenic activities. The coastal erosion vulnerability map prepared from this study can be used for proper planning and management of this coastal region.																	0255-660X					SEP	2013	41	3					675	686		10.1007/s12524-012-0251-2								WOS:000324249800019

Spatial and temporal distribution of Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) along the northeast coast of the United States, 1985-1999	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												The distribution of Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) during their spring migration along the Mid-Atlantic Bight and into the Gulf of Maine has historically been associated with spring warming along the continental shelf. Variations in mackerel distributions based on National Marine Fisheries Service spring surveys were compared with variations in sea surface temperature (SST) from satellite remote sensing for the eastern US continental shelf for the period 1985-1999. The mackerel stock was first analysed as a unit, then separated into three size classes to assess differences in distribution among years and individuals of various lengths. Results showed an across-shelf correlation between catch and March SST in the Mid-Atlantic Bight for both the entire population and each size class. Along-shelf catch variations were correlated with SST for large mackerel, but not total stock or smaller size classes. Finally, the distribution of mackerel length in the Gulf of Maine was negatively correlated with March SST in the Great South Channel. Results suggest surface temperature along the northeast continental shelf may be used to predict certain, but not all, aspects of annual migration along the shelf, and that factors in addition to temperature are also important in controlling distributions of Atlantic mackerel.																	1054-3139					SEP	2013	70	6					1151	1161		10.1093/icesjms/fst029								WOS:000323635600012

Dust emission controls on the lower Kuiseb River valley, Central Namib	AEOLIAN RESEARCH												Global contemporary dust research has identified large inland basins as significant sources of mineral aerosols in the atmosphere. Smaller fluvial sources have received lesser attention despite their global prevalence. To determine the emissive potential of any dust source requires the identification the hydrologic, synoptic and meteorologic state of the system. This study considers the Kuiseb River, which is a significant dust source in southern Africa, and clearly highlights the fluvial-aeolian link in the emission process and emphasises the supply limited nature of such sources. MODIS satellite imagery combined with synoptic circulation and wind speed data were analysed to establish emission frequency in the context of climatology and flood frequency data. Twenty-two emission events were detected between 2005 and 2008, occurring from April to August, driven by north easterly winds largely associated with west coast troughs and berg winds. The ephemeral flooding of the Kuiseb River was identified as the most likely contributor of sediment to the lower reaches while topographic channelling may enhance the wind flow.

Assessment of MODIS-Aqua chlorophyll-a algorithms in coastal and shelf waters of the eastern Arabian Sea	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The use of ocean colour remote sensing to facilitate the monitoring of phytoplankton biomass in coastal waters is hampered by the high variability in absorption and scattering from substances other than phytoplankton. The eastern Arabian Sea coastal shelf is influenced by river run-off, winter convection and monsoon upwelling. Bio-optical parameters were measured along this coast from March 2009 to June 2011, to characterise the optical water type and validate three Chlorophyll-a (Chla) algorithms applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on Aqua (MODIS-Aqua) data against in situ measurements. Ocean Colour 3 band ratio (OC3M), Garver-Siegel-Maritorena Model (GSM) and Generalized Inherent Optical Property (GIOP) Chla algorithms were evaluated. OC3M performed better than GSM and GIOP in all regions and overall, was within 11% of in situ Chla. GSM was within 24% of in situ Chla and GIOP on average was 55% lower. OC3M was less affected by errors in remote sensing reflectance R-rs(lambda) and by spectral variations in absorption coefficient (a(CDOM)(lambda)) of coloured dissolved organic material (CDOM) and total suspended matter (TSM) compared to the other algorithms. A nine year Chla time series from 2002 to 2011 was generated to assess regional differences between OC3M and GSM. This showed that in the north eastern shelf, maximum Chla occurred during the winter monsoon from December to February, where GSM consistently gave higher Chla compared to OC3M.

J	Chen, C; Jiang, H; Zhang, Y				Chen, Cheng; Jiang, Hong; Zhang, Yu			Anthropogenic impact on spring bloom dynamics in the Yangtze River Estuary based on SeaWiFS mission (1998-2010) and MODIS (2003-2010) observations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Nutrient output from the Yangtze River to the sea has increased dramatically since the 1960s, and over the past 50 years more than 50,000 reservoirs on the Yangtze River basin have had little impact on water discharge, but have drastically reduced the annual river-to-sea sediment flux, especially after 2000. This can be presumed to have a close link with the 73% (accumulated incidences) of algal bloom reported on China's eastern coast which have taken place in the Yangtze River Estuary (YRE) and its adjacent waters from 2000 to 2009. A conceptual view explains that the algal bloom zone varies between the YRE and mid-shelf waters of the East China Sea, where the optimum balance of light availability and nutrient supply exists. A reduction in turbidity with declining river-to-sea sediment load around the YRE would provide a deeper euphotic layer for the growth of phytoplankton, which is stimulated by eutrophication following increased river-to-sea sewage. Although the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) represents an immature state of ocean colour remote sensing, especially in coastal waters, in general, SeaWiFS serves as a useful tool to highlight the geographical spread and intensity of spring bloom dynamics at the basin scale in the YRE. We suggest that the problem of skin effect bias in spaceborne observation is minimal and that satellite-derived pigment data should be mainly from phytoplankton production when estimating Chl-a during the spring bloom season in the YRE by analysis of bio-optical properties of spring bloom waters. Comparisons between in situ and simultaneous SeaWiFS-derived Chl-a suggest that SeaWiFS standard Chl-a data show comparable results with ship survey data, with a mean ratio (in situ to satellite ratio) of 1.28 +/- 0.78 (R-2=0.71, n=14, p< 0.001) in spring blooms. We took the seasonal average Chl-a in our defined multi-year highly productive zone in the YRE (28 degrees 3032 degrees N, 122 degrees 123 degrees 30 degrees E, A) compared with its neighbouring region B from 1998 to 2010, and determined a linear least-squares fit to the trend line. Further analysis in the form of t-tests was run for four seasonal periods, MarchApril, MayJune (spring bloom season), JulyAugust, and SeptemberOctober. The SeaWiFS-derived 13-year Chl-a mean slope in the spring bloom season is significantly (P=0.012) increasing by 0.212mgm(3) per year. However, such a trend in other seasons is not significant and there is also no significant variation in B over all seasons. Our results show that there is a positive relationship between the annual mean of Chl-a in the spring bloom season in A and annual sewage water discharge at the Yangtze River basin, and similarly a negative relationship between Chl-a and annual river sediment flux was found from 1998 to 2010. Variation in 3-year sediment flux, sewage water discharge, and Chl-a was 25% (+/- 18%), 15% (+/- 5%), and 14% (+/- 6%), respectively. This result supports the findings of previous studies that human activity has a measurable effect on coastal phytoplankton biomass and that the eutrophication effect seems to stimulate increased Chl-a in the spring bloom season, but not on the enhancement of annual Chl-a levels in the YRE.																	0143-1161	1366-5901				AUG 10	2013	34	15					5296	5316		10.1080/01431161.2013.786851								WOS:000318765000003

Tectonically, Ras Banas peninsula is considered as a part of Pre-Miocene continental slope. Their sedimentary successions account the sedimentation history from Middle Miocene up to Holocene which in part documents the deformational impacts that accompanied the Red Sea rifling. The Ras Banas sedimentary succession exhibits frequent unconformities and conspicuous lithologic variations comprising mixed siliciclastics/carbonate facies, evaporites, open marine and organic build up limestone as well as coral reefs, continental sandy gravels and beach sands. The carbonate succession at the area documents the highstand status of the Red Sea water from Middle Miocene to Pleistocene in accord to the global sea-level fluctuations. The chemical data of the studied rock units substantiates the field and petrographical results. On silica- lime- magnesia diagram, the syn-rifting mixed siliciclastics/carbonates are scattered between the quartz and dolomite reference points. The post-rifting carbonates are mainly pure dolostone, limestone and sandy limestone. Norm calculations indicate that the evaporites are mainly gypsum and anhydrite with substantial normative dolomite. The tectono-sedimentary evolution of Ras Banas sedimentary sequence in relation to Red Sea rifling phases and sea level fluctuations is discussed. New mapping was undertaken for the Ras Banas Peninsula using remote sensing and GIS techniques including band ratioing, principle component analysis and false color composition. Based on mineralogical data, special interest has been paid to the diagnostic spectral features that discriminate between evaporites and carbonates on one hand and between dolomite and calcite on the other.

We have come a long way, yet we still have far to go	NATURAL HAZARDS												Disaster experts around the world have continually warned governments and the public about the possibility of "worst-case'' natural hazard scenarios and their overwhelming impacts. Yet, planning for the occurrence of these events has fallen far short of need. The large earthquake that occurred off the coast of Sumatra in 2004, which resulted in one of the deadliest tsunamis ever recorded, was a painful reminder that living in some of the most desirable areas of the world does have its risks. We all have enjoyed the fun of restful visits to coastal resort communities all around the world, and we rarely think about earthquakes or tsunamis interfering with this enjoyment. Yet, they take us by surprise. Before these events do occur, there should be adequate education for everyone on what actions are appropriate as well as an effective warning system to trigger the right actions.																	0921-030X					AUG	2013	68	1					201	202		10.1007/s11069-013-0555-8								WOS:000322724000013						
J	Bilham, R; Fielding, E				Bilham, Roger; Fielding, Eric			Remote sensing and the search for surface rupture, Haiti 2010	NATURAL HAZARDS												Minutes after the January 12, 2010 Haiti earthquake, most geologists and seismologists assumed that from its shallow teleseismic location and its largely strike-slip mechanism that a significant rupture must have occurred on the transform plate boundary south and west of Port au Prince. Within hours, plans were being made by geologists to map the anticipated rupture and, if possible, to trench it to obtain a record of paleoseismic slip. However, remote sensing images available a few days after the earthquake revealed raised corals and no significant plate boundary slip, and we now know that shallow slip was transpressive and that no surface rupture occurred. A week after the earthquake, it was clear that scientific visits to the region would be much delayed by the continuing needs of emergency response teams and military support who had commandeered access to the airport at Port au Prince. Serendipitously on 20 January, one of the authors accompanied a film crew on a chartered flight from nearby Santo Domingo with the quest to record the tectonic reasons for the disaster and to document the details of structural damage. At the time, there was still no clear idea of whether the transform boundary had a surface rupture, but there was abundant evidence for surface deformation from Google Earth images showing raised corals and collapsed coastlines along the Leogane coast. This article briefly describes communications between remote geologists and the ground-based crew who were guided to critical areas in the search for surface deformation using remote sensing data.

J	Painemal, D; Minnis, P; O'Neill, L				Painemal, David; Minnis, Patrick; O'Neill, Larry			The Diurnal Cycle of Cloud-Top Height and Cloud Cover over the Southeastern Pacific as Observed by GOES-10	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												The diurnal cycles in cloud-top height H-top and cloud fraction (CF) in the southeastern Pacific stratocumulus region were determined for October-November 2008 by analyzing data from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-10 (GOES-10) according to a diurnal/semidiurnal harmonic fitting technique. The value of H-top was obtained by applying a formula based on a linear regression of the differences between GOES-10 cloud-top temperature and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI) satellite sea surface temperature, with a common 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees spatial resolution. A satellite liquid water path (LWP) climatology complemented this dataset. Southwestward transects of H-top and LWP anomalies reveal a coherent propagating signal from the coast in the afternoon, with a typical phase speed of 25 m s(-1). This pattern is preceded by a subsidence wave that reaches its peak a few hours before the maximum in H-top and LWP anomalies. Coincident increases in LWP and H-top after the subsidence wave passes suggest that the boundary layer deepening promotes cloud thickening and increased LWP, which are likely maintained through a well-mixed boundary layer and sufficient moisture fluxes that can counteract the effect of dry air entrainment. The interference between the radiatively and subsidence wave-driven cycles gives rise to a semidiurnal cycle in H-top along the coast. While the semidiurnal amplitude is near 80 m close to the coast with a fraction of explained variance greater than 0.4, it decreases to 30 m offshore (80 degrees W). Similar to H-top, CF also exhibits contrasting zonal differences, but with a smaller semidiurnal component. The phase of the semidiurnal harmonic resembles the subsidence propagation westward, and the noticeable land-sea breeze circulation at 26 degrees S that extends 200 km offshore.

The study was materialized in 20 different sampling points during the overpass of the EO-1 ALI sensor over the study area. A multi-linear regression technique was used to explore the relationships between radiometrically corrected EO-1 ALI image data and water quality parameters: chlorophyll a, turbidity, and suspended solids. The retrieved and verified results show that the measured and estimated values of water quality parameters are in good agreement (R (2) > 0.93). The resulting thematic maps derived from EO-1 multispectral data for chlorophyll a, turbidity, and suspended solids show the spatial distribution of the water quality parameters. The results indicate that the reservoir has average nutrient values. Furthermore, chlorophyll a, turbidity, and suspended solids values increased at the upstream reservoir and shallow coast of the HirfanlA +/- Water Reservoir.

This paper presents the detecting of shoreline changes in four typical coastal wetlands of ecological importance along Bohai rim based on multi-temporal shorelines extracted from obtained Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) images using automatic binarization algorithm. Results showed that although there were statistical uncertainties dominant trends of the shoreline changes could be detected and sections that had significant area changes could be identified from satellite images. The reasons for corresponding changes occurred in these wetlands were stated in terms of natural processes and anthropogenic activities.

The large number of people who live close to the coast and rely directly on marine resources for food and income paradoxically increases the value of, but also the threats to, these ecosystems. A key strategy of the Coral Triangle Initiative is to protect shallow coastal ecosystems through the design and implementation of resilient networks of marine protected areas (MPAs). This strategy requires accurate spatial data on the distribution and extent of coastal habitats (coral reef, seagrass and mangrove) at scales which match conservation planning decisions. In the Coral Triangle, seagrass distribution maps are not readily available at ecoregional scales. The Lesser Sunda ecoregion, extending from Bali, Indonesia to Timor-Leste, is one of 11 ecoregions of the Coral Triangle and a high priority for conservation and sustainable management of marine resources. To support the design of a resilient MPA network for the Lesser Sunda ecoregion, a seagrass distribution map was generated based on Landsat imagery, literature review and groundtruth data. Seagrass beds were estimated to cover an area of 273 km(2) at an overall accuracy of 78%. Use of the seagrass distribution map in the MPA design improved the habitat representation and connectivity - key criteria for resilient MPA design. The final MPA design included 80 km(2) of seagrass beds, with more than half the beds adjacent to coral reefs and mangroves. This study demonstrates the effective use of Landsat imagery and remote sensing techniques to derive ecoregional scale seagrass maps supporting MPA network design. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Liu, YX; Huang, HJ; Qiu, ZF; Fan, JY				Liu, Yanxia; Huang, Haijun; Qiu, Zhongfeng; Fan, Jianyong			Detecting coastline change from satellite images based on beach slope estimation in a tidal flat	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Beach heights and tidal variation have large impacts on the accuracy of estimates of coastline position and its historical changes of a wider and flatter beach based on remote sensing data. This study presents an approach to analysis of waterline movement based on the beach slope, estimated from two effective images with Landsat images data. Two images acquired at different stages of the tide were processed to delineate accurately the position of the waterline. Then waterlines were assigned heights using elevations predicted by a two-dimensional non-linear tidal assimilation model. Beach slope can be calculated piecewise using the heighted shorelines based on the equiangular triangle theory. The positions of the national tidal height datum coastline can be obtained by the beach slope calculation method to accurately monitor the changing of coastline. A change in the coastline of the southwest tidal flat of the Yellow River delta, from Tianshuigou to the Xiaoqing River mouth, was detected by combining field measurements of profiles and bathymetric data. The root mean squared error (RMSE) of the calculated slope of the intertidal zone was one order of magnitude less than the measured slope. The minimum error of self-consistency check is 0.2%. The RMSE between the coastlines estimated by the proposed method and those surveyed data varies from 53.98 m to 217.72 m. It is shown that this method is more suitable for the two years and over the time scales of shoreline change monitoring. To assess erosion/accretion patterns in the tidal flat, and the controlling factors, the volume of the beach was investigated as a possible indicator. The accepted coastline position and changes in the beach volume were used to monitor the changing pattern of accretion and erosion along the coast southwest of the recent Yellow River mouth.

Factors Affecting Harp Seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus) Strandings in the Northwest Atlantic	PLOS ONE												The effects of climate change on high latitude regions are becoming increasingly evident, particularly in the rapid decline of sea ice cover in the Arctic. Many high latitude species dependent on sea ice are being forced to adapt to changing habitats. Harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus) are an indicator species for changing high-latitude ecosystems. This study analyzed multiple factors including ice cover, demographics, and genetic diversity, which could affect harp seal stranding rates along the eastern coast of the United States. Ice cover assessments were conducted for the month of February in the Gulf of St. Lawrence whelping region from 1991-2010 using remote sensing data, and harp seal stranding data were collected over the same time period. Genetic diversity, which may affect how quickly species can adapt to changing climates, was assessed using ten microsatellite markers to determine mean d(2) in a subset of stranded and by-caught (presumably healthy) seals sampled along the northeast U. S. coast. Our study found a strong negative correlation (R-2 = 0.49) between ice cover in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and yearling harp seal strandings, but found no relationship between sea ice conditions and adult strandings. Our analysis revealed that male seals stranded more frequently than females during the study period and that this relationship was strongest during light ice years. In contrast, we found no significant difference in mean d(2) between stranded and by-caught harp seals. The results demonstrate that sea ice cover and demographic factors have a greater influence on harp seal stranding rates than genetic diversity, with only a little of the variance in mean d(2) among stranded seals explained by ice cover. Any changes in these factors could have major implications for harp seals, and these findings should be considered in the development of future management plans for the Arctic that incorporate climate variability.

In this context, taking into account the recent advances in the fields of high-resolution (HR) satellite/airborne remote-sensing and genetics laboratory analysis techniques, we propose this integrated methodology for monitoring changes in transplanted meadows in regard to perspective to provide support in the assessment of the entire local PO and seagrass population dynamic. According to specific information requirements in terms of radiometric and spectral/spatial resolution, the multispectral data currently available from the QuickBird polar satellite's four-band (red, green, and blue visible and near-infrared) HR sensor were exploited for methodology implementation using a practical image-based' approach to account for atmospheric and water column turbidity typical of this mid-coastal Mediterranean region. First, the extents and types of seagrass cover were suitably mapped, and then also the distributions of specific vegetation parameters related to PO dynamics and health were assessed by exploiting the remotely sensed satellite-derived radiance signals and point sea-truth calibration measurements of the bio-genetic parameters. In particular, we implemented maps of leaf area index, genetic similarity, and density Giraud indices corresponding to distributions of PO patches using multivariate and data-mining models (artificial neural network) based on appropriately preprocessed radiometric and auxiliary (bathymetry) input variables.

J	Collin, A; Archambault, P; Planes, S				Collin, Antoine; Archambault, Philippe; Planes, Serge			Bridging Ridge-to-Reef Patches: Seamless Classification of the Coast Using Very High Resolution Satellite	REMOTE SENSING												The structure and functioning of coral reef coastal zones are currently coping with an increasing variety of threats, thereby altering the coastal spatial patterns at an accelerated pace. Understanding and predicting the evolution of these highly valuable coastal ecosystems require reliable and frequent mapping and monitoring of both inhabited terrestrial and marine areas at the individual tree and coral colony spatial scale. The very high spatial resolution (VHR) mapping that was recently spearheaded by WorldView-2 (WV2) sensor with 2 m and 0.5 m multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (Pan) bands has the potential to address this burning issue. The objective of this study was to classify nine terrestrial and twelve marine patch classes with respect to spatial resolution enhancement and coast integrity using eight bands of the WV2 sensor on a coastal zone of Moorea Island, French Polynesia. The contribution of the novel WV2 spectral bands towards classification accuracy at 2 m and 0.5 m were tested using traditional and innovative Pan-sharpening techniques. The land and water classes were examined both separately and combinedly. All spectral combinations that were built only with the novel WV2 bands systematically increased the overall classification accuracy of the standard four band classification. The overall best contribution was attributed to the coastal-red edge-near infrared (NIR) 2 combination (Kappa(gain) = 0.0287), which significantly increased the fleshy and encrusting algae (User's Accuracy(gain) = 18.18%) class. However, the addition of the yellow-NIR2 combination dramatically impacted the hard coral/algae patches class (Producer's Accuracy(loss) = -20.88%). Enhancement of the spatial resolution reduced the standard classification accuracy, depending on the Pan-sharpening technique. The proposed composite method (local maximum) provided better overall results than the commonly used sensor method (systematic). However, the sensor technique produced the highest contribution to the hard coral thicket (PA(gain) = 30.36%) class with the coastal-red edge-NIR2 combination. Partitioning the coast into its terrestrial and aquatic components lowered the overall standard classification accuracy, while strongly enhancing the hard coral bommie class with the coastal-NIR2 combination (UA(gain) = 40%) and the green-coastal Normalized Difference Ratio (UA(gain) = 11.06%). VHR spaceborne remote sensing has the potential to gain substantial innovative insights into the evolution of tropical coastal ecosystems from local to regional scales, to predict the influence of anthropogenic and climate changes and to help design optimized management and conservation frameworks.

Regional dynamics of forest canopy change and underlying causal processes in the contiguous US	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The history of forest change processes is written into forest age and distribution and affects earth systems at many scales. No one data set has been able to capture the full forest disturbance and land use record through time, so in this study, we combined multiple lines of evidence to examine trends, for six US regions, in forest area affected by harvest, fire, wind, insects, and forest conversion to urban/surburban use. We built an integrated geodatabase for the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) with data spanning the nation and decades, from remote sensing observations of forest canopy dynamics, geospatial data sets on disturbance and conversion, and statistical inventories, to evaluate relationships between canopy change observations and casual processes at multiple scales. Results show the variability of major change processes through regions across decades. Harvest affected more forest area than any other major change processes in the North East, North Central, Southeast, and South central regions. In the Pacific Coast and Intermountain West, more forest area was affected by harvest than forest fires. Canopy change rates at regional scales confounded the trends of individual forest change processes, showing the importance of landscape scale data. Local spikes in observed canopy change rates were attributed to wind and fire events, as well as volatile harvest regimes. This study improves the geographic model of forest change processes by updating regional trends for major disturbance and conversion processes and combining data on the dynamics of fire, wind, insects, harvest, and conversion into one integrated geodatabase for the CONUS.

Modeling the temperature-nitrate relationship in the coastal upwelling domain of the California Current	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Given the importance of nitrate in sustaining high primary production and fishery yields in eastern boundary current ecosystems, it is desirable to know the amounts of this nutrient reaching the euphotic zone through the upwelling process. Because such measurements are not routinely available, we developed predictive models of water-column (0-200 m) nitrate based on temperature for a region of the California Current System (30-47 degrees N) within 50 km from the coast. Prediction was done using generalized additive models based on a compilation of 37,607 observations collected over the period 1959-2004 and validated with a separate set of 6430 observations for the period 2005-2011. A temperature-only model had relatively high explanatory power (explained deviance, D-2=71.6%) but contained important depth, latitudinal, and seasonal biases. A model incorporating salinity in addition to temperature (D-2=91.2%) corrected for the latitudinal and depth biases but not the seasonal bias. The best model included oxygen, temperature, and salinity (D-2=96.6%) and adequately predicted nitrate temporal behavior at two widely separated locations (44 degrees 39.1N and 32 degrees 54.6N) with slight or no bias [root-mean-square error (RMSE)=2.39 and 0.40 mu M, respectively). For situations when only temperature is available, a model including depth, month, and latitude as proxy covariates corrects some of the biases, but it had lower predictive skill (RMSE=2.50 and 5.22 M, respectively). The results of this study have applications for the proxy derivation of nitrate availability for primary producers (phytoplankton, macroalgae) in upwelling regions and for biogeochemical and ecosystem modeling studies.

Species distribution modelling for the people: unclassified landsat TM imagery predicts bird occurrence at fine resolutions	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim Assessing the influence of land cover in species distribution modelling is limited by the availability of fine-resolution land-cover data appropriate for most species responses. Remote-sensing technology offers great potential for predicting species distributions at large scales, but the cost and required expertise are prohibitive for many applications. We test the usefulness of freely available raw remote-sensing reflectance data in predicting species distributions of 40 commonly occurring bird species in western Oregon. Location Central Coast Range, Cascade and Klamath Mountains Oregon, USA. Methods Information on bird observations was collected from 4598 fixed-radius point counts. Reflectance data were obtained using 30-m resolution Landsat imagery summarized at scales of 150, 500, 1000 and 2000m. We used boosted regression tree (BRT) models to analyse relationships between distributions of birds and reflectance values and evaluated prediction performance of the models using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values. Results Prediction success of models using all reflectance values was high (mean AUC=0.79 +/- 0.10 SD). Further, model performance using individual reflectance bands exceeded those that used only Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The relative influence of band 4 predictors was highest, indicating the importance of variables associated with vegetation biomass and photosynthetic activity. Across spatial scales, the average influence of predictors at the 2000m scale was greatest. Main Conclusions We demonstrate that unclassified remote-sensing imagery can be used to produce species distribution models with high prediction success. Our study is the first to identify general patterns in the usefulness of spectral reflectances for species distribution modelling of multiple species. We conclude that raw Landsat Thematic Mapper data will be particularly useful in species distribution models when high-resolution predictions are required, including habitat change detection studies, identification of fine-scale biodiversity hotspots and reserve design.																	1366-9516					JUL	2013	19	7					855	866		10.1111/ddi.12093								WOS:000320327500019						
J	Stramondo, S				Stramondo, Salvatore			The Tohoku-Oki Earthquake: A Summary of Scientific Outcomes From Remote Sensing	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												On March 11, 2011, at 05: 46: 23 UTC, a megaearthquake (magnitude 9.0) occurred near the NE coast of Honshu Island (Japan), which originated near the subduction plate boundary between the Pacific and North American plates. The epicenter has been located at about 130 km east of Sendai City at a depth of about 32 km. A foreshock sequence took place days preceding the mainshock with magnitude 7.3 in March 9. The earthquake has been followed by a devastating tsunami. The location, the geometric parameters, and the focal mechanism are in agreement with the occurrence of the earthquake along the subduction plate boundary. The focal region from seismological analysis indicated that an area of about 500 km x 200 km moved with a maximum displacement of about 24 m near the hypocenter. The Earth Observation Community has made a strong effort to investigate the surface effects by exploiting the satellite data and the geodetic GPS measurements available. The Group on Earth Observation Geohazard Supersites established the Tohoku-Oki Event Supersite. This initiative provided a huge amount of satellite data to the scientific community. The main outcomes concern the measurement of the surface displacement pattern, the detection of surface changes due to damage, and the investigation of coastal changes due to inundation.																	1545-598X					JUL	2013	10	4					895	897		10.1109/LGRS.2013.2240651								WOS:000320720300028

Two sources of daily operational OBCs of temperature are considered, derived from (1) the Mercator Global Ocean and (2) the Iberian Biscay Irish analysis and forecasting systems delivering predictions at spatial resolutions of 1/12A degrees and 1/36A degrees, respectively. Coastal model performance is evaluated by comparing SST predictions with recently available field data collected (1) along the route of a vessel travelling between the coast and the isle of Ushant and (2) at two offshore stations. The comparison is extended to SST spatial distribution derived from remote-sensing observations. The influence of OBC spatial resolution is exhibited in the north-eastern area of the Sea of Iroise in relation to the intrusion of cold surface waters. OBC temporal resolution is found to have a lower impact advocating for the implementation of climatological temperature forcings to predict major SST patterns in the Sea of Iroise.

Locating suitable mangrove plantation sites along the Saudi Arabia Red Sea Coast	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												This paper describes a method to locate suitable sites for mangrove plantations along the southern Saudi Arabian Red Sea Coast based on the geological setting of the area. Geological characteristics such as soil type, geomorphology and drainage were considered as siting criteria. Satellite imagery and digital elevation models were interpreted to determine most of the parameters. The study determined that mangrove stands are primarily concentrated in the southern part of the study area and that they are sparsely found northward. Using data provided by satellite imagery, topographic maps and soil samples, the study was able to determine that three areas now barren of vegetation have the environmental elements necessary to support mangroves. One, in particular, would be especially suitable for establishing a plantation. In this paper, we describe the methods we used to make this determination and show the results of the analysis.

These mud banks have an overwhelming impact on the geology, the geomorphology, the ecology and the economy of this coast. Although numerous field investigations and remote sensing studies have considerably enhanced our understanding of the dynamics of this coast over the last three decades, much still remains to be understood of the unique functional mechanisms and processes driving its evolution. Among the themes that we deem as requiring further attention three come out as fundamental. The first concerns the mechanisms of formation of individual mud banks from mud streaming on the shelf off the mouth of the Amazon. An unknown quantity of the fluid mud generated by offshore estuarine front activity is transported shoreward and progressively forms mud banks on the Amapa coast, Brazil. The volume of each mud bank can contain from the equivalent of the annual mud supply of the Amazon to several times this annual sediment discharge. The mechanisms by which individual banks are generated from the Amazon turbidity maximum are still to be elucidated. Areas of research include regional mesoscale oceanographic conditions and mud supply from the Amazon. The second theme is that of variations in rates of migration of mud banks, which influence patterns of coastal accretion. Research emphasis needs to be placed on the analysis of both regional meteorological-hydrodynamic forcing and distant Atlantic forcing, as well as on the hydrology of the large rivers draining the Guyana Shield. The rivers appear to generate significant offshore deflection of mud banks in transit alongshore, through a hydraulic-groyne effect. This may favour both muddy accretion on the updrift coast and downdrift mud liquefaction with probably lessened muddy deposition. The third theme concerns sand supply by the Guiana Shield rivers. The rare sand deposits are important in providing sites for human settlements and routes and for nesting by marine turtles. The limited presence of sand bodies on this coast may reflect 'mud blanketing', a hypothesis that requires verification through high-resolution seismic analyses of shelf deposits and coring operations. The large Guiana Shield rivers, especially in Surinam and Guyana, have supplied sand for the construction of significant bands of cheniers, probably enhanced by the afore-mentioned downdrift hydraulic-groyne effect on hindered mud deposition. In all the three themes of this future research agenda, two central elements are the sediment input of the rivers of the Amazon basin, starting with the massive mud supply from the Amazon catchment itself, followed by sand inputs by the Guiana Shield rivers and their river-mouth effects on mud banks.

J	Yang, WD; Marshak, A; Kostinski, AB; Varnai, T				Yang, Weidong; Marshak, Alexander; Kostinski, Alexander B.; Varnai, Tamas			Shape-induced gravitational sorting of Saharan dust during transatlantic voyage: Evidence from CALIOP lidar depolarization measurements	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Motivated by the physical picture of shape-dependent air resistance and, consequently, shape-induced differential sedimentation of dust particles, we searched for and found evidence of dust particle asphericity affecting the evolution and distribution of dust-scattered light depolarization ratio (). Specifically, we examined a large data set of Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) observations of Saharan dust from June to August 2007. Observing along a typical transatlantic dust track, we find that (1) median is uniformly distributed between 2 and 5km altitudes as the elevated dust leaves the west coast of Africa, thereby indicating uniformly random mixing of particle shapes with height; (2) vertical homogeneity of median breaks down during the westward transport: between 2 and 5km increases with altitude and this increase becomes more pronounced with westward progress; (3) tends to increase at higher altitude (>4km) and decrease at lower altitude (<4km) during the westward transport. All these features are captured qualitatively by a minimal model (two shapes only), suggesting that shape-induced differential settling and consequent sorting indeed contribute significantly to the observed temporal evolution and vertical stratification of dust properties. By implicating particle shape as a likely cause of gravitational sorting, these results will affect the estimates of radiative transfer through Saharan dust layers.

J	Zhao, H; Han, GQ; Zhang, SW; Wang, DX				Zhao, Hui; Han, Guoqi; Zhang, Shuwen; Wang, Dongxiao			Two phytoplankton blooms near Luzon Strait generated by lingering Typhoon Parma	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Two phytoplankton blooms near Luzon Strait triggered by Typhoon Parma in 2009 were investigated using remote sensing data and in situ observations. Parma was slow moving (a translation speed of similar to 2ms(-1)) and relatively weak (a maximum sustained wind of similar to 30ms(-1)) during its lingering path northwest of Luzon Island. After it reached a point (120.5 degrees E, 20.3 degrees N) west of Luzon Strait, Parma turned sharply back toward the northern Philippines along approximately the same course. Such long (similar to 7days) lingering typhoons are rather rare in the South China Sea (SCS). Before Parma, low Chl-a concentrations (<0.2mgm(-3)) were observed in the northeastern SCS. After its passage, a strong offshore phytoplankton increase (Chl-a>0.6mgm(-3)) appeared west of the central Luzon Strait; a nearshore phytoplankton increase was also observed north of Luzon Island, together with high CDOM (color dissolved organic matter). During and after the typhoon, sea-surface cooling (similar to 3 degrees C), stronger wind (>20ms(-1)), and heavy rainfall (>100mmday(-1)) were seen in the above regions. The offshore bloom occurred where Parma's translation speed was the slowest (similar to 1ms(-1)). It may be caused primarily by the Ekman pumping which brought nutrients upward to the euphotic zone and also by the entrainment mixing. The nearshore bloom may be triggered by the heavy typhoon-induced rainfall, which supplied nutrients for the coast region north of Luzon Island. The rapid increase of CDOM in the nearshore region implied that terrestrial input may be the source of nutrients.

J	Xi, HY; Larouche, P; Tang, SL; Michel, C				Xi, Hongyan; Larouche, Pierre; Tang, Shilin; Michel, Christine			Seasonal variability of light absorption properties and water optical constituents in Hudson Bay, Canada	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Previous studies have shown that the properties of optically significant water constituents (phytoplankton, suspended matter, and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM)) in Hudson Bay are different from other Arctic regions. A new bio-optical data set collected in summer 2010 shows that this region also presents seasonal variability of the light absorption coefficients by the different constituents, with a higher relative proportion of CDOM absorption in summer than in the fall as a result of decreased phytoplankton absorption in summer. The slope of the exponential function describing nonalgal particles and CDOM spectral absorption shows little variability between fall and summer. Seasonal variability of light absorption coefficients and water optical constituents is more pronounced near the coast, while less variability is observed in the central part of the bay. Very low summertime chlorophyll-specific absorption coefficients by phytoplankton, among the lowest reported in the literature, are attributed to the high proportion of large size phytoplankton (microphytoplankton) and important packaging effect. There is also a smaller contribution of accessory pigments to total pigments in the summer than in the fall, resulting in a lower blue-to-red phytoplankton absorption ratio. These results emphasize that it is necessary to take into account the seasonal variability of light absorption properties in bio-optical models for further remote sensing applications in Hudson Bay.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				JUN	2013	118	6					3087	3102		10.1002/jgrc.20237								WOS:000324885500023

J	Barnes, BB; Hu, CM				Barnes, Brian B.; Hu, Chuanmin			A Hybrid Cloud Detection Algorithm to Improve MODIS Sea Surface Temperature Data Quality and Coverage Over the Eastern Gulf of Mexico	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												Cloud contamination can lead to significant biases in sea surface temperature (SST) as estimated from satellite measurements. The effectiveness of four cloud detection algorithms for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in retaining valid SST data and masking cloud-contaminated data was assessed for all 2125 daytime and nighttime images during 2010 over the eastern Gulf of Mexico and including the east coast of Florida. None of the cloud detection algorithms was found to be sufficient to reliably differentiate clouds from valid SST, particularly during anomalously cold events. The strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm were identified, and a new hybrid cloud detection algorithm was developed to maximize valid data retention while excluding cloud-contaminated pixels. The hybrid algorithm was based on a decision tree, which includes a set of rules to use existing algorithms in different ways according to time and location. Comparing with > 10 000 concurrent in situ SST measurements from buoys, images processed with the hybrid algorithm showed increases in data capture and improved accuracy statistics over most existing algorithms. In particular, while keeping the same accuracy, the hybrid algorithm resulted in nearly 20% more SST retrievals than the most accurate algorithm (Quality SST) currently being used for operational processing. The increases in both data coverage and SST range should improve MODIS data products for more reliable SST retrievals in near real time, thus enhancing the ocean observing capacity to detect anomaly events and study short-and long-term SST changes in coastal environments.																	0196-2892					JUN	2013	51	6	1				3273	3285		10.1109/TGRS.2012.2223217								WOS:000320940600006

ASSOCIATION OF SCISSOR-TAILED FLYCATCHERS (TYRANNUS FORFICATUS) WITH SPECIFIC LAND-COVER TYPES IN SOUTH-CENTRAL TEXAS	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												Scissor-tailed Flycatchers (Tyrannus forficatus) are insectivorous Neotropical migrants that breed in the south-central United States. We examined their fine-scale (circles 300 m in radius centered on observed flycatcher locations) associations with different land cover types in south-central Texas. Scissor-tailed Flycatchers use a sit-and-scan foraging strategy; therefore, we expected the species would be positively associated with open land cover types (vegetation with little or no canopy) such as grassland, pasture/hayfield and cropland, and negatively associated with forest and shrubland given that the latter could obstruct visual scanning. We conducted 44 surveys from 9 May 2011 to 15 December 2011 by slowly driving (30 km/h) rural roads throughout 15 counties in south-central Texas and 3 near the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Using ArcGIS, we quantified the percent cover of four general land cover types (urban/developed land, forest/shrub, grassland/pasture/hay, and cropland) within 300 m of each flycatcher location. Statistical analysis involved comparing the land cover of the flycatcher locations to a set of random points along the same routes. On average, flycatcher locations had significantly more grassland/pasture/hay than did random points (38.8 vs. 31.2%) and significantly less forest/shrub (29.9 vs. 36.7%). Therefore, although flycatchers may associate with open land cover at a rate greater than its overall availability, they generally occupy locations that have a mix of open and closed land cover. Knowledge of flycatcher habitat use at a fine-scale could be useful to the successful conservation of this species.																	1559-4491					JUN	2013	125	2					314	321		10.1676/12-096.1								WOS:000320893300011

The feature first appears east of the central Vietnam coast in February as a high sea-level anomaly, grows rapidly to a well-developed anticyclonic eddy by March, matures in April, and decays in May. Besides the warm-core feature, it also has an inherent low-salinity property, so it is named "spring mesoscale high (SMH)". Though with clear interannual variation in terms of intensity and spatial coverage, the SMH always emerges in the region between 110 degrees E and 114 degrees E and between 12 degrees N and 16 degrees N. The formation of SMH is ascribed to the combined effects of wind forcing and releasing of potential energy set up by winter monsoon. In particular, the wind-stress curl plays an important role in its development, maintenance, and dissipation.

J	Neelamani, S; Uddin, S				Neelamani, S.; Uddin, S.			Erosion and Accretion Index for Kuwaiti Coast	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Assessment of long term erosion and accretion rate of the coastal area is essential for selection of different types of coastal structures. For example, it is not advisable to develop housing infrastructure on the coast, which is historically eroding. Similarly it is not preferable to select an accreting site for the construction of a port in order to avoid annual maintenance dredging after construction of the port. Kuwait is a coastal country and hence it is essential to understand the long term coastal morphological changes of the coast and identify the historically accreting or eroding or stable coast over a period of many years, say 10 to 15 years. The coastline evolution of Kuwait is investigated using Landsat remote sensing images (30 m resolution) from 1989 to 2003, IRS-P5 images (2.5 m resolution) obtained for the year 2006-07 and 2003 aerial photos (0.38 m resolution). A total of 130 grids, each at a spacing of 1 nautical mile is used. The extent of accretion/erosion for 17 years (from 1989 to 2006) for the mainland coastline of Kuwait is assessed. The average shoreline change/year is calculated. Erosion and accretion index for each location is assigned based on the average annual erosion and accretion. From this study, it is found that annual erosion of more than 25 m does not exist in Kuwait. 1.54% of the coast has experienced annual erosion of 10 to 25 m and 0.77% of the coast has experienced 0 to 10 m annual erosion. 3.85% of the coast is stable. 43.85% of the coast has annual accretion of 0 to 10 in, 11.54% has annual accretion of 10 to 25 m and 38.46% has annual accretion of greater than 25 m. The complete details of this study are presented in this paper. The results will be useful for integrated management of Kuwaiti coast.																	1735-6865					SUM	2013	7	3					779	784										WOS:000319952600016						
J	Ramirez-Herrera, MT; Navarrete-Pacheco, JA				Teresa Ramirez-Herrera, Maria; Antonio Navarrete-Pacheco, Jose			Satellite Data for a Rapid Assessment of Tsunami Inundation Areas after the 2011 Tohoku Tsunami	PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS												The M (w) = 9.0 earthquake that occurred off the coast of Japan's Tohoku region produced a great tsunami causing catastrophic damage and loss of life. Within hours of the tsunami event, satellite data were readily available and massive media coverage immediately circulated thousands of photographs and videos of the tsunami. Satellite data allow a rapid assessment of inundated areas where access can be difficult either as a result of damaged infrastructure (e.g., roads, bridges, ports, airports) or because of safety issues (e.g., the hazard at Nuclear Power Plant at Fukushima). In this study, we assessed in a day tsunami inundation distances and runup heights using satellite data (very high-resolution satellite images from the GeoEye1 satellite and from the DigitalGlobe worldview, SRTM and ASTER GDEM) of the Tohoku region, Northeast Japan. Field survey data by Japanese and other international scientists validated our results. This study focused on three different locations. Site selection was based on coastal morphologies and the distance to the tsunami source (epicenter). Study sites are Rikuzentakata, Oyagawahama, and Yagawahama in the Oshika Peninsula, and the Sendai coastal plain (Sendai City to Yamamoto City). Maximum inundation distance (6 km along the river) and maximum runup (39 m) at Rikuzentakata estimated from satellite data agree closely with the 39.7 m inundation reported in the field. Here the ria coastal morphology and horn shaped bay enhanced the tsunami runup and effects. The Sendai coastal plain shows large inundation distances (6 km) and lower runup heights. Natori City and Wakabayashi Ward, on the Sendai plain, have similar runup values (12 and 16 m, respectively) obtained from SRTM data; these are comparable to those obtained from field surveys (12 and 9.5 m). However, at Yagawahama and Oyagawahama, Miyagi Prefecture, both SRTM and ASTER data provided maximum runup heights (41 to 45 m and 33 to 34 m, respectively), which are higher than those measured in the field (about 27 m). This difference in DEM and field data is associated with ASTER and SRTM DEM's pixel size and vertical accuracy, the latter being dependent on ground coverage, slope, aspect and elevation. Countries with less access to technology and infrastructure can benefit from the use of satellite imagery and freely available DEMs for an initial, pre-field surveys, rapid estimate of inundated areas, distances and runup, and for assisting in hazard management and mitigation after a natural disaster.																	0033-4553	1420-9136				JUN	2013	170	6-8					1067	1080		10.1007/s00024-012-0537-x								WOS:000320044100008

Shoreline change analysis of Vedaranyam coast, Tamil Nadu, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The coastal zone is one of the nation's greatest environmental and economic assets. The present research aims at studying the shoreline changes along Vedaranyam coast using conventional and modern techniques including field sampling, remote sensing, and geographical information system (GIS). The study area was divided into three zones. Dynamic Land/Sea polygon analysis was performed to obtain the shore line changes at different time periods between 1930 and 2005. From the multidate shoreline maps, the rate of shoreline change was computed using linear regression rate and end point rate. Further, the shoreline was classified into eroding, accreting, and stable regions through GIS analysis. The eroding, accreting, and stable coastal stretch along Vedaranyam is observed as 18 %, 80.5 %, and 1.5 %, respectively. Net shoreline movement is seaward, i.e., the coast is progressive with an average rate of 5 m/year. A maximum shoreline displacement of 1.3 km towards the sea is observed near Point Calimere. During the Asian Tsunami 2004, the eastern part of the study area showed high erosion. Sediment transport paths derived from the grain size analysis of beach sediments collected during different seasons help to identify the major sediment source and sinks. Point Calimere acts as the major sink for sediments whereas Agastiyampalli and Kodiakkarai are found to be the major sources for the sediment supply along the Vedaranyam coast. Shoreline change study from field and satellite data using GIS analysis confirms that Vedaranyam coast is accreting in nature.																	0167-6369					JUN	2013	185	6					5099	5109		10.1007/s10661-012-2928-y								WOS:000318503100046	23054290

Sediment fluxes and the littoral drift along northeast Andhra Pradesh Coast, India: estimation by remote sensing	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The littoral drift regime along the northeastern coast of India was investigated by analyzing coastal drift indicators and shoreline changes based on multitemporal satellite images. The study of offshore turbidity patterns and quantitative estimation of suspended sediments was undertaken to understand the magnitude and direction of movement of sediment fluxes. The study revealed that: (1) the character of coastal landforms and sedimentation processes indicate that the sediment transport is bidirectional and monsoon dependent; (2) multidate, multitemporal analysis of satellite images helps to show the nature of sediment transport along the coast. The dominant net sediment transport is in a NE direction along the eastern coast of India. Finally, this assessment demonstrates the potential of remote sensing technology in understanding the coastal morphometric changes, long-term sediment transport, shoreline changes, and offshore turbidity distribution pattern and the implications for the transport of sediment-associated pollutants.

Two case studies, one representative of synoptic and the other of breeze patterns, are presented and analyzed to evaluate how the local wind circulation can influence these processes of mutual interaction between the wooded and the urban area nearby. This is a common situation in many other places around the world. To this end an up-to-date version of a method for gas profile retrieval in the lower troposphere, developed by the authors, is exploited to study the time evolution of the vertical structure of O-3 and NO2 concentrations on the Estate. The method consists of applying an inversion technique, based on the weighted Chahine algorithm, to DOAS (Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) remote-sensing measurements. The analysis of the retrieved vertical profiles shows that the degradation process associated with the arrival of air masses rich in photo-chemical pollutants, due to breeze circulation modified by the Coriolis Effect, is more apparent at upper levels than near the surface, affecting to a greater degree the higher branches of the trees. The paper also examines the impact of O-3 on the wooded part of the Castel Porziano Estate. The incidence of this effect is evaluated with the analysis of the so-called AOT40 parameter.

In order to be able to identify risk hot spots and implement targeted risk reduction measures, decision makers need to have a clear picture of the risk situation in their countries or regions. This work reviews existing approaches for human hazard and risk assessment, and geographic information system-based statistical tools are employed to analyze the hazard cases which happened within the Taichung Port area from 2000 to 2010. Based on hazard analysis, we establish a seasonal digital map and calculate the center of the distribution of hazard cases and the standard distance and observe the distribution trend. We also identify the hazard cases' gathering mode by the average nearest neighbor method. Finally, hot spot analysis is proposed to assess the position and features of hot and cold spots, as a reference for coast guard patrols.																	0921-030X					JUN	2013	67	2					275	294		10.1007/s11069-013-0559-4								WOS:000318494300008

Even small natural or anthropogenic disturbances can cause severe changes in the distributional pattern of seagrass meadows. Satellite imageries provide a suitable means to detect and assess such changes in space and time in remote and inaccessible areas. Present study aims to understand the distribution pattern of seagrasses after the Indian Ocean Tsunami in 2004 with the help of Indian Remote Sensing satellite data and in situ ground surveys with hand held GPS. As no geospatial data bases were available for the pre-tsunami period, the changes in seagrass cover were compared with the ground estimates available in the literature and also using pre-tsunami satellite data sets. The study found severe loss of seagrasses in the northern Andaman particularly in the Interview and North reef islands and in the Nicobar group of islands including Great Nicobar and Trinket islands. The investigation revealed the presence of 2,943.38 ha of seagrass covering the entire Andaman and Nicobar islands, and that 1,619.41 ha of seagrasses had been denuded during this period. The earthquake and subsequent tsunami in 2004 was the major reason for the loss of seagrasses in these islands. The seagrass spatial map generated in the present study can be used for the development of conservation and management plans and also to restore the denuded seagrasses of this region.																	1738-5261	2005-7172				JUN	2013	48	2					173	181		10.1007/s12601-013-0014-1								WOS:000335400200003

Based on the analysis of more than 2 500 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical satellite images, the internal wave propagation in the whole South China Sea was investigated systematically. The results show that (1) in the northeastern South China Sea, most internal waves propagate westward from the Luzon Strait and are diffracted by coral reefs near the Dongsha Islands. Some impinge onto the shelf and a few are reflected; (2) in the northwestern South China Sea, most internal waves are generated at the shelf and propagate northwestward or westward to the coast; (3) in the western South China Sea, most internal waves propagate westward to the Vietnamese coast, except a few propagate southward to the deep sea; and (4) in the southern South China Sea, most internal waves propagate southwestward to the coast. Some propagate southeastward to the coast of Kalimantan Island, and a few propagate southeastward because of the influence of the Mekong River.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				MAY	2013	32	5					42	50		10.1007/s13131-013-0312-6								WOS:000318750700006

Monitoring of the shoreline change using remote sensing and GIS: a case study of Al Hawasnah tidal inlet, Al Batinah coast, Sultanate of Oman	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												One of the most effective means of monitoring the cumulative effects of natural processes and human activities on the shoreline is to study the patterns of shoreline change over time. An attempt has been made to study the shoreline changes along Al Batinah, Sultanate of Oman, at the outlet of Wadi Al Hawasnah. The previous studies showed that Al Batinah coastline is generally stable except where coastal engineering structures like harbors, corniches, ports, and recharge dams are present. Remote sensing and GIS techniques are widely used in the coastal geomorphology because they provide the best sources to study the long-term shoreline changes. Rapid shoreline changes at the mouth of Wadi Al Hawasnah have been measured using proxy data derived mainly from satellite images from 2000 to 2005. The mouth of Wadi Al Hawasnah is now completely blocked after the construction of recharge dam at the upper stream of Wadi Al Hawasnah and Wadi Bani Umar in 1995. There has been no discharge to the sea after the construction of the dam. Furthermore, beach profiles of this area show erosion close to the south of the tidal inlet and accretion further south. The shorelines in the northwest of the tidal inlet remained stable.																	1866-7511					MAY	2013	6	5					1479	1484		10.1007/s12517-011-0424-2								WOS:000318443000014						
J	Katlane, R; Nechad, B; Ruddick, K; Zargouni, F				Katlane, Rim; Nechad, Bouchra; Ruddick, Kevin; Zargouni, Fouad			Optical remote sensing of turbidity and total suspended matter in the Gulf of Gabes	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Optical remote sensing was used to provide scientific information to support environmental management in the Gulf of Gabes that is located in the southeastern coast of Tunisia. This region is characterized by shallow continental shelf subjected to semi-diurnal tides. Industrial activities in this area since the early 1970s may have contributed to the degradation of the biodiversity of the ecosystem with eutrophication problems and disappearance of benthic and planktonic species. To assess the long-term effect of anthropogenic and natural discharges on the Gulf of Gabes, the optical environment of the coastal waters is assessed from in situ measurements of total suspended matter concentration (TSM), Secchi depth and turbidity (TU). This monitoring requires regular seaborne measurements (monthly), which is very expensive and difficult to obtain. The objective of the present study is the evaluation of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) AQUA data compared with two sampling campaigns realized at the study area. To map turbidity data from MODIS images, a semi-empirical algorithm was applied at band 667 nm. This bio-optical algorithm has already been calibrated and validated on the Belgian coast. The validation of this algorithm on the Gulf of Gabes using in situ measurements of turbidity and remotely sensed turbidity obtained from MODIS imagery shows a correlation coefficient of 68.9%. Seasonal and annual average maps for TSM and TU were then computed over the Gulf of Gabes using MODIS imagery. The obtained results of TSM and TU from remotely sensed data are conformable with those obtained through the analysis of in situ measurements. Therefore, remote sensing techniques offer a better and efficient tool for mapping and monitoring turbidity over the whole region.																	1866-7511					MAY	2013	6	5					1527	1535		10.1007/s12517-011-0438-9								WOS:000318443000019

Golam; Banu, Mehmuna R.; Seker, Dursun Zafer			Monitoring the drastic growth of ship breaking yards in Sitakunda: a threat to the coastal environment of Bangladesh	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The vast coastal and marine resources that occur along the southern edge of Bangladesh make it one of the most productive areas of the world. However, due to growing anthropogenic impacts, this area is under considerable environmental pressure from both physical and chemical stress factors. Ship breaking, or the dismantling and demolition of out-of-service ocean-going vessels, has become increasingly common in many coastal areas. To investigate the extent of ship breaking activities in Bangladesh along the Sitakunda coast, various spatial and non-spatial data were obtained, including remote sensing imagery, statistical records and published reports. Impacts to coastal and marine life were documented. Available data show that ship breaking activities cause significant physical disturbance and release toxic materials into the environment, resulting in adverse effects to numerous marine taxonomic groups such as fish, mammals, birds, reptiles, plants, phytoplankton, zooplankton and benthic invertebrates. Landsat imagery illustrates that the negatively impacted coastal area has grown 308.7 % from 367 ha in 1989 to 1,133 ha in 2010. Physicochemical and biological properties of coastal soil and water indicate substantially elevated pollution that poses a risk of local, regional and even global contamination through sea water and atmospheric transport. While damage to the coastal environment of Bangladesh is a recognized hazard that must be addressed, the economic benefits of ship breaking through job creation and fulfilling the domestic demand for recycled steel must be considered. Rather than an outright ban on beach breaking of ships, the enterprise must be recognized as a true and influential industry that should be held responsible for developing an economically viable and environmentally proactive growth strategy. Evolution of the industry toward a sustainable system can be aided through reasonable and enforceable legislative and judicial action that takes a balanced approach, but does not diminish the value of coastal conservation.

Seasonal variability of chlorophyll-a and oceanographic conditions in Sabah waters in relation to Asian monsoon-a remote sensing study	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												A study was conducted to investigate the influence of Asian monsoon on chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) content in Sabah waters and to identify the related oceanographic conditions that caused phytoplankton blooms at the eastern and western coasts of Sabah, Malaysia. A series of remote sensing measurements including surface Chl-a, sea surface temperature, sea surface height anomaly, wind speed, wind stress curl, and Ekman pumping were analyzed to study the oceanographic conditions that lead to large-scale nutrients enrichment in the surface layer. The results showed that the Chl-a content increased at the northwest coast from December to April due to strong northeasterly wind and coastal upwelling in Kota Kinabalu water. The southwest coast (Labuan water) maintained high concentrations throughout the year due to the effect of Padas River discharge during the rainy season and the changing direction of Baram River plume during the northeast monsoon (NEM). However, with the continuous supply of nutrients from the upwelling area, the high Chl-a batches were maintained at the offshore water off Labuan for a longer time during NEM. On the other side, the northeast coast illustrated a high Chl-a in Sandakan water during NEM, whereas the northern tip off Kudat did not show a pronounced change throughout the year. The southeast coast (Tawau water) was highly influenced by the direction of the surface water transport between the Sulu and Sulawesi Seas and the prevailing surface currents. The study demonstrates the presence of seasonal phytoplankton blooms in Sabah waters which will aid in forecasting the possible biological response and could further assist in marine resource managements.

This paper is focused on the formulation of DEM based on the GOCART aerosol model, along with its integration and execution into the air quality model. It also addresses the testing of the module and its evaluation by contrasting results against satellite products such as MODIS and CALIPSO and ground-level observations of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and concentration levels of PM10 for different periods in July 2007. DEM was found capable of reproducing the spatial (horizontal and vertical) and temporal profiles of Saharan dust outbreaks into the Mediterranean basin and the Atlantic coast of Africa. Moreover, it was observed that its combination with CMAQ increased the correlation degree between observed and modelled PM10 concentrations at the selected monitoring locations. DEM also enhanced CMAQ capabilities to reproduce observed AOT, although significant underestimations remain. The implementation of CMAQ + DEM succeeded in capturing Saharan dust transport into the Iberian Peninsula, with contributions up to 25 and 14 mu g m(-3) in 1 h and 24 h average PM10 respectively. The general improvement of total PM10 predictions in Spain are however moderate. The analysis of model performance for the main PM components points out that remaining PM10 underestimation is due to dust local sources missing in the inventories and misrepresentation of organic aerosol processes, which constitutes the main areas for future improvement of CMAQ capabilities to simulate particulate matter within SERCA.

MODIS-based corn grain yield estimation model incorporating crop phenology information	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												A crop yield estimation model using time-series MODIS WDRVI was developed. The main feature of the proposed model is the incorporation of crop phenology detection using MODIS data, called the "Shape-Model Fitting Method". MODIS WDRVI taken 7-10 days before the corn silking stage had strong linear correlation with corn final grain yield at both field and regional scales. The model revealed spatial patterns of corn final grain yield all over the U.S. from 2000 to 2011. State-level corn yield was estimated accurately with coefficient of variation below 10% especially for the 18 major corn producing states including Iowa, Illinois, Delaware, Minnesota, Ohio, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Nebraska, Kentucky, New York, South Dakota, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, New Jersey and Maryland. The results corresponded well with the spatial pattern of high-yield regions derived from the USDA/NASS data. However, the model tended to underestimate corn grain yield in three irrigated regions: the Midwestern region depending on the Ogallala Aquifer, the downstream basin of the Mississippi, and the southwestern region of Georgia. In contrast, it tended to overestimate corn grain yield around the outlying regions of the U.S. Corn Belt, specifically, the East Coast, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Missouri. The estimation accuracy of the proposed model differed depending on the region. However, the annual variation of state level corn grain yield could be detected with high accuracy, especially in the major corn producing states. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Those deposits are part of very important sediment reservoirs on the coast that feed and protect sandy beaches, and are key habitat for several benthic species. On the coast of Yucatan (Mexico) there are conspicuous sedimentary deposits forming well structured and outstanding submarine dune swarms, close to the shoreline at the localities of Dzilam de Bravo, San Felipe and El Cuyo. The objective of this research was to assess the spatial disposition and inter-decadal movements of these dune fields. We used standardized satellite images analyses, validated with seismic profiles and a basic sedimentological description of the identified structures in the field. The dunes showed different magnitude position changes, with estimated net annual movement rates between 2.94 m year(-1) and 10.83 m year(-1), heading mainly northwest. The spatial disposition of these dunes was confirmed by the field data, the smallest dunes detected with the satellite images were 0.31 m high, conformed by medium, conformed by medium and fine sand sediments. It is suggested that the orientation of the shore line and wave incidence, jointly with the dominant currents in the zone, determine the formation of these sediment accumulations in the region. This evaluation presents an innovative and confident approach for the study of submarine dunes in shallow waters, using remote sensing incomes and standardized spatial analyses. These findings set basis for a systematic monitoring of these marine systems, and contributes with original information on the study and understanding of the coastal marine processes in Mexico.				euan-avila, jorge /D-4717-2016													0717-3326	0718-1957				APR	2013	48	1					99	113		10.4067/S0718-19572013000100009								WOS:000319327100009						
J	Hamilton, S				Hamilton, Stuart			ASSESSING THE ROLE OF COMMERCIAL AQUACULTURE IN DISPLACING MANGROVE FOREST	BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE												To fill a gap in the marine science literature, I calculated the amount of mangrove deforestation in tropical estuaries that is attributable to commercial aquaculture. The eight countries analyzed were Indonesia, Brazil,. India, Bangladesh, China, Thailand, Vietnam, and Ecuador. Together these countries contain approximately 36% of the world's remaining mangrove forest. One precommercial aquaculture remote sensing survey and one current remote sensing survey were undertaken in the major mangrove holding estuaries in each nation. The time period of the analysis varied by country based on the first arrival of large-scale commercial aquaculture, with the majority of initial surveys occurring in the early to mid-1970s and all the current surveys occurring post-2004. The surveys classified the land cover of 110,557 randomly located estuarine point locations and examined the land-cover change over time for each of these discreet locations. Among the largest and most representative account of global mangrove to aquaculture conversion, this study revealed that mangrove forests have lost 51.9% of their aerial extent during the analysis period. Of the mangrove loss during this period, I estimate that commercial aquaculture accounted for 28% of total mangrove loss across all nations resulting in approximately 544,000 ha of mangrove forest converted to aquaculture. There were significant differences in mangrove loss and mangrove to aquaculture conversion from nation to nation and even within nations.

Bloom of Hemidiscus hardmannianus (Bacillariophyceae) and Its Impact on Water Quality and Plankton Community Structure in a Mangrove Wetland	CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER												An intense monospecies bloom of the centric diatom Hemidiscus hardmannianus (Greville) Mann. (Bacillariophyceae) occurred in the coastal waters of Sundarban mangrove wetland, India on 22 July, 2010. The species was abruptly flourished (mean density 8.86x106cells/L) resulting intense green coloration of water. The greatest impoverishment of diversity and density of phytoplankton, micro- and mesozooplankton community was observed during the bloom. The phytoplankton community showed an extreme reduction in diversity (12 species to one) and sharp decrease in standing stock (12.84x103 to 8.86x106cells/L) during this period. The late bloom condition coincided with sudden and huge arrival of a clupoid fish Hilsa ilisha which forms the most potential fisheries in Sundarban deltaic region. An attempt has been made to correlate the satellite remote sensing-derived information to the bloom conditions. The MODIS-Aqua derived chlorophyll and TMI satellite derived sea surface temperature and wind speed maps have been interpreted.																	1863-0650	1863-0669				APR	2013	41	4					333	339		10.1002/clen.201200012								WOS:000317288800005

Fracture zones have variable influence on uplift of the Kamchatka Cape Peninsula. Relevant morphologic indicators of neotectonic activity are multilevel, highly uplifted marine terraces and terraces displaced along active faults. Recent uplift rates of coastal sediments are determined by remote sensing via ASTER and SRTM DEM combined with optically stimulated luminescence dating (OSL). On the Kamchatka Cape Peninsula, terraces from the same generation are mapped at different elevations by remote sensing methods. After defining different areas of uplifted terraces, four neotectonic blocks are identified. According to apatite fission track data, the mean differential exhumation rates range from 0.2 to 1.2 mm year(-1) across the blocks since Late Miocene. The OSL data presented point to significant higher uplift rates of up to 3 +/- A 0.5 and 4.3 +/- A 1 mm year(-1), which indicates an acceleration of the vertical movement along the coast of Kamchatka Cape Peninsula in Upper Pleistocene and Holocene times.

Case study: Ras El Hekma area, northwestern coast of Egypt	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The surface water development can help to address the growing demand for water resources and the effects of stormwater flooding on the local environment. The study area was chosen according to its special conditions where it represents one of the main headlands along the southern Mediterranean coast and receives amount of rainfall during the winter season. The main objective of this paper is to monitor and record data about the current surface water status as well as to have a systematic understanding of the water resources base in the study area, and this assessment will contribute in the exploitation of the surface water. The current research is integration between geomorphology, geology, remote sensing, and the applications of geographical information system. The total amount of annual rainfall and surface runoff are estimated (annual rainfall is 23.345 million m(3) and surface runoff is 1.167 million m(3)). On the other hand, the surface runoff which has been resulted from one event (storm) is also estimated to be 483,000 m(3)/day. The present study introduce some recommendations; the cisterns should be established in the vicinities of the watersheds and on the downstream of the drainage basins to store water before draining to the sea, the dug should be in oolitic limestone to reduce drilling costs, the water reservoirs should be established to store large amount of surface water (from 2,000 to 3,000 m(3)). Dams are necessary to protect the agriculture activities from any flash hazard which is expected any time.																	1866-7511					APR	2013	6	4					1295	1306		10.1007/s12517-011-0433-1								WOS:000316199100030

Remote sensing of exposure to NO2: Satellite versus ground-based measurement in a large urban	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Remote sensing may be a useful tool for exploring spatial variability of air pollution exposure within an urban area. To evaluate the extent to which satellite data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) can resolve urban-scale gradients in ground-level nitrogen dioxide (NO2) within a large urban area, we compared estimates of surface NO2 concentrations derived from OMI measurements and US EPA ambient monitoring stations. OMI, aboard NASA's Aura satellite, provides daily afternoon (similar to 13:30 local time) measurements of NO2 tropospheric column abundance. We used scaling factors (surface-to-column ratios) to relate satellite column measurements to ground-level concentrations. We compared 4138 sets of paired data for 25 monitoring stations in the South Coast Air Basin of California for all of 2005. OMI measurements include more data gaps than the ground monitors (60% versus 5% of available data, respectively), owing to cloud contamination and imposed limits on pixel size. The spatial correlation between OMI columns and corrected in situ measurements is strong (r=0.93 for annual average data), indicating that the within-urban spatial signature of surface NO2 is well resolved by the satellite sensor. Satellite-based surface estimates employing scaling factors from an urban model provide a reliable measure (annual mean bias: -13%; seasonal mean bias: <1% [spring] to -22% [fall]) of fine-scale surface NO2. We also find that OMI provides good spatial density in the study region (average area [km(2)] per measurement: 730 for the satellite sensor vs. 1100 for the monitors). Our findings indicate that satellite observations of NO2 from the OMI sensor provide a reliable measure of spatial variability in ground-level NO2 exposure for a large urban area.

Mapping sub-surface geostrophic currents from altimetry and a fleet of gliders	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Integrating the observations gathered by different platforms into a unique physical picture of the environment is a fundamental aspect of networked ocean observing systems. These are constituted by a spatially distributed set of sensors and platforms that simultaneously monitor a given ocean region. Remote sensing from satellites is an integral part of present ocean observing systems. Due to their autonomy, mobility and controllability, underwater gliders are envisioned to play a significant role in the development of networked ocean observatories. Exploiting synergism between remote sensing and underwater gliders is expected to result on a better characterization of the marine environment than using these observational sources individually. This study investigates a methodology to estimate the three dimensional distribution of geostrophic currents resulting from merging satellite altimetry and in situ samples gathered by a fleet of Slocum gliders. Specifically, the approach computes the volumetric or three dimensional distribution of absolute dynamic height (ADH) that minimizes the total energy of the system while being close to in situ observations and matching the absolute dynamic topography (ADT) observed from satellite at the sea surface. A three dimensional finite element technique is employed to solve the minimization problem. The methodology is validated making use of the dataset collected during the field experiment called Rapid Environmental Picture-2010 (REP-10) carried out by the NATO Undersea Research Center-NURC during August 2010. A marine region off-shore La Spezia (northwest coast of Italy) was sampled by a fleet of three coastal Slocum gliders. Results indicate that the geostrophic current field estimated from gliders and altimetry significantly improves the estimates obtained using only the data gathered by the glider fleet.

Bleaching occurrences at Abrolhos have been observed since the 1990s but with a much lower frequency/extent than for other reef systems worldwide. We constructed a Bayesian Belief Network (BN) to back-predict the intensity of bleaching events and learn how local and regional scale forcing factors interact to enhance or alleviate coral bleaching specific to Abrolhos. Bleaching intensity data were collected for several reef sites across Bahia state coast (similar to 12 degrees-20 degrees S; 37 degrees-40 degrees W) during the austral summer 1994-2005 and compared to environmental data: sea surface temperature (SST), diffuse light attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (K-490), rain precipitation, wind velocities, and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) proxies. Conditional independence tests were calculated to produce four specialized BNs, each with specific factors that likely regulate bleaching intensity. All specialized BNs identified that a five-day accumulated SST proxy (SSTAc5d) was the exclusive parent node for coral bleaching producing a total predictive rate of 88% based on SSTAc5d state. When SSTAc5d was simulated as unknown, the Thermal-Eolic Resultant BN kept the total predictive rate of 88%. Our approach has produced initial means to predict beaching intensity at Abrolhos. However, the robustness of the model required for management purposes must be further (and regularly) operationally tested with new in situ and remote sensing data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Retrieving aerosol characteristics and sea-surface chlorophyll from satellite ocean color multi-spectral sensors using a neural-variational method	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												We developed a two-step algorithm for retrieving and then monitoring the concentration of Saharan dusts and of the sea-surface chlorophyll from satellite ocean-color multi-spectral observations. The first step consisted in classifying the top of the atmosphere (TOA) spectra using a neuronal classifier, which provided the aerosol type and a first-guess value of the aerosol parameters that was used to initialize the variational method. The variational method was the second step, which retrieved accurate measurements of the aerosol and chlorophyll-a concentrations. The algorithm was conditioned to take into account the absorbing aerosols, such as the Saharan dusts. We used this algorithm to analyze 13 years of SeaWiFS images (September 1997-December 2009) over an area of the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of West Africa. Since our method allowed us to take Saharan dusts into account, the number of pixels processed for retrieving the chlorophyll-a concentration was an order of magnitude higher than that processed by the standard SeaWiFS algorithm. The analysis of the SeaWiFS images showed that the Saharan dust concentration was maximal in summer during the rainy season and minimal in autumn, which could be explained by the seasonal variability of dust emission triggered by mesoscale atmospheric processes (low-level jet and convection) and soil characteristics (humidity and vegetation).

Due to the fact that malaria is insect vector transmitted, the environment is a key determinant of the spread of infection. Geo-climatic factors (such as temperature, moisture, water quality) determine the presence of Anopheles breeding sites, vector densities, adult mosquito survival rate, longevity and vector capacity. Several studies have shown the association between environmental factors and malaria incidence in autochthonous population. The association between the incidence of clinical malaria cases among non-immune travellers and environmental factors is yet to be evaluated. The objective of the present study was to identify, at a country scale (Ivory Coast), the environmental factors that are associated with clinical malaria among non-immune travellers, opening the way for a remote sensing-based counselling for malaria risk prevention among travellers. Methods: The study sample consisted in 87 cohorts, including 4,531 French soldiers who travelled to Ivory Coast, during approximately four months, between September 2002 and December 2006. Their daily locations were recorded during the entire trip. The association between the incidence of clinical malaria and other factors (including individual, collective and environmental factors evaluated by remote sensing methods) was analysed in a random effect mixed Poisson regression model to take into account the sampling design. Results: One hundred and forty clinical malaria cases were recorded during 572,363 person-days of survey, corresponding to an incidence density of 7.4 clinical malaria episodes per 1,000 person-months under survey. The risk of clinical malaria was significantly associated with the cumulative time spent in areas with NDVI > 0.35 (RR = 2,42), a mean temperature higher than 27 degrees C (RR = 2,4), a longer period of dryness during the preceding month (RR = 0,275) and the cumulative time spent in urban areas (RR = 0,52). Conclusions: The present results suggest that remotely-sensed environmental data could be used as good predictors of the risk of clinical malaria among vulnerable individuals travelling through African endemic areas.

The case of nesting sea turtles in the Mediterranean	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Artificial night lights pose a major threat to multiple species. However, this threat is often disregarded in conservation management and action because it is difficult to quantify its effect. Increasing availability of high spatial-resolution satellite images may enable us to better incorporate this threat into future work, particularly in highly modified ecosystems such as the coastal zone. In this study we examine the potential of satellite night light imagery to predict the distribution of the endangered loggerhead (Caretta caretto) and green (Chelonia mydas) sea turtle nests in the eastern Mediterranean coastline. Using remote sensing tools and high resolution data derived from the SAC-C satellite and the International Space Station, we examined the relationship between the long term spatial patterns of sea turtle nests and the intensity of night lights along Israel's entire Mediterranean coastline. We found that sea turtles nests are negatively related to night light intensity and are concentrated in darker sections along the coast. Our resulting GLMs showed that night lights were a significant factor for explaining the distribution of sea turtle nests. Other significant variables included: cliff presence, human population density and infrastructure. This study is one of the first to show that night lights estimated with satellite-based imagery can be used to help explain sea turtle nesting activity at a detailed resolution over large areas. This approach can facilitate the management of species affected by night lights, and will be particularly useful in areas that are inaccessible or where broad-scale prioritization of conservation action is required.

Assessment of the hyperspectral sensor CASI-2 for macroalgal discrimination on the Ria de Vigo coast (NW Spain) using field spectroscopy and modelled spectral libraries	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Hyperspectral remote sensing from aircraft and satellite sensors is an important tool for mapping shallow benthic habitats in areas where high spectral and spatial resolutions are needed e.g. spatially heterogeneous coastal environments. However, the acquisition of hyperspectral images sometimes involves a high economic investment and there is no prior guarantee of their utility. Physics-based methods like bio-optical models are an alternative to assess sensors without purchasing the images. In this study we used a simple bio-optical model that simulates reflectance spectra for waters with variable depth and benthic macroalgal cover. The modelled spectral library was used to assess the capability of CASI-2 sensor to recognise different benthic macroalgal species. Reflectance spectra of 17 macroalgal species were used in the model simulations. Uni- and multi-variate statistical analyses were used to evaluate the spectral differences between several species. The results show that only a few species seem to be clearly differentiable: Codium tomentosum, Laminaria saccharina and Corallina officinalis. Therefore, further bio-optical modelling was applied at the level of taxonomic groups rather than species level. Emerged green, brown and red macroalgae as well as sand can be differentiated from each other when using the CASI-2 sensor. The bio-optical simulations showed that the three macroalgal groups can be separated from each other in waters shallower than 4 m when CASI-2 is used. Green and brown macroalgae can be differentiated from deep water if the water depth does not exceed 6 m whereas red macroalgae can be optically separated from deep water when the water depth is less than 5 m. Sea-beds covered with the three macroalgal groups are separable from sandy sea-beds in waters shallower than 10 m. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Interannual variability in the timing of New England shellfish toxicity and relationships to environmental forcing	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Routine monitoring along the coast of the Gulf of Maine (GoM) reveals shellfish toxicity nearly every summer, but at varying times, locations, and magnitudes. The responsible toxin is known to be produced by the dinoflagellate Alexandrium fundyense, yet there is little apparent association between Alexandrium abundance and shellfish toxicity. One possibility is that toxic cells are persistent in offshore areas and variability in shellfish toxicity is caused not by changes in overall abundance, but rather by variability in transport processes. Measurements of offshore Alexandrium biomass are scarce, so we bypass cell abundance as an explanatory variable and focus instead on the relations between shellfish toxicity and concurrent metrics of GoM meteorology, hydrology, and oceanography. While this yields over two decades (1985-2005) of data representing a variety of interannual conditions, the toxicity data are gappy in spatial and temporal coverage. We address this through a combination of parametric curve fitting and hierarchical cluster analysis to reveal eight archetypical modes of seasonal toxicity timing. Groups of locations are then formed that have similar interannual patterns in these archetypes. Finally, the interannual patterns within each group are related to available environmental metrics using classification trees. Results indicate that a weak cross-shore sea surface temperature (SST) gradient in the summer is the strongest correlate of shellfish toxicity, likely by signifying a hydrological connection between offshore Alexandrium populations and near-shore shellfish beds. High cumulative downwelling wind strength early in the season is revealed as a precursor consistent with this mechanism. Although previous studies suggest that alongshore transport is important in moving Alexandrium from the eastern to western GoM, alongshore SST gradient is not an important correlate of toxicity in our study. We conclude by discussing the implications of our results for designing efficient and effective shellfish monitoring programs along the GoM coast. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Geospatial Analysis for Coastal Risk Assessment to Cyclones	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Cyclone is one of the major coastal hazards affecting the Indian coastline bringing floods and widespread damage due to rain, storm surges and heavy winds. Hence, coastal risk assessment is essential to identify the threats to the land and population, from cyclones. The risk assessment has been carried out in northern coast of Tamil Nadu, India, for the stretch from Kattivakkam to Kovalam. Risk is the probability of expected losses from a given hazard and it varies according to the vulnerability of the region. The risk assessment has been structured in four components, namely, Environmental Vulnerability, Social Vulnerability, Hazard Potential and Mitigation Capacity. The thematic layers and hazard maps are created using Satellite data and Geographic Information System. Coastal risk indices are generated for each component of risk using Analytic Hierarchy Process. Based on the index value, the level of risk is mapped and the results help in faster and appropriate decision making.																	0255-660X					MAR	2013	41	1					157	176		10.1007/s12524-011-0198-8								WOS:000316122200014

Shoreline change analysis along the coast between Kanyakumari and Tuticorin of India using remote sensing and GIS	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Shoreline is one of the rapidly changing landform in coastal area. So, accurate detection and frequent monitoring of shorelines are very essential to understand the coastal processes and dynamics of various coastal features. The present study is to investigate the shoreline changes along the coast between Kanyakumari and Tuticorin of south India, where hydrodynamic and morphologic changes occur continuously after the December 2004 tsunami. Multi-date satellite data of Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites (1999, 2000, 2003, 2005, and 2006) are used to extract the shorelines. The satellite data is processed by using the ERDAS IMAGINE 9.1 software and analyzed by ArcGIS 9.2 workstation. The different shoreline change maps are developed and the changes are analyzed with the shoreline obtained from the Survey of India Toposheets (1969). The present study indicates that accretion was predominant along the study area during the period 1969-1999. But recently (from 1999 onwards), most of the coastal areas have experienced erosion. The study also indicates the reversal of shoreline modifications in some coastal zones. The coastal areas along the headlands have experienced both erosion and accretion. Though the coastal erosion is due to both natural and anthropogenic activities, the coastal zones where sand is mined have more impacts and relatively more rate of erosion than that of other zones. Improper and in-sustainable sand mining leads to severe erosion problem along this area. So the concept of sustainable management should be interpreted in the management of the near-shore coastal sand mining industry.																	1866-7511					MAR	2013	6	3					647	664		10.1007/s12517-011-0394-4								WOS:000315647700004

The traverse covered 2400 km from the coast to the vicinity of the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station in 2007-08, and a 2600 km route from the South Pole to the coast in 2008-09. Side traverses were also conducted in 2008-09, for a total of over 10 000 km of GPS data between the two vehicles. We use precise point positioning to post-process our single receiver kinematic GPS data. Analysis of data obtained while the vehicles were stationary shows individual solutions are accurate to ca. 1 cm horizontally and 3 cm vertically. We compare our GPS elevations with those determined by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat), a space-based altimeter designed to measure ice elevation. ICESat accuracy is evaluated by cross-over analysis; mean differences calculated between dh/dt-corrected ICESat data and GPS-derived surface elevations for two vehicles and two traverse seasons range from -12 to -2 cm, within ICESat's stated goal of +/- 15 cm, while 1-sigma values of the same data imply that ICESat's precision is ca. 15.8 cm.

In order to show the potential of the fully polarimetric high-resolution polarimetric SAR (POLSAR) image data sets, a four-component scattering power decomposition scheme has been developed and applied to monitor near-real-time earthquake and tsunami disaster damages. The test site for natural disaster damages has been selected: parts of the coastal area affected by the March 11, 2011, 9.0 magnitude earthquake that struck off Japan's northeastern coast and triggered a super-tsunami. The color-coded images of the scattering power decomposition scheme are a simple and straightforward tool to interpret the changes over the earthquake/tsunami affected urban areas and man-made infrastructures. This method also holds other types of natural (typhoon or tornado) and man-made disaster assessment applications. It is found that the double-bounce scattering power is the most promising of the input parameters to detect automated disaster affected urban areas at pixel level. It is also observed that the very-high-resolution POLSAR images are required for superior urban area monitoring over the oriented urban blocks with respect to the illumination of radar.																	0018-9219	1558-2256				MAR	2013	101	3			SI		831	846		10.1109/JPROC.2012.2230311								WOS:000315480200016

Quantification of cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) camouflage: a study of color and luminance using in situ spectrometry	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY A-NEUROETHOLOGY SENSORY NEURAL AND BEHAVIORAL PHYSIOLOGY												Cephalopods are renowned for their ability to adaptively camouflage on diverse backgrounds. Sepia officinalis camouflage body patterns have been characterized spectrally in the laboratory but not in the field due to the challenges of dynamic natural light fields and the difficulty of using spectrophotometric instruments underwater. To assess cuttlefish color match in their natural habitats, we studied the spectral properties of S. officinalis and their backgrounds on the Aegean coast of Turkey using point-by-point in situ spectrometry. Fifteen spectrometry datasets were collected from seven cuttlefish; radiance spectra from animal body components and surrounding substrates were measured at depths shallower than 5 m. We quantified luminance and color contrast of cuttlefish components and background substrates in the eyes of hypothetical di- and trichromatic fish predators. Additionally, we converted radiance spectra to sRGB color space to simulate their in situ appearance to a human observer. Within the range of natural colors at our study site, cuttlefish closely matched the substrate spectra in a variety of body patterns. Theoretical calculations showed that this effect might be more pronounced at greater depths. We also showed that a non-biological method ("Spectral Angle Mapper"), commonly used for spectral shape similarity assessment in the field of remote sensing, shows moderate correlation to biological measures of color contrast. This performance is comparable to that of a traditional measure of spectral shape similarity, hue and chroma. This study is among the first to quantify color matching of camouflaged cuttlefish in the wild.

Offshore and onshore seepage of thermogenic gas at Katakolo Bay (Western Greece)	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Considerable seepage of natural gas occurs throughout the Katakolo Bay, both at sea and on land, along the Ionian coast of Peloponnesus (Western Greece). Explosive levels of CH4 and toxic concentrations of H2S accumulating in the ground, pose a severe hazard for humans and tourist infrastructures. A wide offshore and onshore gas survey, including marine remote sensing, underwater exploration by a towed instrumented system, compositional and isotopic analyses, and flux measurements of gas, allowed us to assess that: (a) gas seepage takes place along two main normal faults; (b) offshore side-scan sonographs recorded at least 823 gas bubble plumes over an area of 94,200 m(2), at depths ranging from 5.5 to 16 m; (c) offshore and onshore seeps release the same type of thermogenic gas (delta C-13(CH4)similar to-34 to -36 parts per thousand); (d) offshore gas showed increased stable carbon isotopic ratio of CO2 and propane, which suggests enhanced biodegradation of hydrocarbons; (e) isotopic data combined with thermogenic gas generation modeling and maturity plots, suggest that the gas is related to a deep Petroleum System with Jurassic carbonate reservoirs, Triassic source rocks, and Triassic evaporites; (f) H2S (delta S-34: +2.4 parts per thousand) is produced by thermochemical sulfate reduction in deep anhydrites, in contact with hydrocarbon-rich carbonates; (g) due to the shallow depth, more than 90% of CH4 released at the seabed enters the atmosphere, consistent with theoretical bubble dissolution models, with a mean plume output of 0.12 kg d(-1); total offshore CH4 output was estimated in the range of 33 to 120 t y(-1); and (h) in the onshore area at least 50 gas vents in the harbor and a large seep on the adjacent Faros hill, emit in total about 89 t CH4 y(-1).

Modelling impact of bottom roughness on sea surface temperature in the Sea of Iroise	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												A hydrological model based on the coupling of the three-dimensional hydrodynamic module COHERENS (coupled Hydrodynamical-Ecological model for RegioNal and Shelf seas) with the wave propagation module SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore) is used to study the effects of bottom roughness on sea surface temperature (SST) in the nearshore areas of the Sea of Iroise (western end of french Brittany). Predicted time histories of SST are compared with the available field data collected at two offshore stations and along the route of a vessel travelling between the coast and the isle of Ushant. The comparison is extended to SST spatial distribution derived from remote-sensing observations for conditions characterising the development of horizontal thermal fronts in the Sea of Iroise. A numerical sensitivity study is conducted focusing on the impacts of the heterogeneous bottom roughnesses associated with (i) the granulometric distribution of seabed sediments and (ii) the apparent friction induced by the waves in the bottom boundary layer. Whereas moderate differences are obtained, both bottom-roughness distributions are found to influence the predicted SST leading to slight improvements of global predictions. The sensitivity of numerical simulations is exacerbated in areas of high thermal gradients. The effects of the bottom roughness associated with the seabed are thus revealed at the north-eastern and south-eastern edges of external Ushant thermal front. Waves have a major influence in the nearshore areas of the bay of Audierne and the western extend of Crozon peninsula. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Le, CF; Hu, CM; Cannizzaro, J; English, D; Muller-Karger, F; Lee, Z				Le, Chengfeng; Hu, Chuanmin; Cannizzaro, Jennifer; English, David; Muller-Karger, Frank; Lee, Zhongping			Evaluation of chlorophyll-a remote sensing algorithms for an optically complex estuary	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Estimation of chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chla in mg m(-3)) in optically complex waters using remote sensing is difficult because traditional empirical (e.g., OCx blue/green band ratios) or semi-analytical algorithms (e.g., GSM or QAA) rely on blue-green wavelengths where water constituents other than phytoplankton often dominate the optical properties and satellite-derived reflectance in these wavelengths often contains substantial uncertainties. Some recent attempts have been made to derive Chla based on red and near-infrared wavelengths to avoid such problems. Using in situ data collected from 9 cruises between 1998 and 2010 in Tampa Bay, a large estuary (similar to 1000 km(2)) located in Florida (U.S.A.), we first tested three Chla algorithms, where each algorithm derived Chla as a function of independent variable x = Rrs(lambda(2))/Rrs(lambda(1)), x = [Rrs(lambda(1))(-1) - Rrs(lambda(2))(-1)] * Rrs(lambda(3)), and x = [Rrs(lambda(1))(-1) - Rrs(lambda(2))(-1)]/[Rrs(lambda(4))(-1) - Rrs(lambda(3))(-1)], respectively. Here Rrs(lambda) is the remote sensing reflectance, lambda is the wavelength from 660 to 760 nm, and the positions of the these wavelengths were determined using an objective method while the functional forms of Chla=f(x) were determined through regression between Chla and x. A synthetic chlorophyll index (SCI) using 4 green-red MERIS wavelengths was also tested. Using field measured Rrs(lambda) data, all these algorithms showed the potentials to retrieve Chla between similar to 2 and similar to 80 mg m(-3), with 2-band algorithms showing the best performance. However, when satellite-derived Rrs(lambda) data were used, none of the four algorithms was applicable to MODIS in this estuary, and only a 2-band algorithm in the form of Rrs(709)/Rrs(665) was applicable to MERIS, with other algorithms significantly degraded. The coefficients of the 2-band algorithm for MERIS were determined through regression between in situ Chla and MERIS-derived Rrs(709)/Rrs(665), with the final form of Chla = 10.55x(1.51). The algorithm yielded mean relative errors of 35.3% for Chla between 1.0 and 30.0 mg m(-3) when an in situ dataset from the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County (EPCHC) was used to tune the algorithm coefficients, which was further validated using another independent dataset. Spatial Chla patterns derived from MERIS for both low and high concentrations also showed reasonable agreement with in situ measurements. In contrast, 3-band and 4-band algorithms yielded significant patchiness in spatial patterns that differed from in situ measurements. Tests in Chesapeake Bay (located on the east coast of the U.S.A.) showed reasonable spatial patterns of Chla using the Rrs(709)/Rrs(665) approach, with a mean relative error of 34.7% for Chla ranging between 1.6 and 21.5 mg m(-3), suggesting that the approach may be generally applicable to other turbid estuaries once algorithm coefficients are adjusted using local data.

Mangrove Inventory of India at Community Level	NATIONAL ACADEMY SCIENCE LETTERS-INDIA												Mangroves are salt tolerant plants that occur between 32A degrees N and 38A degrees S latitudes. Mangroves play an important role in stabilizing shoreline and protect the coast against storm surges and heavy tides. Though the mangrove inventory has been done earlier in India using satellite data but no systematic attempts has been made to map the mangroves at the community level for the entire country. The present paper reports the mangrove inventory at community level for India using Resourcesat-1 satellite data. State wise inventory on the mangrove area and the dominant communities are presented. Total area under mangrove based on the satellite data of 2005-2007 is 495,620 ha. West Bengal has the highest area under mangrove.																	0250-541X					FEB	2013	36	1					67	77		10.1007/s40009-012-0087-x								WOS:000315334200010

Satellite data assimilation and estimation of a 3D coastal sediment transport model using error-subspace emulators	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												This paper describes sequential assimilation of data into a three-dimensional coastal ocean model using fast and cheap statistical surrogates of the model (emulators). The model simulates resuspension and deposition of fine sediments in a macro-tidal environment of the Fitzroy Estuary and Keppel Bay, North-East Australian coast. The assimilation algorithm was applied first to synthetic observations produced by a twin model run, and then with real data obtained from satellite observation. The latter are derived from remote sensing algorithms customised to the study region. The main objective of simulations was to test the data assimilation scheme using synthetic observations and identify potential issues and challenges when assimilating real data sets. The assimilation algorithm proved capable of substantially reducing a prior uncertainty of the model for both the scenario with the synthetic observations and the scenario with the satellite data. Significant remaining error in western Keppel Bay after assimilating satellite data is diagnostic of an underlying error in the system conceptualisation in other words, it indicates that the primary source of error is not in the parameter values specified, but in the model structure, in the interpretation of satellite data or in the other input data. The results of our study show the utility of the developed technique for the data assimilation into the three-dimensional sediment transport model of the Fitzroy estuary and Keppel Bay. More research is required to understand the capacity of this technique to generalise to other models and regions. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In many tropical regions, such efforts have focused largely on the use of optical data despite low capture rates because of persistent cloud cover. Recognizing the ability of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for providing cloud-free observations, this study investigated the use of JERS-1 SAR and ALOS PALSAR data, acquired in 1996 and 2008 respectively, for mapping the extent of mangroves along the Brazilian coastline, from east of the Amazon River mouth, Para State, to the Bay of Sao Jose in Maranhao. For each year, an object-orientated classification of major land covers (mangrove, secondary vegetation, gallery and swamp forest, open water, intermittent lakes and bare areas) was performed with the resulting maps then compared to quantify change. Comparison with available ground truth data indicated a general accuracy in the 2008 image classification of all land covers of 96% (kappa = 90.6%, tau = 92.6%). Over the 12 year period, the area of mangrove increased by 718.6 km(2) from 6705 m(2) to 7423.60 km(2), with 1931.0 km(2) of expansion and 1213 km(2) of erosion noted; 5493 km(2) remained unchanged in extent. The general accuracy relating to changes in mangroves was 83.3% (Kappa 66.1%; tau 66.7%). The study confirmed that these mangroves constituted the largest continuous belt globally and were experiencing significant change because of the dynamic coastal environment and the influence of sedimentation from the Amazon River along the shoreline. The study recommends continued observations using combinations of SAR and optical data to establish trends in mangrove distributions and implications for provision of ecosystem services (e.g., fish/invertebrate nurseries, carbon storage and coastal protection).

Tidal constituents from remote sensing image sequences	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												We address the problem of obtaining tidal constituents from a series of shoreline positions derived from time-sequential airborne imagery of the intertidal zone. A multi-sensor experiment (Bachmann et al., 2012) conducted at the Virginia Coast Reserve Long-Term Ecological Research (VCR LTER) site(1) supplied in-situ and airborne data. Hyperspectral and infrared shoreline imagery of the VCR LTER barrier islands, shallow lagoons, and mainland coastal areas as well as topographic LiDAR data were obtained from the same air platform over a nine-day period, and LiDAR and in-situ topographic beach surveys were used to specify the beach bathymetry and derive a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) over the primary area focused on in this paper at Wreck Island, VA. The DEM and shoreline positions are used to obtain a time sequence of tidal heights; these are found to be consistent with a time series from a GPS-equipped tide gage float anchored nearby. A least-squares fit of the five largest tidal constituents (M-2, N-2, S-2, O-1, K-1) to this one-week record indicates that the first three can be retrieved with only a +/- 15-20 % error, as determined by the one-year sea-surface height time series from a nearby NOAA Sea Surface Height (SSH) station at Wachapreague, VA. The broader question of how many images are needed to obtain tidal constituents from an annual record is also addressed. Using SSH values from a NOAA tide gage station as a surrogate for image-derived SSH values, we progressively decimate a yearlong tide record, calculating its tidal constituents at each level of decimation. We find that that only one image every ten days is needed to retrieve the five largest tidal constituents to within a 10% error.

Detection of Coral Distribution Change in Recent Decades with Satellite Remote Sensing	2013 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING (CISP), VOLS 1-3					6th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing (CISP)	DEC 16-18, 2013	Hangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE, Hangzhou Normal Univ, EMB				Coral reef is a very important ecosystem in Sanya Bay and it has been studied for years only with in situ observations. However, these in situ observations generally have point information and lack the spatial resolution. Recently in order to make clear coral reef spatial distribution and variation in Sanya Bay, Hainan, satellite data of Landsat, QuickBird, CBERS (China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite program) and historical in situ observation data are used to retrieve and validate the information of coral reef. Based on the retrieved information, coral reef coverage and variation were studied in the paper. Satellite remote sensing results showed that area of coral reef distribution along coast of Dongmao (east) Islands and Ximao (west) islands in Sanya Bay reduced greatly in recent years, which coincides with variation trends of in situ observation data in the whole Sanya Bay. While analyzing the reason for coral reduction it was found that coral distribution in Sanya Bay conversely correlated with anthropic activities, such as digging coral reef for making lime and land use change. These activities change the water quality and sediment type which lead to the change in coral distribution.																			978-1-4799-2763-0				2013							830	834										WOS:000341115000155

Effective oil spill detection and monitoring are the basis for the rapid response and play an important role. Due to its all-weather, day and night detection, wide coverage, and real-time monitoring capability, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is the most applicable sensors for marine oil spill monitoring and detection. Radar detection of target always uses back scattering of its reaction. After the oil spills, oil slicks spread to the sea surface dampen the Bragg waves and reduce radar backscattering coefficients; that is, smooth the sea surface. So oil spills appear as dark areas in the SAR images. The critical part of the oil spill detection is to distinguish oil spills from other natural phenomena. Low wind speed areas, internal waves, biogenic films and so on can lead to this phenomenon, which are called " lookalikes". Based on the principle of oil spill detection using SAR images, analysis accomplished over ENVISAT ASAR data gathered in the Gulf of Mexico and related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill accident, which happened on April 20, 2010, is mentioned in this paper. The main areas of interest related to such disaster are the following: 1) to detect oil spills at sea and 2) analyze changes of oil slicks over the sea. In order to achieve the proposed goal, the method consists of three steps: preprocessing, detection of dark spots and analysis. Firstly, the SAR data are pre-processed, including histogram equalization, geometric correction and speckle filtering. Enhanced Lee filter is used to reduce the speckle noise due to the good capability in noise suppression and edge preserving. Secondly, SAR image classification and oil spill identification are carried out. Because of dark patches in SAR images cause by other natural phenomena, the purpose of the classifier is to distinguish oil spills from look-alikes. So the object-based classification is applied with support vector machine (SVM) owing to a better effect for oil spill identification. Last but not the least, based on the results of oil spill exaction and polluted areas, the development process of Deepwater Horizon oil spill is analyzed, such as the temporal dispersion scope, diffusion and drift of the oil slick. In addition, oil spill area is calculated for area variation tendency. At the early stage of this accident, shapes of oil slicks mainly appear as patches. As time passed by, quite a few parts of oil slicks showed as stripes. Oil slick shape and position were affected by winds, ocean currents and so on. During the middle or later period, a portion of oil slick eroded the coasts of Louisiana, Alabama and Florida. In the early days of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the size of oil slicks presented the tendency of increasing as a whole and reached a peak in June. However, after July, areas of oil slicks began to fall. Relevant reports such as weather and plugging are also attached, which indicate analysis and reports are in accordance.																	2161-024X						2013																		WOS:000339361500147

The ecosystems along China's coast are especially vulnerable to the accelerated sea-level rise and associated multi-hazards such as storm surges and coastal flooding due to their low-lying topography, highly developed economy, and high-density population. To ensure a better management of China's coastal areas, it is crucial to develop adequate nationwide coastal vulnerability assessment models. This paperpresents our design and procedure of assessing the vulnerability of China's entire coast using eight factors. Techniques of geographic information systemand remote sensing were used to integrate the best available, spatially-disaggregated national data on critical impact elements. A comprehensive coastal vulnerability index( CVI) was then calculated by integrating the differentially weighted rank values of the variables. In the finalstep, the coastline was segmented into 4vulnerability levels: low, moderate, high and very high. The results generated from the segmentation show that35% of the entire coast has high or very high vulnerability, mostly along Bohai Bay, theNorth Jiangsu coastal plain, the Yangtze River and the Yellow River Delta, and the western coast of Taiwan. The geographical distribution of the vulnerability grade proves to be reasonable. Findingsfurtherreveal that large amounts of land and population wouldbe vulnerable to inundation by coastal flooding from sea level rise and storm surge without effective measures. Finally, some suggestions are presented for decision makers and other concerned stakeholders to develop appropriate coastal zonemanagement and mitigation measures.																	2161-024X						2013																		WOS:000339361500163

The subtidal area requires significant study in order to understand the complete processes of mud bank migration. The aim of this short paper is to compare the mud bank migration in the subtidal area combining remote sensing data and in-situ measurement. The determination of the delimitation of the subtidal part is realized with remotely sensed data using waves attenuation as a proxy of the subtidal part location. Waves are dampened by fluid mud at proximity of the subtidal area, and are highly detectable on SPOT images. The regular bathymetric survey of the Kourou harbor channel offers a detailed situation of fluid mud arrival along the channel and so on the subtidal migration of the mud bank. Fresh mud arrival in the Kourou channel induce significant depth addition, more precisely the mud lens, important dredging effort in the navigation channel is organized to allow the passage of ships. Therefore, it is observed that the passage of mud bank contributes differently along the channel with a more pronounced arrival of fluid mud in the offshore part of the navigation channel between 2003 and 2009 while the onshore channel were silting-up by the trailing edge of the mud bank from 2010. Combining both the mud bank position from remote sensing images analyses and mud lens surveys allow the determination of the localization of a mud bank along the Kourou coast for 10years.																	0749-0208	1551-5036					2013			1		65		558	563		10.2112/SI65-095.1								WOS:000337995500096

In this paper, we report an effort to visualize and explore the ocean three-dimensionally for the China Digital Ocean Prototype System (CDOPS). This three-dimensional ocean environment is composed of three parts: the three-dimensional coast, the ocean surface and the three-dimensional ocean floor. In the study that follows, the in situ observational data were visualized by a two-dimensional graph. The remote sensing information product was overlaid on the globe in a distributed web environment, and the model output data were visualized and explored in a web environment with vertical profile and a sedate change-representation function. The applications of the CDOPS are introduced at the paper's end.

Temporal variation in turbidity is the key to understanding sediment dynamics in coastal regions. For example, a certain patch of suspended sediment in surface water can be traced every hour by generating a GOCI-derived map of suspended sediment concentration (SSC). By calculating the variations in the position of the patch every hour quantitatively, we can obtain information on the current movement in the region quantitatively. Here, we investigate the applicability of GOCI data to monitoring of the temporal movement of suspended sediment in coastal areas and to the development of algorithms for calculating the current speed and direction. Our study was performed in areas near Gyeonggi Bay on the mid-west coast of the Korean Peninsula. Field work was performed to obtain in situ measurements of SSC and optical properties of the water surface. These data could then be combined to derive an SSC algorithm based on the relationship between the SSC and remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) values. We calculated the suspended sediment movement from hourly SSC images. Current velocity and direction were also measured in the field to validate and identify the calculated movement. GOCI images acquired on the same day as the samples were used to generate a map of turbidity and to estimate the differences in SSC displayed in each image. We found that GOCI could be effectively used to monitor the temporal dynamics of the turbidity of coastal waters, i.e., sediment movements driven by currents along the west coast of the Korean Peninsula. Sediment movements can be applied to develop GOCI-based algorithms that calculate current velocities and generate maps of current vectors in this coastal area.

Chlorophyll concentration along the northwestern coast of the Iberian Peninsula vs. atmosphere-ocean-land conditions	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					12th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)	APR 08-12, 2013	Plymouth, ENGLAND					The aim of this work is to investigate the relationship between the atmosphere-ocean-land conditions and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) formation along the northwestern coast of the Iberian Peninsula. Spatial and temporal distribution of Chl-a concentration, sea surface temperature, surface winds and rivers discharge were analyzed from 1998 to 2007, using remote sensing data. Generally, the Chl-a concentrations are higher near the coast showing a seasonal variability. In fact, along the coast there are higher Chl-a concentrations during the dry season (April to September) which can be associated to the upwelling favorable conditions (southward winds). These favorable conditions are related to the presence of cold nutrient-rich water which upwells towards the surface layers enhancing the primary production. During winter months, the wind pattern is usually upwelling unfavorable (northward winds); however high Chl-a concentration also occurs near the coast. These high values could be related to the inland nutrients input through rivers discharge and winter upwelling events. Afterwards, correlation coefficients were computed between Chl-a and upwelling index, SST and rivers discharges. Between June to September chlorophyll and upwelling index are positively correlated, increasing southward (0.58 to the south of the study area). During winter, the correlation coefficient between chlorophyll and rivers discharge is 0.75 in the northern region of the study area. Therefore, during summer months the chlorophyll variations could be explained mainly by the frequent upwelling events, whereas during winter months, high chlorophyll concentration near coast depends on rivers discharges.

From June through November 2012, University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF) deployed and maintained three Long Range SeaSonde@ HF Surface Wave Radars operating in the 5 MHz band and two High Resolution SeaSondes operating in the 25 MHz band to map hourly ocean surface currents in the Chukchi Sea during the summer and fall. With funding from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Center for Islands, Maritime, and Extreme Environments Security (CIMES), UAF partnered with Rutgers University, a partner in the DHS Center for Secure and Resilient Maritime Commerce (CSR) and CODAR Ocean Sensors to demonstrate multi-use MDA capability of Sea Sondes to provide vessel detections simultaneously with surface current maps near Barrow, Alaska. The Arctic region poses challenges to HF Radar vessel detection including: remote locations requiring specialized shelter, power and communications; extreme weather; the presence of ice floes, which have their own Doppler echoes in addition to sea clutter; and a different radio environment with auroral influences. Vessel detection results are shown with corresponding AIS data, the effect of diurnal ionosphere activity on HF Doppler spectra is shown and the performance of the UAF remote power module (RPM) is discussed.																	0197-7385		978-1-4799-0000-8; 978-1-4799-0002-2				2013																		WOS:000335313100191

The long-range SeaSonde is a key component of the national HF radar network. Default SeaSonde processing on long-range systems only captures 92% of the M2 tidal current velocity and hence 85% of the tidal energy due to a 180-minute averaging time. Reducing this averaging time would help improve the surface current measurements of the SeaSonde system. A study was undertaken to analyze the radial processing of the long-range SeaSonde. Radial current files were generated using a sixty-minute radial averaging and compared with the default one hundred and eighty minute average. This was performed at five stations in the northern section of the Mid Atlantic Regional Association Coastal Ocean Observing System (MARACOOS) for a two-week period. This study has implications for the thirty-five long-range radars operating in the United States and the approximately eighty-six long-range radars operating around the globe. The hope being that the shorter averaging time will lead to increased accuracy of the measured surface currents. This in turn will lead to more effective search and rescue cases for the US Coast Guard. Another study was conducted to measure the impact that bistatic radar has on the measurements of surface currents. A 13 MHz radar network was used to test to see if elliptical current measurements would decrease the uncertainty of a total surface current measurement. A three-week record of hourly radial and elliptical measurements were used and combined in several configurations to test the impact of the elliptical currents. Initial findings show that the elliptical current measurements decreased the uncertainty of the total vector calculation and reduced gaps due to missing radial data.																	0197-7385		978-1-4799-0000-8; 978-1-4799-0002-2				2013																		WOS:000335313100141

The characteristics of estuaries are difficult to determine accurately because they are different in terms of their biological, chemical and physical. Because of their natural characteristics such as sheltered, shallow and calm, humans have benefited the estuaries as their source of food, transportation and development sites especially to the inland areas located far from the coast. However, the industrial activities have affected the areas by changing on the natural balance in the estuarine and pollution due to industrialization. In order to observe any changes in the area and to detect the pollution, remote sensing technology has been proven to be effective for observation of water bodies especially for total suspended solids (TSS). In this study, Landsat TM satellite image on 14 December 2009 was used to demonstrate the feasibility of TSS distribution mapping map in the lower Merbok estuary. In order to map the TSS distribution, a multiple regression algorithm was built using multi-band data for retrieval of the water constituent and the data were combined for multi-date regression analysis. In this study, the best R and RMS values were 0.96 and 18.68 mg/l. The coefficients obtained from the regression analysis were then used to map the suspended sediments. From the map analysis, assisted with the river discharge and tidal data, it was observed that the primary controlling factor to the TSS distributions in the area is the river discharge. The second predominant factor is tidal cycles. The presence of tidal cycles tends to increase or decrease the advections of the plume water.																	2165-4301		978-1-4673-5233-8				2013							341	344										WOS:000333962400071

In order to investigate the evolution and the disappearance of the archaeological site and to define the causes of the settlements affecting the area since ancient times, an interdisciplinary research, about the geological, tectonical, morphological and geotechnical aspects, has been for long carried out; recent studies have focused on a recent component of the subsidence, that is also revealed by PS-INSAR monitoring data. This paper discusses the geotechnical modeling that has been developed to interpret the source of the current settlement rates. It is related to the hydraulic boundary conditions evolving in the recent past in the plain, in particular as effect of deep water extraction and of shallow water drainage by a wellpoint system working at the archeological site since the last century. The model is based on an extensive set of geotechnical profiles and laboratory data. The calculation results are compared to the recent data collected by remote sensing and allow to forecast the possible evolution of the subsidence.				; Pagliarulo, Rosa/B-7983-2015	COTECCHIA, Federica/0000-0001-9846-4193; Pagliarulo, Rosa/0000-0002-3534-5741														978-1-315-88749-4; 978-1-138-00055-1				2013							199	206										WOS:000328117300019

Improved exploration of fishery resources through the integration of remotely sensed merged Sea level anomaly, Chlorophyll concentration, and Sea surface temperature	REMOTE SENSING OF THE OCEAN, SEA ICE, COASTAL WATERS, AND LARGE WATER REGIONS 2013	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Remote Sensing of the Ocean, Sea Ice, Coastal Waters, and Large Water Regions	SEP 24, 2013	Dresden, GERMANY	SPIE				The capabilities of evolving satellite remote sensing technology, combined with conventional data collection techniques, provide a powerful tool for efficient and cost effective management of living marine resources. Fishes are the valuable living marine resources producing food, profit and pleasure to the human community. Variations in oceanic condition play a role in natural fluctuations of fish stocks. The Satellite Altimeter derived Merged Sea Level Anomaly(MSLA) results in the better understanding of ocean variability and mesosclae oceanography and provides good possibility to reveal the zones of high dynamic activity. This study comprised the synergistic analysis of signatures of SEAWIFS derived chlorophyll concentration, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer(NOAA-AVHRR) derived Sea Surface Temperature and the monthly Merged Sea Level Anomaly data derived from Topex/Poseidon, Jason-1 and ERS-1 Altimeters for the past 7 years during the period from 1998 to 2004. The overlapping Chlorophyll, SST and MSLA were suggested for delineating Potential Fishing Zones (PFZs). The Chlorophyll and SST data set were found to have influenced by short term persistence from days to week while MSLA signatures of respective features persisted for longer duration. Hence, the study used Altimeter derived MSLA as an index for long term variability detection of fish catches along with Chlorophyll and SST images and the maps showing PFZs of the study area were generated. The real time Fishing statistics of the same duration were procured from FSI Mumbai. The catch contours were generated with respect to peak spectra of chlorophyll variation and trough spectra of MSLA and SST variation. The vice-a-versa patterns were observed in the poor catch contours. The Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) for each fishing trail was calculated to normalize the fish catch. Based on the statistical analysis the actual CPUEs were classified at each probable MSLA depth zones and plotted on the same images.																	0277-786X		978-0-8194-9757-4				2013	8888								UNSP 888805	10.1117/12.2029016								WOS:000328345700004

This sets the stage for events with potentially altered sea-air CO2 fluxes. Four upwelling events off the east coast of Gotland in the Baltic Sea were analyzed to assess the impact of upwelling on the air-sea exchange of CO2. For each event, the observed pCO(2) were found to be a function of sea-surface temperature (SST) in the upwelling area, which allowed satellite observations of SST to form a proxy for surface water pCO(2). A bulk formula was then used to estimate the air-sea CO2 flux during the upwelling events. The results show that the CO2 fluxes in the study area are highly influenced by the upwelling. Comparing with idealized cases without upwelling yields relatively large differences, ranging between 19 and 250% in reduced uptake/increased emission of CO2. Upwelling may also influence the CO2 fluxes on larger scales. A rough estimate indicates that it may also be of significant importance for the average annual CO2 flux from the Baltic Sea. Including upwelling possibly decreases the Baltic Sea annual average uptake by up to 25%.																	0280-6509	1600-0889					2013	65								21831	10.3402/tellusb.v65i0.21831								WOS:000328681800001

Simulation, Visualization and GIS analysis of Oil Spill disasters is crucial to rapidly assessment of the vulnerability of coastal areas and to make a full understanding of possible impact of disasters on infrastructure and environment. Globe model become a hotspot in the area of GIS research presently. It is a useful platform for integration and sharing of spatial information with its strong abilities of spatial data management and visualization. In this paper, Multi-resolution remote sensing imagery and DEM of terrain is implemented with LOD based on Globe Model. A numerical simulation result of PL19-3 oil spill based on General NOAA Operational Modeling Environment (GNOME) is visualized using particle trace and analysed on the globe model. It proves that the method of virtual reality and GIS analysis based on globe model for oil spill is vivid and intuitionistic; it may be applied in other ocean research.

A Normalized Optical Water Index (NOWI) is proposed to accurately discriminate between land and water regions in multi-spectral satellite imagery data from DubaiSat-1. NOWI exploits the spectral characteristics of water content (using visible bands) and uses a non-linear normalization procedure that renders strong emphasize on small changes in lower brightness values whilst guaranteeing that the segmentation process remains image-independent. The NOWI representation is validated through systematic experiments, evaluated using robust metrics, and compared against various supervised classification algorithms. Analysis has indicated that NOWI has the advantages that it: a) is a pixel-based method that requires no global knowledge of the scene under investigation, b) can be easily implemented in parallel processing, c) is image-independent and requires no training, d) works in different environmental conditions, e) provides high accuracy and efficiency, and f) works directly on the input image without any form of pre-processing.

S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program (http://www.arm.gov/). The overall goal of the TCAP field campaign is to study the evolution of optical and microphysical properties of atmospheric aerosol transported from North America to the Atlantic and their impact on the radiation energy budget. During TCAP, the ground-based ARM Mobile Facility (AMF) was deployed on Cape Cod, an arm-shaped peninsula situated on the easternmost portion of Massachusetts (along the east coast of the United States) and that is generally downwind of large metropolitan areas. The AMF site was equipped with numerous instruments for sampling aerosol, cloud and radiative properties, including a Multi-Filter Rotating Shadowband Radiometer (MFRSR), a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), an Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS), and a three-wavelength nephelometer. In this study we present an analysis of diurnal and day-to-day variability of the column and near-surface aerosol properties obtained from remote sensing (MFRSR data) and ground-based in situ measurements (SMPS, APS, and nephelometer data). In particular, we show that the observed diurnal variability of the MFRSR aerosol optical depth is strong and comparable with that obtained previously from the AERONET climatology in Mexico City, which has a larger aerosol loading. Moreover, we illustrate how the variability of aerosol properties impacts the direct aerosol radiative forcing at different time scales.

Remote sensing of harmful algal events in optically complex waters using regionally specific neural network-based algorithms for MERIS data	FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT (RSCY2013)	Proceedings of SPIE				1st International Conference on Remote Sensing and Geoinformation of the Environment (RSCy)	APR 08-10, 2013	Paphos, CYPRUS	Cyprus Remote Sensing Soc, Cyprus Univ Technol, European Space Agcy, Cyprus Sci & Tech Chamber, Cyprus Meteorol Serv, Minist Commun & Works, Dept Elect Commun, Frederick Univ, European Space Agcy, Intergraph (SG&I) Italia LLC, Hexagon, Geosystems Hellas, Neapolis Univ				In typical case 2 waters an accurate remote sensing retrieval of chlorophyll a (chla) is still challenging. There is a widespread understanding that universally applicable water constituent retrieval algorithms are currently not feasible, shifting the research focus to regionally specific implementations of powerful inversion methods. This study takes advantage of regionally specific chlorophyll a (chla) algorithms, which were developed by the authors of this abstract in previous works, and the characteristics of Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) in order to study harmful algal events in the optically complex waters of the Galician Rias (NW). Harmful algal events are a frequent phenomenon in this area with direct and indirect impacts to the mussel production that constitute a very important economic activity for the local community. More than 240 10(6) kg of mussel per year are produced in these highly primary productive upwelling systems. A MERIS archive from nine years (2003-2012) was analysed using regionally specific chla algorithms. The latter were developed based on Multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural networks and fuzzy c-mean clustering techniques (FCM). FCM specifies zones (based on water leaving reflectances) where the retrieval algorithms normally provide more reliable results. Monthly chla anomalies and other statistics were calculated for the nine years MERIS archive. These results were then related to upwelling indices and other associated measurements to determine the driver forces for specific phytoplankton blooms. The distribution and changes of chla are also discussed.																	0277-786X		978-0-8194-9638-6				2013	8795								UNSP 87950O	10.1117/12.2027591								WOS:000325475000024

Knowledge of these systems allows managers and scientists to model and establish the ecosystem state. This study is focused on the sand bars located in the Ebro delta coast. These sand bars constitute a natural sediment deposit to protect the beaches from wave erosion. Over the last 20 years, their detection has been based on the record of the maximum intensity shown by waves breaking over them. The methodology uses satellite images to detect the sand bars depending on the pixel value. Although is not possible to validate the results, their coherence allows where new investigation lines to be explored. The methodology used will allow increased frequency of monitoring in large areas while reducing costs.

Arau River often overflowed flooding the region city. To reduce this flood the Dutch government constructs the flood relief channel in 1926. The construction of this flood relief channel has resulted supply of sediment from Arau River to the coast become less which in turn caused the abrasion on the coast of Padang. In order to minimize the problem, the Department of Water Resources Management of West Sumatera has constructed several groins and jetties perpendicular to the shoreline. Thus, there is a vital need to conserve these constructed groins and jetties so that the shoreline equilibrium is protected. Here, monitoring changes in shoreline helps to identify the nature and processes that caused these changes. Over the past few years, Remote sensing (RS) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) offer potential methods to solve many coastal erosion problems by providing a means for generating information, regular monitoring and analysis to predict and visualize future scenarios. The repetitive acquisition and synoptic capabilities of RS and GIS can be exploited to provide timely spatial data for coastal, enabling detection and monitoring of coastline movement. This paper therefore highlights the coastal monitoring processes and analyzing the shoreline change using RS and GIS techniques.																			978-1-4673-5609-1				2013							280	284										WOS:000324596300054

Its acceptance along ocean coasts has resulted in the development of several commercially available systems and a planned nationwide coastal network to routinely measure coastal currents. Because HF radiation is known to propagate less efficiently over fresh water than seawater, it has been largely overlooked as a viable tool for freshwater application. However, its potential utility in freshwater was clearly demonstrated by a deployment along Lake Michigan as part of the 1999-2001 Episodic Events Great Lakes Experiment. As part of this experiment, the University of Michigan Multi-frequency Coastal Radar consistently produced reliable near surface current measurements to a range of approximately 25 km offshore showing strong correlation with both in-situ measurements and numerical hind-casts. This paper provides background on HF radar technology, a summary of the current state of the art with respect to freshwater and describes the results of a recent experiment to measure the propagation of HF radar signal over freshwater using CODAR Ocean Sensors SeaSondes, operating at 5 and 42 MHz with 21 W and 90 W average radiated powers, respectively. The effective offshore range for these radars was found to be 18 km at 5 MHz and 4-5 km at 42 MHz. These findings are consistent with currently available models for the prediction of propagation loss, verifying that they can reliably be used to estimate ranges in freshwater settings.

J	El Shoubaky, GA				El Shoubaky, Gihan Ahmed			Comparison of the impacts of climate change and anthropogenic disturbances on the El Arish coast and seaweed vegetation after ten years in 2010, North Sinai, Egypt	OCEANOLOGIA												Human activities on coasts and climate changes during the past ten years have given rise to considerable shoreline changes along the El Arish coast (the northern coast of the Sinai Peninsula). In the El Arish Power Plant, sediment accretion has reached the tip of the breakwater of the cooling water intake basin, necessitating extensive dredging inside the basin. To the east of El Arish Harbour, the shoreline has been in continuous retreat. The differences between the year 2000 and 2010 in the shoreline along the El Arish coast were determined by analysing satellite images from NOAA-AVHRR images. The analyses revealed erosion and accretion patterns along the coast. The physical parameters showed that the minimum water temperature of 18 C was recorded at site I in winter and that the maximum was 40 C at site II in summer. The latter temperature can be attributed to the effluent discharge of cooling water from the El Arish power plant. Spatial and temporal patterns in the distribution and abundance of macroalgae were measured at four sites (I, II, III and IV) along the El Arish coast. The percentage cover of the successional macroalgae exhibited environmental fluctuations. After ten years, the phytocommunity showed that red and green algae were dominant at the study sites. Significant differences between past and current flora were observed. 39 taxa recorded in 2000 were absent in 2010, while 9 taxa not previously reported were present in 2010. These changes are discussed in the context of possible global warming effects. PERMANOVA showed significant changes (p < 0.001) between sites, seasons, species abundance and macroalgal groups along the El Arish coast in 2000 and 2010. The similarity matrix showed a significant difference between the flora in 2010 and that recorded in 2000, indicating poor similarity and changes in species composition among the seasons at the different sites. Most of the algae belonged to the filamentous, coarsely branched and sheet functional form groups.																	0078-3234	2300-7370					2013	55	3					663	685		10.5697/oc.55-3.663								WOS:000324282500008

A novel technique to monitor thermal discharges using thermal infrared imaging	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												Coastal temperature is an important indicator of water quality, particularly in regions where delicate ecosystems sensitive to water temperature are present. Remote sensing methods are highly reliable for assessing the thermal dispersion. The plume dispersion from the thermal outfall of the nuclear power plant at Kalpakkam, on the southeast coast of India, was investigated from March to December 2011 using thermal infrared images along with field measurements. The absolute temperature as provided by the thermal infrared (TIR) images is used in the Arc GIS environment for generating a spatial pattern of the plume movement. Good correlation of the temperature measured by the TIR camera with the field data (r(2) = 0.89) make it a reliable method for the thermal monitoring of the power plant effluents. The study portrays that the remote sensing technique provides an effective means of monitoring the thermal distribution pattern in coastal waters.																	2050-7887						2013	15	9					1729	1734		10.1039/c3em00081h								WOS:000323352100009	23839171

Real-Time Beyond the Horizon Vessel Detection	RADAR SENSOR TECHNOLOGY XVII	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Radar Sensor Technology XVII	APR 29-MAY 01, 2013	Baltimore, MD	SPIE				The marine transportation system (MTS) is a vital component of the United States Economy. Waterborne cargo accounts for more than $742 billion of the nation's economy and creates employment for 13 million citizens. A disruption in this system would have far reaching consequences to the security of the country. The US National High Frequency radar network, which comprises 130 radar stations around the country, became operational in May 2009. It provides hourly measurements of surface currents to the US Coast Guard for search and rescue (SAR). This system has the capability of being a dual use system providing information for environmental monitoring as well as vessel position information for maritime security. Real time vessel detection has been implemented at two of the radar stations outside New York Harbor. Several experiments were conducted to see the amount vessel traffic that the radar could capture. The radars were able to detect a majority of the vessels that are reporting via the Automatic Identification System (AIS) as well as 30 percent of mid to large size vessels that are not reporting via AIS. The radars were able to detect vessels out to 60 km from the coast. The addition of a vessel detection capability to the National HF radar network will provide valuable information to maritime security sector. This dual use capability will fill a gap in the current surveillance of US coastal waters. It will also provide longer-range situational awareness necessary to detect and track smaller size vessels in the large vessel clutter.																	0277-786X		978-0-8194-9505-1				2013	8714								UNSP 87140Z	10.1117/12.2015871								WOS:000323559400031

However, measuring these variables has proven to be challenging because appropriate techniques have not yet been developed and extensive datasets of field estimates are lacking. The goal of this study was to estimate the relationship between field-observed snow particle-size parameters from across the East Antarctic ice sheet and a suite of spatial datasets (i.e. topography, remote-sensing data) using a principal component analysis (PCA). Five snow particle-size parameters were correlated to spatial datasets of the following five groups: (1) relief properties such as elevation and slope; (2) remote-sensing data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors; (3) spatially interpolated data (i.e. 10 m maps of temperature and approximate snow accumulation in kg m(-2) a(-1)); (4) field-retrieved data on surface roughness; and (5) in situ elevation and distance from the coast. The results show that the relief parameter slope correlated best with the snow particle length and area (r=0.76, r=0.80). Further, the PCA indicated that the different remote-sensing parameters correlated differently with the size parameters and that the most common parameter in visual analysis, particle length (grain diameter), is not always the optimal parameter to characterize the snow particle size as, for example, area correlates better to slope and aspect than length.

Ice-edge detection from Japanese C-band radar and high-frequency radar coastal stations	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY												A C-band sea-ice radar (SIR) network system was operated to monitor the sea-ice conditions off the Okhotsk Sea coast of northern Hokkaido, Japan, from 1969 to 2004. The system was based on three radar stations, which were capable of continuously monitoring the sea surface as far as 60 km offshore along a 250 km long coastal section. In 2004 the SIR system was closed down and a sea surface monitoring programme was commenced using high-frequency (HF) radar; this system provides information on surface currents in open-water conditions, while areas with 'no signal' can be identified as sea ice. The present study compares HF radar data with SIR data to evaluate their feasibility for sea-ice remote sensing. The period of overlapping data was 1.5 months. The results show that HF radar information can be utilized for ice-edge mapping although it cannot fully compensate for the loss of the SIR system. In particular, HF radar does not provide ice concentration, ice roughness and geometrical structures or ice kinematics. The probability of ice-edge detection by HF radar was 0.9 and the correlation of the ice-edge distance between the radars was 0.7.

The pattern determination of sea surface temperature distribution and chlorophyll a in the Southern Caspian Sea using SOM Model	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												Remote sensing has changed modern oceanography by proving synoptic periodic data which can be processed. Since the satellite data are usually too much and nonlinear, in most cases, it is difficult to distinguish the patterns from these images. In fact, SOM (Self-Organizing Maps) model is a type of ANN (Artificial Neural Network) that has the ability to distinguish the efficient patterns from the vast complex of satellite data. In this study, the sea surface temperature data and chlorophyll a related to a part of south Caspian Sea were investigated weekly by NOAA satellite for three years (2003-2005) and the annual and seasonal patterns were extracted (elicited) with their relative frequency using the SOM model. In all patterns the Caspian Sea coast has the highest chl-a and when you go away from the shore the rate decreases and when you approach to the middle parts the chl-a is of the least proportion on the sea surface.																	1562-2916					JAN	2013	12	1					105	VI										WOS:000317941200009						
J	Zhai, P; Bower, A				Zhai, Ping; Bower, Amy			The response of the Red Sea to a strong wind jet near the Tokar Gap in summer	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Remote sensing and in situ observations are used to investigate the ocean response to the Tokar Wind Jet in the Red Sea. The wind jet blows down the atmospheric pressure gradient through the Tokar Gap on the Sudanese coast, at about 19 degrees N, during the summer monsoon season. It disturbs the prevailing along-sea (southeastward) winds with strong cross-sea (northeastward) winds that can last from days to weeks and reach amplitudes of 20-25 m/s. By comparing scatterometer winds with along-track and gridded sea level anomaly observations, it is observed that an intense dipolar eddy spins up in response to the wind jet. The eddy pair has a horizontal scale of 140 km. Maximum ocean surface velocities can reach 1 m/s and eddy currents extend more than 100 m into the water column. The eddy currents appear to cover the width of the sea, providing a pathway for rapid transport of marine organisms and other drifting material from one coast to the other. Interannual variability in the strength of the dipole is closely matched with variability in the strength of the wind jet. The dipole is observed to be quasi-stationary, although there is some evidence for slow eastward propagation in an idealized numerical model. Simulation of the dipole in an idealized high-resolution numerical model suggests that this is the result of self-advection. Citation: Zhai, P., and A. S.

Elbrus, Caucasus Mountains, Russia on 5 May 2009 to develop a method for dating and "provenancing" of desert dust events recorded in snow pack	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												A significant desert dust deposition event occurred on Mt. Elbrus, Caucasus Mountains, Russia on 5 May 2009, where the deposited dust later appeared as a brown layer in the snow pack. An examination of dust transportation history and analysis of chemical and physical properties of the deposited dust were used to develop a new approach for high-resolution "provenancing" of dust deposition events recorded in snow pack using multiple independent techniques. A combination of SEVIRI red-green-blue composite imagery, MODIS atmospheric optical depth fields derived using the Deep Blue algorithm, air mass trajectories derived with HYSPLIT model and analysis of meteorological data enabled identification of dust source regions with high temporal (hours) and spatial (ca. 100 km) resolution. Dust, deposited on 5 May 2009, originated in the foothills of the Djebel Akhdar in eastern Libya where dust sources were activated by the intrusion of cold air from the Mediterranean Sea and Saharan low pressure system and transported to the Caucasus along the eastern Mediterranean coast, Syria and Turkey. Particles with an average diameter below 8 mu m accounted for 90% of the measured particles in the sample with a mean of 3.58 mu m, median 2.48 mu m. The chemical signature of this long-travelled dust was significantly different from the locally-produced dust and close to that of soils collected in a palaeolake in the source region, in concentrations of hematite. Potential addition of dust from a secondary source in northern Mesopotamia introduced uncertainty in the "provenancing" of dust from this event. Nevertheless, the approach adopted here enables other dust horizons in the snowpack to be linked to specific dust transport events recorded in remote sensing and meteorological data archives.

Interannual variability of chlorophyll-a concentration along the southwest coast of India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The interannual variability of chlorophyll concentration along the southwest coast of India is studied using remote-sensing data from SeaWiFS. The data are analysed in conjunction with satellite-measured sea surface winds. The satellite-measured chlorophyll data for a period of 10 years from 1998 to 2007 were made use of for indexing the maximum offshore extent of chlorophyll along the coast for each month. From the empirical orthogonal functional analysis of chlorophyll data, it is observed that the dominant mode is annual. Interestingly, intraseasonal variability and the influence of climatic events like El Nino are observed in the secondary principle component of the time series. The variability of chlorophyll coincided well with variability of Ekman transport all along the coast with higher chlorophyll (>1mgm3) when the Ekman transport is greater than 1000 kg/m/s. During the years 20052007, reduction in the meridional (along shore) component of wind resulted in reduction of Ekman transport, the phenomenon which leads to a decrease in chlorophyll. This is due to the reduction in the amount of nutrients that entrained to surface layers during upwelling of the southwest monsoon. The chlorophyll-a is minimum when Ekman transport is less than 0.5 kg/m/s on the normalized scale. For higher values of chlorophyll, the Ekman transport is higher, indicating the contribution of wind in enhancing the already upwelled chlorophyll production. The smaller value of R 2 infers that there exist other forces as well involved in augmenting the surface chlorophyll. The enhanced knowledge on the offshore extent and the intraseasonal and interannual variability of chlorophyll can provide valuable inputs on fisheries and primary productivity for this region.																	0143-1161	1366-5901				JAN 1	2013	34	11					3820	3831		10.1080/01431161.2012.762482								WOS:000315384500007

As such, protection of mangroves is an urgent priority. This work provides some new information on patterns of degradation in the Sundarbans, the largest contiguous mangrove forest in the world, which are home to more than 35 reptile species, 120 commercial fish species, 300 bird species and 32 mammal species. Using radar imagery, we contrast and quantify the recent impacts of cyclone Sidr and anthropogenic degradation on this ecosystem. Our results, inferred from changes in radar backscatter, confirm already reported trends in coastline retreat for this region, with areas losing as much as 200 m of coast per year. They also suggest rapid changes in mangrove dynamics for Bangladesh and India, highlighting an overall decrease in mangrove health in the east side of the Sundarbans, and an overall increase in this parameter for the west side of the Sundarbans. As global environmental change takes its toll in this part of the world, more detailed, regular information on mangroves' distribution and health is required: our study illustrates how different threats experienced by mangroves can be detected and mapped using radar-based information, to guide management action.

This area included three sites at 2, 10 and 18 km perpendicular to the coast, sampled at surface, mid-Secchi and Secchi depths at each site. Phytoplankton absorption coefficients were transformed into specific coefficients (a(ph)*(lambda)) by normalizing them with respect to chlorophyll a (Chla) concentrations determined by High Performance Liquid Chromatography. The influence on the variability of the absorption coefficient of phytoplankton was assessed for physicochemical and biological parameters such as nutrients or Chla levels, as well as size structure and abundance of the phytoplankton community. The results showed that the phytoplankton absorption coefficients decreased from inshore to offshore, but were relatively constant within the water column, revealing a well-mixed column. The a(ph)*(lambda) varied inversely with Chla content, with minima in Autumn and Spring, matching phytoplankton blooms. The effects of the size structure of the community and pigment composition on the variability of phytoplankton absorption coefficient were studied and results showed that size structure had a greater influence on the variability of the phytoplankton absorption, although the pigment contribution was also important.

Relating Biophysical Parameters of Coastal Marshes to Hyperspectral Reflectance Data in the Bahia Blanca Estuary, Argentina	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Gonzalez Trilla, G.; Pratolongo, P.; Beget, M.E.; Kandus, P.; Marcovecchio, J., and Di Bella, C., 2013. Relating biophysical parameters of coastal marshes to hyperspectral reflectance data in the Bahia Blanca Estuary, Argentina. Journal of Coastal Research, 29(1), 231-238. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Salt marshes occupying the tidal fringe of estuaries and protected coasts provide valuable ecosystem services, and remote sensing is a powerful tool for their large-scale monitoring. However, in order to apply remote sensing techniques to evaluate the ecological state of salt marshes, a deeper understanding is needed about the interactions between field biophysical parameters and the sensor's reflectance. The main objective of this work is to analyze and quantify the influence of different biophysical parameters characterizing stands of Spartina alterniflora marshes in the Bahia Blanca Estuary, Argentina, on their spectral response. Spectral reflectance at high resolution was measured in S. alterniflora canopies under natural conditions, manipulating standing biomass by means of successive harvestings. Reflectance data were acquired using a FieldSpec (R) spectroradiometer, which measures in the visible, near-infrared, and shortwave-infrared spectral bands. Based on these reflectance data, spectral indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were calculated for each biomass condition. Biomass, leaf area index (LAI), percent canopy cover (PCC), water content, and soil properties were also evaluated. LAI, PCC, and biomass were positively correlated between each other. As a general trend, as biomass decreased, absorption in red wavelengths decreased and reflectance in near-infrared increased. Several indices explained the variability in LAI, biomass, and PCC. For example, NDVIRouse had a positive regression with PCC (R-2 = 0.80, N = 75) and LAI (R-2 = 0.67, N = 75). Results indicate that LAI, biomass, and PCC of Spartina alterniflora could be accurately determined from spectral data.

Short-term variability of surface carbon dioxide and sea-air CO2 fluxes in the shelf waters of the Galician coastal upwelling system	SCIENTIA MARINA					15th Iberian Seminar on Marine Chemistry	FEB 22-24, 2010	Vigo, SPAIN					Using data collected during the DYBAGA and ECO cruises, remote sensing chlorophyll-a estimations and the averaged upwelling index of the previous fortnight (I-w'), we studied the variability of the sea surface CO2 fugacity (fCO(2)) over the Galician continental shelf during three seasonal cycles. Sea surface salinity (SSS) distribution controlled fCO(2) mainly in spring, while sea surface temperature (SST) did so during periods of intense cooling in November and warming in June. The uptake of carbon by photosynthetic activity, which was more intense during spring and autumn, masked the surface increase in the dissolved inorganic carbon concentration during upwelling events, especially during spring. A significant low correlation between fCO(2) and Iw' was found during spring and summer when upwelling events were observed, whereas no relationship was observed during the downwelling period. High fCO(2) exceeding atmospheric values was only found during the summer stratification breakdown. Although sea-air CO2 fluxes showed a marked inter-annual variability, surface waters off the Galician coast were net sinks for atmospheric CO2 in every seasonal cycle, showing a lower CO2 uptake (similar to 65%) compared to previously published values. Marked inter-annual changes in the sea-air CO2 fluxes seem to be influenced by fresh water inputs on the continental shelf under different meteorological scenarios.

Effects of atmospheric river landfalls on the cold season precipitation in California	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Effects of atmospheric river (AR) landfalls in the California coast on the cold-season precipitation in California are examined for the cold seasons of 10 water years (WYs) 2001-2010 using observed data and regional modeling in conjunction with AR-landfall inventory based on visual inspections of precipitable water vapor (PWV) from remote sensing and reanalysis. The PWV in the SSM/I and SSMIS retrievals and the ERA-Interim reanalysis shows 95 AR-landfall days in the California coast that are almost evenly split between the northern and southern coasts across 37.5N. The CPC/NCEP gridded daily precipitation analysis shows that 10-30% of the cold-season precipitation totals in California have occurred during these AR landfalls. The analysis also reveals that the percentage of precipitation and the precipitation intensity during AR landfalls in California are characterized by strong north-to-south gradient. This north-south contrast in the AR precipitation is reversed for the non-AR precipitation in the coastal range. The frequency of AR landfalls and the cold-season precipitation totals in the Sierra Nevada region are only marginally correlated. Instead, AR landfalls are closely related with the occurrence of heavy precipitation events. The freezing-level altitudes are systematically higher for AR wet days than non-AR wet days indicating warmer low-troposphere during AR storms. Cold season simulations for the 10 WYs 2001-2010 show that the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model can reasonably simulate important features in both the seasonal and AR precipitation totals. The daily pattern correlation coefficients between the simulated and ERA-Interim upper-air fields exceed 0.9 for most of the period. This suggests that the simulated temporal variations in the atmospheric circulation agree reasonably with the reanalysis over seasonal time scales, characteristics critical for reliable simulations of regional scale hydrologic cycle. The simulated seasonal and AR precipitation totals also agree reasonably with the CPC/NCEP precipitation analysis. The most notable model errors include the overestimation (underestimation) of the season-total and AR precipitation in the northern (southern) California region. The differences in the freezing-level altitudes during the AR- and non-AR wet days in the simulation agree with those from the ERA-Interim reanalysis. The freezing level altitudes are systematically overestimated in the simulations, suggesting warm biases in the low troposphere. Overall, WRF appears to perform reasonably in simulating the key features in the cold season precipitation related with AR landfalls, an important capability for assessing the impact of global climate variations and change on future hydrology in California.

The processors, named Case II Regional (C2R), boreal (BOR), and eutrophic (EUT), for the associated lake types, have been developed for different types of coastal or inland (Case II) waters. Chlorophyll-a (chl-a), total suspended matter (TSM), absorption of colored dissolved organic matter (alpha(CDOM)(443)), and signal depth (Z(90)) products of the BEAM processors were compared with in situ data. In addition, total absorption (alpha(TOT)) and scattering of TSM (b(TSM)) from different BEAM processors were compared against the results of coastal field campaign measurements. The in situ water quality data consisted of monitoring station data gathered by the Finnish environmental administration during 2006-2009 and data from coastal field campaigns with a flow-through system. AERONET-OC (SeaPRISM) data from the Helsinki Lighthouse station were used to validate the BEAM reflectance products. The comparison with the BEAM processor results and in situ data showed that the bias of the original BEAM algorithms can be decreased through adjustment of the coefficients that relate IOPs such as the absorption of pigments and the scattering of TSM to water quality constituents such as chl-a and turbidity. The TSM products of the BEAM processors can be used to estimate the turbidity measured at monitoring stations with an r(2) of 0.76-0.84 and an RMSE of 0.7-0.85 FNUs (Formazin Nephelometric Units) on the coast of Finland. The best functionality for turbidity estimation was observed with the EUT processor, but the C2R processor also gave a sound performance. The BOR and C2R processors proved to be the best for deriving chl-a concentration. However, the accuracy of chl-a estimations was low with both processors (r(2) ranged from 0.45 to 0.47 and RMSE was between 44 and 45%). Chl-a products, particularly during the phytoplankton bloom seasons of spring and summer, require further development. The Z(90) product from the BOR processor was used to derive an algorithm for Secchi disk depth estimation with r(2) 0.48 and RMSE 0.97 m. The BOR processor was the most successful at CDOM estimation (r(2) 0.6 and RMSE 0.49 1/m), but a simple reflectance ratio was actually able to perform better (r(2) 0.75 and RMSE 0.39 1/m). In many cases, the differences between the outcomes of processors were small and related only to a part of the in situ dataset. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

F.; Ho, Tung-Yuan; Shiah, Fuh-Kwo; Liu, Hongbin			Remote sensing of picophytoplankton distribution in the northern South China Sea	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												By using a global data set (NOMAD), improved algorithms were developed for deducing from ocean color remote sensing data the concentrations of phytoplankton pigments, total chlorophyll alpha (TChl_alpha), zeaxanthin (Zea) and fucoxanthin (Fuco), and the associated primary phytoplankton groups, namely, Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, haptophytes and diatoms, in the oceans. A modified classification for the waters of the world's ocean based on the dominant phytoplankton group was then devised. By using a local data set from the northern South China Sea (NSCS), algorithms were also developed for assessing the cell abundances of picophytoplankton, Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus and pico-eukaryotes, in this region. These algorithms were then applied to the remotely sensed data from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer at Aqua sensor (MODIS-Aqua) to study the abundances and the distributional patterns of picophytoplankton in the entire NSCS. The results agreed well with field observations, which were available only from selected locations in the study area. On a basin scale, the results were consistent with expected variations in phytoplankton pigments, phytoplankton community composition, and picophytoplankton biomass, in response to the major known environmental phenomena in the NSCS, such as the progressive increase in biological productivity towards the coast, the runoff from the Pearl River, higher biological productivity in the wintertime, upwelling around the Taiwan Bank, winter upwelling northwest of the Luzon Island, and the transformation and dissipation of internal waves off the Dongsha Atoll. This work represents the first effort in estimating the cell abundances of the principal picophytoplankton groups in the oceans from space. The general application of this approach to the global ocean needs to be further validated and calibrated with a more extensive data base from field observations in other parts of the oceans.

However, this industry is not exempt of accidents such as oil spills. Satellite remote sensing is a useful tool in delineating polluted areas due to its characteristic to cover large areas. This paper proposes a methodology combining information from both optical (Landsat) and radar (Envisat-ASAR) images to delineate polluted soils by hydrocarbons in the coast of Paraiso, Tabasco, Mexico. Landsat images identified polluted areas over the beach (bare soil); nevertheless, they did not reach the soil under vegetation conditions. In contrast, radar images did not indentify polluted areas in the beach mainly because of the extreme dry conditions in the soil. But, in vegetated areas, the radar penetrated the vegetation cover and identified the polluted soils. Both optical and radar information showed complementarities to delineate polluted areas under heterogeneous conditions.

A synoptic view of the shallow submerged and emerged coastal landscape can offer the quantitative ability to obtain spatially explicit data over large and complex areas, where the heterogeneity of habitat is mixed by vegetation and sediment/soil interactions at the interface with water and atmosphere. In the present paper, by combining field radiometry with contemporary airborne hyperspectral imagery and topographic and bathymetric LiDAR data, an innovative approach with the application of Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) and Multiple Linear Regression models is proposed in order to define shallow coastal seabed, beach and dune habitat at the finest scale. The implemented FHyL (Field spectral libraries, airborne Hyperspectral imagery and LiDAR altimetry) processing chain leads to an innovative mapping results obtained by an integration of multisensory data. Presence and typology of vegetated and unvegetated beach is represented as the abundance of each physical response within the hyperspectral reflectance by building multisensory and multidimensional hyperspectral - LiDAR mixture space. Mineralogical and sedimentological proprieties of the beach sediment was estimated by using field and airborne spectral libraries combined with sediment sampling in a multiple linear regression statistical model. Therefore, FHyL represents the multisensory data fusion process to classify and map vegetation presence and distribution, as well as sediment properties and geomorphology of complex coastal seabed, and beaches dunes systems. The present research is a novel input for multilayered analysis in biophysical studies and its application on multi temporal dataset modeling of coast evolution.

Therefore, this task can be accomplished only by using satellite microwave remote sensing techniques. Due to the unique all weather penetration capability of microwaves it can penetrate through clouds and provide data during day as well as at night. The microwave remote sensing will provide the opportunity to measure the extent of oil spills over the sea surface and the thickness of oil over the sea surface. The paper describes briefly the specification of Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) satellite and present a relationship between brightness temperature at different frequency with different oil spill and non-oil spill locations. The detection of oil spill has been done over a large frequency range from 6 GHz to 91 GHz and the behaviour of brightness temperature over oil spill location as well as non-oil spill location for each frequency is analyzed. The oil spill detection technique using the multifrequency brightness temperature has been revealed in this paper. The study is based on the 2010 Mumbai oil spill, which occurred after the two Panamian-flagged ships, MSC Chitra and MV Khalijia-III collided off the west coast of India.																	2153-6996		978-1-4799-1114-1				2013							3710	3713		10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6723636								WOS:000345638903196

The results indicated that high concentration areas of SSC did not directly surround the Yangtze estuary but concentrated northwards considerably along the coast about 100km. The driving of Taiwan warm current, the southward drift of SSC along the coast and also the river discharges should be the mixed reasons for this northward concentration of SSC. The coastal current also drove the SSC along the coast to the high concentration area of SSC. The first EOF pattern, demonstrated by EOF analysis, explains the dominant distribution pattern of SSC in the study area. This controlling pattern should be caused by the joint effects of northeast wind, the coastal current and Taiwan warm current. The SSC dispersed and extended with a wide range from 122 degrees E to 126 degrees E (about 400km), and from 30 degrees N to 34 degrees N (about 440km). SSC in spring of 2010 and 2011 was obviously higher than that in the previous three years. It suggested that the suspended sediment and associate contaminant, discharged from the Yangtze River, was increasing in recent two years. Stronger northeast wind has significant and negative influence on the SSC.																			978-0-7695-4923-1; 978-1-4673-4893-5				2013							607	611		10.1109/ISDEA.2012.147								WOS:000319283600140

The landward displacement of the shoreline caused by the forces of waves and currents has been a perennial problem for the Chennai coast since the last 100 years. In 2004, groynes were constructed along the north Chennai coast and the lost shoreline and the beaches are now being regained. This study is concerned with remote sensing, GIS and field based studies to evaluate the performance of these groynes along the north Chennai coast and quantify the rate of accretion. Digitally processed multi-temporal (1972-2011) satellite images were interpreted and the shorelines for 7 different years were digitised in a GIS environment. The digitised shorelines, imported into the USGS developed Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) were analysed and final maps were generated depicting erosion in pre-2004 and accretion in post-2004 periods. These maps show that the shoreline has eroded about 220 meters in the last 32 years up to 2004, while it is accreting at a rate of about 8 m/yr from 2004 up to 2011. Finally a shoreline change prediction model was prepared in the DSAS environment. The positions of the future shorelines were determined using a component of DSAS called LRR and the position of predicted shorelines was obtained. This study has shown that due to the construction of groynes, erosion has reduced and deposition is in progress to regain the lost beaches in Chennai City, thus indicating that the groynes are performing well.																			978-80-248-2974-6				2013							217	230										WOS:000393928700018

During this period, a unique monitoring technology, which includes direct field observations, remote sensing and numerical methods, has been developed. The dynamics of thermal-abrasion coasts are directly linked with climate and sea ice extent changes.

Existing seep-mapping projects include Santa Barbara County's Natural Seep Inventory and the University of California Santa Barbara's Bubbleology Coal Oil Point interactive explorer. Organic compounds typically associated with reservoir hydrocarbons are often recognized at or near the surface. Direct and indirect detection of these compounds and their associated (alteration) phenomena are a primary means of establishing the presence of an active or previously active petroleum system. Surface hydrocarbons can be detected by hyperspectral remote-sensing techniques. Hyperspectral data were collected over the Santa Barbara area onshore and offshore by gravity and magnetic surveys. The hyperspectral sensors collected data spanning the visible, near-infrared, shortwave-infrared, and thermal-infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Images were viewed using false-color infrared composite with different enhancement levels for preliminary hydrocarbon identification at various locations in the imagery. Spectral signatures from the airborne hyperspectral data, combined with field spectroradiometer measurements of known seeps, were used to create a spectral library. Numerical classification techniques identified known and previously unknown occurrences of hydrocarbons. Magnetic and gravity surveys were acquired simultaneously and were used to map major geologic trends and structures in relation to the presence of seeps. The occurrence and distribution of detected seeps provided direct evidence of the presence of an active petroleum system.

This situation is also seen in Europe Union; So, Strengthening the EU capacity to respond to Disasters is very important. This paper represents the baseline results of the FP-7 founded DITAC project, which aims to develop a holistic and highly structured curriculum for responders and strategic crisis managers. Up-to-date geospatial information is required in order to create an effective disaster response plan. Common sources for geospatial information such as Google Earth, GIS databases, and aerial surveys are frequently outdated, or insufficient. This limits the effectiveness of disaster planning. Disaster Management has become an issue of growing importance. Planning for and managing large scale emergencies is complex. The number of both victims and relief workers is large and the time pressure is extreme. Emergency response and triage systems with 2D user interfaces are currently under development and evaluation. Disasters present a number of spatially related problems and an overwhelming quantity of information. 3D user interfaces are well suited for intuitively solving basic emergency response tasks. Such tasks include commanding rescue agents and prioritizing the disaster victims according to the severity of their medical condition. Further, 3D UIs hold significant potential for improving the coordination of rescuers as well as their awareness of relief workers from other organizations. This paper describes the outline of a module in a Disaster Management Course related to 3D Applications in Disaster Mitigation and Management. By doing this, the paper describes the gaps in existing systems and solutions. Satellite imageries and digital elevation data of Turkey are investigated for detecting sites prone to natural hazards. Digital image processing methods used to enhance satellite data and to produce morphometric maps in order to contribute to the detection of causal factors related to landslides, local site conditions influencing and/or experiencing earthquake damage intensity or those of tsunami and storm surge hazard sites at the coasts.																	2194-9034						2013	40-2-W2						173	177										WOS:000358415700026

A Brazilian Northeast Coast Wave Data Comparison - Radar vs Buoy	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME 32ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON OCEAN, OFFSHORE AND ARCTIC ENGINEERING - 2013 - VOL 5					32nd ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering	JUN 09-14, 2013	Nantes, FRANCE	ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div				Wave buoys are well known by its accuracy in measuring sea surface elevations while wave radars were developed later. Buoy's motions are considered direct wave measurements while microwave radars use remote sensing for tracking the sea surface. Due to sensitivity to winds, sea surface roughness, rain, etc, it is a good practice to check radar data against buoys records. Even both systems installed being 6 km apart in a deep water region offshore northeast Brazilian shelf, there were differences in wave directional spectral parameters calculated by both equipments. The wave measurements at Sergipe and Alagoas basin were in good agreement in terms of significant wave height. Hs correlation was 91% and bias was only 0.06 m. A particular behavior of radar Hs when compared to buoy Hs was overestimation in high sea states and underestimation in low ones. Tp1 correlation was 69%, bias was 0.02 s and linear regression coefficient was 0.64. The worst correlated parameter was peak direction Dp1 with 60% of correlation for E-ESE directional band. Time series matched each other and showed the typical regional wave climate with Hs 1.0-2.0 m, Tp 6-10 s and Dpi from E-ESE. The distinction between radar and the buoy directions is related to radar susceptibility to SE trade winds during Spring and Summer seasons. However, the difference did not diverge from prevailing wave regional climate.																			978-0-7918-5539-3				2013									V005T06A023									WOS:000360866100023						
J	Matsuoka, K; MacGregor, JA; Pattyn, F				Matsuoka, Kenichi; MacGregor, Joseph A.; Pattyn, Frank			Predicting radar attenuation within the Antarctic ice sheet	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												To better understand the ability of ice-penetrating radar to diagnose the subglacial environment from bed-returned power, we model the englacial radar attenuation of Antarctic ice. First, we use a one-dimensional thermo-mechanical model to evaluate the sensitivity of the depth-averaged attenuation rates to ice temperature as a function of surface accumulation rate, geothermal flux, and ice thickness. We find that attenuation is most sensitive to variations in geothermal flux and accumulation rate when the bed temperature is close to the pressure-melting point. But even if geothermal flux and accumulation rate remain fixed, attenuation can easily vary with ice thickness. Such high sensitivities show that one should not assume a uniform attenuation rate in the radar data analysis. Then, using ensembles of modeled ice temperatures with different boundary conditions, we generate multiple attenuation predictions for the Antarctic ice sheet and evaluate the resulting uncertainties. The largest contributor to uncertainty in these predictions is the geothermal flux. This uncertainty is localized within the deeper half of the ice sheet. By combining these temperature ensembles with ice-core chemistry data, we show that the sea salt adds little to the attenuation, but the contribution from acids accounts for similar to 29% (inland) to similar to 53% (coast) of the total attenuation. We conclude that improving radar diagnosis of the subglacial environment using bed-returned power requires both (1) better data-interpretation algorithms that account for attenuation variations and (2) better constraints of geothermal flux and bulk chemistry.

Remote sensing techniques can provide spatial and temporal information about seagrass habitats. Given the availability and accessibility of Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and the advanced nature of Earth Observing-1 Advanced Land Imager (ALI) and Hyperion (HYP), we compared the capability of the three 30 m resolution satellite sensors and tested regression models based on two seagrass metrics [percent cover of submerged aquatic vegetation (%SAV) and leaf area index (LAI)] for mapping and assessing seagrass habitats within a shallow coastal area along the central western coast of FL, USA. We also evaluated a water depth correction approach to create water depth-invariant bands calculated from the three sensors' data. Then a maximum likelihood classifier was used to classify the %SAV cover into two classification schemes (3-class and 5-class). Based upon the two seagrass metrics measured in the field, six multiple regression models were developed and %SAV and LAI were estimated with spectral variables derived from the three sensors to assess the seagrass habitats in mapped units. Our results indicate that the HYP sensor produced the best seagrass cover maps in the two classification schemes: 3-class [overall accuracy (OA) = 95.9%] and 5-class (OA = 78.4%) and the best % SAV and LAI estimation models [R-2 = 0.78 and 0.59, and cross-validation (CV) = 18.1% and 1.40 for %SAV and LAI, respectively] for assessing seagrass habitats. These results are likely due to the many narrow bands in the visible spectral range and rich subtle spectral information available in the HYP hyperspectral data. ALI outperformed TM (OA = 94.6% vs. 92.5% for the 3-class scheme, and OA = 77.8% vs. 66.0% for the 5-class scheme) for mapping %SAV likely due to its higher radiometric resolution. Our findings also demonstrate that the water depth correction approach was effective in mapping the detailed seagrass habitats with the data from the three sensors. The protocol developed and utilized here represents a new contribution to the existing set of tools used by researchers for documenting the amount of seagrass and which can guide future studies.

Human Impacts on Geological and Cultural Heritage in the Coastal Zone West of Alexandria to Al-Alamein, Egypt	GEOHERITAGE												A combination of remote sensing and field surveying is used to detect changes within the coastal zone west of Alexandria towards Al-Alamein. The satellite images used are Landsat Thematic Mapper and SPOT images acquired in 1984, 2003 and 2007. The results show considerable changes due to human impacts. The research reveals that seven land cover features (seawater, salt marshes, sabkha, agricultural land, road, bare land and urban land) can be identified in the Landsat data sets. The unplanned urban and agricultural growth that was detected from 1984 to 2007 has been by 309.3 and 445.4 km(2), respectively, in the vicinity of coastal areas rich in natural beauty, geological interests and cultural heritage. Most of the coastal ridge, which records Holocene shorelines and yields Neolithic pottery and bones, has been obliterated due to the increased construction of tourism and recreational facilities. Such a case was also observed for the Abu Sir ridge, where the remains of Graeco-Roman villages (e. g. Taposiris Magna) are bordered with resorts. Recently, the Bahig drain which cuts the Gebel Maryut ridge has been partially damaged. The drain cut is unique because it demonstrates outcrops of the Last Interglacial highstand (Oxygen Isotope Stage 5e). During this stage the sea level reached more than 8 m above the present level. The construction of the Marina Resort to the east has caused the accelerated erosion of the shoreline and the removal of Holocene platforms and evidence of sea-level highstands. The relevance of this northwestern coast as a geological and cultural heritage resource site is proposed.																	1867-2477	1867-2485				DEC	2012	4	4					263	274		10.1007/s12371-012-0066-0								WOS:000324991500003

The aims were (1) to discriminate diatom biofilms (from the Bacillariophyceae class) constituting microphytobenthos on any mudflat and (2) to estimate their biomass expressed in mg Chl a.m(-2) by remote sensing of poorly accessible mudflats. Due to the distinct absorption peaks of certain pigments of different microalgae classes constituting microphytobenthos, the high spectral resolution of hyperspectral images was employed in order to detect the pigment assemblage characterizing diatom biofilms. Thus, the HySpex 1600 VNIR camera was used both in the laboratory for estimating biomass under controlled conditions and in an airborne setting. 1) The mapping approach used known spectral indices (NDVI and MPBI) and new ones (I-Diatom and I-Euglenid) to characterize quickly the key pigments of two main microphytobenthos classes, for a fast selection of diatom and euglenid biofilms by two different masks. 2) The inherent spectral properties of biofilms in the 700-900 nm range were also used to calculate an original estimate of the substrate/environmental effects in each mask. 3) Biomass quantification of the diatom biofilms was finally performed by application of the microphytobenthos optical model (MPBOM). This approach was first tested on laboratory HySpex images of synthetic biofilms for which the in vitro biomass measurements by chromatography (HPLC) were available. The comparison between estimated and measured biomass values showed the reliability of the mapping approach for biomass estimation. Finally, a map of diatom biomass was obtained at the scale of the entire Bourgneuf Bay. The range of biomass variation (0-35 mg Chl a.m(-2)) was in close agreement with the biomass maps presented in previous studies. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Vertical distribution and column optical properties of aerosol plume are derived from a combination of multi-wavelength lidar and sunphotometer measurement. Aloft smoke plumes from two cases are investigated in this paper from U.S. western and south-western forest fires. The smoke source and transport pathway to the U.S. east coast are analyzed by MODIS and CALIOP imageries as well as HYSPLIT backward trajectory analysis. In both cases, the plumes have relatively high optical depth (as much as 12 at 500-nm) and Angstrom exponent of up to 1.8, but show different intrusion heights, source regions and transport process. Lidar profiling observations indicate these smoke plumes mixing downward into the planetary-boundary-layer which are coincident with increasing trends of surface PM2.5 (particulate matter, diameter < 2.5 mu m) concentrations.

Malcolmia littorea: The isolated Italian population in the European context	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION												We compared the coenological information of the only Italian population of Malcolmia littorea (L.) R. Br. with published phytosociological releves, including ones of this species, throughout its European range. With the aim of highlighting the main climatic features influencing the distribution patterns of M. littorea, we integrated coenological data with some climatic variables and considered major drivers for plant distribution at the European scale. Finally, we analysed the population extent of M. littorea in Italy, in order to assess its conservation status at regional level. The DCA analysis, performed on a matrix 139 releves x 183 species, separated the releves according to their floristic composition, showing a geographic gradient from Portugal to Mediterranean coasts, until Italy; with Mediterranean releves clearly separated from Atlantic ones as well. Along the beach-inland gradient, the analysis highlights that the species is typical of fixed dunes habitats (more inland, mainly stabilised dunes), although in the Atlantic it can also be found in mobile dunes. The analysis of climatic variables in relation to M. littorea distribution, suggested that the species is sensitive to low winter temperature and to summer drought. The only Italian population of M. littorea is subjected to many threats, due to its small dimensions (<1 ha), isolation from the rest of its distribution area, that ranges from Portugal to France (until the Camargue region) and intensive human disturbances. Using both field and remote sensing information, we showed a considerable decrease of the occupied surface in Italy, leading us to suggest that the IUCN threat category of M. littorea in Italy should be reassessed from endangered to critically endangered.

Primary productivity and nitrogen fixation by Trichodesmium spp. in the Arabian Sea	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Trichodesmium was studied with the purpose of understanding its distribution, organic production and nitrogen fixation in the Arabian Sea. Out of the 143 stations sampled, a total of 93 stations showed the presence of Trichodesmium filaments. Two species of Trichodesmium namely, T. thiebautii and T. erythraeum were found. These were distributed on the basis of the physico-chemical conditions of the Arabian Sea. This was the first time that we managed to detect and record the presence of Trichodesmium thiebautii bloom in the Arabian Sea at depths as deep as 60-70m. Total counts of Trichodesmium varied between 0 and 400737 filamentsL(-1). T. thiebautii developed in offshore waters during the fall intermonsoon, when the water temperature was around 28 degrees C and nitrate content was as low as 0.34 mu M.. After the northeast monsoon, Trichodesmium erythraeum developed in the offshore area and then spread to coastal waters. Both species of Trichodesmium together produced a total of 0.263 TgCyear(-1) and fixed a total of 0.2976TgNyear(-1) in the Arabian Sea. The study revealed that Trichodesmium was a major contributor to the organic matter productivity of the Arabian Sea during the period from November to April. The seasonality of the blooms of Trichodesmium is discussed with the help of Ocean Color Monitoring (OCM) data and biogeochemical implication of these findings in the Arabian Sea.

J	Dunhill, AM				Dunhill, Alexander M.			Problems with using rock outcrop area as a paleontological sampling proxy: rock outcrop and exposure area compared with coastal proximity, topography, land use, and lithology	PALEOBIOLOGY												Fossil specimens can be recovered easily only from exposed localities, so rock exposure area should represent a better proxy for rock availability than the frequently used outcrop (i.e., map) area. Data collected via remote sensing and GIS show that map area does not consistently correlate with exposure area in different regions. Proportional rock exposure is not geographically consistent and is influenced by a number of variables that are independent of outcrop area, including proximity to the coast, elevation, bedrock age, land use and lithology. These variables appear to be non-independent in their influence on rock exposure, and are not consistent in their effects across continents. The inconsistency in the correlation between outcrop and exposure area, and the variability in the influence of different factors on rock exposure, suggests that using outcrop area as a sampling proxy is poorly supported. The weaknesses in using outcrop area as a sampling proxy, highlighted by the lack of correlation with exposure area, suggest that a single accurate global sampling proxy may never be attained and it is premature to assume that paleodiversity curves can be corrected using such proxies. It is therefore preferable to work on a regional scale, comparing regional fossil collection data with a number of proxies representing all aspects of sampling. The lack of correlation between outcrop and exposure area suggests that the covariance detected between outcrop area and paleodiversity might be better explained by a common-cause model, and that geological megabiases may not have had as profound an effect on paleodiversity curves as previously thought.																	0094-8373	1938-5331				WIN	2012	38	1					126	143		10.1666/10062.1								WOS:000299063400008

The process of rural migration to urban centers and the disorderly occupation of natural environments by these populations from endemic areas have favored expansion of schistosomiasis to locations that had been considered to be disease-free. Based on environmental changes that have occurred in consequent to an occupation and urbanization process in the locality of Porto de Galinhas, the present study sought to identify the relationship between those chances, measure by remote-sensing techniques, and establish a new endemic area for schistosomiasis on the coast of Pernambuco State - Brazil. Methods: To gather prevalence data, two parasitological census surveys were conducted (2000 and 2010) using the Kato-Katz technique. Two malacological surveys were also conducted in the same years in order to define the density and infection rate of the intermediate host. Based on these data, spatial analyses were done, resulting in maps of the risk of disease transmission. To ascertain the environmental changes that have occurred at the locality, images from the QuickBird satellite were analyzed, thus resulting in land use maps. Results: Over this 10-year period, the foci of schistosomiasis became more concentrated in the Salinas district. This area was considered to be at the greatest risk of schistosomiasis transmission and had the highest prevalence rates over this period. The study illustrated that this was the area most affected by the environmental changes resulting from the disorderly urbanization process, which gave rise to unsanitary environments that favored the establishment and maintenance of foci of schistosomiasis transmission, thereby consolidating the process of expansion and endemization of this parasitosis.

Towards a process-based model to predict dune erosion along the Dutch Wadden coast	NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES-GEOLOGIE EN MIJNBOUW												An equilibrium dune-erosion model is used every six years to assess the capability of the most seaward dune row on the Dutch Wadden islands to withstand a storm with a 1 in 10,000 probability for a given year. The present-day model is the culmination of numerous laboratory experiments with an initial cross-shore profile based on the central Netherlands coast. Large parts of the dune coast of the Wadden islands have substantially different dune and cross-shore profile characteristics than found along this central coast, related to the presence of tidal channels, ebb-tidal deltas, beach-plains and strong coastal curvature. This complicated coastal setting implies that the predictions of the dune-erosion model are sometimes doubtful; accordingly, a shift towards a process-based dune-erosion model has been proposed. A number of research findings based on recent laboratory and field studies highlight only few of the many challenges that need to be faced in order to develop and test such a model. Observations of turbulence beneath breaking waves indicate the need to include breaking-wave effects in sand transport equations, while current knowledge of infragravity waves, one of the main sand transporting mechanisms during severe storm conditions, is strongly challenged by laboratory and field observations on gently sloping beaches that are so typical of the Wadden islands. We argue that in-situ and remote-sensing field observations, laboratory experiments and numerical models need to be the pillars of Earth Scientific research in the Wadden Sea area to construct a meaningful process-based dune-erosion tool.																	0016-7746	1573-9708				NOV	2012	91	3					357	372										WOS:000311601200006

EVALUATING HABITAT-ASSOCIATION MODELS FOR THE SALTMARSH SPARROW	CONDOR												Habitat models that associate organisms with features of their environment can help identify areas for planning conservation strategies. These models, however, should be tested with new data before their conclusions are widely accepted. The Saltmarsh Sparrow (Ammodramus caudacutus) is a species of growing conservation concern along the Atlantic coast of North America. In a previous study, we developed models for Saltmarsh Sparrow presence and nesting habitat. Sparrow occupancy was best predicted from raw reflective properties of marshes derived from remote sensing, whereas sparrow nesting was best predicted from a classification of marsh plant communities. To test these models, we surveyed a stratified random sample of sites for which the probability of sparrow presence had been predicted and compared the observations to the predicted probability of presence and nesting generated from the models. The models' performance, assessed by the area under a receiver-operating characteristic curve and the deviance of observations from the models' predictions, was significantly better than expected by chance alone. Because sparrows are predicted to occur in many places where they are unlikely to nest, monitoring sparrow presence alone will not identify areas important for their nesting.																	0010-5422					NOV	2012	114	4					856	864		10.1525/cond.2012.110197								WOS:000311882700020

Discrimination of seagrass species and cover classes with in situ hyperspectral data. Journal of Coastal Research, 28(6), 1330-1344. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Seagrass habitats support a variety of ecosystem functions and an increasing interest has emerged for utilizing remote sensing to acquire information on the spatial extent and abundance of seagrass vegetation. Here we report on hyperspectral data collected from a combined laboratory and field-based study to examine the spectral qualities of seagrass species and evaluate whether seagrass species and levels of seagrass cover could be distinguished using true in situ hyperspectral data collected by a spectrometer overlying sea-grass-dominated vegetation in a shallow water setting in the central west coast of Florida. We also analyzed hyperspectral data measured in the lab to compare with those from in situ collections. Using a set of 97 field measurements we compared spectra qualities for different seagrass species, levels of seagrass cover, water depths, and substrate types over wavelengths 400-800 nm, using spectral data preprocessing and data transformation. Optimal wavelengths for identifying seagrass species and levels of seagrass cover were determined by two-sample t-tests. We also utilized principal component analysis (PCA) on spectra to evaluate if a set of first five PCs could be used to discriminate effectively among seagrass species and levels of seagrass cover. The experimental results indicate that the best accuracies for identifying species were produced with the data set of the second -derivative normalized spectra. The optimal wavelengths were 450, 500, 520, 550, 600, 620, 680, and 700 nm, most of which are related to the peaks of reflectance and absorption bands by photosynthetic and accessory pigments. A set of five optimal bands produced higher accuracies for identifying seagrass species (overall accuracy = 73% and average accuracy = 75%) compared with those from use of PCA. Data preprocessing techniques were demonstrated to be effective for improving discriminant accuracies of species and levels of seagrass cover.																	0749-0208					NOV	2012	28	6					1330	1344		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-11-00229.1								WOS:000311873100002

Integration of optical and acoustic remote sensing data over the backshore foreshore nearshore continuum: a case study in Ostend (Belgium). Journal of Coastal Research, 28(6), 1426-1436. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. This research addresses the possibilities of the combined use of airborne hyperspectral imaging spectroscopy, airborne laser scanning, and seaborne sonar to study the sediment dynamics in the back-, fore-, and nearshore continuum. In May 2009, airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and hyperspectral data were acquired at low tide of the beach in Ostend, Belgium. In June 2009, seaborne side-scan sonar and single- and multibeam depth and backscatter data were acquired in the nearshore part of the Ostend coastal area at high tide. Both LiDAR and single- and multibeam data were used to create a topographic reference of the back- to nearshore continuum, with an average vertical accuracy of 10 cm. This reference framework was used, in combination with historical data, to study the morphological evolution over the last few years. Hyperspectral data, optionally combined with LiDAR-derived intensity, slope, and elevation data, were used for sedimentological mapping of the back- and foreshore area. Both multibeam backscatter and side-scan sonar data were used to produce a sedimentary surface fades map of the nearshore area. Because no automatic classification of subtle seabed gradients is yet available, the data were manually screened to produce 12 sedimentary classes. Subsequently, the airborne- and seaborne-derived maps were combined to construct an integrated sedimentological and morphological map of the entire area. This was used to interpret and formulate statements about the sediment dynamics of the area.

Sub-surface small-scale eddy dynamics from multi-sensor observations and modeling	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The study of mesoscale and submesoscale [hereafter (sub)mesoscale] hydrodynamic features is essential for understanding thermal and biogeochemical exchanges between coastal areas and the open ocean. In this context, a glider mission was conducted in August 2008, closely co-located and almost simultaneously launched with a JASON 2 altimetric pass, to fully characterize the currents associated with regional (sub)mesoscale processes regularly observed to the north of Mallorca (Mediterranean Sea). A synoptic view from satellite remote-sensing fields, before and during the glider mission, provided a descriptive picture of the main surface dynamics at the Balearic Basin scale. To quantify the absolute surface geostrophic currents, the coastal altimetry-derived current computation was improved and cross-compared with its equivalent derived from glider measurements. Model simulations were then validated both qualitatively and statistically with the multi-sensor observations. The combined use of modeling and multi-sensor observational data reveals the baroclinic structure of the Balearic Current and the Northern Current and a small-scale anticyclonic eddy observed northeast of the Mallorca coast (current similar to 15 cm/s, <30 km in extent and >180 m deep). This mesoscale structure, partially intercepted by the glider and along-track altimetric measurements, is marked by relatively strong salinity gradients and not, as is more typical, temperature gradients. Finally, the use of the validated model simulation also shows that the geostrophic component of this small-scale eddy is controlled by sub-surface salinity gradients. We hypothesize that this structure contains recently modified Atlantic water arriving from the strait of Ibiza due to a northerly wind, which strengthens the northward geostrophic circulation.

The filament dynamics and potential impact on the cross-shelf exchange budget are investigated based on a combined use of remote sensing imagery, in situ data and numerical modelling. The complexity of these phenomena is shown by focusing on four distinct events that led to cross-shelf transport, each representative of a different dynamic process and a distinct expected impact on the coastal area. A systematic analysis of available observations for the years 1998-2006 underlines the role of the interplay of atmospheric freshwater fluxes, river loads and wind stress variations, which may create favourable conditions for the convergence of shelf waters (particularly at coastal capes) and the subsequent formation of short-lived filaments along the coast. The response of the buoyant coastal waters to periods of wind reversal and fluctuating freshwater discharge rates is examined through idealised Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) simulations. The filaments observed in remote sensing imagery were well reproduced by the numerical exercise, where the filaments appear as organised submesoscale structures that possess high relative vorticity and develop at the river mouths or adjacent capes. In both scenarios, the filaments appear largely determined by (i) the presence of a buoyancy anomaly, (ii) the angle between the wind pulse direction and the coast and (iii) irregularities in the coastal profile. The ensemble of results suggests that the occurrence of such transient, intense structures may contribute considerably to the biological variability and cross-shelf exchange in coastal areas with similar traits.

SAR observations of internal solitary waves generated at the Estremadura Promontory off the west Iberian coast	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												A comprehensive dataset of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from the west Iberian coast is used to identify the Estremadura Promontory as an oceanic hotspot for internal solitary waves. The full two-dimensional structure and the main physical properties of these waves are revealed for the first time. Composite maps and a statistical analysis show that these waves have two main propagation paths coming from the northern and southern slopes of the promontory, and that on average they have horizontal scales of the order of 400 m and crestlengths around 9 km. The overall propagation of the internal solitary wave field observed in the SAR images is evaluated, using a proxy measure for energy based on observed wavelengths, crestlengths and radar backscatter intensities. A refraction pattern is found to divert the meridionally propagating waves to the east, where they eventually dissipate in the inner-shelf regions close to shore. The barotropic body force is calculated and the most likely generation locations are identified. It is found that there is more energy emanating from the south while the tidal forcing seems to be equally divided between both flanks of the promontory. Calculations using the vertical excursion inverse Froude number (defined by Legg and Klymak, 2008) indicate that this is probably related to the steeper slopes located in the northern side. This pronounced bathymetry is more likely to generate internal hydraulic jumps and overturning, which may inhibit the disintegration of the internal tide into solitary waves. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Veitch, SA; Nettles, M				Veitch, Stephen A.; Nettles, Meredith			Spatial and temporal variations in Greenland glacial-earthquake activity, 1993-2010	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Glacial earthquakes are anomalous earthquakes associated with large ice-loss events occurring at marine-terminating glaciers, primarily in Greenland. They are detectable teleseismically, and a proper understanding of the source mechanism may provide a remote-sensing tool to complement glaciological observations of these large outlet glaciers. We model teleseismic surface-wave waveforms to obtain locations and centroid-single-force source parameters for 121 glacial earthquakes occurring in Greenland during the period 2006-2010. We combine these results with those obtained by previous workers to analyze spatial and temporal trends in glacial-earthquake occurrence over the 18-year period from 1993-2010. We also examine earthquake occurrence at six individual glaciers, comparing the earthquake record to independently obtained observations of glacier change. Our findings confirm the inference that glacial-earthquake seismogenesis occurs through the capsize of large, newly calved icebergs. We find a close correspondence between episodes of glacier retreat, thinning, and acceleration and the timing of glacial earthquakes, and document the northward progression of glacial earthquakes on Greenland's west coast over the 18-year observing period. Our results also show that glacial earthquakes occur when the termini of the source glaciers are very close to the glacier grounding line, i.e., when the glaciers are grounded or nearly grounded.

This work extends the previous observations of the much stronger 2011 Japan tsunami. The distance offshore at which the tsunami can be detected, and hence the warning time provided, depends primarily on the bathymetry: the wider the shallow continental shelf, the greater this time. The weak Indonesia tsunamis were detected successfully in spite of the narrow shallow-water shelf offshore from the radar systems. Larger tsunamis could obviously be detected further from the coast. This paper provides further confirmation that radar is an important tool to aid in tsunami observation and warning.																	2072-4292					OCT	2012	4	10					2944	2956		10.3390/rs4102944								WOS:000313914100004

Based on the high-resolution in situ and remote sensing data, this study examined in details the spatial patterns of phytoplankton biomass and primary production in the coast of NWSCS in summer and discussed the underline physical processes involved. The results suggested that the southwesterly monsoon wind induced coastal upwelling is the major mechanism for the relatively high phytoplankton biomass and primary production found in the coastal area. However, the waters off the ELP have relatively higher phytoplankton biomass than that off the eastern Hainan Island (EHI). This is probably due to the topography- and eddy-driven enhancement of nutrient supply and light availability along the ELP. A small but distinguishably high biomass/productivity area was found at the east side of the Qiongzhou Strait. This eddy-shaped feature appears to be separated from the larger high productivity area near the Qiongzhou Strait, and is likely caused by the interaction of multiple dynamical processes including coastal upwelling, topographically-induced double eddy circulation, the YCC and associated large-scale cold eddy, and possibly the tidal mixing in this area. The YCC tends to inhibit phytoplankton growth and thus depresses the surface phytoplankton biomass in the near-shore waters of the ELP, mainly through the stratification-induced nutrient limitation (primarily phosphorous limitation). Overall, the interaction of physical processes between wind-induced upwelling, coastal current and tidal-shoaling mixing as well as eddy upwelling are key drivers regulating the horizontal and vertical distribution of phytoplankton biomass and productivity in the NWSCS.

Coastal vulnerability assessment for Chennai, east coast of India using geospatial techniques	NATURAL HAZARDS												The study area is 56-km coastal zone of Chennai district of the Tamil Nadu state, southeast coast of India. The coastline, which includes tourist resorts, ports, hotels, fishing villages, and towns, has experienced threats from many disasters such as storms, cyclones, floods, tsunami, and erosion. This was one of the worst affected area during 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and during 2008 Nisha cyclone. The present study aims to develop a Coastal Vulnerability Index for the Chennai coast using eight relative risk variables to know the high and low vulnerable areas, areas of inundation due to future SLR, and land loss due to coastal erosion. Both conventional and remotely sensed data were used and analyzed with the aid of the remote sensing and geographic information system tools. Zones of vulnerability to coastal natural hazards of different magnitude (high, medium, and low) are identified and shown on a map. Coastal regional elevation, near-shore bathymetry, and socio-economic conditions have been considered as additional important variables. This study revealed that 11.01 km of the coastline has low vulnerability, 16.66 km has medium vulnerability, and 27.79 km is highly vulnerable in the study area, showing the majority of coastline is prone to erosion. The map prepared for the Chennai coast can be used by the state and district administration involved in the disaster mitigation and management plan and also as a tool in planning a new facility and for insurance purpose.																	0921-030X					OCT	2012	64	1					853	872		10.1007/s11069-012-0276-4								WOS:000308329900045

Considered MLP products are chlorophyll a concentration (Chl-a), absorption by yellow substance at 412 nm (a(ys)(412)) and concentration of total suspended matter (TSM), all determined from spectral remote sensing reflectance R-RS. Investigated oceanographic regions comprise the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, the northern Adriatic Sea, the Westem Black Sea and the Baltic Sea. The in situ measurements applied in the study were produced within the framework of the Coastal Atmosphere and Sea Time Series (COASTS) and Rio-Optical Mapping of Marine Properties (BiOMaP) programs contributing to a unique dataset that represents different water types including chlorophyll a, yellow substance and sediment dominated waters. Performance analysis of the proposed regional MLPs indicates that Chl-a can be quantified with the highest accuracy in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea (with absolute percent difference of 14% with respect to in situ measurements). In the case of a(ys)(412), the most accurate determination is observed for the Baltic Sea waters (13%). Instead, TSM retrieval is the most accurate in the Black Sea (14%). The study demonstrated the limited generalization capability of regional algorithms. Within this context, saturation of MLP output occurring with input data not statistically represented in the training set has been investigated through cross-basin product analysis in view of proposing a practical solution to the problem.

Applied to sea surface temperature (SST), we propose a method for the characterization of this geometric regularity from curvature-based statistics along temperature level lines in front regions. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed descriptors, we used six years (from 2003 to 2008) of daily SST observations of the regions of Agulhas in the South of Africa and of Malvinas off the southern Brazilian coast. These experiments stress the relevance of geometric regularity features of tracer observation at ocean surface to characterize seasonal variations in ocean regimes.

InSAR Study of Shoreline Change along the Damietta Promontory, Egypt	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Shoreline erosion has been a major problem in the Nile Delta since the full damming of the Nile River in 1970, especially along the two Nile promontories (Rosetta and Damietta). Synthetic aperture radar interferometric (InSAR) data acquired by the European remote-sensing satellites (ERS-1 and ERS-2), spanning 1993-2000, were utilized in this study to (1) identify the erosion/accretion pattern along the Damietta Promontory shoreline, (2) monitor the evolution of the accretionary spit on the E side of the promontory, and (3) investigate the effect of protective structures established in multiple stages since 1991. The tandem coherence of InSAR was found to be a powerful tool for delineating the water/land boundary with very high precision. Four locations along the promontory shoreline experienced substantial erosion, with average rates of -9, -39, -17, and -11 m yr(-1). Local accretion occurred at the W and E flanks of the promontory, with average rates of +12 and +36 m yr(-1), respectively. The sandy spit increased in width by about 36 m yr(-1) and migrated laterally to the SE at an average rate of 120 m yr(-1). Shoreline instability during 1993-2000 implies that the established defensive structures have not been sufficient to cease erosion completely. As the promontory shoreline has not been armored with further protection since 2000, the identified erosional locations at the promontory flanks still require protection and monitoring to help mitigate the impact of shoreline retreat and its environmental consequences.																	0749-0208					SEP	2012	28	5					1263	1269		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-11-00182.1								WOS:000308774400026						
J	Deroin, JP; Wade, S; Dia, A				Deroin, Jean-Paul; Wade, Souleye; Dia, Abdoulaye			Impacts of breaching on a bar-built estuary, example of the Senegal River new mouth monitored with satellite imagery from 2003 to 2010	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR GEOMORPHOLOGIE												This paper presents the results of a survey of an estuary in Senegal since a human-induced breach was opened in a bar at the mouth of the embayment in October 2003 to reduce the effect of a major flood event. The evolution of the new mouth's width has been analysed using a Landsat time series of 94 scenes, covering the period 2003-2010. This series is complemented by recent high resolution Alos-PRISM data, and very high resolution Ikonos data. The survey indicates a rapid opening of the new mouth in the first days after the breaching (270 m wide after 10 days) and during the first three years (about 1,900 m wide in September 2006). Then, a strong shortening of the mouth appears (689 m wide in April 2007). The next evolution shows a relatively regular widening of the mouth with limited shortening events during high-water periods (autumn 2007, 2008, and 2009). In May 2010, the mouth was 2,400 m wide and then slightly decreased to 2,145 m wide on September 15, 2010. The general trend is the opening of the mouth with an average of about 300 m per year since the breaching. The effect of the high flow period (August to November) seems to shorten the mouth width but with various amplitudes, 1,210 m in 2006, only 215 m in 2008. During this period the northern sandbar is more or less north-south oriented. In contrast, during the dry season when the littoral drift dominates, the mouth width generally increases except in 2007. The main part of the widening is due to the erosion of the southern part of the mouth (about 2,300 m). The northern part is barely affected because it is regularly fed with sand transported by the littoral drift. The erosion of the southern part results in a NNE-SSW oriented coastline showing also the important effect of the littoral drift. The most recent observations show that the evolution of the mouth will probably change in the near future. The opening of the new mouth in 2010 has been stopped for the first time since the breaching. New changes are now visible such as the natural breaching of Babagueye Island formed in February 2010 in front of the new mouth. All these major changes also induced large-scale ecological and human effects. The direct impact of the new breach on flood mitigation remains unknown. If Saint-Louis City seems less subject to recurrent river flooding by overflow, flooding by stagnation of water from precipitation remains worrying.																	0372-8854					SEP	2012	56	3					351	370		10.1127/0372-8854/2012/0072								WOS:000308282500005

However, the availability of suitable substrata differed significantly on a latitudinal scale; 60% of the available spawning area was north of 67 degrees N. However, the spatial distribution of larvae indicated that the bulk of the adult population wintering off northern Norway in the period 1998-2007 migrated farther south and upstream to spawn. This suggests benefits attributable to extra costs accompanying the spawning migration. To test whether southern spawning is beneficial with regard to overlap between herring larvae and their prey, remotely sensed chlorophyll a data from SeaWiFS were used as a proxy for the onset of phytoplankton bloom (OSB) in discrete bins along the Norwegian coast and linked to interannual variation in the observed average timing of larval hatching during the years 1998-2007. There was a delay in OSB with increasing latitude of 37 d within the spawning habitat of NSS herring. Overlap between larval hatching and OSB was clearly highest in the south, suggesting that match with prey availability may be an important factor in the selection of spawning grounds by NSS herring.																	1054-3139					SEP	2012	69	7					1298	1302		10.1093/icesjms/fss083								WOS:000308012000019

Assessment of AHS (Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner) sensor to map macroalgal communities on the Ria de vigo and Ria de Aldan coast (NW Spain)	MARINE BIOLOGY												Ria de Vigo and Ria de Aldan have high biological richness that is reflected in the number of environmental protection areas like the Atlantic Islands National Park and five places of community interest. Benthic algal communities play an important role in these ecosystems due to their ecological functions and support a great part of this biological richness. We tested by means of bio-optical modelling and Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS) images to what extent remote sensing could be used to map these communities in Ria de Vigo and Ria de Aldan (NW Spain). Reflectance spectra of dominating macroalgae groups were modelled for different water depths in order to estimate the separability of different bottom types based on their spectral signatures and the spectral characteristics of the AHS. Our results indicate that separation between three macroalgae groups (green, brown and red) as well as sand is possible when the bottoms are emerged during low tide. The spectra differences decrease rapidly with increasing water depth. Two types of classifications were carried out with the three AHS images: maximum likelihood and spectral angle mapper (SAM). Maximum likelihood showed positive results reaching overall accuracy percentages higher than 95 % and kappa coefficients higher than 0.90 for the bottom classes: shallow sand, deep sand, emerged rock, emerged macroalgae and submerged macroalgae. Sand and algae substrates were then separately analysed with SAM. These classifications showed positive results for differentiation between green and brown macroalgae until 5 m depth and high differences between all macroalgae and sandy substrate. However, differences between red and brown macroalgae are only detectable when the algae are emerged.

J	Pleskachevsky, AL; Lehner, S; Rosenthal, W				Pleskachevsky, Andrey L.; Lehner, Susanne; Rosenthal, Wolfgang			Storm observations by remote sensing and influences of gustiness on ocean waves and on generation of rogue waves	OCEAN DYNAMICS												The impact of the gustiness on surface waves under storm conditions is investigated with focus on the appearance of wave groups with extreme high amplitude and wavelength in the North Sea. During many storms characterized by extremely high individual waves measured near the German coast, especially in cold air outbreaks, the moving atmospheric open cells are observed by optical and radar satellites. According to measurements, the footprint of the cell produces a local increase in the wind field at sea surface, moving as a consistent system with a propagation speed near to swell wave-traveling speed. The optical and microwave satellite data are used to connect mesoscale atmospheric turbulences and the extreme waves measured. The parameters of open cells observed are used for numerical spectral wave modeling. The North Sea with horizontal resolution of 2.5 km and with focus on the German Bight was simulated. The wind field "storm in storm," including moving organized mesoscale eddies with increased wind speed, was generated. To take into account the rapid moving gust structure, the input wind field was updated each 5 min. The test cases idealized with one, two, and four open individual cells and, respectively, with groups of open cells, with and without preexisting sea state, as well the real storm conditions, are simulated. The model results confirm that an individual-moving open cell can cause the local significant wave height increase in order of meters within the cell area and especially in a narrow area of 1-2 km at the footprint center of a cell (the cell's diameter is 40-90 km). In a case of a traveling individual open cell with 15 m center dot s(-1) over a sea surface with a preexisting wind sea of and swell, a local significant wave height increase of 3.5 m is produced. A group of cells for a real storm condition produces a local increase of significant wave height of more than 6 m during a short time window of 10-20 min (cell passing). The sea surface simulation from modeled wave spectra points out the appearance of wave groups including extreme individual waves with a period of about 25 s and a wavelength of more than 350 m under the cell's footprint. This corresponds well with measurement of a rogue wave group with length of about 400 m and a period of near 25 s. This has been registered at FiNO-1 research platform in the North Sea during Britta storm on November 1, 2006 at 04:00 UTC. The results can explain the appearance of rogue waves in the German Bight and can be used for ship safety and coastal protection. Presently, the considered mesoscale gustiness cannot be incorporated in present operational wave forecasting systems, since it needs an update of the wind field at spatial and temporal scales, which is still not available for such applications. However, the scenario simulations for cell structures with appropriate travel speed, observed by optical and radar satellites, can be done and applied for warning messages.																	1616-7341					SEP	2012	62	9					1335	1351		10.1007/s10236-012-0567-z								WOS:000308345600005

Greg			Spatial and temporal statistics of sea surface temperature and chlorophyll fronts in the California Current	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The statistics of sea-surface fronts detected with the automated histogram method were studied in the California Current using sea-surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl) images from various satellite sensors. Daily maps of fronts were averaged into monthly composites of front frequency (FF) spanning 29 years (19812009) for SST and 14 years (19972010) for Chl. The large-scale distributions of frontal frequency of both SST (FFsst) and of Chl (FFchl) had a 500700 km wide band of elevated values (47) along the coast that roughly coincided with the area of increased mesoscale eddy activity. FFsst and FFchl were positively correlated at monthly and seasonal frequencies, but the year-to-year variations were not significantly correlated. The long-period (1 year and longer) variability in FFsst is influenced by the large-scale SST gradient, while at shorter timescales the influence of the Coastal Upwelling Index is evident. In contrast with FFsst, FFchl variability is less related to the coherent large-scale forcing and has stronger sensitivity to local forcings in individual areas. Decadal-scale increasing trends in the frequency of both SST and Chl fronts were detected in the Ensenada Front area (general area of the A-Front study) and corresponded to, respectively, trends towards colder SST and increasing chlorophyll-a concentration.

On June 13, 2011, around Qingdao, China, the world's first Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) detected an enormous bloom of floating green algae, which originated from the nearshore Subei Bank, China. The large floating green algae patches were observed along and across the Yellow Sea and in the East China Sea during 2011 summer by various oceanic cruises. To detect the massive macroalgae blooms from space, we analyzed their spectral characteristics from in situ optical measurements and satellite-derived green algae spectra. An "Index of floating Green Algae for GOCI" (IGAG) was developed from the multiple spectral band ratios using three wavelengths (555, 660, 745 nm), which the spectral response of green algae reflected at 555, 745, and 865 nm and absorbed at 660 and 680 nm. The results were compared with those obtained by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and Korea Ocean Satellite Center (KOSC) approaches. An advantage of the IGAG method was that muted or subtle signals of floating green algae were enhanced and separated from surrounding complex water signals. Although maps of floating green algae derived by the other approaches delineated dense green algae, they were less sensitive to subtle (less dense) features and in cases of nearby cloudy or complex water conditions. The floating green algae maps from IGAG provided a more robust estimate of wide floating green algae blooms than those derived using NDVI, EVI, or KOSC approaches. The IGAG approach should be useful for tracing and monitoring changes in green algae blooms on regional and global scales.																	1738-5261	2005-7172				SEP	2012	47	3					359	375		10.1007/s12601-012-0034-2								WOS:000315720600019

Characterization of space-time variability of chlorophyll, a surrogate for plankton abundance, in the northern Bay of Bengal is an essential first step to develop any methodology for predicting cholera outbreaks in the Bengal Delta region using remote sensing. This study quantifies the space-time distribution of chlorophyll, using the data from SeaWiFS, in the Bay of Bengal region using 10 years of satellite data. Variability of chlorophyll at daily scale, irrespective of spatial averaging, resembles white noise. At a monthly scale, chlorophyll shows distinct seasonality and chlorophyll values are significantly higher close to the coast than in the offshore regions. At pixel level (9 km) on monthly scale, on the other hand, chlorophyll does not exhibit much persistence in time. With increased spatial averaging, temporal persistence of chlorophyll increases and lag 1 autocorrelation stabilizes around 0.60 for 1296 km(2) or larger areal averages. In contrast to the offshore regions, spatial analyses of chlorophyll suggest that only coastal region has a stable correlation length of 100 km. Presence (absence) of correlation length in the coastal (offshore) regions indicate that the two regions may have two separate processes controlling the production of phytoplankton. This study puts a lower limit on space-time averaging of satellite measured plankton at 1296 km(2) monthly scale to establish relationships with cholera incidence in Bengal Delta.

Observation of oceanic origin of Sahel precipitation from space	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The West African Monsoon region is of great concern due to the negative ecological, economical, and societal impacts of the persistent drought. Our results support the established postulation that the onset of summer rain in the southern region is associated with the migration of the inter-tropical convergence zone and in phase with the meridional moisture transport from the Gulf of Guinea. We present recent satellite measurements that illustrate the phase shift of the precipitation in the northern region, the Sahel, with respect to the region to the south. These satellite data and associated analysis techniques let us combine the effect of the onshore flow at the surface and offshore transport aloft to demonstrate with sufficient clarity that the depth-integrated moisture advection across the west coast, from the open Atlantic Ocean into the Sahel region, is in-phase with the annual and inter-annual variations of Sahel rainfall, but out-of-phase with rainfall in the southern region around the Gulf of Guinea. The peak Sahel rainfall is associated with the short-lived net moisture influx from the Atlantic, which may interact with local instability related to the African Easterly Waves. The data show two precipitation regimes in Western Africa Monsoon region associated with moisture input from two different regions of the ocean. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Mapping results were checked and refined by the same analyst with the same set of criteria. The results show during the last 20 years urban areas in China have increased exponentially more than 2 times. The greatest area of urbanization changed from Northeastern provinces in 1990s to the Southeast coast of China in Jiangsu, Guangdong, Shandong, and Zhejiang in 2010s. Urban areas are mostly converted from croplands in China. Approximately 17750 km(2) croplands were converted into urban lands. Furthermore, the conversion from 2000 to 2010 doubled that from 1990 to 2000. During the 20 years, the most urbanized provinces are Jiangsu, Guangdong, Shandong and Zhejiang. We also analyzed built-up areas, gross domestic production (GDP) and population of 147 cities with a population of greater than 500000 in 2009. The result shows coastal cities and resource-based cities are with high economic efficiency per unit of built-up areas, resource-based cities have the highest population density, and the economic efficiency of most coastal provinces are lower than central provinces and Guangdong. The newly created urban expansion dataset is useful in many fields including trend analysis of urbanization in China; simulation of urban development dynamics; analysis of the relationship among urbanization, population growth and migration; studies of carbon emissions and climate change; adaptation of climate change; as well as land use and urban planning and management.

Influence of permafrost distribution on groundwater flow in the context of climate-driven permafrost thaw: Example from Yukon Flats Basin, Alaska, United States	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Understanding the role of permafrost in controlling groundwater flow paths and fluxes is central in studies aimed at assessing potential climate change impacts on vegetation, species habitat, biogeochemical cycling, and biodiversity. Recent field studies in interior Alaska show evidence of hydrologic changes hypothesized to result from permafrost degradation. This study assesses the hydrologic control exerted by permafrost, elucidates modes of regional groundwater flow for various spatial permafrost patterns, and evaluates potential hydrologic consequences of permafrost degradation. The Yukon Flats Basin (YFB), a large (118,340 km(2)) subbasin within the Yukon River Basin, provides the basis for this investigation. Model simulations that represent an assumed permafrost thaw sequence reveal the following trends with decreasing permafrost coverage: (1) increased groundwater discharge to rivers, consistent with historical trends in base flow observations in the Yukon River Basin, (2) potential for increased overall groundwater flux, (3) increased spatial extent of groundwater discharge in lowlands, and (4) decreased proportion of suprapermafrost (shallow) groundwater contribution to total base flow. These trends directly affect the chemical composition and residence time of riverine exports, the state of groundwater-influenced lakes and wetlands, seasonal river-ice thickness, and stream temperatures. Presently, the YFB is coarsely mapped as spanning the continuous-discontinuous permafrost transition that model analysis shows to be a critical threshold; thus, the YFB may be on the verge of major hydrologic change should the current permafrost extent decrease. This possibility underscores the need for improved characterization of permafrost and other hydrogeologic information in the region via geophysical techniques, remote sensing, and ground-based observations.																	0043-1397					JUL 27	2012	48								W07524	10.1029/2011WR011595								WOS:000306905900001

In recent years, in order to better understand this scientific accumulation-erosion budget phenomenon, CURAT (Centre Universitaire de Recherche et d'Application en Teledetection) undertook studies both in situ and from a mapping approach to assess the rate of coastal retreat on the sandy coasts of the Ivory Coast. In this study, the study changes in the morphology of the coastal area of Abidjan, the economic capital of Cote d'Ivoire, was derived from the use of the software Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) to process vertical aerial photographs, and Corona and HRG panchromatic SPOT-5 imagery to estimate the displacement of shorelines by photointerpretation. The mid-secular evolution of the coastline (beach dune contact) has been analysed over 42 years (1967-2009). We discuss the role of the destabilising developments and crises on the erosive dynamics of the coastline in the Bay of Port-Bouet, which seek a new equilibrium position by readapting its shore relative to the longshore drift. As a result, a new up drift zone has developed, resulting in a general enhancement of the concavity of the bay of Port-Bouet.																	1266-5304					JUL-SEP	2012		3					369	382										WOS:000313937400007

The TSS results obtained were compared to in situ collected TSS data. The analysis of the satellite image data set revealed that each river system exhibits a distinct turbidity plume dispersal pattern. The behavior, dimension and degree of turbidity of the Sao Francisco River plume have been greatly altered by the construction of a cascade of hydroelectric dam reservoirs in its hydrological basin. The plume has lost its typical unimodal seasonal pattern of material dispersion and its turbidity has decreased due to the regulation of river flow by the dams and TSS retainance by the reservoirs. In contrast, the Doce and Paraiba do Sul river plumes are still subject to seasonal pulsations and show more turbid conditions than the SF plume, as dams are less numerous, set in the middle river sections and the natural river flow has been maintained. The Caravelas Coastal System river plume is restricted to near shore shallow waters dominated by resuspension processes. During austral spring and summer when NE-E winds prevail, all plumes generally disperse southward. Short-term northward reversals may occur in winter with the passage of atmospheric cold fronts. The Sao Francisco and Doce river plumes tend to disperse obliquely to the coast and transport materials further offshore, while the Caravelas and Paraiba do Sul plumes tend to disperse mainly parallel to the coast, enhancing TSS retention nearshore.

Demonstration of Bistatic Radar for Ocean Remote Sensing Using Communication Satellite Signals	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												Remote sensing of ocean roughness using reflected signals from digital communication satellites is demonstrated in an airborne experiment. Transmitted data are approximated as an infinitely long sequence of random bits, which is experimentally a hypothesis confirmed for the S-band XM radio signal. On July 2, 2010, a signal recorder was flown at an altitude of 3.17 km off the coast of Virginia, collecting ocean-reflected signals from both geostationary satellites identified as "Rhythm" and "Blues," which were broadcasting the XM radio signal. Direct and reflected signals from the same channel were cross-correlated, producing a waveform that agreed well with a model generated at the 7.5-m/s wind speed reported from the Chesapeake Lighthouse. Adjusting this model to fit the experimental data produced an optimal estimate of 6 m/s. A Monte Carlo approach predicted errors of 0.5% from the simulated reflected XM radio signals and 2%-10% from simulated reflected Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS-R) signals. This improvement was attributed to the higher (similar to 30 dB) power in the XM radio signal. The availability of communication satellite transmissions, in all frequency bands used for remote sensing, opens the possibility of using signals of opportunity as low-cost alternatives to radiometry or scatterometry.																	1545-598X					JUL	2012	9	4					619	623		10.1109/LGRS.2011.2177061								WOS:000310909800017

Multiplatform Ocean Exploration: Insights From the NEEMO Space Analog Mission	MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL												Since the beginning of space exploration, methods and protocols of exploration have been developed using space analogs on Earth to reduce research costs, develop safe deployment/retrieval protocols, and ready astronauts for hostile environments in less threatening settings. Space analogs are required as much as ever today as astronauts and scientists develop new tools and techniques for exploration, while working to address evolving mission objectives from low-earth orbit to deep-space exploration. This study examines coordinated human and robotic exploration at the Aquarius Underwater Habitat off of the coast of Key Largo, Florida, in support of the NEEMO 15 (NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations) program. The exploration scheme presented in this work fuses (1) robotic precursor missions as a means of remote sensing data collection; (2) crowdsourcing to process immense amounts of data to identify key targets of interest that might be missed in the tight cycle of mission operations; and (3) human exploration to examine locations directly up close and collect physical samples that require involved sampling techniques. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and single-person submersibles, called DeepWorkers (TM), were used as underwater analogs of robotic systems currently being used and human-operated vehicles (HOVs) proposed for use on a Near Earth Asteroid (NEA), the Moon, or Mars. In addition to operational lessons learned for space exploration that are directly applicable to ocean exploration, ocean floor mapping provides new levels of detail of benthic habitat critical for coral reef monitoring and management. Opportunistic (onsite adaptive) data sampling also took place by placing self-recording instrumentation onto each of the DeepWorkers, increasing the collection of scientific information during the submersible missions and contributing to mission planning for optimal and efficient use of expensive assets.

J	Pivot, FC				Pivot, Frederique C.			C-Band SAR Imagery for Snow-Cover Monitoring at Treeline, Churchill, Manitoba, Canada	REMOTE SENSING												RADARSAT and ERS-2 data collected at multiple incidence angles are used to characterize the seasonal variations in the backscatter of snow-covered landscapes in the northern Hudson Bay Lowlands during the winters of 1997/98 and 1998/99. The study evaluates the usefulness of C-band SAR systems for retrieving the snow water equivalent under dry snow conditions in the forest-tundra ecotone. The backscatter values are compared against ground measurements at six sampling sites, which are taken to be representative of the land-cover types found in the region. The contribution of dry snow to the radar return is evident when frost penetrates the first 20 cm of soil. Only then does the backscatter respond positively to changes in snow water equivalent, at least in the open and forested areas near the coast, where 1-dB increases in backscatter for each approximate 5-10 mm of accumulated water equivalent are observed at 20-31. incidence angles. Further inland, the backscatter shows either no change or a negative change with snow accumulation, which suggests that the radar signal there is dominated by ground surface scattering (e.g., fen) when not attenuated by vegetation (e.g., forested and transition). With high-frequency ground-penetrating radar, we demonstrate the presence of a 10-20-cm layer of black ice underneath the snow cover, which causes the reduced radar returns (-15 dB and less) observed in the inland fen. A correlation between the backscattering and the snow water equivalent cannot be determined due to insufficient observations at similar incidence angles. To establish a relationship between the snow water equivalent and the backscatter, only images acquired with similar incidence angles should be used, and they must be corrected for both vegetation and ground effects.																	2072-4292					JUL	2012	4	7					2133	2155		10.3390/rs4072133								WOS:000306759700013						
J	Lin, AM; Ikuta, R; Rao, G				Lin, Aiming; Ikuta, Ryoya; Rao, Gang			Tsunami run-up associated with co-seismic thrust slip produced by the 2011 M-w 9.0 Off Pacific Coast of Tohoku earthquake, Japan	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												The 2011 M-w 9.0 Off Pacific Coast of Tohoku (Japan) earthquake generated a violent tsunami and unexpected high tsunami wave that caused great substantial damage and similar to 18,940 fatalities along the east-northeast coast of Honshu Island of Japan. Analyses of high-resolution remote sensing imagery data acquired before and after the earthquake, combined with the results of field investigations, reveal that (i) run-up height of the tsunami (i.e., the inland limit of tsunami) was spatially variable, ranging from <3 m to similar to 35 m, and (ii) large run-up heights occurred mainly in the areas between Ishinomaki (similar to 38.2 degrees N) and Miyako city (similar to 40.2 degrees N), close to the epicenter of 2011 M-w 9.0 earthquake, and showed a gradual decrease away from this region. Combined with the ground motion direction revealed by GPS and seismic data, the distribution of run-up height is consistent with that of ground displacement (calculated from GPS observations) and that of co-seismic thrusting slip on the source fault plane along the plate boundary (calculated from the seismic inversion). The results of numerical simulation of tsunami propagation show that (i) the distributions of tsunami height along the northeast Honshu coastline are constrained mainly by thrusting slip on the source fault plane; and (ii) the height of tsunami wave in special areas was strongly affected by the sawtooth geometry of the coastline.

OCEAN DYNAMICS												Observations of currents aimed to study the flow near a spawning aggregation reef, Gladden Spit off the coast of Belize, reveal unusually strong currents on 19-20 October 2009 (the current speed was over 1 m s(-1), when the mean and standard deviation are 0.2 +/- 0.12 m s(-1)). During this short time, the water level was raised by 60-70 cm above normal in one place, but lowered by 10-20 cm in another location just 2 km away. The temperature dropped by over 2A degrees C within a few hours. Analyses of local and remote sensing data suggest that a rare combination of an offshore Caribbean cyclonic eddy, a short-lived local tropical storm, and a Spring tide, all occurred at the same time and creating a "perfect storm" condition that resulted in the unusual event. High-resolution simulations and momentum balance analysis demonstrate how the unique shape of the coral reef amplified the coastal current through nonlinear flow-topography interactions. The suggested mechanism for the water level change is different than the classical wind-driven storm surge process. The study has implications for the influence of external forcing on mixing processes and physical-biological interactions near coral reefs.

The study area is located on the northwest of Turkey. It was formed on the Black Sea coast by the sediments carried by the Sakarya river. Land cover change depending on many natural and human factors. Land cover in the Sakarya river delta has a composition of different geomorphological units. The research area is involved in Euxine province of Euro-Siberian phytogeographical region. However this region is the most important area with its wetland vegetation (Acarlar Longoz). In recent years, change has been observed in the natural land cover because of the land degradation and deforestation in the region. Landsat TM, IRS and SPOT-5 satellite images are used as data between 2001-2010 period to determine this change. These images which have different spectral and spatial resolution are analyzed by using images processing techniques in ERDAS Imagine (c) 10.0 and ArcGIS (c) 10.0 software. Images are classified into three main classes and three subclasses land cover types; according to the CORINE (Coordination of Information on the Environment) Land Cover Nomenclature, Level 1-2-3 Classification. Furthermore, the image analysis results are confirmed by the field research. As a result it is found that, significant changes has been occurred on the natural land cover between the years 2001-2010 in the Sakarya river delta and its surroundings.																	1308-772X					JUL	2012	29	2					721	730										WOS:000304512900003

Two years of oceanic observations below the Fimbul Ice Shelf, Antarctica	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The mechanisms by which heat is delivered to Antarctic ice shelves are a major source of uncertainty when assessing the response of the Antarctic ice sheet to climate change. Direct observations of the ice shelf-ocean interaction are extremely scarce and in many regions melt rates from ice shelf-ocean models are not constrained by measurements. Our two years of data (2010 and 2011) from three oceanic moorings below the Fimbul Ice Shelf in the Eastern Weddell Sea show cold cavity waters, with average temperatures of less than 0.1 degrees C above the surface freezing point. This suggests low basal melt rates, consistent with remote sensing-based, steady-state mass balance estimates for this sector of the Antarctic coast. Oceanic heat for basal melting is found to be supplied by two sources of warm water entering below the ice: (i) eddy-like bursts of Modified Warm Deep Water that access the cavity at depth for eight months of the record; and (ii) fresh surface water that flushes parts of the ice base with temperatures above freezing during late summer and fall. This interplay of processes implies that basal melting at the Fimbul Ice Shelf cannot simply be parameterized by coastal deep ocean temperatures, but instead appears directly linked to both solar forcing at the surface as well as to the dynamics of the coastal current system.

C.; Greenwood, Sarah L.; Jordan, Colm; Sejrup, Hans Petter			Pattern and timing of retreat of the last British-Irish Ice Sheet	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												During the last glacial the ice sheet that subsumed most of Britain, Ireland and the North Sea attained its maximum extent by 27 ka BP and with an ice volume sufficient to raise global sea level by ca 2.5 m when it melted. We reconstruct the demise of this British-Irish Ice Sheet (BIIS) and present palaeo-glaciological maps of retreat stages between 27 and 15 ka BR The whole land area was investigated using remote sensing data and we present maps of moraines, meltwater channels, eskers, and drumlins and a methodology of how to interpret and bring them together. For the continental shelf, numerous large moraines were discovered recording an extensive pattern of retreat stretching from SW Ireland to the Shetland Isles. From an integration of this new mapping of glacial geomorphology (>26,000 landforms) with previously published evidence, compiled in the BRITICE database, we derive a pattern of retreat for the whole BIIS. We review and compile relevant dates (881 examples) that constrain the timing of retreat. All data are held within a Geographic Information System (GIS), and are deciphered to produce a best-estimate of the combined pattern and timing of retreat. Pattern information reveals an ice sheet mainly comprised of a shelf-parallel configuration from SW Ireland to NE Scotland but it spread far enough to the south to incorporate outlying ice domes over Wales, the Lake District and Kerry. Final disintegration was into a number of separate ice caps, rather than reduction as a single mass, and paradoxically, retreat was not always back to high ground. By 23 ka BP ice withdrew along its northern boundaries at the same time as the southern margins were expanding, including transient ice streaming down the Irish Sea and advances of lobes in the Cheshire Basin, Vale of York and east coast of England. Ice divides migrated south. By 19 ka the ice sheet was in crisis with widespread marine-based ice losses, particularly in the northern North Sea and the Irish Sea. Considerable dynamic-thinning occurred during this phase. Final collapse of all marine sectors occurred by 17 ka BP and with most margins beginning to back-step onshore. Disintegration of the North Sea 'ice bridge' between Britain and Norway remains loosely constrained in time but the possibility of catastrophic collapse of this sector is highlighted. The North Channel and Irish Sea ice streams had finally cleaved the ice sheet into separate Irish and Scottish ice sheets by 16 ka BP. Rates of ice loss were found to vary widely over space and time (e.g., 65-260 km(3) per year). The role of ice streams and calving losses of marine-based sectors are examined. Retreat rates of up to ca 150 ma(-1) were found for some ice stream margins. That large parts (2/3) of the BIIS were marine-based, drained by ice streams, and possibly with fringing ice shelves in places, makes it a useful analogue for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). This is especially so because the BIIS deglaciated in response to rising temperatures and a rising sea level (driven by melting of other ice masses) which are the current forcings that might cause collapse of the WAIS. Our reconstruction, when viewed from the opposite perspective, documents when fresh land became exposed for exploitation by plants, animals and Man, and records for how long such land has been available for soil and geochemical development and ecological succession.

Rapid Holocene sea-level changes along the Iranian Caspian coast	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The Caspian Sea is well-known for its rapid sea-level change. During 1929-1995, a full sea-level cycle was observed. First, the sea level dropped similar to 3 m with a lowstand in 1977, followed by a 3 m rise to 1995, after which the sea level has been relatively stable, These oscillations are a specific feature of the Caspian Sea and its sedimentary record. The main purpose of this study is to reconstruct the sea-level curve in the Holocene by using sedimentological and biostratigraphic analysis and radiiocarbon dating along the Iranian part of the Caspian shore. Remote sensing images and historical maps show that two lagoons totally emerged, and the Gorgan delta prograded rapidly at a rate of around 160 m y(-1) until the 1975 lowstand. Gorgan Bay was reduced in size considerably and the connection to the sea was blocked due to growth of a spit and change in base level. When sea level started to rise again, the coastal morphology rapidly changed and the Gorgan delta retrograded at the rate of around 140 m y(-1). These sedimentary dynamics can be recognized in the preserved deposits. In addition to the recent dynamics, core data from the southeastern lowlands show four earlier highstands. Using characteristic barrier-lagoon deposits, early Holocene sea level rose until a highstand was reached of ca. -34 m. This phase was followed by fluvial deposition in the Gorgan delta associated with a base level fall. There is also an evidence of sea-level rise between 5000 and 2300 BP at ca. -27.7 m. On top of these deposits there is evidence of a highstand between 2700 and 2300 BP at ca. -23.5 m. The fourth highstand from the core data is dated to the Little Ice Age at ca. -24 m. Data from these last two highstands correspond well with other observations from the Caspian region. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

The United States developed the National Coastal Wetlands Inventory (NCWI) to provide information on the spatial extent of the coastal wetlands. However, the NCWI has become outdated and needs to be updated for the purpose of natural resource management. Monitoring invasive species is also essential because they threaten wetland health. The overall objective of this research is to develop accurate and replicable tools for monitoring coastal wetlands in a time- and cost-effiicent manner. An integrated approach using the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI), multi-temporal Landsat satellite imagery, Soil Survey Georgraphic Database (SSURGO), National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), Light Detection and Ranging (lidar), and Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) data will be used to map wetlands. NWI, Landsat, SSURGO, and NHD data can effectively identify most wetlands, but they sometimes miss vegetated wetlands. Lidar and radar data will be incorporated to reduce these omission errors and improve the overall classification accuracy of wetland delineations. Maximum likelihood, a decision tree analysis, or object-based classification will be applied to the various combinations of data. The least expensive method of wetland delineation with the highest accuracy will be determined and proposed for national implementation. Mixture-tuned mathced filtering on hyperspectral data will be used to map common reed (Phragmites australis, Cav.) an invasive species on the U.S. East Coast. Results of this research will provide remote sensing strategies for updating coastal wetlands inventories every 5 to 10 years with improved classification accuracy. These strategies are more efficient than the traditional approaches of aerial image interpretation and field surveys. The wetlands inventory data from this research will provide the information needed by natural resource managers to protect and conserved wetlands.				chen, zhu/K-5923-2013													0099-1112					JUN	2012	78	6					537	547										WOS:000304791200009						
J	Han, H; Lee, H				Han, Hyangsun; Lee, Hoonyol			Inter-satellite atmospheric and radiometric correction for the retrieval of Landsat sea surface temperature by using Terra MODIS data	GEOSCIENCES JOURNAL												Thermal infrared images of Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-7 ETM+ sensors have been unrivalled sources of high resolution thermal remote sensing (120 m for TM and 60 m for ETM+) for more than two decades. As the sensors have only one thermal channel, however, the correction of atmospheric effect has been virtually limited, degrading the accuracy of sea surface temperature (SST) measurement. Launched in 1999, MODIS sensor onboard Terra satellite is equipped with two thermal channels that can provide accurate atmospheric correction at 1 km resolution. In this paper we propose an inter-satellite calibration method to correct the radiometric and atmospheric effect of Landsat brightness temperature by using the atmospherically corrected Terra MODIS SST which lags Landsat pass by 30 minutes only. Comparison of the corrected Landsat SST with in situ SST near the coast of South Korea showed a significant improvement in root mean square error from 2.31 degrees C before the correction to 0.96 degrees C after the correction. Errors from spatial and temporal inhomogeneities over 1 km X 1 km window could be masked out by identifying negative correction term and applying a root mean square deviation criterion between Landsat and MODIS SSTs.

Sage			Evaluation of two algorithms for a network of coastal HF radars in the Mid-Atlantic Bight	OCEAN DYNAMICS												The National High Frequency (HF) Surface Current Mapping Radar Network is being developed as a backbone system within the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System. This paper focuses on the application of HF radar-derived surface current maps to U.S. Coast Guard Search and Rescue operations along the Mid-Atlantic coast of the USA. In that context, we evaluated two algorithms used to combine maps of radial currents into a single map of total vector currents. In situ data provided by seven drifter deployments and four bottom-mounted current meters were used to (1) evaluate the well-established unweighted least squares (UWLS) and the more recently adapted optimal interpolation (OI) algorithms and (2) quantify the sensitivity of the OI algorithm to varying decorrelation scales and error thresholds. Results with both algorithms were shown to depend on the location within the HF radar data footprint. The comparisons near the center of the HF radar coverage showed no significant difference between the two algorithms. The most significant distinction between the two was seen in the drifter trajectories. With these simulations, the weighting of radial velocities by distance in the OI implementation was very effective at reducing both the distance between the actual drifter and the cluster of simulated particles as well as the scale of the search area that encompasses them. In this study, the OI further reduced the already improved UWLS-based search areas by an additional factor of 2. The results also indicated that the OI output was relatively insensitive to the varying decorrelation scales and error thresholds tested.																	1616-7341					JUN	2012	62	6					953	968		10.1007/s10236-012-0533-9								WOS:000304308500010

Detecting coral bleaching using high-resolution satellite data analysis and 2-dimensional thermal model simulation in the Ishigaki fringing reef, Japan	CORAL REEFS												In 2007, high-temperature-induced mass coral mortality was observed in a well-developed fringing reef area on the southeastern coast of Ishigaki Island, Japan. To analyze the response of the corals to thermal stress, the coral cover was examined using Quickbird data, taken across the reef flat just before and after the bleaching event and performing a reef scale horizontal 2-dimensional thermal model simulation. The Quickbird data consisted of multispectral (MSS) imagery, which had a spatial resolution of 2.4 m, and panchromatic (PAN)-fused multispectral imagery, which had a 0.6-m spatial resolution. The observed changes in coral cover implied that the delineation of partially bleached coral was more precise with PAN + MSS. The classification accuracy achieved using PAN + MSS (93%) was superior to that obtained using MSS (88%). The in situ water temperature observations and 2-dimensional thermal model simulation results indicated that the water temperature fluctuated greatly in the inner reef area in late July 2007. Different thermal stress indices, including daily average temperature, daily maximum excess temperature, and daily accumulated temperature, were examined to define a suitable index that represented the severity of the thermal stress on coral cover. The results suggested that the daily accumulated temperature that occurred during the maximum sea surface temperature period of the bleaching season provided the best predictor of bleaching. The changes in water temperature, bathymetry, and coral patch size affected the severity of bleaching; therefore, the spatial dependence of these variables was examined using Moran's I and Lagrange multiplier tests. An investigation of the effect of coral patch sizes on coral bleaching indicated that large coral patches were less affected than the small patches, which were more likely to suffer bleaching and coral mortality.

Predicting euphotic-depth-integrated chlorophyll-a from discrete-depth and satellite-observable chlorophyll-a off central California	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Predicting water column integrated phytoplankton biomass from near-surface measurements has been an important effort in marine ecological research, particularly since the advent of satellite remote sensing of ocean color. Quantitative relationships between chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl-a) at the surface and its depth-integrated magnitude have thus far only been developed for open-ocean waters. Here we develop and test for the first time an extension of open-ocean relationships into ocean-margin waters, specifically the highly productive and variable eastern boundary upwelling ecosystem off the central California coast. This region was chosen because of the unique availability of a 30-year record of ship-based Chl-a profiles measured using consistent methods. The extended relationship allows accurate prediction of integrated biomass from surface measurements. Further, we develop a new set of relationships for predicting the depth-integrated Chl-a from Chl-a measured over a range of discrete depths (i.e., as measured by fluorometers on moorings). The newly developed relationships are tested against 15,000 fluorometric Chl-a profiles obtained from an autonomous underwater vehicle. Surprisingly, the relationship between surface Chl-a and depth-integrated Chl-a holds for profiles with high concentrations of Chl-a in persistent subsurface thin phytoplankton layers (layers <3 m thick and located below the first optical depth). The results have implications for monitoring of algal blooms and for quantifying ocean primary productivity from satellite observations of ocean color.

J	Lipa, B; Isaacson, J; Nyden, B; Barrick, D				Lipa, Belinda; Isaacson, James; Nyden, Bruce; Barrick, Donald			Tsunami Arrival Detection with High Frequency (HF) Radar	REMOTE SENSING												Quantitative real-time observations of a tsunami have been limited to deep-water, pressure-sensor observations of changes in the sea surface elevation and observations of sea level fluctuations at the coast, which are essentially point measurements. Constrained by these data, models have been used for predictions and warning of the arrival of a tsunami, but to date no system exists for local detection of an actual incoming wave with a significant warning capability. Networks of coastal high frequency (HF)-radars are now routinely observing surface currents in many countries. We report here on an empirical method for the detection of the initial arrival of a tsunami, and demonstrate its use with results from data measured by fourteen HF radar sites in Japan and USA following the magnitude 9.0 earthquake off Sendai, Japan, on 11 March 2011. The distance offshore at which the tsunami can be detected, and hence the warning time provided, depends on the bathymetry: the wider the shallow continental shelf, the greater this time. We compare arrival times at the radars with those measured by neighboring tide gauges. Arrival times measured by the radars preceded those at neighboring tide gauges by an average of 19 min (Japan) and 15 min (USA) The initial water-height increase due to the tsunami as measured by the tide gauges was moderate, ranging from 0.3 to 2 m. Thus it appears possible to detect even moderate tsunamis using this method. Larger tsunamis could obviously be detected further from the coast. We find that tsunami arrival within the radar coverage area can be announced 8 min (i.e., twice the radar spectral time resolution) after its first appearance. This can provide advance warning of the tsunami approach to the coastline locations.																	2072-4292					MAY	2012	4	5					1448	1461		10.3390/rs4051448								WOS:000306757800017

Luminescence dating of fluvial and coastal red sediments in the SE coast, India, and implications for paleoenvironmental changes and dune reddening	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The Holocene and late Pleistocene environmental history of the teri ('sandy waste' in local parlance) red sands in the southeast coastal Tamil Nadu was examined using remote sensing, stratigraphy, and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating. Geomorphological surveys enabled the classification of the teri red sands as, 1) inland fluvial ten, 2) coastal teri and, 3) near-coastal teri dunes. The inland teri sediments have higher clay and silty-sand component than the coastal and near-coastal teri, suggesting that these sediments were deposited by the fluvial process during a stronger winter monsoon around >15 ka. The coastal teri dunes were deposited prior to 11.4 +/- 0.9 ka, and the near-coastal dunes aggraded at around 5.6 +/- 0.4 ka. We interpret that the coastal dunes were formed during a period of lower relative sea level and the near-coastal dunes formed during a period of higher sea level. Dune reddening is post deposition occurred after 11.4 +/- 0.9 ka for the coastal ten i dunes and after 5.6 +/- 0.4 ka for the near-coastal ten i dunes. Presence of microlithic sites associated with the coastal dunes suggest that the cultures existed in the region during 11.4 +/- 0.9 ka and 5.6 +/- 0.4 ka. (C) 2012 University of Washington.

A new, robust, and accurate method to extract tide-coordinated shorelines from coastal elevation models. Journal of Coastal Research, 28(3), 683-699. West Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. The extraction of highly accurate shoreline data is fundamental to carrying out accurate and reliable studies to enhance our understanding of coastal evolution and coastal vulnerability. In our case, shoreline extraction was needed to develop a method based on an extrapolation process because the most suitable height for datum-coordinated shoreline extraction along Spanish coastal areas turned out to be the orthometric datum origin, i.e., the origin of the vertical reference system in Spain. Because of the microtidal nature of the Mediterranean Sea, using this vertical datum is rather troublesome for remotely extracting ground points to apply to traditional shoreline-extraction methods based on interpolation procedures. Because of these difficulties, a new method for shoreline extraction, based on extrapolation from an iterative digital-elevation model, is presented in this article. The Elevation Gradient Trend Propagation method employs the local elevation gradient to estimate the shoreline position by extrapolating the slope until the zero-elevation contour, representing the modeled intersection of the vertical datum and the beach profile, is reached. The proposed methodology was tested on a Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR)-derived digital-elevation model, which comprised a coastal area of Almeria (Mediterranean Sea, south Spain). The results obtained from the new approach were compared with those provided by the widely known Cross-Shore Profile (CSP) method. A validation process was conducted for both methods to highlight their advantages and shortcomings. An alternative contour level of 0.4 m was employed as a ground truth because the zero-elevation contour was not available because LIDAR returns under the water surface were unavailable. The validation process showed that the proposed method was more robust and more suitable than CSP method was for microtidal coasts and for data that need to be extrapolated to reach the desired contour level. In addition, the influence of the starting point in applying the elevation extrapolation process was also proven.

Part I: Quality Assessment for the Second Half of 2010	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												Multi-angular images of the brightness temperature (T-B) of the Earth at 1.4 GHz are reconstructed from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite sensor data since end 2009. Sea surface salinity (SSS) products remote sensing from space is being attempted using these data over the world oceans. The quality of the first version of the European Space Agency operational Level 2 (L2) SSS swath products is assessed in this paper, using satellite/in situ SSS data match-ups that were collected over the second half of 2010. This database reveals that 95% of the SMOS L2 products show a global error standard deviation on the order of similar to 1.3 practical salinity scale. Simple spatiotemporal aggregation of the L2 products to generate monthly SSS maps at 1 degrees x 1 degrees spatial resolution reduces the error down to about 0.6 globally and 0.4 in the tropics for 90% of the data. Several major problems are, however, detected in the products. Systematically, SMOS SSS data are biased within a similar to 1500 km wide belt along the world coasts and sea ice edges, with a contamination intensity and spread varying from ascending to descending passes. Numerous world ocean areas are permanently or intermittently contaminated by radio-frequency interferences, particularly in the northern high latitudes and following Asia coastlines. Moreover, temporal drifts in the retrieved SSS fields are found with varying signatures in ascending and descending passes. In descending passes, a time-dependent strong latitudinal bias is found, with maximum amplitude reached at the end of the year. Errors in the forward modeling of the wind-induced emissivity and of the sea surface scattered galactic sources are as well identified, biasing the sss retrievals at high and low winds and when the galactic equator sources are reflected toward the sensor.

Impact of tsunami on the forest and biodiversity richness in Nicobar Islands (Andaman and Nicobar Islands), India	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Occurrences of extreme events are likely to cause major decline in global biodiversity. In one such event, on December 26, 2004 tsunami caused extensive damage and irreparable losses to the ecology and biodiversity of low-lying areas of the countries located around the Indian Ocean region. Archipelago of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, one of the richest centre of endemism and biodiversity in the Indo-Malayan region, suffered great loss of forests and coastal biodiversity owing to its closeness to the epicenter of tsunami, i.e. just off the coast of Indonesia. There is little insight into the resilience and rate of recovery pattern of tropical coastal habitats consequent to catastrophic impacts of tsunami. It's important to study the impacts of tsunami on the forest and biodiversity in order to suggest mitigation, restoration measures and long-term conservation planning. Here we have assessed the immediate after-effects of December 26, 2004 tsunami on the forests and areas prioritized for biodiversity conservation analyzing pre and post tsunami satellite imageries. The effect of topographic patterns of Island's coastal areas and their distance from the epicenter of tsunami with respect to changes in the forests and different levels of biologically rich areas modeled for prioritization for different groups of Islands in Nicobar has been studied. Great Nicobar accounted for higher proportion of total forest area damaged and submerged in Nicobar, followed by Central Nicobar and Car Nicobar. Mangroves, littoral forest, beach forest and low land swamps and Syzygium swamps were most affected. Study brings out spatially explicit scenario of damaged, submerged and lost forest areas and corresponding area statistics, vital for understanding and mitigating medium and long term effects of tsunami an extreme event.																	0960-3115					MAY	2012	21	5			SI		1267	1287		10.1007/s10531-011-0214-x								WOS:000302570400008						
J	Wilson, J; Rocha, C				Wilson, Jean; Rocha, Carlos			Regional scale assessment of Submarine Groundwater Discharge in Ireland combining medium resolution satellite imagery and geochemical tracing techniques	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												This paper sets the foundation for the use of freely available Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM +) thermal infrared (TIR) imagery in a regional scale assessment of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) to coastal waters. A comprehensive, tiered, three-step approach is proposed as the most effective and affordable means to determine the spatial extent and scale of SGD from coastal aquifers to the coastal margin. As the preliminary step, Sea Surface Temperature (SST) values derived from Landsat ETM + TIR are used to successfully detect plumes of colder water eventually associated with SGD in close proximity to the shoreline. Subsequently, potential sites of SGD are linked to geological features on land acting as possible sources, by combining within a Geographical Information System (GIS), mapped temperature anomalies with ancillary on-shore spatial datasets describing bedrock geology including aquifer fault lines. Finally, nearshore surveys mapping the activity of Rn-222 (radon) and salinity are carried out to verify the presence of SGD and provide a qualitative assessment of fresh groundwater inputs to the coastal zone. Practical application of the complete approach in the context of coastal zone management is illustrated through a case-study of the Republic of Ireland. As part of this study, over 30 previously unidentified links between aquifers on land and the sea are shown along the Irish coast, hence illustrating the tight coupling between coastal waters and groundwater inputs at an unprecedented spatial scale. The study demonstrates the potential of the combined applications of remote sensing methods and geochemical tracing techniques for a cost-effective regional-scale assessment of groundwater discharge to coastal waters.

In October 1983, a mangrove area of nearly 300 ha located on the southeastern coast of Brazil was impacted by a 3.5 million liter crude oil spill released by a broken pipeline. In order to assess the long-term effects of oil pollution on mangrove vegetation, we carried out a GIS-based multitemporal analysis of aerial photographs of the years 1962, 1994, 2000 and 2003. Photointerpretation, visual classification, class quantification, ground-truth and vegetation structure data were combined to evaluate the oil impact. Before the spill, the mangroves exhibited a homogeneous canopy and well-developed stands. More than ten years after the spill, the mangrove vegetation exhibited three distinct zones reflecting the long-term effects of the oil pollution. The most impacted zone (10.5 ha) presented dead trees, exposed substrate and recovering stands with reduced structural development. We suggest that the distinct impact and recovery zones reflect the spatial variability of oil removal rates in the mangrove forest. This study identifies the multitemporal analysis of aerial photographs as a useful tool for assessing a system's capacity for recovery and monitoring the long-term residual effects of pollutants on vegetation dynamics, thus giving support to mangrove forest management and conservation.

J	Matsushita, B; Yang, W; Chang, P; Yang, F; Fukushima, T				Matsushita, Bunkei; Yang, Wei; Chang, Peng; Yang, Fan; Fukushima, Takehiko			A simple method for distinguishing global Case-1 and Case-2 waters using SeaWiFS measurements	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Since the combinations of water constituents are different between Case-1 and Case-2 waters, bio-optical models, retrieval algorithms for water constituent concentrations and other applications in water-color remote sensing are also very dissimilar between these waters. Use of the algorithms specifically developed for Case-1 waters returns inaccurate results in Case-2 waters, and vice versa. To select an appropriate algorithm for a given water pixel, it is important to first determine whether it is a Case-1 or Case-2 water and to clarify its temporal variations. This paper presents a simple method based on the inherent optical properties (IOPs) of water bodies for discriminating global Case-1 and Case-2 waters based on satellite data. Compared with the previous methods, the newly proposed method only requires two remote-sensing reflectances at 412 and 443 nm for relative comparisons, and thus it not only can easily be implemented using satellite data but also is robust even for satellite data with imperfect atmospheric correction, unpredictable noise pixels in the images, and so on. The new method was then applied to seasonal SeaWiFS 9-km data to map the global distribution of Case-1 and Case-2 waters for each season in 2003. The results showed that more than 80% of global waters belong to the Case-1 category throughout the year, and the Case-2 waters are mainly concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere along the coasts. Both the area and distribution of Case-1 and Case-2 waters changed seasonally. By using a sub-dataset from NOMAD, it was found that when the ratio of [a(ph)(443) + a(w)(443)]/a(443) was larger (smaller) than 50%, about 70%(75%) of the samples were identified as Case-1 (Case-2) waters by the new method. Moreover, the semi-analytical algorithm GSM01 was more accurate for distinguishing Case-1 than Case-2 waters, which implies that use of the proposed method to select the appropriate remote-sensing algorithm would be important.

The system has been utilized to map ice sheet topography in Greenland and to measure sea ice freeboard and roughness in Fram Strait off the coast of Svalbard and in the Southern Ocean near McMurdo, Antarctica. The elevation measurement accuracy is found to be < 10 cm (1 sigma) when short-baseline differential GPS processing is used to position the aircraft, and IMU data are used to correct for off-nadir pointing of the LIDAR. The system is optimized to provide coincident surface topography measurements and imagery of ice sheets, glaciers, and sea ice, and it has the potential to become a widely distributed observational resource to complement manned-aircraft and satellite missions.

J	Zheng, YM; Zhang, HY; Niu, ZG; Gong, P				Zheng YaoMin; Zhang HaiYing; Niu ZhenGuo; Gong Peng			Protection efficacy of national wetland reserves in China	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN												Wetlands have the most abundant biodiversity, the highest carbon sequestration capacity, and the highest values for ecological services per unit area, of all the world's ecosystems. Practice has shown that establishing reserves is the most effective way of protecting typical ecosystems and their biodiversity, and saving rare or endangered wildlife. The Chinese government's policy is to protect wetland systems by establishing reserves that encompass a massive network of wetlands, including wetland nature reserves, internationally important wetlands, and wetland parks. Many are already established. The effect of protecting wetland nature reserves at the national level has not yet been reported. We used the latest database evaluating the protection value of wetland reserves, and remotely sensed wetland maps (1978-2008), developed by the same mapping specialists and based on the same classification system, and related environmental data, to evaluate the effects of protecting China's national wetland reserves over the last 30 years. We conclude that (i) the total area of wetland in the national wetland reserves has decreased over the last 30 years to 8152.47 km(2), and just 8% of China's net decrease in wetlands; (ii) about 79% of the 91 national wetland reserves are in a poor condition. These are generally located around the Yangtze River, Eastern Coast, the Three Rivers Source, and Southwest China. Protection measures should be undertaken urgently in these areas. Only 15% of national wetland reserves are under sound protection, and these are generally located in the upper reaches of the Songhua River; (iii) although 88% of national wetland reserves are primitive (relatively natural), implying that the site selection has been scientific, a high percentage of national wetland reserves show early warning signs of decline and require urgent attention; (iv) based on our evaluation of protection effects and pressures on ecology, we have made a priority list of national wetland reserves, and propose several protection strategies.

J	Irtem, E; Sacin, Y				Irtem, Emel; Sacin, Yener			Investigation of Lagoon lakes in Kocacay delta by using remote sensing method	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Coasts are areas that are under the influence of the interaction of the air, water and land and attract attention with the abundance of their natural resources and therefore are subjected to excessive usage. This excessive usage may disturb the sensitive balance of the coast ecosystem. In this study, the changes in Arapciftligi, Poyraz, Dalyan lakes area found in Kocacay delta located in the south coast of Marmara sea was evaluated between the periods of 2000 to 2007 with remote sensing method. These lakes, located on the shores, have a very sensitive naturally dynamic balance and very importance in terms of natural surroundings and the coastal zones management plan. It must be known the change of the lakes mentioned above area according to years. Research and applications have demonstrated the advantages of remote sensing and geographic information system techiques on river,delta, lake, lagoon lake, sensitivite areas in a lakeshore, coastal erosion etc. monitoring and management. In the study, we benefited from Erdas and Intergraph-Geomedia 6.1 image processing and GIS, and also from AutoCAD 2007 and NetCAD 4.0 computer-aided design (CAD) software. For 2000, 2001, 2005 and 2007 years (4 number) Landsat-5 TM satellite images belonging to the region were used. As a result of the study, Arapciftligi, Dalyan and Poyraz lake areas, number of islets that are seen in the lakes were given in respect to years. Arapciftligi lake shrank 29.5% in size in the years 2000 and 2007. The fact that the lake continued to get smaller in size even in periods of high precipitation may be due to the sediment flowing from the agricultural fields established close to the lake area. Dalyan and Poyraz lakes lost 60% in terms of their surface area in the years 2000 and 2007. In 2000-2001 periods, Dalyan and Poyraz lakes increased in size by 3.2%. The reason for this could be the excessive precipitation and the fact that the seawater from Marmara sea seeps into the lake. Protection of the natural balance of the lagoons can be possible by using a monitoring programme to be set in connection with a healthy, systematic and manageable data system.																	0254-8704					APR	2012	33	2		S	SI		487	492										WOS:000300857400025	23424854

Evaluation of Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS) cyclone forecasts using infrared satellite imagery	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												The Antarctic coast is an area of high cyclonic activity. Specifically, the regions of Terra Nova Bay, in the western Ross Sea, and Byrd Glacier, in the western Ross Ice Shelf, are prone to cyclone development. The United States, New Zealand, and Italian Antarctic programmes conduct extensive research activities in the region of the western Ross Sea. Due to the harsh weather conditions associated with the cyclonic systems that occur in this region and the abundant research activities in the area, it is important to be able to accurately predict the timing, location and strength of cyclones in this sector of Antarctica. This study evaluates the ability of the Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (from 2006-09) to accurately forecast cyclones in the region of the western Ross Sea by comparing the Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System forecasts to cyclones identified in infrared satellite imagery. The results indicate that the Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System is able to accurately predict the presence of cyclones about 40% of the time (at a minimum) and the presence of no cyclones about 70% of the time.

Distribution and relative abundance of humpback whales in relation to environmental variables in coastal British Columbia and adjacent waters	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Humpback whales are common in feeding areas off British Columbia (BC) from spring to fall, and are widely distributed along the coast. Climate change and the increase in population size of North Pacific humpback whales may lead to increased anthropogenic impact and require a better understanding of species-habitat relationships. We investigated the distribution and relative abundance of humpback whales in relation to environmental variables and processes in BC waters using GIS and generalized additive models (GAMs). Six non-systematic cetacean surveys were conducted between 2004 and 2006. Whale encounter rates and environmental variables (oceanographic and remote sensing data) were recorded along transects divided into 4 km segments. A combined 3-year model and individual year models (two surveys each) were fitted with the mgcv R package. Model selection was based primarily on GCV scores. The explained deviance of our models ranged from 39% for the 3-year model to 76% for the 2004 model. Humpback whales were strongly associated with latitude and bathymetric features, including depth, slope and distance to the 100-m isobath. Distance to sea-surface-temperature fronts and salinity (climatology) were also constantly selected by the models. The shapes of smooth functions estimated for variables based on chlorophyll concentration or net primary productivity with different temporal resolutions and time lags were not consistent, even though higher numbers of whales seemed to be associated with higher primary productivity for some models. These and other selected explanatory variables may reflect areas of higher biological productivity that favor top predators. Our study confirms the presence of at least three important regions for humpback whales along the BC coast: south Dixon Entrance, middle and southwestern Hecate Strait and the area between La Perouse Bank and the southern edge of Juan de Fuca Canyon.

A pure marine aerosol model, for use in remote sensing applications	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Retrievals of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and related parameters from satellite measurements typically involve prescribed models of aerosol size and composition, and are therefore dependent on how well these models are able to represent the radiative behavior of real aerosols. This study uses aerosol volume size distributions retrieved from Sun-photometer measurements at 11 Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) island sites, spread throughout the world's oceans, as a basis to define such a model for pure (unpolluted) maritime aerosol. Volume size distributions are observed to be bimodal and approximately lognormal, although the coarse mode is skewed with a long tail on the low-radius end. The relationship of AOD and size distribution parameters to meteorological conditions is also examined. As wind speed increases, so do coarse-mode volume and radius. The AOD and angstrom ngstrom exponent show linear relationships with wind speed, although with considerable scatter. Links between aerosol properties and near-surface relative humidity, columnar water vapor, and sea surface temperature are also explored. A recommended bimodal maritime model, which is able to reconstruct the AERONET AOD with accuracy of order 0.01-0.02, is presented for use in aerosol remote sensing applications. This accuracy holds at most sites and for wavelengths between 340 nm and 1020 nm. Calculated lidar ratios are also provided, and are in the range of other studies, although differ more strongly from those currently used in Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) processing.

Variability in specific-absorption properties and their use in a semi-analytical ocean colour algorithm for MERIS in North Sea and Western English Channel Coastal Waters	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Coastal areas of the North Sea are commercially important for fishing and tourism, and are subject to the increasingly adverse effects of harmful algal blooms, eutrophication and climate change. Monitoring phytoplankton in these areas using Ocean Colour Remote Sensing is hampered by the high spatial and temporal variations in absorption and scattering properties. In this paper we demonstrate a clustering method based on specific-absorption properties that gives accurate water quality products from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). A total of 468 measurements of Chlorophyll a (Chla), Total Suspended Material (TSM), specific- (sIOP) and inherent optical properties (IOP) were measured in the North Sea between April 1999 and September 2004. Chla varied from 0.2 to 35 mg m(-3). TSM from 0.2 to 75 g m(-3) and absorption properties of coloured dissolved organic material at 442 nm (a(CDOM)(442)) was 0.02 to 0.26 m(-1). The variation in absorption properties of phytoplankton (a(ph)) and non-algal particles (a(NAP)) were an order of magnitude greater than that for a(ph) normalized to Chla (a(ph)*) and a(NAP) normalized to TSM (a(NAP)*). Hierarchical cluster analysis on a(ph)*, a(NAP). and a(CDOM) reduced this large data set to three groups of high a(NAP)*-a(CDOM). low a(ph)* situated close to the coast, medium values further offshore and low a(NAP)* a(CDOM), high a(ph)* in open ocean and Dutch coastal waters. The median sIOP of each cluster were used to parameterize a semi-analytical algorithm to retrieve concentrations of Chla, TSM and a(CDOM)(442) from MERIS data. A further 60 measurements of normalized water leaving radiance (nL(w)), Chla, TSM, a(CDOM)(442) and a(NAP)(442) collected between 2003 and 2006 were used to assess the accuracy of the satellite products. The regionalized MERIS algorithm showed improved performance in Chla and a(CDOM)(442) estimates with relative percentage differences of 29 and 8% compared to 34 and 134% for standard MERIS Chla and a(dg)(442) products, and similar retrieval for TSM at concentrations >1 g(-3).

The distributions and proportions of the light absorption coefficients of major ocean color components based on two large-scale investigations in the ECS are presented, showing these features in typical summer and winter seasons. The absorption coefficient a(CDOM), a(NAP) and a(phy) of colored dissolved organic matter, non-algal particle, and pigment of phytoplankton show a decreasing trend from the coast to the outer shelf. According to the a(CDOM) distribution at 440 nm, the Changjiang River plume shows an abnormal southeastward transport. An extremely high a(NAP) value patch at 440 nm is present; in the middle coast. The chlorophyll-a-specific phytoplankton pigment absorption (a*(phy)) is much higher in winter than in summer, which may cause serious underestimated results when applying the averaged a*(phy) into remote-sensing algorithms for chlorophyll concentration retrieval. The importance of phytoplankton size was evident in outer shelf waters. The absorption of a(CDOM) (440) is a dominant component accounting for over half of the total seawater absorption in summer. The a(NAP)(440) accounts for 64% or the absorption of the ECS coastal area in winter.

This study investigated the extensive changes in beach morphology due to the earthquake and tsunami along the 15 km Northern Sendai Coast using remotely sensed data. The remote sensing analysis on the beach topography and coastal forest demonstrated the following notable characteristics of beach morphological change: erosion of the northern barrier at the mouths of the Nanakitagawa and Natorigawa Rivers; erosion at an old river channel; scour landward of the seawalls in the longshore direction; erosion and deposition in beach areas with detached breakwaters; and deposition in coastal forest areas. Linkage of the deposition in the forest areas with the damage type of coastal forests was observed. The impact of the earthquake and tsunami on the beach morphology was serious; roughly 60% of the study area was degraded by 0.2-0.5m in elevation mainly due to land subsidence, and a total of 0.4 km(2) of beach area was eroded mainly due to erosion of the northern barrier at the mouths of the Nanakitagawa and Natorigawa Rivers. This study explores the geographical changes brought on by a tremendous earthquake and tsunami, which will help to elucidate the mechanisms of coastal forest destruction, beach erosion, and their interaction during tsunami events.

Performance evaluation of the TRMM precipitation estimation using ground-based radars from the GPM validation network	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS												The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission is scheduled to fly in the year of 2013 to measure the earth's precipitation structure. Since the precipitation measurement by the GPM platform will be very similar to its predecessor, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), hence, the development of GPM algorithms to improve precipitation retrievals can be addressed through the lessons learnt from the former TRMM mission in terms of precipitation retrievals and its associated uncertainty. To support the future GPM mission, this paper assesses the performance of the TRMM precipitation estimation using ground-based radars from the GPM validation network. A total of 22 significant overpass instantaneous events from 22 different radar sites has been evaluated in view of different surface and rain type flags. The overall results show that attenuation corrected reflectivity from the TRMM precipitation radar agrees well to the measured reflectivity from ground based radars with correlation coefficients r=0.91 (without frequency adjustment) and r=0.92 (with frequency adjustment). However, the correlation decreases by 10-30%, once the reflectivity are transformed to rainfall rates. The lower correlations on the basis of precipitation estimation by the TRMM are exhibited over the coast than those of ocean and land surface terrain. Taking into account the rain type flags, the analysis shows a poor correlation during convective precipitations, in particular, those retrieved from the TRMM precipitation radar. In contrast, the combined algorithm, which utilizes both radar and microwave imager instrument on-board TRMM, outperforms throughout the analysis, yet, there is a scope to improve the precipitation retrievals.

J	Canova, F; Tolomei, C; Salvi, S; Toscani, G; Seno, S				Canova, Fabio; Tolomei, Cristiano; Salvi, Stefano; Toscani, Giovanni; Seno, Silvio			Land subsidence along the Ionian coast of SE Sicily (Italy), detection and analysis via Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) multitemporal differential SAR interferometry	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												The paper presents the results of a multi-temporal, differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) analysis aiming to identify active surface deformation phenomena in south-eastern Sicily. The study area has been chosen because of its strong seismicity, high concentration of industrial and agricultural activities, and high density of people living in the coastal area. Furthermore, the morphology, lithology and climatic features of this sector of the Hyblean foreland are suitable for an interferometric analysis, providing a high coherence over the area. The Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) multitemporal DInSAR technique was used to calculate mean ground velocity maps and displacement time series from a large data set of European Remote Sensing Satellites (ERS 12) images spanning the time period 1992-2000. The reliability of the DInSAR results was tested calculating the EastSAR and UpSAR values over two permanent global positioning system (GPS) stations in the area, and comparing them with the EastGPS and UpGPS values. The residuals between GPS and DInSAR velocities were 1 and 0.6mm/yr for the Up and East components, respectively. Four main subsiding areas, previously undetected, have been identified, corresponding with the towns of Augusta, Siracusa, Priolo, and Villasmundo. The observed deformation phenomena are located within coastal structural basins, filled with Pleistocene and Holocence deposits, except the Villasmundo land subsidence, which is located on the Hyblean plateau. The measured deformation rates reach values up to -18mm/yr in Augusta, 6mm/yr in Siracusa, 5mm/yr in Villasmundo and -4.5mm/yr in Priolo. The examination of velocity profiles, time series, and geological data allows us to relate all the detected deformation patterns primarily to groundwater over-exploitation. A multi-dimensional interpolation with kriging was performed to obtain a field subsidence map. A first-order elastic deformation model was used to simulate the peculiar features of the Villasmundo subsidence. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Remote sensing, in conjunction with geographical information systems (GIS), global positioning systems (GPS), and on-site investigations were used to map salt marsh vegetation along the entire coast. Species recognitions were checked subsequently using in situ field surveys of selected areas. Results showed that the distribution of Spartina anglica has been greatly degraded from 33,333 ha in 1981 to only 16 ha in 2007. By contrast, Spartina alterniflora had spread widely from being absent in 1981 to an area of 34,451 ha by 2007 from Liaoning Province to Guangxi Province. Nearly 94% area of the area covered by S. alterniflora is distributed in Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Fujian Provinces, representing the most highly concentrated areas in China. Knowing the current expanse of this species, including its quantity and spatial patterns, is useful for predicting the future proliferation of S. alterniflora. Coastal ecosystem health of the China coast can thus be better assessed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Application of Satellite Remote Sensing for Investigation of Suspended Sediment Dispersion Pattern in the Near Shore Region: A Case Study from the Central West Coast of India	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												NAYAK, SR.; HEGDE, V.S.; SHALINI, R.; RAJAWAT, A.S.; ALT, M.; VENKATESHWARLU, B., and RAMANA, I.V., 2012. Application of satellite remote sensing for investigation of suspended sediment dispersion pattern in the near shore region: A case study from the Central West Coast of India. Journal of Coastal Research, 28(2), 399-406. West Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Indian Remote Sensing -P4 (IRS P4) Ocean Color Monitor (OCM) data is used to understand seasonal variations in suspended sediment (SS) dispersal pattern in the near-shore waters of the Central West Coast of India. Four distinct patterns of sediment dispersion are observed. (1) During monsoon, plume-like sediment dispersion seaward is observed especially in the mouths of rivers. (2) As the monsoon progresses, there is northerly transport of sediments with anticlockwise pattern within the plumes. (3) During NE monsoon, sediment concentration is less and its transport is southward. (4) During premonsoon, SS concentration is high in the near-shore water and transport is landward. Sequential OCM data analyses indicated the influence of tidal currents, especially during premonsoon in the vicinity of the river mouths on sediments dispersion. During rising tide, sediments move into the estuary, and during falling tide they flow seaward resulting in erosion and formation of shoals. Sediment-dispersal patterns largely follow wind and wave patterns, a characteristic feature of the mesotidal coast. Presence of a number of mudflats within the estuary along with the siltation in the channels suggests that a net landward transport of sediments occur in the region.					, Ali/0000-0002-3821-6099												0749-0208					MAR	2012	28	2					399	406		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-10-00190.1								WOS:000301328700011

Multitemporal analysis of a gravel-dominated coastline in the central Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Journal of Coastal Research, 28(2), 421-441. West Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. This study assesses the stability of Arctic gravel coasts across a range of timescales, based on field and remote-sensing studies of three coastal sites near Resolute Bay, Nunavut. It considers shore-zone sensitivity to ice, wind, and wave forcing at storm-event and annual timescales within a longer-term context, including coastal emergence resulting from postglacial isostatic uplift partially counteracted by accelerating sea-level rise. Another long-term factor associated with climate change is the potential for increased seasonal depth of thaw in the beachface and nearshore. The coast in this area is ice bound on average for 10 months of the year, but the annual duration of ice cover has decreased over the past 30 years (1979-2009) by 0.95 d/y. A longer open-water season has implications for the number and timing of storm-wave events, with increased probability of storms impacting the coast later in the season when the seasonal thaw layer is approaching maximum thickness. Overall, shoreline progradation surpassed erosion in the Resolute area between 1958 and 2006, reflecting a combination of sediment supply and emergence. The coastal impacts of storms were found to be short lived and not necessarily indicative of longer-term trends. Gravel shorelines can be resilient in the face of intermittent storm impacts, but thresholds of stability in this high-latitude setting are poorly understood. If current trends of rising sea level, increasing open-water duration, and more frequent effective wave events continue, there is a heightened potential for more rapid coastal change in the region.																	0749-0208					MAR	2012	28	2					421	441		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-11-00020.1								WOS:000301328700013

In this paper we present a standalone remote video-based method that estimates wave height at the breakpoint. Individual breaking events are first identified from changes in optical properties and wave height is further derived from the optical signature at the onset of breaking. An extended validation is performed using a dense wave basin dataset. The results show the ability of the method to measure individual breaker heights (9% of mean error, 18% RMS). In addition, the unique combination of in situ and remotely sensed data allows the estimation of two other breaking-related parameters, the height-to-depth ratio and wave front face slope, which show a substantial amount of dispersion. Because nearshore video systems are rapidly spreading over world coasts, this low-cost remote breaker height estimator should encounter large interest in coastal engineering studies.

Identification of hot spots and well managed areas of Pichavaram mangrove using Landsat TM and Resourcesat-1 LISS IV: an example of coastal resource conservation along Tamil Nadu Coast, India	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												The present work is a multi-temporal satellite based study on the spatial dynamic of an important coastal habitat, the Pichavaram mangrove ecosystem, over a period of 15 years. The Pichavaram mangrove forest near Chidambaram, South India is the second largest mangrove forest in the world. Unsupervised classification, the Iterative Self Organising Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA), has been used to classify the mangrove cover into the open and dense classes. The status of the classes has been monitored using Landsat TM of 1991, 2001, and Resourcesat-1 LISS IV of 2006 satellite data. The study demonstrated that by classifying mangrove ecosystem into just the 3 classes using remote sensing data and by studying their temporal variations, it is possible to get a reasonably accurate picture of the extent and condition of the mangrove ecosystem. The total area of the Pichavaram mangrove showed a net increase of 2.51 km(2) within a span of 15 years (1991 to 2006). The hot spots that are at a risk of being degraded, and on the other hand, the mangrove areas that are well managed are identified using Geographical Information System (GIS) tools for the restoration and conservation measures.																	1400-0350					MAR	2012	16	1					1	12		10.1007/s11852-011-0162-3								WOS:000300888500001

Spatial distribution of and topographic controls on Tillandsia fog vegetation in coastal southern Peru: Remote sensing and modelling	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Fog-dependent vegetation communities (lomas) occur in disjunct populations in the coastal desert of Peru and northern Chile. Epiarenic species of Tillandsia develop characteristic metre-scale vegetation patterns which allow their distribution to be mapped in high-resolution satellite images. In combination with digital elevation models, topographic controls on their distribution are deduced. Dense Tillandsia lomas in the Pisco-Acari sector of the Peruvian coastal desert occur at elevations between 467 and 1129 in; sparse populations have a slightly wider elevation range but are spatially much more extensive. Mean slope and aspect of dense Tillandsia lomas are 3.5 degrees and 227 degrees, respectively; however, scatter is large. Modelling based on the topographic properties of mapped dense Tillandsia lomas results in a much larger surface area than actually occupied by Tillandsia, implying that there must be other limiting factors besides local topographic controls. Comparison of the modelling results with the mapped distribution in conjunction with satellite images and digital elevation models indicates that the factors which limit the actual distribution of Tillandsia are (i) distance from the coast together with regional-scale lee situations behind the Cordillera de la Costa, (ii) local lee situations behind small topographic obstacles and (iii) wind strength and/or aeolian sediment transport.

J	Eckert, S; Jelinek, R; Zeug, G; Krausrnann, E				Eckert, Sandra; Jelinek, Robert; Zeug, Gunter; Krausrnann, Elisabeth			Remote sensing-based assessment of tsunami vulnerability and risk in Alexandria, Egypt	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Tsunamis can cause catastrophic loss of life, destruction of property, engineered structures and coastal infrastructure, and they can lead to major economic losses. Even though tsunamis are relatively rare in the Mediterranean Sea, their potential danger to cities along the Mediterranean coast cannot be neglected. In order to create awareness among the potentially affected people it is important to know the risk and vulnerability of the population and infrastructure related to a possible tsunami impact. In this work a hazard, vulnerability and risk analysis for buildings in two districts of Alexandria was carried out. Relevant input parameters were derived mainly from remote sensing and field data and were analyzed with a geographical information system (GIS). Based on historical records of past tsunamis, two inundation scenarios of 5 m and 9 m were defined and modeled applying a bath-type model. The resulting tsunami building risk zone maps showed that 12% of the buildings in El Gomrok district are at high or very high risk for the 5 m scenario, while the risk for El Montazah area is low. For the 9 m scenario, on the other hand, the majority of the buildings in both districts, 56% of El Gomrok, and 60% of El Montazah, are in the high or very high risk zone. An analysis of the building use indicated that the majority of these buildings are residential and commercial types, highlighting that the potential consequences of a tsunami could be severe. Due to the scarcity of historical data no frequency could be associated with the two selected scenarios. While both are credible we consider the 5 m scenario as possible but unlikely and the 9 m scenario as unlikely. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Dupuy, S; Barbe, E; Balestrat, M				Dupuy, Stephane; Barbe, Eric; Balestrat, Maud			An Object-Based Image Analysis Method for Monitoring Land Conversion by Artificial Sprawl Use of RapidEye and IRS Data	REMOTE SENSING												In France, in the peri-urban context, urban sprawl dynamics are particularly strong with huge population growth as well as a land crisis. The increase and spreading of built-up areas from the city centre towards the periphery takes place to the detriment of natural and agricultural spaces. The conversion of land with agricultural potential is all the more worrying as it is usually irreversible. The French Ministry of Agriculture therefore needs reliable and repeatable spatial-temporal methods to locate and quantify loss of land at both local and national scales. The main objective of this study was to design a repeatable method to monitor land conversion characterized by artificial sprawl: (i) We used an object-based image analysis to extract artificial areas from satellite images; (ii) We built an artificial patch that consists of aggregating all the peripheral areas that characterize artificial areas. The "artificialized" patch concept is an innovative extension of the urban patch concept, but differs in the nature of its components and in the continuity distance applied; (iii) The diachronic analysis of artificial patch maps enables characterization of artificial sprawl. The method was applied at the scale of four departments (similar to provinces) along the coast of Languedoc-Roussillon, in the South of France, based on two satellite datasets, one acquired in 1996-1997 (Indian Remote Sensing) and the other in 2009 (RapidEye). In the four departments, we measured an increase in artificial areas of from 113,000 ha in 1997 to 133,000 ha in 2009, i. e., an 18% increase in 12 years. The package comes in the form of a 1/15,000 valid cartography, usable at the scale of a commune (the smallest territorial division used for administrative purposes in France) that can be adapted to departmental and regional scales. The method is reproducible in homogenous spatial-temporal terms, so that it could be used periodically to assess changes in land conversion rates in France as a whole.

J	Palmsten, ML; Holman, RA				Palmsten, Margaret L.; Holman, Robert A.			Laboratory investigation of dune erosion using stereo video	COASTAL ENGINEERING												Simple parameterizations of dune erosion are necessary for forecasting erosion potential prior to an oncoming storm. Dune erosion may be parameterized in terms of the elevation of the total water level (composed of surge, tide, and wave runup) above the dune base and period of exposure of the dune to waves. In this work, we test several versions of this model using observations from a large wave tank experiment designed to model a storm hydrograph, and we develop a new method for acquiring the appropriate data with confidence intervals using stereo video techniques. The stereo method results in observations of dune morphology at higher spatial and temporal resolutions than traditional survey methods allow. Resolution of the stereo technique was 0.1 m in the horizontal and 0.04 m in the vertical, and errors in stereo observations were on the order of 0.02 to 0.08 m (1 to 2 pixels) when compared with surveys. A new method was developed to estimate confidence intervals on stereo observations. When the unchanging dune top was repeatedly sampled, the new confidence intervals encompassed 2 standard deviations of scatter about the mean dune surface 98% of the time. Observations from the stereo method were used to quantify wave runup and dune erosion. We tested a variety of runup statistics based on a Gaussian distribution of swash properties, and found that the most predictive statistic for dune erosion was the 16% exceedance elevation above the dune base, lower than the often used 2% exceedance value. We found that the parameterization of runup was sensitive to the definition of beach slope and that the most accurate beach slope for predicting runup was through the region of the beach profile defined by the mean water level plus one standard deviation of swash. The dune base retreated along a relatively constant trajectory that was a half of the initial beach slope. Finally, a simple model for dune erosion was tested and found to reproduce 64% of the observed variance in dune erosion rate given known forcing at the dune and 49% of the observed variance in dune erosion rate given parameterized forcing. Integrating the simple model over time, 93% of the observed dune retreat distance was reproduced given offshore forcing. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The regeneration process of aerosols was implemented into the SBM and was found to be necessary for simulating the satellite-observed microphysical properties of warm clouds by the SBM model used in this study. The results showed that the aerosol amount changed the correlation statistics in a way that changes the cloud particle number concentration, whereas the inversion height of the boundary layer, which is related to the atmospheric stability and the cloud-top height, changed the correlation statistics in a way that changes the liquid water path. These results showed that the dominant mechanisms that control the correlation statistics are similar to those suggested by previous modeling studies based on two-dimensional idealized simulations. On the other hand, the present three-dimensional modeling was also able to simulate some realistic patterns of the correlation statistics, namely, mixtures of characteristic patterns and the "high-heeled" pattern as observed by satellite remote sensing.

Evolution of Swarna estuary and its impact on braided islands and estuarine banks, Southwest coast of India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Qualitative and quantitative evolution of the Swarna estuary, during the past 38 years (1967-2005), has been analysed by integrating the results of field surveys, satellite images, hydrodynamic modelling and topographic data in GIS context. Significant changes in erosion/accretion patterns of the estuarine banks, inlet configuration and adjacent spits, and origin, morphology, orientation and areal extent of fifteen braided islands have been estimated. Hydrodynamics of the region is studied through modelling, and probable flow pattern that is responsible for morphological changes is discussed. The simulated flow patterns indicate that current speeds are of the order of 10-20 cm/s inside the estuary and of the order of 40 cm/s at the mouth. The Right bank (Rb) of the estuary is subject to net erosion and the Left bank (Lb) is subject to net accretion. On an average, 20-30% of the area of all braided islands would be flooded, if the water level rises by 0.7 to 1.0 m. Islands of this estuary are morphologically very dynamic (migrating towards north, northeast and southwest directions) and subject to net accretion, whereas only one island (i.e., the Padu) has lost its major portion of landmass. A conceptual inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation model has been generated and evaluated possible flooding on the estuarine shoals and braided islands, due to heavy rainfall and/or sea-level rise. The model reveals that the possibility of flooding will be higher for those islands which are located close to the Rb than those close to the Lb.					Jayappa, K.

J	Liu, JY; Zhang, Q; Hu, YF				Liu Jiyuan; Zhang Qian; Hu Yunfeng			Regional differences of China's urban expansion from late 20th to early 21st century based on remote sensing information	CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE												This study investigated the regional differences of China's urban land expansion from the late 1980s to the year of 2008, based on the spatio-temporal analysis of CLCD (China's land cover/land use database) datasets which were mainly produced from remote sensing imagery data. A newly defined urbanization level index (UI), based on urban land area, is proposed to describe Chinese urban expansion process at 1 kilometer, provincial, regional, and national scales, together with the absolute urban expansion index (UEa) and the relative urbanization expansion index (UEr). The results indicate that the percentages of total land area occupied by urban in the late 1980s, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2008 were approximately 0.25%, 0.32%, 0.33%, 0.43% and 0.52% of China's total land area, respectively. Between the late 1980s and 2008, the total urban expansion in the mainland of China was 2.645 x 10(4) km(2), resulting in an annual urban expansion area of about 1322.7 km(2)/yr, with the UEr of 111.9%. This study also finds that there has been an obvious spatial gradient of urbanization ratio running from the east coast to the west inland, and the urbanization gaps among different regions have persisted over the past two decades. The study also reveals obvious temporal variations of the urbanization rates. There was very little urban growth during the period of 1995-2000 due to the governmental policy factors.																	1002-0063					FEB	2012	22	1					1	14		10.1007/s11769-012-0510-8								WOS:000298965900001

As part of the RADYO program, we deployed a passive radiometer on an AUV in the Santa Barbara Channel and off the coast of Hawaii to apply existing bio-optical algorithms for characterizing the optical constituents of coastal seawater (i.e., dissolved organic material, algal biomass, and other particles). The spectral differences between attenuation coefficients were computed from ratios of downwelling irradiance measured at depth and used to provide estimates of the in-water optical constituents. There was generally good agreement between derived values of absorption and concurrent measurements of this inherent optical property in Santa Barbara Channel. Wave focusing, cloud cover, and low attenuation coefficients influenced results off the coast of Hawaii and are used to evaluate the larger-scale application of these methods in the near surface coastal oceans.																	0148-0227					JAN 31	2012	117								C00H15	10.1029/2011JC007352								WOS:000299954000006

Coastline is one of the most important linear features on the Earth's surface showing a dynamic nature. The coast and its environmental management need information on coastline and its changes. Regarding to the sea level changes in the recent century, the coastline changes issue has introduced more consideration of social, economical and environmental aspects at Tonekabon coastal area, and has created some problem for the environment and residential areas. In this study, the common approaches for determination of coastline changes through Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques and also Satellite Images has been applied on Tonekabon coastline. The TM, ETM and ETM+ landsat satellite images in 1984, 2000 and 2010 were selected, and their geometric and radiometric error correction were done at pre-processing stage. At image processing stage, Band #5 being the best band of detecting water from land, and contrast enhancement, Thresholding and edge detecting filter as the best separation approaches were applied. Outputs in the form of raster layers, showed a zigzag-like coastline from 1984 to 2000 and 2010. Afterwards, raster data were converted into vector, and position changes of coastline for 41 points with an equal space of 1000 m were measured. Results showed an average displacement of 75.2 m toward coast during 1984 and 2000. The average change, during 2000 and 2010, was determined 32.9 m. In these years, most of the study area has encountered a retrograde water level and expansion of land and only in a few places small values of rising in sea level has been observed. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the applied methods in extraction of coastline and its change measurement, field measurement was also taken that Building destruction by sea waves, sinking several buildings under water, protecting of buildings against sea expansion and so on, are some witness for the methodology accuracy of this study in the coastline changes issue at Tonekabon City.

It was found that when winds are predominantly SW, S or W, a wake eddy of varying size (up to 25 km in diameter) forms off Cape Taran and can cover the area between the shoreline and the 65 m isobath. Its longest lifetime, observed using MODIS images, was 6 days. Another location where coastal sub-mesoscale eddies (up to 10-15 km in diameter) of varying form regularly appear is the coastal slope near the southern and central part of the Curonian Spit.

Comparison of MODIS cloud microphysical properties with in-situ measurements over the Southeast Pacific	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Utilizing the unique characteristics of the cloud over the Southeast Pacific (SEP) off the coast of Chile during the VOCALS field campaign, we compared satellite remote sensing of cloud microphysical properties against in-situ data from multi-aircraft observations, and studied the extent to which these retrieved properties are sufficiently constrained and consistent to reliably quantify the influence of aerosol loading on cloud droplet sizes. After constraining the spatial-temporal coincidence between satellite retrievals and in-situ measurements, we selected 17 non-drizzle comparison pairs. For these cases the mean aircraft profiling times were within one hour of Terra overpasses at both projected and un-projected (actual) aircraft positions for two different averaging domains of 5 km and 25 km. Retrieved quantities that were averaged over a larger domain of 25 km compared better statistically with in-situ observations than averages over a smaller domain of 5 km. Comparison at projected aircraft positions was slightly better than un-projected aircraft positions for some parameters. Overall, both MODIS-retrieved effective radius and LWP were larger but highly correlated with the in-situ measured effective radius and LWP, e. g., for averaging domains of 5 km, the biases are up to 1.75 mu m and 0.02 mm whilst the correlation coefficients are about 0.87 and 0.85, respectively. The observed effective radius difference between the two decreased with increasing cloud drop number concentration (CDNC), and increased with increasing cloud geometrical thickness. Compared to the absolute effective radius difference, the correlations between the relative effective radius difference and CDNC or cloud geometric thickness are weaker. For averaging domains of 5 km and 25 km, the correlation coefficients between MODIS-retrieved and in-situ measured CDNC are 0.91 and 0.93 with fitting slopes of 1.23 and 1.27, respectively. If the cloud adiabaticity is taken into account, better agreements are achieved for both averaging domains (the fitting slopes are 1.04 and 1.07, respectively). Our comparison and sensitivity analysis of simulated retrievals demonstrate that both cloud geometrical thickness and cloud adiabaticity are important factors in satellite retrievals of effective radius and cloud drop number concentration. The large variabilities in cloud geometrical thickness and adiabaticity, the dependencies of cloud microphysical properties on both quantities (as demonstrated in our sensitivity study of simulated retrievals), and the inability to accurately account for either of them in retrievals lead to some uncertainties and biases in satellite retrieved cloud effective radius, cloud liquid water path, and cloud drop number concentration. However, strong correlations between satellite retrievals and in-situ measurements suggest that satellite retrievals of cloud effective radius, cloud liquid water path, and cloud drop number concentration can be used to investigate aerosol indirect effects qualitatively.

The general practicability of the WDM has been demonstrated in previous studies for small areas. This article attempts to generate a DEM over a large offshore sandbank with a tidal flat area of more than 620 km2 by integrating the conventional WDM with a hydraulic model and multitemporal satellite images. For illustration purposes, a case study was conducted at the Dongsha sandbank, one of the largest sandbanks among the radial tidal sand ridges of Jiangsu Province, China. In this study, 34 multitemporal satellite images acquired at different tidal phases in 2006 were analyzed to detect the waterlines. The water level at each satellite overpass moment was simulated by a south Yellow Sea hydraulic model, and discrete waterline points were combined with the corresponding water levels to produce a topographic map. Compared with the DEM produced during the same period by the airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, the DEM derived from WDM effectively contains the average height error within 47 cm, which is satisfactory. All of these findings may be useful for researchers and local authorities, as the findings could be used as a reference for sandbank evolution research or to support environmental management, coast protection, and storm forecasting.

Tsunami Inundation Modeling and Mapping using ALTM- and CARTOSAT-Derived Coastal Topographic Data	MARINE GEODESY												Coastal topography is the principal variable that affects the movement of the tsunami wave on land. Therefore, land surface elevation data are critical to a tsunami model for computing extent of inundation. Elevation data from India's remote sensing satellite CARTOSAT-1 are available for the entire Indian coastline, while elevation data collected using Airborne Laser Terrain Mapper (ALTM) are only available for selected sections of the coastline. This study was carried out to evaluate the suitability of CARTOSAT-1 and ALTM elevation data sets in the tsunami inundation modeling. Two areas of the coastal Tamil Nadu that were severely affected during the December 2004 tsunami and surveyed extensively for mapping the extent of inundation were selected as the study areas. Elevation data sets from ALTM, CARTOSAT-1 and field measurement collected using Real-time Kinematic GPS (RTK-GPS) were compared for these areas. The accuracy of ALTM and CARTOSAT-1 data, the significance of interpolation methods and data used on model outputs were studied. The analysis clearly revealed that the elevation accuracy of CARTOSAT-1 data (+/-2m) was much lower than ALTM data (+/-0.6m). However, it was found that despite the differing elevation accuracy, both ALTM and CARTOSAT-1 can be used to produce tsunami inundation maps for open coasts with an accuracy of 185 m (2 grid cells) at 75% and 50% confidence level, respectively.																	0149-0419						2012	35	4					429	440		10.1080/01490419.2011.646606								WOS:000312439600006

Developing Tsunami fragility curves using remote sensing and survey data of the 2010 Chilean Tsunami in Dichato	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												On 27 February 2010, a megathrust earthquake of M-w = 8.8 generated a destructive tsunami in Chile. It struck not only Chilean coast but propagated all the way to Japan. After the event occurred, the post-tsunami survey team was assembled, funded by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), to survey the area severely affected by the tsunami. The tsunami damaged and destroyed numerous houses, especially in the town of Dichato. In order to estimate the structural fragility against tsunami hazard in this area, tsunami fragility curves were developed. Surveyed data of inundation depth and visual inspection of satellite images of Dichato were used to classify the damage to housing. A practical method suitable when there are limitations on available data for numerical simulation or damage evaluation from surveys is presented here. This study is the first application of tsunami fragility curves on the South American Pacific coast and it might be of practical use for communities with similar characteristics along the west Pacific coast. The proposed curve suggests that structures in Dichato will be severely damaged - with a 68 % probability - already at 2 m tsunami inundation depth.

Impact of spring upwelling variability off southern-central Chile on common sardine (Strangomera bentincki) recruitment	FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY												Off southern-central Chile, the impact of spring upwelling variability on common sardine (Strangomera bentincki) recruitment was examined by analyzing satellite and coastal station winds, satellite chlorophyll, and common sardine recruitment from a stock assessment model. In austral spring, the intensity of wind-driven upwelling is related to sea surface temperature (SST) from the Nino 3.4 region, being weak during warm periods (El Nino) and strong during cold periods (La Nina). Interannual changes in both spring upwelling intensity and SST from the Nino 3.4 region are related to changes in remotely sensed chlorophyll over the continental shelf. In turn, year-to-year changes in coastal chlorophyll are tightly coupled to common sardine recruitment. We propose that, in the period 19912004, interannual changes in the intensity of spring upwelling affected the abundance and availability of planktonic food for common sardine, and consequently determined pre-recruit survival and recruitment strength. However, the importance of density-dependent factors on the reproductive dynamic cannot be neglected, as a negative association exists between spawning biomass and recruitment-per-spawning biomass. Coastal chlorophyll, upwelling intensity, and SST anomalies from the Nino 3.4 region could potentially help to predict common sardine recruitment scenarios under strong spring upwelling and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-related anomalies.

Comparison of the MOVES2010a, MOBILE6.2, and EMFAC2007 mobile source emission models with on-road traffic tunnel and remote sensing measurements	JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION												The Desert Research Institute conducted an on-road mobile source emission study at a traffic tunnel in Van Nuys, California, in August 2010 to measure fleet-averaged, fuel-based emission factors. The study also included remote sensing device (RSD) measurements by the University of Denver of 13,000 vehicles near the tunnel. The tunnel and RSD fleet-averaged emission factors were compared in blind fashion with the corresponding modeled factors calculated by ENVIRON International Corporation using U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) MOVES2010a (Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator) and MOBILE6.2 mobile source emission models, and California Air Resources Board's (CARB's) EMFAC2007 (EMission FACtors) emission model. With some exceptions, the fleet-averaged tunnel, RSD, and modeled carbon monoxide (CO) and oxide of nitrogen (NOx) emission factors were in reasonable agreement (+/- 25%). The nonmethane hydrocarbon (NMHC) emission factors (specifically the running evaporative emissions) predicted by MOVES were insensitive to ambient temperature as compared with the tunnel measurements and the MOBILE- and EMFAC-predicted emission factors, resulting in underestimation of the measured NMHC/NOx ratios at higher ambient temperatures. Although predicted NMHC/NOx ratios are in good agreement with the measured ratios during cooler sampling periods, the measured NMHC/NOx ratios are 3.1, 1.7, and 1.4 times higher than those predicted by the MOVES, MOBILE, and EMFAC models, respectively, during high-temperature periods. Although the MOVES NOx emission factors were generally higher than the measured factors, most differences were not significant considering the variations in the modeled factors using alternative vehicle operating cycles to represent the driving conditions in the tunnel. The three models predicted large differences in NOx and particle emissions and in the relative contributions of diesel and gasoline vehicles to total NOx and particulate carbon (TC) emissions in the tunnel.

Variability in the mass flux of the Ross ice streams, West Antarctica, over the last millennium	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												We synthesize previously published remote-sensing observations, radar data and model output to obtain a similar to 1000 year ice flow history for the Siple Coast ice-stream system in West Antarctica to investigate the timing and magnitude of changes in mass flux. The synthesized history shows significant short-term variability in ice-stream shear margin and grounding line position due to internal variability of the coupled system. The chronology highlights the interplay between adjacent ice streams, which implies that the behavior of any individual ice stream should not be examined in isolation. Furthermore, individual events cannot be fully interpreted without an understanding of the broad-scale, long-term variability in the ice sheet. In the context of this millennium-scale history, we interpret the relatively recent stagnation of Kamb Ice Stream (KIS) as just one stage in the thermodynamic cycle of an ice stream in this region. The changes in mass balance that result from the KIS stagnation may thus be viewed as century-scale 'noise' relative to the longer-term trend. Understanding and characterizing this noise is a necessary step before accurate model-based predictions of ice-sheet mass balance for the next century can be made.

Among remote sensing techniques, synthetic aperture radar is a particularly advantageous method to monitor mangroves: images are not dependent on cloud cover and can provide information from forest understory. This article mapped mangrove forests in the southern coast of Sao Paulo State (Brazil) using frequency-based contextual classification of incoherent attributes derived from a multi-polarized Phased Array L-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) image. The use of 10 incoherent attributes and only 3 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) vegetation indices as input for digital classification showed the best accuracies with kappa index values of 0.739 and 0.734, respectively. HH polarization and SAR vegetation indices were the attributes that contributed most to the mangrove mapping procedure. The use of L-Band SAR data was effective for mapping mangrove areas, and therefore it is recommended as a tool for coastal management.				chen, zhu/K-5923-2013; Cunha Lignon, Marilia/B-8953-2012	Rocha de Souza Pereira, Francisca/0000-0002-1319-7717												2150-704X						2012	3	7					567	576		10.1080/01431161.2011.641511								WOS:000308397900003

The map (available at http://www.transmap.fc.ul.pt/) was a reference for the study of environmental and social aspects, and for conservation, was disseminated among local stakeholders, ENGOs and various decision-making authorities and managers, and was used in the development of a transfrontier conservation area. Large scale remote sensing constitutes a cost-effective approach for research and management, as, with limited human, technical, temporal, and financial resources, it provides synoptic views of territories and allows for the estimation of quantitative changes in land use.

Spatial distributions of sea surface temperature (SST) and Chl a concentration were examined using MODIS and MEP:IS data respectively. The MERIS data were processed with an algorithm developed by the Free University of Berlin (FUB) for case 2 waters. Evaluation of MEETS Chl a versus in situ Chl a showed good correlation (r(2) = 0.67), but the concentration was underestimated. The linear regression for a 2 h window was applied to calibrate MEM Chl a. The spatio-temporal variability exhibited the clear influence of upwelling events and related filaments on Chl a distribution in the western and central Gulf. The lowest Chl a concentrations were recorded in the upwelled water, especially at the upwelling centres, and the highest concentrations (13 mg m(-3)) were observed about two weeks after the upwelling peak along the northern coast. The areas along the northern coast of upwelled water (4879 km(2)) on the SST map, and increased Chi a (5526 km(2)) two weeks later, were roughly coincident. The effect of upwelling events was weak in the eastern part of the Gulf, where Chl a concentration was relatively consistent throughout this period.
