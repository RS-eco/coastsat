According to the magnetic anomaly from Hydrocarbon alteration zone, the distribution of oil-gas seepage can be determined at plane. Susceptibility measure of drilling samples and the analyses of minerals by x-ray diffraction from anomalous magnetic sedimentary intervals have identified that some kinds of alteration minerals exist. The magnetic detect result in Bohai area is consistent with that from remote sensing result. The association between magnetic anomalies and oil-gas has been recorded from the survey of the drill cuttings in 3 wells in the South China Sea. It is effective to decide hydrocarbon alteration zone in the near-surface sedimentary strata by using magnetic detect method and the others.																	0001-5733					MAR	2001	44	2					245	+										WOS:000167723000012						
J	Shifrin, KS				Shifrin, KS			An algorithm for determining the radiance reflected from the rough sea surface using MODIS-N satellite radiometer data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												A new algorithm is suggested for determining the radiance B-r (theta, phi) reflected from the rough sea surface. The knowledge of B-r (theta, phi) is needed for excluding the reflected solar radiation from the signal at the space receiver. Information on the reflected radiance is also required when estimating the state of the sea surface from space, The information (on reflected radiance) is important for problems such as estimating the chlorophyll concentration in sea water. The suggested algorithm was constructed based on direct measurements of the radiance coefficient rho published in [1], [14]. The experimental results show that the slope distribution of sea surface elements depends not only on the wind speed near the sea surface but also on the stability of the lower part of the marine atmospheric boundary layer. It is shown that the failure to account for this effect causes an error of +/- 30% when estimating B-r (theta, phi).																	0196-2892					MAR	2001	39	3					677	681		10.1109/36.911124								WOS:000167628100019						
J	Sanderson, PG				Sanderson, PG			The application of satellite remote sensing to coastal management in Singapore	AMBIO												This paper reviews the application of satellite remote sensing to management of Singapore's coastal environment. Remotely sensed data have been used for marine habitat mapping, water quality monitoring, ship and ship-wake detection, oil spill detection, red tide monitoring, and mapping of reclamation activities. While these applications clearly cover most of the range of opportunities for use of remotely sensed data in the coastal zone, there is still a need for more complete baseline studies of natural resources and habitats, and monitoring of the impacts of development on the coastal and marine environment. There is also a requirement for more management-oriented research and continued development and revision of the available datasets. integration and exchange of information between management agencies and research groups is also an important aspect of sustainable management of Singapore's coastal environment and marine resources.																	0044-7447					FEB	2001	30	1					43	48		10.1639/0044-7447(2001)030[0043:TAOSRS]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000167684900007	11351792					
J	Barber, DG; Yackel, JJ; Hanesiak, JM				Barber, DG; Yackel, JJ; Hanesiak, JM			Sea ice, RADARSAT-1 and Arctic climate processes: A review and update	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												It is a common axiom that the problems of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing of sea ice have largely been solved, or at the very least, that this application area is mature relative to other terrestrial and oceanographic applications. The utility of SAR for sea ice studies is well documented in the literature and currently is used operationally on a global basis for both climate related process studies and marine navigation in polar regions. In this paper we argue that the knowledge generated in the past 40 years has created a sufficiently strong theoretical foundation that we can derive new information based on the physical, electrical and thermodynamic controls on the temporal evolution in microwave scattering over snow-covered sea ice. A conceptual model for this relationship calls for a physically, based microwave scattering model coupled numerically to a one-dimensional thermodynamic model of snow-covered sea ice. We term this an 'Electro-Thermophysical' model. To provide the necessary background for development of this model we review our current understanding of the physical and electrical properties of snow-covered sea ice throughout the annual cycle. We discuss how the microwave scattering coefficient evolves over this annual cycle and examine the physical controls on this scattering relative to our knowledge of the geophysics and thermodynamics of the system. We then present results illustrating the potential benefits of integrating microwave scattering with a one-dimensional thermodynamic model of snow-covered sea ice by presenting and illustrating a number of examples on how this 'Electro-Thermophysical' model might operate.																	1712-7971					FEB	2001	27	1					53	63										WOS:000172767800007						
J	Bates, CR; Phillips, DR; Grimm, R; Lynn, H				Bates, CR; Phillips, DR; Grimm, R; Lynn, H			The seismic evaluation of a naturally fractured tight gas sand reservoir in the Wind River Basin, Wyoming	PETROLEUM GEOSCIENCE												Sub-vertical natural fracturing is critical for ensuring economic gas production from tight sand reservoirs in many provinces. Over the last seven years, the US Department of Energy (DoE) has sponsored a series of programmes in the continental United States to develop cost-effective technologies for investigating naturally fractured reservoirs. The results from a stud!: of a Laramide-age faulted anticline reservoir in the Lower Fort Union Formation of the Wind River Basin, Wyoming are presented. At the field site a multi-azimuth, multi-offset 3D compressional wave seismic survey was acquired and processed using azimuth-dependent processing followed by multi-azimuth attribute analysis. Geophysical attributes such as velocity, frequency, reflectivity and amplitude variation with offset, together with geological attributes such as depth below closure and distance from faults, were correlated to estimated ultimate recovery of gas for established wells within the field. The correlations were made using linear statistical methods, non-linear rank methods and neural networks to combine attribute results. The geophysical attributes and other geological information were combined into prospectivity maps for areas of highest fracture density. Based on the geophysical and geological results an 80% success rate was achieved at prospecting well locations. A major aspect of the DoE programmes has been the investigation of cost-effective protocols for fracture detection. From this study the following procedure is recommended for cost-effective mapping of fractures and associated gas: (1) perform field and remote-sensing reconnaissance of structural trends; (2) acquire 3D P-wave surveys with offsets equal to or greater than target depth in all azimuths; (3) process in at least two dominant structural azimuths; (4) combine best correlated geophysical and geological attributes to fractures for future fracture zone mapping. The implications of the results from this sun ey have important consequences for the design and implementation of multi-azimuth, multi-offset data acquisition on land and for marine surveys where multi-component ocean bottom cable surveying is used.

J	Hutchinson, JN				Hutchinson, JN			Reading the ground: Morphology and geology in site appraisal	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND HYDROGEOLOGY												In this lecture, the process of reading the ground is explored, some of the necessary background is defined and ways of improving our present and future competence in this area are outlined. It acknowledges the world-wide scope of this activity, but employs mainly the narrower canvas of mass movements in NW European conditions to illustrate its nature. Some basic tools which can assist in this process are first noted, good databases, the techniques of initial site appraisal, comprising desk study, site reconnaissance and mapping (with the aid of stereoscopic air photo interpretation and other remote sensing techniques), terrain modelling and the use of associated well-logged and sampled trial trenches. The importance of the classification of mass movements, not least to develop an agreed terminology, is touched upon and the great value, even at this early stage, of the influence line approach in assessing rapidly the effects of proposed cuts and fills is noted. An attempt is then made to identify the relevant vocabulary for reading the ground, that is those physical phenomena which bear on site appraisal. These are divided into bedrock elements, of which lithology and tectonics are highlighted, and Quaternary elements, particularly those that occurred in areas of cold climate, i.e. past freezing and thawing, sea-level changes, hydrogeological features and glacial, periglacial, fluvial and marine erosional and depositional features, Abandoned cliffs and inland scarps in chalk and some clays are then identified as characteristic landforms, and their nature and development are also explored. Case records of successful and unsuccessful earthworks on clayey scarps are also reviewed, in relation to the quality of initial site appraisal undertaken. in conclusion, significant weaknesses in our current education and training in this area are identified, specifically a near-absence of geomorphology and insufficient Quaternary geology, and proposals made to remedy these.																	0481-2085					FEB	2001	34		1				7	+		10.1144/qjegh.34.1.7								WOS:000166724700001						
J	Westbrook, AG; Pinkerton, MH; Aiken, J; Pilgrim, DA				Westbrook, AG; Pinkerton, MH; Aiken, J; Pilgrim, DA			Simulated performance of remote sensing ocean colour algorithms during the 1996 PRIME cruise	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Coincident pigment and underwater radiometric data were collected during a cruise along the 20 degreesW meridian from 60 degreesN to 37 degreesN in the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean as part of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) thematic programme: plankton reactivity in the marine environment (PRIME). These data were used to simulate the retrieval of two bio-optical variables from remotelysensed measurements of ocean colour (for example by the NASA Sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor, SeaWiFS), using two-band semi-empirical algorithms. The variables considered were the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm, (K-d(490), units: m(-1)) and the phytoplankton pigment concentration expressed as optically-weighted chlorophyll-a concentration [C-a, units: mg m(-3)]. There was good agreement between the measured and the retrieved bio-optical values. Algorithms based on the PRIME data were generated to compare the performance of local algorithms (algorithms which apply to a restricted area and/or season) with global algorithms (algorithms developed on data from a wide variety of water masses). The use of local algorithms improved the average accuracy, but not the precision, of the retrievals: errors were still +/- 36% (K-d) and +/- 117% (C-a) using local algorithms.

J	Lisitsyn, AP				Lisitsyn, AP			Lithology of lithospheric plates	GEOLOGIYA I GEOFIZIKA												The recent decades have become a,,golden age" for lithology and marine geology. The principal achievements include investigation and mapping of oceanic bottom sediments and studies of the sedimentary material in the atmosphere, rivers, seas, and oceans, in ice and snow; development of a new approach to the role of biogenic processes; analysis of endogenic material supplied to the mid-ocean ridges; and changes in the view of sedimentary material of the land provenance and its transformation at the river-sea boundary. Another achievement is the concept of rapid (.,avalanche") sedimentation at several levels, responsible for concentration of 93% of the sedimentary material of the Earth in limited basins, which become major reservoirs of hydrocarbons. The regions of avalanche sedimentation alternate with those of sedimentation gaps. The lithology is gaining a more solid quantitative basis, using such dynamic parameters as flux and vectors of sedimentary material. It has been found out that sedimentation in oceans follows its specific laws, as the oceanic crust differs from the continental crust. Modern lithological studies employ remote sensing methods (seismic stratigraphy, magnetometry, multiray sea beams, side-view sonars, etc.), as well as mapping and special sampling from natural bottom outcrops at depths of to 6000 m with the use of submersibles. Deep-sea drilling experiments (since 1968) and data processing performed by the joint efforts of international teams became an important step forward. As a result, the amount of data obtained in the course of the recent 30-40 years is hundreds or thousands of times as great as that accumulated through the whole previous history of the science, though lithologists, unfortunately, use very few of these data. The recent results led to numerous discoveries and creation of the mobilistic lithology, or the lithology of lithospheric plates, and required the synthetic use of the data of tectonics, geophysics, marine geology and geochemistry, petrology and petrochemistry, oceanology and climatology.																	0016-7886						2001	42	4					522	559										WOS:000169179400001						
J	Sathyendranath, S; Cota, G; Stuart, V; Maass, H; Platt, T				Sathyendranath, S; Cota, G; Stuart, V; Maass, H; Platt, T			Remote sensing of phytoplankton pigments: a comparison of empirical and theoretical approaches	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Algorithms that have been used on a routine basis for remote sensing of the phytoplankton pigment, chlorophyll-a, from ocean colour data from satellite sensors such as the CZCS (Coastal Zone Color Scanner), SeaWiFS ( Sea Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor) and OCTS (Ocean Colour and Temperature Scanner) are all of an empirical nature. However, there exist theoretical models that allow ocean colour to be expressed as a function of the inherent optical properties of seawater, such as the absorption coefficient and the backscattering coefficient. These properties can in turn be expressed as functions of chlorophyll-a, at least for the so-called Case 1 waters in which phytoplankton may be considered to be the single, independent variable responsible for most of the variations in the marine optical properties. Here, we use such a theoretical approach to model variations in ocean colour as a function of chlorophyll-a concentration, and compare the results with some empirical models in routine use. The parameters of phytoplankton absorption necessary for the implementation of the ocean colour model are derived from our database of over 700 observations of phytoplankton absorption spectra and concurrent measurements of phytoplankton pigments by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) techniques. Since there are reports in the literature that significant differences exist in the performance of the algorithms in polar regions compared with lower latitudes, the model is first implemented using observations made at latitudes less than 50 degrees. It is then applied to the Labrador Sea, a high-latitude environment. Our results show that there are indeed differences in the performance of the algorithm at high latitudes, and that these differences may be attributed to changes in the optical characteristics of phytoplankton that accompany changes in the taxonomic composition of their assemblages. The sensitivities of the model to assumptions made regarding absorption by coloured dissolved organic matter (or yellow substances) and backscattering by particles are examined. The importance of Raman scattering on ocean colour and its influence on the algorithms are also investigated.																	0143-1161					JAN	2001	22	2-3					249	273		10.1080/014311601449925								WOS:000166471600004

J	Kawamoto, K; Nakajima, T; Nakajima, TY				Kawamoto, K; Nakajima, T; Nakajima, TY			A global determination of cloud microphysics with AVHRR remote sensing	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												An algorithm is developed for determining the cloud optical thickness and effective particle radius simultaneously on a global scale using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) multispectral radiance data. In the algorithm, the treatment of thermal radiation in Nakajima and Nakajima is improved by reformulating the thermal emission in the atmospheric layers. At the same time, the lookup table for thermal emission is parameterized in terms of the equivalent water vapor path in order to include the effect of various vertical water vapor profiles. The algorithm is applied to AVHRR radiance data corresponding to reported aircraft and balloon measurements of cloud microphysical parameters. A comparison shows a good agreement between in situ and satellite-retrieved values thus obtained. The algorithm is further applied to 4-month Global Area Coverage data of 1987 to generate global distributions of the cloud optical thickness and effective particle radius for every 0.5 degrees X 0.5 degrees box in a -60 degrees -60 degrees latitudinal region. Similarities and differences in the global features of the effective particle radius and the optical thickness are found as compared with the previous studies.

J	Boyd, IL; Hawker, EJ; Brandon, MA; Staniland, IJ				Boyd, IL; Hawker, EJ; Brandon, MA; Staniland, IJ			Measurement of ocean temperatures using instruments carried by Antarctic fur seals	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												The study aimed to test the utility of instruments deployed on marine mammals for measuring physical oceanographic variation and, using this method, to examine temperature variation in the coastal waters around South Georgia. There was a significant correlation between temperature measurements made using a towed undulating oceanographic recorder (UOR) and concurrent measurements from time-depth recorders (TDRs) fitted to lactating Antarctic fur seals foraging from the coast of South Georgia, Congruence was found at horizontal spatial scales from 0.01 degrees x 0.01 degrees to 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees (degrees of latitude and longitude), and at a vertical scale of 10 m. However, there was no significant correlation between temperature measured by TDRs in the top 5 m and sea surface temperature (SST) measured by satellite remote sensing. TDR data provided information about temperature variation vertically through the water column, and through rime. The UOR data were used to recalibrate the TDR data in order to correct for the slow response time of the TDR thermistor relative to the speed of seal movements through the water column. Seasonal temperature variation was apparent, and temperatures also varied between regions, and with bathymetry. These results were consistent with the current interpretation of the coastal oceanography around South Georgia. In particular, the relationship between on- and off-shelf waters showed larger amounts of warmer surface water in a region in which more run-off was to be expected. The study also showed that Antarctic fur seals concentrate their activity in regions of colder, and presumably oceanic, water. Such instrumented animals could provide near real time data for assimilation into ocean models. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Platnick, S				Platnick, S			Approximations for horizontal photon transport in cloud remote sensing problems	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER												The effect of horizontal photon transport within real-world clouds can be of consequence to remote sensing problems based on plane-parallel cloud models. In this paper, analytic approximations for the root-mean-square horizontal displacement of reflected and transmitted photons, relative to the incident cloud-top location, are derived for plane-parallel cloud layers. With anisotropic scattering, separate approximations are needed depending on the order of scattering. When sufficient numbers of photon scatterings occur, an approximation based on random walk theory (photon diffusion) is applicable; when scattering numbers are relatively small, a modification to the diffusion result is used. The resulting formulae are a function of the average number of photon scatterings, as well as particle asymmetry parameter and single scattering albedo. In turn, the average number of scatterings from plane-parallel, vertically inhomogeneous cloud layers can be determined from efficient adding/doubling radiative transfer procedures. The transport approximations are applied to liquid water clouds for typical remote sensing solar spectral bands, involving both conservative and non-conservative scattering. Results compare well with Monte Carlo calculations. Though the emphasis is on horizontal photon transport in terrestrial clouds, the derived approximations are applicable to general anisotropic, multiple scattering, plane-parallel radiative transfer problems. Approximations useful for three-dimensional transport are also given. The complete horizontal transport probability distribution can be described with an analytic distribution specified by the root-mean-square and average radial displacement values. However, it is shown empirically that the average displacement can be reasonably inferred from the root-mean-square value. An estimate for the horizontal transport distribution can then be made from the root-mean-square photon displacement alone. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Cho, BC; Park, MG; Shim, JH; Choi, DH				Cho, BC; Park, MG; Shim, JH; Choi, DH			Sea-surface temperature and f-ratio explain large variability in the ratio of bacterial production to primary production in the Yellow Sea	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												To determine whether parameters related to hydrography and phytoplankton utilization of nitrogenous nutrients are responsible for the variability in ratios of euphotic zone-integrated bacterial production (BP) to primary production (PP), we measured bacterial production, primary production, new production, regenerated production and environmental variables in the euphotic zone in May 1995 and June 1996 at a frontal region in the Yellow Sea. The BP/PP ratios were highly variable with different hydrodynamic conditions, ranging from 0.03 for mixed waters to 0.40 for stratified waters. The BP/PP ratios were significantly correlated (r(2) = 0.64, p < 0.01) with water-column stability of the euphotic zone and, to a greater degree, with sea-surface temperature (SST; r(2) = 0.74, p < 0.001). SST was also closely correlated with water-column stability (r(2) = 0.91, p < 0.0001). An inverse relationship was found (r(2) = 0.61, p < 0.01) between BP/PP and f-ratios, indicating close association of the variability of the BP/PP ratios with the relative utilization of nitrogen by phytoplankton. High BP/PP values were found when the euphotic zone was stratified and phytoplankton mostly depended on ammonium for nitrogen source, and low BP/PP values were found when the euphotic zone was completely mixed and phytoplankton mostly depended on nitrate. Our results suggest that both turbulent mixing and water temperature were underlying physical forces regulating variations in BP/PP ratios in the Yellow Sea. It might be possible to predict energy pathways in the Yellow Sea and, presumably, in other marine environments by remote-sensing of SST and ocean color.																	0171-8630						2001	216						31	41		10.3354/meps216031								WOS:000170395500003						
J	Moran, XAG; Estrada, M				Moran, XAG; Estrada, M			Short-term variability of photosynthetic parameters and particulate and dissolved primary production in the Alboran Sea (SW Mediterranean)	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The short-term variability of photosynthesis-irradiance (P-E) relationships and integrated primary production at 3 stations (Stns A, B, C in a coastal-offshore gradient) located across the Western Alboran Sea Gyre (SW Mediterranean) were investigated during a High Frequency Flux Experiment (1 to 16 May 1998). Photosynthetic production of total, particulate and dissolved organic carbon (TOC, POC and DOC respectively) was considered separatedly in 34 experiments. Photosynthetic parameters were calculated for TOC and POC data. For POC measurements, maximum photosynthetic rate (p(m)(B) (POC)) and the initial slope of the P-E curve (alpha) varied between 0.59 and 6.25 mg C (mg chi a)(-1) h(-1) and 0.0023 and 0.0182 mg C (mg chi a)(-1) h(-1) (mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1))(-1), respectively, and were significantly correlated, showing a similar decrease with depth. No photoinhibition was detected at any depth and the light saturation parameter (E-k) was on average 251 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1), suggesting that phytoplankton assemblages were acclimated to high irradiance levels in the whole area. Percent extracellular release (PER) obtained for each experimental irradiance (PERE = DOC/ [POC+DOC]) showed an inverse relationship with irradiance when data from all the P-E experiments were pooled. A light-saturated chi a-normalized DOC production rate (P, Dec) was calculated as P-m(B) (TOC) - P-m(B) (POC), and PERm values calculated as P-m(B) (DOC)/P-m(B) (TOC) tended to increase with depth. Integrated particulate and total primary production varied considerably (23- and 35-fold, respectively), but tended to decrease along a coastal-offshore gradient. During the cruise, a subsurface phytoplankton bloom was advected into Stn A, increasing primary production rates up to 1 g C m(-2) d(-1). Average particulate primary production was 632 mg C m(-2) d(-1) at Stn A, 388 mg C m(-2) d(-1) at Stn B and 330 mg C m(-2) d(-1) at Stn C, with dissolved primary production ranging from 4 to 44% of total values. integrated primary production was significantly correlated with surface chi a but not with integrated chi a. This finding has implications for the estimation of regional primary production based on remote sensing of near-surface pigments. Altogether, the results confirmed that the high hydrodynamism of the Alboran Sea was associated with marked biological variability and episodic high primary production events.

J	Chauvaud, S; Bouchon, C; Maniere, R				Chauvaud, S; Bouchon, C; Maniere, R			Thematic mapping of tropical marine communities (coral reefs, seagrass beds and mangroves) using SPOT data in Guadeloupe Island.	OCEANOLOGICA ACTA												In the framework of a comprehensive study of the coastal marine ecosystems of Guadeloupe Island (French West Indies), a remote sensing survey of marine communities was conducted in the Bay of the Grand Cul-de-Sac Marin. Pictures of SPOT satellite were used. At first sight, XS data from SPOT did not seem to be well adapted to extract information from deepest underwater areas. In the present study, a method for analysis of XS data was developed, which increases tenuous spectral differences associated to very low intensity signals. This technique led to a better distinction of objects, even the deepest ones. Reference surfaces were then identified in the field and a reliable supervised classification was conducted, which reflected the high diversity of ecological themes (up to 32) of the area to 20 m depth. A total of 23 700 ha of biota was clearly identified. Mangrove covered up to 2 700 ha. Submerged areas were constituted of 15 700 ha of soft bottoms and 3 800 ha of hard substrate bottoms. On the coral reefs, flourishing coral communities accounted only for 113 ha (11.2%). This result enhances the alarming situation of these communities in Guadeloupe. Finally, seagrass beds took up to 8 200 ha (i.e. 42% of the total sublittoral area, 58% of soft bottom substrates). This ecosystem revealed to be of primary importance within the studied area and particular attention was paid to seagrass beds of Thalassia rest testudinum. Twelve themes were retained to describe them, based on the coverage rate of the substratum by the plants and the type of the sediment colonised. The final document expresses well the high complexity of the studied area.

The present study was carried out within the Gulf of St-Florent (Corsica, France) on a Posidonia oceanica reef platform. Over the last 40 years, no major diachronic evolution has been observed within this plant formation. An erosion of the coastline has been noted inland of these seagrass beds, however, with erosion values of up to 40 m. The use of photogrammetric techniques, which are new to the marine environment, allows the possibility of obtaining a numeric model of a given site. The comparison of cartographic and bathymetric data, brought together in a geographic information system, allows the spatial distribution of seagrasses to be evaluated for the first time.

One such habitat is the basin-wide chlorophyll front located at the boundary between the low chlorophyll subtropical gyres and the high chlorophyll subarctic gyres. Global satellite maps of surface chlorophyll clearly show this feature in all oceans. In the North Pacific, the front is over 8000 km long and seasonally migrates north and south about 1000 km. In the winter this front is located at about 30-35 degreesN latitude and in the summer at about 40-45 degreesN. It is a zone of surface convergence where cool, vertically mixed, high chlorophyll, surface water on the north side sinks beneath warm, stratified, low chlorophyll water on the south side. Satellite telemetry data on movements of loggerhead turtles and detailed fisheries data for albacore tuna show that both apex predators travel along this front as they migrate across the North Pacific. The front is easily monitored with ocean color satellite remote sensing. A change in the position of the TZCF between 1997 and 1998 appears Lo have altered the spatial distribution of loggerhead turtles. The position and dynamics of the front varied substantially between the 1998 El Nino and the 1999 La Nina. For example, from May to July 1999 the transition zone chlorophyll front (TZCF) remained between about 35 degreesN and 40 degreesN latitude showing very little meandering, whereas in 1998, during the same period, the TZCF exhibited considerable meandering and greater monthly latitudinal movement. Catch rates for albacore were considerably higher in 1998 than in 1999, and we hypothesize that a meandering TZCF creates regions of convergence, which enhances the foraging habitat for apex predators along the front.

J	Winstead, NS; Schaaf, RM; Mourad, PD				Winstead, NS; Schaaf, RM; Mourad, PD			Synthetic aperture radar observations of the surface signatures of cold-season bands over the Great Lakes	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												An important aspect of operational meteorology in and around the Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada in the winter months is the forecasting of lake-effect precipitation. While the synoptic- and mesoscale processes that govern the development of lake-effect precipitation have been well understood for many years, problems observing these bands remain because of the limited boundary layer coverage provided by the Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) network. While traditional visible and infrared satellite imagery helps alleviate these coverage limitations, overcast conditions often negate this advantage. Here, a new method for observing lake-effect bands by using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to identify and characterize their surface signatures is presented. SAR is a remote sensing tool that images surface roughness. Over water, this roughness is related to the surface wind stress and, hence, surface wind field. Here, three cases are documented where the SAR aboard the Canadian Radar Satellite-1 imaged the footprints of precipitating bands over the Great Lakes: one case with multiple snowbands west of one main band over Lake Superior, and two cases with shore-parallel bands over each of Lakes Ontario and Michigan. These cases are first documented using traditional observing methods: infrared satellite imagery, WSR-88D, and surface observations. Then, each SAR image is interpreted based upon the traditional observations. The ultimate goal is to demonstrate that SAR is capable of detecting the surface signatures associated with Great Lakes precipitation bands that could be of value to forecasters when data from traditional observation platforms are unavailable.																	0882-8156	1520-0434					2001	16	3					315	328		10.1175/1520-0434(2001)016<0315:SAROOT>2.0.CO;2								WOS:000169160000003						
J	Culik, B				Culik, B			Finding food in the open ocean: foraging strategies in Humboldt penguins	ZOOLOGY-ANALYSIS OF COMPLEX SYSTEMS					94th Annual Meeting of the German-Zoological-Society	JUN 04-08, 2001	UNIV OSNABRUCK, OSNABRUCK, GERMANY	German Zoolog Soc	UNIV OSNABRUCK			Penguins are excellent "model" organisms allowing us to study the behaviour of marine homeotherms at sea. Penguins regularly return to their breeding colonies, enabling biologists to equip them with remote sensing devices such as physiological or behavioural data-loggers, radio- or satellite transmitters. Foraging trips at sea can last from days to weeks and after return of the birds to their breeding sites, the devices can easily be removed for analysis of on-board stored data, yielding a wealth of information. Investigation of penguin behaviour at sea becomes particularly revealing when other sources of information can be matched to the data set, such as satellite data on wind, temperature, ice cover, and chlorophyll-a concentrations. Penguins and other marine homeotherms are true inhabitants of the high seas. Depending on the season., the marine behaviour varies: during reproduction, penguins are central-place foragers, and must return regularly to their nest to feed their chicks. During the remainder of the year, there are no constraints and the birds travel large distances at sea. Breeding Humboldt penguins react to climatic change by varying their daily foraging range and dive duration. Similar to other representatives of the family Spheniscidae, Humboldt penguins avoid food shortages by migrating into more productive marine areas. Navigational clues such as daylength, sea surface temperature, local wind direction and olfaction might provide important aids in finding patchily distributed prey in the open ocean. DMS, a chemical compound produced by decaying algae, seems to be a further clue that indirectly points the way to feeding areas.																	0944-2006						2001	104	3-4					327	338		10.1078/0944-2006-00038								WOS:000174431600018	16351847

For one possible countermeasure we have developed an oil sensor. This sensor can be applied for a remote sensing technique (LIDAR) and fluorescence analysis. This system can distinguish oil spices in laboratory. We have tried to obtain field experience for the first time using fluorescence LIDAR (F-LIDAR). The F-LIDAR system was used to carry out a field analysis around Yuge Island on board a ship (Yuge-Maru). The fluorescence response was detected but oil was not detected during this voyage. We think that cause for this result was the microbes, based on an observation of seawater by an optical microscope. F-LIDAR can observe microbes under environmental conditions. Our system is new a useful and technique for monitoring oil and microbes in the marine environment.																	0525-1931					DEC	2000	49	12					1009	1014		10.2116/bunsekikagaku.49.1009								WOS:000166001300012

This study provided simultaneous observations of a wide range of physical and chemical factors of importance for the melting processes of sea ice, from its southernmost margins at about 77.5 degreesN to the consolidated Arctic pack ice at 81.5 degreesN. This paper includes a description of the oceanographic processes, ice-density packing and structures in cores, optical properties of water masses and the ice, characteristics of the incident spectral radiation and chlorophyll - leading to primary production. Large seasonal and inter-annual variations in ice cover in the MIZ were evident from satellite images as well as ship observations. Even if the annual variation in ice extent may be large, the inter-annual variations may be even larger. The minimum observed ice extent in March, for example, can be smaller than the maximum observed ice extent in September. Oceanographic phenomena such as the semi-permanent lee polynyas found west and south-west of Kvitoya and Franz Josef Land and the bay of open water, the "Whalers Bay", north of the Spitsbergen are structures which can change with time intervals of hours to decades. For example, the polynya south of Franz Josef Land was clearly evident in 1995 but was only seen for a short period in 1996. The observed variability in physical conditions directly affects the primary production in the MIZ. From early spring, solar radiation penetrates both leads and the ice itself, initiating algal production under the ice. Light measurements showed that the melt ponds act as windows, permitting the transmission of incoming solar radiation through to the underlying sea ice, thus, accelerating the melting process and enhancing the under-ice primary production. In June 1995, the N-S transect went through a pre-bloom area well inside the ice-covered part of the Barents Sea to a post-bloom phase in the open waters south of the ice edge. The biological conditions in the later season (August) of 1996 were considerably more variable. The longer N-S transect in August 1996 passed through areas with variable ice and oceanographic conditions, and different developmental stages of phytoplankton blooms were encountered. The previously adapted picture of a plankton bloom following the retreating ice edge northwards was not seen. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Varadan, VK; Varadan, VV				Varadan, VK; Varadan, VV			Microsensors, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and electronics for smart structures and systems	SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES												The technology referred to by the terms 'microelectromechanical systems' (MEMS), 'interdigital transducers' (IDTs), and 'smart systems' is a multidisciplinary one which has generated a great deal of interest in the chemical, mechanical, electrical engineering, medical, materials science, and food science communities in recent years. The term 'smart system' refers to a device or an array of devices that can sense changes in its environment and makes a useful or optimal response by changing its material properties, geometry, or mechanical or electromagnetic response. Both the sensor and actuator functions with the appropriate feedback must be integrated, and comprise the 'brain' of the material. The materials belonging to this category include a range of artificial materials, from optically active or chiral polymers to multifunctional polymers, carbon nanotubes, piezoelectrics, ferroelectrics, and other active ceramics. The miniaturization of sensors and subsequently that of the MEMS incorporating the sensors, actuators, and electronic circuitry for signal processing and control feedback have been made possible by advances in technologies originating in the semiconductor industry, and the emerging field has grown rapidly during the past ten years. Recently, microstereolithography has revolutionized the MEMS industry through multifunctional polymeric materials incorporating organic thin-film transistors with three-dimensional MEMS which is not possible with silicon processing. The integration of MEMS, IDTs, and the required microelectronics and conformal antenna in the multifunctional smart materials and composites results in a smart wireless system suitable for sensing and control of a variety of functions in automobile, aerospace, marine, and civil structures, and the food and medical industries. This unique combination of technologies also results in novel conformal sensors that can be remotely accessed by an antenna system with the advantage of no power requirements at the sensor site. After giving a brief overview of microsensors and MEMS, the paper focuses on the design and fabrication of MEMS devices and their use in engineering and medical applications. Examples include: (1) accelerometers and gyroscopes for automobiles, inertial navigation, etc; (2) drag sensing and reduction for aircraft; (3) sensing and control of ice formation and de-icing for aircraft; (4) remote measurement of tip deflection for helicopters; (5) health monitoring of structures; and (6) a 'smart tongue and electronic nose'.																	0964-1726	1361-665X				DEC	2000	9	6					953	972		10.1088/0964-1726/9/6/327								WOS:000166144200027

We documented that the observed oil spills were generally elongate, narrow and thin, that spill dimensions were interrelated, and that wind speed and wave height affected these dimensions. A major fraction of the total variation however could be attributed to slick thickness. Spills found outside the Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) tended to be smaller in surface area but showed no significant difference in average volume. Thus, the source of the spill more so than the hydrodynamics of the sea determined the characteristics of the spill. Given the impact of oil spills on marine life, continuous attention should be paid to monitoring and pollution control measures in the BMZI, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Platnick, S				Platnick, S			Vertical photon transport in cloud remote sensing problems	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Photon transport in plane-parallel, vertically inhomogeneous clouds is investigated and applied to cloud remote sensing techniques that use solar reflectance or transmittance measurements for retrieving droplet effective radius. Transport is couched in terms of weighting functions which approximate the relative contribution of individual layers to the overall retrieval. Two vertical weightings are investigated, including one based on the average number of scatterings encountered by reflected and transmitted photons in any given layer. A simpler vertical weighting, based on the maximum penetration of reflected photons, proves useful for solar reflectance measurements. These weighting functions are highly dependent on droplet absorption and solar/viewing geometry. A superposition technique, using adding/doubling radiative transfer procedures, is used to accurately determine both weightings, avoiding time-consuming Monte Carlo methods. Effective radius retrievals from modeled vertically structured liquid water clouds are then made using the standard near-infrared bands and compared with size estimates based on the proposed weighting functions. Agreement between the two methods is generally within several tenths of a micrometer, much better than expected retrieval accuracy. Though the emphasis is on photon transport in clouds, the derived weightings can be applied to any multiple-scattering plane-parallel radiative transfer problem, including arbitrary combinations of cloud, aerosol, and gas layers.

CISNet is composed of intensive, long-term monitoring and re search sites around the U.S. marine and Great Lakes coasts. In this partnership, EPA and NOAA are funding research and monitoring programs at pilot sites that utilize ecological indicators and investigate the ecological effects of environmental stressors. NASA is funding research aimed at developing a remote sensing capability that will augment or enhance in situ research and monitoring programs selected by EPA and NOAA. CISNet has three objectives: 1) to develop a sound scientific basis for understanding ecological responses to anthropogenic stresses in coastal environments, including the interaction of exposure, environment/climate, and biological/ecological factors in the response, and the spatial and temporal nature of these interactions, 2) to demonstrate the value of developing data from selected sires intensively monitored to examine the relationships between changes in environmental stressors, including anthropogenic and natural stresses, and ecological response, and 3) to provide intensively monitored sites for development and evaluation of indicators of change in coastal systems.																	0167-6369					SEP	2000	64	1					379	390		10.1023/A:1006455505015								WOS:000089244600029

By using the polarization differences at the two high frequency channels (i.e., 37 and 85 GHz) of the special sensor microwave/imager (SSM/I), a new quantity called R-factor is defined. Using the R-factor, the atmospheric signal can be easily separated from the surface signal and, more importantly, the surface signal and its variation can be strongly suppressed, especially in regions with low ice concentrations. In regions with high ice concentrations, other sea ice parameters like snow cover play an important role as indicated by simulations using in situ measured sea ice emissivities and observed by the SSM/I, Under the assumption that the sea ice parameters remain sufficiently stable within a short period (e.g., ten days), a method is proposed to determine the background term from SSM/I measurements, allowing the detection of the cloud signature. A comparison with a known SSM/I cloud liquid water algorithm over the open ocean shows a high degree of correlation (0.958) among the cloud signatures detected by the two algorithms. On January 2 and 3, 1996, a low pressure system moved into the sea ice-covered Weddell Sea. Its cloud signature detected using the R-factor method compares well with coincident observations from both visible and infrared sensors.

Seabed erosion and diapirism in the abandoned subaqueous delta lobe	MARINE GEOLOGY												Historical bathymetry, satellite remote sensing and river discharge data have been used to examine the evolution of an abandoned delta lobe in the northern area of the modern Yellow River delta. Results show three stages of evolution in the subaqueous delta slope after lobe abandonment: (1) rapid erosion stage; (2) slow erosion stage; and (3) erosion-accumulation adjustment stage. According to 1:10,000 bathymetry data and high-resolution seismic profiles, diapirism in the subaqueous abandoned delta lobe is closely related to seabed erosion, which mainly occurs in the middle part of subaqueous delta slope. Diapirism results from the deformation of soft, fine-grained prodeltaic sedimentary stratum when the accumulation body on the soft stratum is removed in rapid erosion stage. The maximum accumulation centre in the delta lobe during growth coincides with the maximum erosion centre in the delta lobe abandonment phase. The diapir body occurs there. Distinguishing from diapirism in the Mississippi delta, three stages of the soft stratum deformation and diapirism are established in the Yellow River delta. The mobile strata and its diapirism are destructive to the offshore engineering facilities. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Of particular interest is the ability to programme the position and width of the spectral bands in flight. This allows a large set of applications, making the instrument concept also attractive for future Earth Watch missions.

A new method for estimating the spectral slope coefficient (S) was examined and found to give a closer fit for the measured absorption (92% reduction in sum of residuals) than the traditional method. The spectral pattern in residuals produced by the new technique enabled the identification of CDOM originating from areas of different land uses/types where S coefficients were similar. S values were found to behave conservatively with respect to salinity in all waters except for the off-shore North Sea region where CDOM from marine sources was suspected to have more influence. The specific absorption coefficient of CDOM did not vary significantly in Danish coastal waters. These waters are of particular interest in bio-optical studies as they allow the study of CDOM across a gradient from estuarine, brackish to near-oceanic environments. The results demonstrate that it is possible to develop regional models for the optical properties of CDOM which would then allow higher precision in remote sensing applications.

J	Moreno, JID; Agostini, VN; Caddy, JF; Carocci, F				Moreno, JID; Agostini, VN; Caddy, JF; Carocci, F			Is the pelagic-demersal ratio from fishery landings a useful proxy for nutrient availability? A preliminary data exploration for the semi-enclosed seas around Europe	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												In this comparative study of fishery production from 14 semi-enclosed marine statistical areas around Europe, GIS techniques were used to estimate some simple geographical parameters in both these areas and their surrounding catchments. Indices included the ratio of catchment area to sea area, chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) pigmentation intensity from remote sensing imagery and a simple index of the degree of geographical enclosure. These indices were compared with the ratio of pelagic to demersal plus invertebrate landings (the P/D ratio). The P/D ratio appears to be a proxy for the differential impact of nutrients on pelagic and benthic system, in that benthic/demersal components are negatively affected by hypoxia resulting from excess primary production, which has less negative effects, (or may even be positive), for pelagic fish production. P/D ratios shows a wide dynamic range from <1.0 for nutrient-limited or oligotrophic seas (e.g. the Aegean and Ionian) to 10 and more for more eutrophic water bodies such as the Black and Azov Seas. Chi-a appears related to the degree of enclosure, perhaps implying significant nutrient run-off from land, while the P/D ratio appears to be correlated with the mean Chl-a value.

J	Owen, RB; Zozulya, AA				Owen, RB; Zozulya, AA			In-line digital holographic sensor for monitoring and characterizing marine particulates	OPTICAL ENGINEERING												We report an in-line digital holographic sensor (DHS) for monitoring and characterizing marine particulates. This system images individual particles over a deep depth of field (>25 cm) with a resolution of 5 mu m. The DHS projects a collimated beam through the water column and onto a lensless CCD array. Some light is diffracted by particulates and forms an object beam; the undeflected remainder constitutes the reference beam. The two beams combine at the CCD array and create an in-line hologram, which is then numerically reconstructed. The DHS eliminates many problems traditionally associated with holography. The CCD recording material considerably lowers the exposure time and eliminates most vibration problems. The laser power needs are low; the DHS uses a small 10-mW diode laser. Rapid numerical reconstruction eliminates photographic processing and optical reconstruction. We successfully operated the DHS underwater on a remotely operated vehicle; our test results include tracing a single particle from one hologram to the next, thus deriving a velocity vector for marine mass transport. We outline our digital holographic reconstruction procedure, and present our graphical user interface and user software tools. The DHS is particularly useful for providing in situ ground-truth measurements for environmental remote sensing. (C) 2000 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

J	Joint, I; Groom, SB				Joint, I; Groom, SB			Estimation of phytoplankton production from space: current status and future potential of satellite remote sensing	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												A new generation of ocean colour satellites is now operational, with frequent observation of the global ocean. This paper reviews the potential to estimate marine primary production from satellite images. The procedures involved in retrieving estimates of phytoplankton biomass, as pigment concentrations, are discussed. Algorithms are applied to SeaWiFS ocean colour data to indicate seasonal variations in phytoplankton biomass in the Celtic Sea, on the continental shelf to the south west of the UK. Algorithms to estimate primary production rates from chlorophyll concentration are compared and the advantages and disadvantage discussed. The simplest algorithms utilise correlations between chlorophyll concentration and production rate and one equation is used to estimate daily primary production rates for the western English Channel and Celtic Sea; these estimates compare favourably with published values. Primary production for the central Celtic Sea in the period April to September inclusive is estimated from SeaWiFS data to be 102 gC m(-2) in 1998 and 93 gC m(-2) in 1999; published estimates, based on in situ incubations, are ca. 80 gC m(-2). The satellite data demonstrate large variations in primary production between 1998 and 1999, with a significant increase in late summer in 1998 which did not occur in 1999. Errors are quantified for the estimation of primary production from simple algorithms based on satellite-derived chlorophyll concentration.

Absorption at wavelengths outside this band (>460 nm) is dominated by accessory pigments and for the successful measurement of Chl a (e.g., 490:550 nm and 520:550 nm ratios) early Coastal Zone Color Scanner investigators speculated that these accessory pigments must covary with Chl a, although routine methods to measure these pigments had not yet been developed. Nearly 7,000 (high performance liquid chromatography) pigment samples, collected within the euphotic zone, were measured to test the consistency of the relationship between accessory pigments and Chl a. Despite the various sampling periods (1985-1998) and numerous geographic locations, consistent patterns have emerged in the ratios of the log accessory pigments to log total Chl a (TCHLA = Chl a, Chl a allomer, Chl a epimer, and chlorophyllide a). There were strong log-linear relationships within cruises for these ratios with an average r(2) of 0.889. An even moro impressive relationship was observed on a global scale when all the data were combined. individual relationships were also calculated for case I and case II waters, as well as for the first optical depth (K-1), termed the remote sensing depth. There were some statistical differences between these relationships, yet on a practical sense many could be combined. Despite a wide range of environments sampled, the overall slope of the log accessory pigments:log TCHLA was found to be 0.934 with a relative-difference root-mean-square error of 28% in log accessory pigment concentrations. This global log-linearity largely explains the success in remotely sensed Chl a algorithms, even though phyroplankton populations can vary in their composition and suite of pigments.

Airborne measurements and millimeter-wavelength cloud radar data are used to validate retrieved microphysical properties of three stratus cloud systems occurring in the April 1994 and 1997 intensive observation periods at the Southern Great Plains site. The addition of the observed cloud-top height into the Han and Westwater retrieval scheme eliminates the need to invoke the adiabatic assumption. Thus, the retrieved liquid water content (LWC) profile is represented as the product of an adiabatic LWC profile and a weighting function. Based on in situ measurements, two types of weighting functions are considered in this study: one is associated with a subadiabatic condition involving cloud-top entrainment mixing alone (type I) and the other accounts for both cloud-top entrainment mixing and drizzle effects (type II). The adiabatic cloud depth ratio (ACDR), defined as the ratio of the actual cloud depth to the one derived from the adiabatic assumption, is found to be a useful parameter for classifying the subadiabatic character of low-level stratiform clouds. The type I weighting function only exists in the lower ACDR regime, while the type II profile can appear for any adiabatic cloud depth ratio. Results indicate that the subadiabatic character of low-level stratiform clouds has substantial impacts on radiative energy budgets, especially those in the shortwave, via the retrieved LWC distribution and its related effective radius profile of liquid water Results also show that this subadiabatic character can act to stabilize the cloud deck by reducing the in-cloud radiative heating/cooling contrast. As a whole, these impacts strengthen as the subadiabatic character of low-level stratiform clouds increases.				chuang, cathy/H-4814-2012													0027-0644					JUL	2000	128	7	2				2511	2527		10.1175/1520-0493(2000)128<2511:AMRSFC>2.0.CO;2								WOS:000166058500008						
J	Sigernes, F; Lorentzen, DA; Heia, K; Svenoe, T				Sigernes, F; Lorentzen, DA; Heia, K; Svenoe, T			Multipurpose spectral imager	APPLIED OPTICS												A small spectral imaging system is presented that images static or moving objects simultaneously as a function of wavelength. The main physical principle is outlined and demonstrated. The instrument is capable of resolving both spectral and spatial information from targets throughout the entire visible region. The spectral domain has a bandpass of 12 Angstrom. One can achieve the spatial domain by rotating the system's front mirror with a high-resolution stepper motor. The spatial resolution range from millimeters to several meters depends mainly on the front optics used and whether the target is fixed (static) or movable relative to the instrument. Different applications and examples are explored, including outdoor landscapes, industrial fish-related targets, and ground-level objects observed in the more traditional way from an airborne carrier (remote sensing). Through the examples, we found that the instrument correctly classifies whether a shrimp is peeled and whether it can disclose the spectral and spatial microcharacteristics of targets such as a fish nematode (parasite). In the macroregime, we were able to distinguish a marine vessel from the surrounding sea and sky. A study of the directional spectral albedo from clouds, mountains, snow cover, and vegetation has also been included. With the airborne experiment, the imager successfully classified snow cover, leads, and new and raft ed ice, as seen from 10.000 ft (3.048 m). (C) 2000 Optical Society of America.

J	Kitsiou, D; Karydis, M				Kitsiou, D; Karydis, M			Categorical mapping of marine eutrophication based on ecological indices	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The present work is concerned with the development of methodological procedures for studying the spatial distribution of eutrophication in the marine environment. Seven ecological indices (S, number of phytoplankton species; N, total number of individuals; D-Mg, Margalef's index; D-Mn, Menhinick's index; D-Od, Odum's species per thousand individuals; H', Shannon's Diversity index; E, Evenness index), based on phytoplankton community data collected from Saronicos Gulf, Greece were used for describing the eutrophication state of the sea environment. A representation of the spatial distribution for each ecological index was developed using the Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation method. A eutrophication scale for each index was also developed for indicating four different trophic levels in the marine environment (eutrophic, upper-mesotrophic, lower-mesotrophic, oligotrophic); categorization of the interpolated values of each index resulted in a clear illustration of these trophic levels on seven thematic maps. Two methodological procedures were finally applied for synthesizing the information of these thematic maps. The purpose was the development of a final map illustrating the spatial distribution of eutrophication in the study area. The first procedure was based on the integration of unsupervised and supervised classification methods, widely used in the field of remote sensing, while the second one on the overlay technique, simply carried out within the frame of a Geographical Information System (GIS). The hybrid unsupervised/supervised classification method can assess the optimal number of classes in which data values from simultaneously considered parameters could be allocated, while the overlay technique is an additive procedure not taking into account existing trends in the dataset. The advantages and disadvantages of each procedure are further discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The sensing system included a combination electrode, pH meter and portable computer powered by a marine battery. Temperature and pH information from the pH meter were acquired every 10 min and stored in the computer. The two ponds, located within 2 km of one another, have a different average pH and sensitivity to acid precipitation. Maquan Pond has an average pH of 6.0 and an alkalinity of 7.4 mg/l, while Furnace Pond has an average pH of 6.9 and alkalinity of 14.9 mg/l. The pH of both ponds varied seasonally and showed diel changes due to the photosynthetic and respiratory activity of aquatic organisms. Precipitation events did not change the pH of Furnace Pond. Maquan Pond on the other hand, did exhibit changes in surface water pH due to specific acidic precipitation events. During certain rainstorms, the pH of Maquan surface waters dropped to values as low as pH 4. In addition to the transient changes in pH, the acid-sensitive pond also exhibited differences in planktonic distribution patterns. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Roff, JC; Taylor, ME				Roff, JC; Taylor, ME			National frameworks for marine conservation - A hierarchical geophysical approach	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. Development of environmental protected areas has been driven 'more by opportunity than design, scenery rather than science' (Hackman A. 1993. Preface. A protected areas gap analysis methodology: planning for the conservation of biodiversity. World Wildlife Fund Canada Discussion Paper: i-ii). If marine environments are to be protected from the adverse effects of human activities, then identification of types of marine habitats and delineation of their boundaries in a consistent classification is required. Without such a classification system, the extent and significance of representative or distinctive habitats cannot be recognized. Such recognition is a fundamental prerequisite to the determination of location and size of marine areas to be protected. 2. A hierarchical classification has been developed based on enduring/recurrent geophysical (oceanographic and physiographic) features of the marine environment, which identifies habitat types that reflect changes in biological composition. Important oceanographic features include temperature, stratification and exposure; physiographic features include bottom relief and substrate type. 3. Classifications based only on biological data are generally prohibited at larger scales, due to lack of information. Therefore, We are generally obliged to classify habitat types as surrogates for community types. The data necessary for this classification are available from mapped sources and from remote sensing. It is believed they can be used to identify representative and distinctive marine habitats supporting different communities. and will provide an ecological framework for marine conservation planning at the national level.

This model is based on the linear response from water-leaving to satellite-detected reflectance spectra, simply reflected by the gradient for correlation curve between reflectance of the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) channels 1 (R-1, 580-680 nm) and 2 (R-2, 720-1 100 nm). Proportional factor for this gradient transiting, mathematically represented as (t(d2)/t(d1)) (t(oz2)/f(oz1)), depends on a ratio of atmospheric transmittance for such two channels, including ozone and diffuse transmittance. As a simple but efficient algorithm of gradient, the algorithm of alpha R-1-R-2 is selected to retrieve gradient a and then sea surface suspendend sediment concentration.																	1001-6538					MAY	2000	45	10					925	931		10.1007/BF02886202								WOS:000088416300014						
J	Dunbar, JA; Allen, PM; Higley, PD				Dunbar, JA; Allen, PM; Higley, PD			Color-encoding multifrequency acoustic data for near-bottom studies	GEOPHYSICS												In this paper we describe color encoding methods far combining acoustic data in widely separate spectral hands into composite displays. These new display methods better image the near-bottom interval in fine-grained depositional environments. In fine-grained depositional environments the water bottom is typically not a discrete surface but is a transition zone spanning 1-3 m. This near-bottom interval is not completely imaged by either fathometers or subbottom profilers alone. Multiple acoustic frequencies spanning both the fathometer and subbottom bands are needed for applications in which the detalis of the near bottom are critical. Such applications include surveys of water reservoirs, scour around bridge piers, and predredging surveys in harbors To make effective use of the multifrequency data, we combine three or more signal frequencies into composite false color displays by adapting multispectral photography methods used in optical remote sensing. One approach is to en-code amplitudes of traces recorded with three different source frequencies as the red, green, and blue intensities of the false color display. In a second approach, more than three signal frequencies are combined by computing weights for red, green, and blue for each frequency through a principal-component transformation of the data. We use both color encoding approaches in a field example from a water reservoir and in simulated examples based on a convolutional model of near-bottom reflectivity. In these examples, color-encoded displays of multifrequency data improve resolution of interfaces within the near-bottom interval over that of the corresponding single-frequency displays. Changes in the near-bottom frequency response with Sediment type also suggest that color encoding of different signal bands has the potential for improved sediment type classification within the near-bottom interval. The principal component display approach offers a method for automatically adjusting the frequency content within a single display to account for widely varying bottom conditions.																	0016-8033					MAY-JUN	2000	65	3					994	1002		10.1190/1.1444795								WOS:000087656200027						
J	Carleton, AM; Song, YD				Carleton, AM; Song, YD			Satellite passive sensing of the marine atmosphere associated with cold-air mesoscale cyclones	PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHER												Contemporary research into extratropical cloud systems optimizes the increase in resolution of visible (VIS) and thermal infra-red (IR) sensors, and the ability to retrieve wind and atmospheric moisture variables at mesoscales using microwave radiometry. These passively-acquired remote sensing data are used to develop synoptic climatological (conceptual and simple statistical) "models" of mesoscale cyclones in cold-air outbreaks (mesocyclones, "polar lows") occurring over the otherwise data-void southern oceans. Mesocyclones present a limitation to successful weather forecasting for New Zealand and coastal Chile, southern Australia and South Africa, during the cold season. The synoptic climatological analyses show that: 1) the patterns of mesocyclone cloud vortex origins, movement and dissipation ("mesocyclone regimes"), exhibit spatial dependence and have associations with upper-ocean conditions; 2) mesocyclone "outbreaks" are embedded within characteristic larger-scale anomaly fields of tropospheric pressure, height, and layer thickness (mean temperature); and 3) composite (statistical average) models of cloud system structure based on the microwave retrievals of marine weather reveal mesocyclones to be relatively dry in comparison with synoptic cyclones, yet very windy. These analyses should permit the development of methods to better predict these important cold-season storms over southern middle latitudes, and a fuller assessment of their significance for the larger hydroclimatic system.																	0033-0124	1467-9272				MAY	2000	52	2					289	306		10.1111/0033-0124.00225								WOS:000087120600012

Size distribution spectra measured over the ocean near Sagres (Portugal), on-board the Research Vessel Vodyanitsky and on-board the Avion de Recherche Atmospherique et Teledetection (ARAT) have been used to parameterize the aerosol vertical distribution. This parameterization, which is essential to the analysis of airborne lidar measurements, has been validated via closure experiments on extinction coefficient profiles and aerosol optical depth (AOD). During the studied event, AOD's retrieved from lidar measurements at 0.73 mu m range between 0.055 and 0.10. The parameterized aerosol vertical distribution has been used to shift AOD retrievals from 0.73 to 0.55 mu m to enable comparison with other remote sensing instruments. At the latter wavelength, AOD's retrieved from lidar measurements range between 0.08 and 0.14. An agreement better than 20% is obtained between AOD's derived from lidar and sunphotometer measurements made at the same time and place over the ocean near the coast. However, large differences are observed with the AOD estimated from Meteosat imagery in the same area. These differences are thought to be caused by large uncertainties associated with the Meteosat sensitivity for small AOD's or by the presence of thin scattered clouds. Lidar-derived particulate extinction profiles and scattering coefficient profiles measured by a nephelometer mounted on the ARAT, in a different part of the plume, were found in good agreement, which could be an indication that absorption by pollution aerosols is small and/or that soot is present in small amounts in the European pollution plume. Lidar measurements have also been used to differentiate the contribution of different aerosol layers to the total AOD. It is shown that the AOD in the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) can contribute as much as 70% of the total AOD in some regions. At 0.73 mu m, the AOD in the continental plume was observed to diminish with the distance to the coastline from 0.04 to 0.03.

J	Krotkov, NA; Vasilkov, AP				Krotkov, NA; Vasilkov, AP			Reduction of skylight reflection effects in the above-water measurement of diffuse marine reflectance: comment	APPLIED OPTICS												Use of a vertical polarizer has been suggested to reduce the effects of surface reflection in the above-water measurements of marine reflectance. We suggest using a similar technique for airborne or spaceborne sensors when atmospheric scattering adds its own polarization signature to the upwelling radiance. Our own theoretical sensitivity study supports the recommendation of Fougnie et al. [Appl. Opt. 38, 3844 (1999)] (40-50 degrees vertical angle and azimuth angle near 135 degrees, polarizer parallel to the viewing plane) for above-water measurements. However, the optimal viewing directions land the optimal orientation of the polarizer) change with altitude above the sea surface, solar angle, and atmospheric vertical optical structure. A polarization efficiency function is introduced, which shows the maximal possible polarization discrimination of the background radiation for an arbitrary altitude above the sea surface, viewing direction, and solar angle. Our comment is meant to encourage broader application of airborne and spaceborne polarization sensors in remote sensing of water and sea surface properties.

The vertically uniform model is thus compared to the adiabatic stratified one. The validation of the adiabatic model is based on simultaneous measurements of cloud microphysical parameters in situ and cloud radiative properties from above the cloud layer with a multispectral radiometer. In particular, the observations demonstrate that the dependency of cloud optical thickness on cloud geometrical thickness is larger than predicted with the vertically uniform model and that it is in agreement with the prediction of the adiabatic one. Numerical simulations of the radiative transfer have been performed to establish the equivalence between the two models in terms of the effective radius. They show that the equivalent effective radius of a vertically uniform model is between 80% and 100% of the effective radius at the top of an adiabatic stratified model. The relationship depends, in fact, upon the cloud geometrical thickness and droplet concentration. Remote sensing measurements of cloud radiances in the visible and near infrared are then examined at the scale of a cloud system for a marine case and the most polluted case sampled during the second Aerosol Characterization Experiment. The distributions of the measured values are significantly different between the two cases. This constitutes observational evidence of the aerosol indirect effect at the scale of a cloud system. Finally, the adiabatic stratified model is used to develop a procedure for the retrieval of cloud geometrical thickness and cloud droplet number concentration from the measurements of cloud radiances. It is applied to the marine and to the polluted cases. The retrieved values of droplet concentration are significantly underestimated with respect to the values measured in situ. Despite this discrepancy the procedure is efficient at distinguishing the difference between the two cases.

An airborne scanning low frequency microwave radiometer provided the first fine spatial resolution description of the surface salinity held in Florida Bay, USA. Low salinity levels to the north and central region of the Bay indicated freshwater inflows from the Everglades, while marine conditions influenced by the Gulf of Mexico waters prevailed in the western (outer) region of the Bay. Bio-optical variables such as chlorophyll a, suspended solids, coloured dissolved organic matter(yellow substance) and remote sensing reflectance exhibited different distribution patterns in the low and high salinity regions of the Bay.

We present seasonal time series data of chlorophyll a, primary productivity and in-water irradiance measured in the coastal waters of the Western Antarctica Peninsula and build upon existing models to provide a more optimum parameterization for the estimation of primary productivity in Antarctic coastal waters. These and other data provide strong evidence that bio-optical characteristics and phytoplankton productivity in Antarctic waters an different from temperate waters. For these waters we show that over 60% of the variability in primary production can be explained by the surface chlorophyll a concentration alone, a characteristic, which lends itself to remote sensing models. if chlorophyll a concentrations are accurately determined, then the largest source of error 13-18) results from estimates of the photoadaptive variable (P-opt(B)). Further, the overall magnitude of P-opt(B) is low (median 1.09 mg C mg chl(-1) h(-1)) for these data compared to other regions and generally fits that expected for a cold water system. However, the variability of P-opt(B) over the course of a season (0.4 to 3 mg C mg chl(-1) h(-1)) is not consistently correlated with other possible environmental parameters, such as chlorophyll, sea surface temperature, incident irradiance, day length, salinity, or taxonomic composition. Nonetheless, by tuning a standard depth- integrated primary productivity model to fit representative P-opt(B) values and the relatively uniform chlorophyll-normalized production profile found in these waters, we can improve the model to account for approximately 72-73% variability in primary production both for our data as well as for independent historic Antarctic data.																	0954-1020					MAR	2000	12	1					20	32										WOS:000086625500004						
J	Cole, J				Cole, J			Coastal sea surface temperature and coho salmon production off the north-west United States	FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY												A time Series of mean weekly sea surface temperature (SST) images was used to investigate the relationship between fluctuations in the marine survival of hatchery-reared coho salmon and coastal ocean dynamics off the north-western United States (51 degrees to 37 degrees N) between 1985 and 1996, using univariate and nonlinear bivariate regression analysis. Ocean conditions were matched against survival for a number of different annual time frames according to the sum of negative or positive weekly SST anomalies. From the univariate analyses, the sum of negative anomalies from April to June, when the juvenile salmon first enter the ocean, was found to have an R-2 of 0.88 against survival with 1991 excluded as an outlier. The bivariate multiple regressions used the sum of negative anomalies from April to lune as the first independent variable. When the sums of positive anomalies from the following periods during the fishes' second calendar year in the ocean were each used as the second independent variable, the R-2 Values were all greater than or equal to 0.92 (with no data points excluded): January to June, February to lune, April to June, March to lune. These results are discussed within the context of coastal ocean processes. It is concluded that the analysis of SST image time series might allow management to make reasonable forecasts of hatchery-reared coho salmon survival.																	1054-6006					MAR	2000	9	1					1	16		10.1046/j.1365-2419.2000.00118.x								WOS:000087552000001

While direct sensing techniques provide good data, they are limited in their temporal and spatial scope. There is a need for assessing the three-dimensional (3-D) time-varying refractivity structure. Recently published results (Gingras et al, [1]) indicate that matched-field processing methods hold promise for remotely sensing the refractive profile structure between an emitter and receive array, This paper is aimed at precisely quantifying the performance one can expect with matched-held processing methods for remote sensing of the refractivity structure using signal strength measurements from a single emitter to an array of radio receivers. The performance is determined,ia simulation and is evaluated as a function of: 1) the aperture of the receive array; 2) the refractivity profile model; and 3) the objective function used in the optimization. Refractivity profile estimation results are provided for a surface-based duct example, an elevated duct example, and a sequence of time-varying refractivity profiles. The refractivity profiles used were based on radiosonde measurements collected off the coast of southern California.

The potential of the investigation method is assessed for delineating geologically meaningful stratifications in the shallow subsurface. The fundamentals of the GPR technique are described. Penetration depth and vertical resolution depends on the soil conditions, the characteristics of input signal and the configuration of the transmitter-receiver assembly. In the studied carbonates the penetration level is rather good and the electromagnetic signal reaches up to 1000 nanoseconds maximum (i.e. approximately 55 m). Several depositional units are outlined on the GPR profiles. Six different lithological units are recognised with distinct GPR reflection characteristics. The profiles illustrate the internal 3D organisation of the carbonate platform and its geometry. They provide detailed insight into the nature of an Oxfordian reefal build-up. The high-resolution subsurface model is directly calibrated with geological field observations and it results in a predictive 3D depositional working model. The GPR method is a non-destructive remote sensing technique that is cost effective. The method is considered complementary to other conventional high-resolution reservoir characterisation studies. It represents a powerful investigation tool in earth science studies concerning the imaging of the structure of the shallow subsurface. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Miles, NL; Verlinde, J; Clothiaux, EE				Miles, NL; Verlinde, J; Clothiaux, EE			Cloud droplet size distributions in low-level stratiform clouds	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												A database of stratus cloud droplet (diameter <50 mu m) size distribution parameters, derived from in situ data reported in the existing literature, was created, facilitating intercomparison among datasets and quantifying typical values and their variability. From the datasets, which were divided into marine and continental groups, several parameters are presented, including the total number concentration, effective diameter, mean diameter standard deviation of the droplet diameters about the mean diameter, and liquid water content, as well as the parameters of modified gamma and lognormal distributions. In light of these results, the appropriateness of common assumptions used in remote sensing of cloud droplet size distributions is discussed. For example, vertical profiles of mean diameter, effective diameter, and liquid water content agreed qualitatively with expectations based on the current paradigm of cloud formation. Whereas parcel theory predicts that the standard deviation about the mean diameter should decrease with height, the results illustrated that the standard deviation generally increases with height, A feature common to all marine clouds was their approximately constant total number concentration profiles: however, the total number concentration profiles of continental clouds were highly variable. Without cloud condensation nuclei spectra, classification of clouds into marine and continental groups is based on indirect methods. After reclassification of four sets of measurements in the database, there was a fairly clear dichotomy between marine and continental clouds, but a great deal of variability within each classification. The relevant applications of this study lie in radiative transfer and climate issues, rather than in cloud formation and dynamics. Techniques that invert remotely sensed measurements into cloud droplet size distributions frequently rely on a priori assumptions, such as constant number concentration profiles and constant spectral width. The results of this paper provide a basis for evaluating the sensitivity of these techniques. In particular, there were large enough differences in observed droplet spectral widths to significantly affect remotely sensed determinations of cloud microphysics.

The new remote sensor is composed of three parts: a main instrument with a portable computer, an antenna with an amplifier and an external power. The new remote sensing technique is characterized by good stability and reproducibility at the same spot but at different times and high sensitivity and high signal-to-noise ratio, and can reveal geological and lithologic boundaries as well as strata and related mineral sources. Two years of marine geological experiments on this technique have indicated that it can solve many problems in marine geological exploration, e.g. the burial depths of sea-floor mud, Quaternary sediments and submarine structures. This technique can be applied to detecting the sea bed depth and submarine sediment thickness.

J	Winokur, RS				Winokur, RS			SAR symposium keynote address	JOHNS HOPKINS APL TECHNICAL DIGEST												Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can provide perspective ai the Earth's surface that is nearly unique in scientific remote sensing studies. From the 1978 Seasat (which provided the first intriguing images of ocean features) to present systems, spaceborne SAR has demonstrated the capability to image the Earth's ocean and land features over broad areas, day and night, and under most weather conditions. Civil research has included studies of ocean dynamics, marine meteorology, and sea ice monitoring; terrestrial research has included agriculture, mapping and charting, and resource management. But is SAR ready to make the transition from a scientific research tool to an operational sensor! To be truly operational, a SAR system must have continuity of observations, timeliness of data delivery, and usable products.																	0270-5214					JAN-MAR	2000	21	1					5	11										WOS:000085289300002						
J	Brown, RA				Brown, RA			Serendipity in the use of satellite scatterometer, SAR, and other sensor data	JOHNS HOPKINS APL TECHNICAL DIGEST												When marine geophysical measurements reach resolutions of ten to hundreds of meters over 1000-km regions, a new realm of analysis is opened. Such data did not exist Drier to Seasat in 1978. However, the value of these data has been neglected for almost two decades. The reasons are many: Star Wars, modeler indifference, fear of a new form of data where empiricism reigns, and numerical model mysticism. Now the Seasat microwave sensors, finally including synthetic aperture radar (SAR), are coming of age. Organized large eddies (OLEs) that are endemic to the geophysical planetary boundary-layer (PBL) solution exemplify the new phenomena that are revealed in SAR data. Theory for OLEs has existed for 30 years. If they are truly as common as SAR data suggest, then Geophysical Climate Model PBLs must be improved, buoy data corrected, anti climatology revised.																	0270-5214					JAN-MAR	2000	21	1					21	26										WOS:000085289300004						
J	Young, GS				Young, GS			SAR signatures of the marine atmospheric boundary layer: Implications for numerical forecasting	JOHNS HOPKINS APL TECHNICAL DIGEST												Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) offers the potential for 10 to 100 times higher-resolution remote sensing of the wind field at sea than is possible with spaceborne scatterometers. With this enhanced resolution comes new opportunities for quantitative analysis of marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) processes. In particular, SAR's ability to resolve much of the turbulence spectrum permits quantitative diagnosis of air-sea fluxes as well as the depth and stability of the MABL. Because the cost of a SAR satellite is closely linked to its resolution, it is essential to examine the minimum resolution required for each of these capabilities. The well-known similarity forms of the MABL's wind speed spectrum provide the basis for this evaluation.																	0270-5214					JAN-MAR	2000	21	1					27	32										WOS:000085289300005

For this purpose, different algorithms were developed and tested using SAR images from two European Remote Sensing satellites. In this article, the methods for deriving wind fields from SAR data are introduced. The wind directions are extracted from wind-induced streaks visible on most SAR images. Wind speeds are derived from the normalised radar cross section by applying an empirical C-Land model. The different sources of error in wind retrieval that must be considered are discussed with respect to Radarsat/ScanSAR data. Furthermore, SAR-retrieved ocean surface winds are used to investigate the spatial variation of winds at different scales.																	0270-5214					JAN-MAR	2000	21	1					100	107										WOS:000085289300015

This paper addresses the use of space techniques for remote sensing of the ocean, in the context of how marine environmental risks may be monitored. Since there are several significant differences between remote sensing over land and over sea, the techniques specific to ocean observation are first reviewed, identifying what can be measured from space and what are the sampling capabilities and inherent limitations. Ocean environmental risks are then identified at global, regional and local scales, and serve as examples of how space techniques can be used to address them. Finally operational environmental monitoring and risk management is shown to require an integrated approach using models and measurements from space and at sea.																	0169-3298						2000	21	2-3					317	328		10.1023/A:1006702529338								WOS:000167731800018

Microcosm simulations	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The influence of the melting of Antarctic sea ice on the planktonic microbial food web and the formation of microalgal blooms was investigated under controlled laboratory conditions in 20 1 microcosms at the onset of austral spring in the southern Atlantic. Experiments were performed with first-year ice and water from the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and the ACC-Weddell Gyre Boundary (AWB) at 6 degrees W, a region usually lacking ice-edge blooms in austral spring. The experiments comprised the following simulations: (1) stratification of the water column, (2) seeding of sympagic organisms, (3) inoculation of dissolved organic matter from sea ice and (4) grazing impact of mesozooplankton (Calanoides acutus). Microcosms were sampled almost daily over a 2 wk period. The samples were analyzed for inorganic nutrient concentrations, primary and bacterial production, abundances of algae (in the size classes <20 and >20 mu m), bacteria and heterotrophic flagellates (in the size classes <2, 2 to 10 and 10 to 20 mu m). Additionally, maximum uptake rates of glucose and aminopeptidase activity were measured. Stratification alone did not induce bloom formation within the time scale of the experiments. Simulated seeding of sympagic organisms provoked a strong increase in abundances and activities of auto- and heterotrophic microbes and the development of microalgal blooms (cells >20 mu m). Primary and bacterial production was enhanced up to 28- and 24-fold, respectively, compared to the control, while abundances increased by a factor of about 20 for microalgae and 12 for bacteria. Initial high activities of auto- and heterotrophs were restricted to sympagic organisms, which maintained their high metabolic rates for several days. Addition of dissolved organic substances mainly stimulated the pelagic bacterial populations. Their production was enhanced up to 12-fold compared to the control, while autotrophs were virtually unaffected. In the presence of mesozooplankton, bacterial blooms occurred but no accumulation of nano- and microalgae. Thus, this region of the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean does have a strong potential for the formation of ice-edge blooms, but phytoplankton accumulation is efficiently controlled by grazing activity. Bacterial blooms may be more common during ice melt. These findings agree with remote-sensing data, which show no bloom formation during ice melt in this area.

This article presents a method for deriving the bottom albedo from the TM in coastal waters. Our study of historical TM images shows degradation of the sensor through time. Pattern noise in the imagery in Bands 2 and 3 was analyzed and removed using a combination of Fourier filtering and edge-detection techniques. Noise was first examined over clear and deep nearby oceanic waters, and the filter algorithms developed there were applied to the entire image. To estimate water-leaving radiance from the satellite sensor, Rayleigh and aerosol path radiance were removed. Radiance due to aerosol scattering was calculated for offshore pixels assuming a marine aerosol type, and it was removed as a constant from the entire scene. The TM sensor calibration was validated by comparing water-leaving radiance values over the clear waters of the Florida current with known, normalized water-leaving radiance values. Corrections for water path radiance and water-column attenuation of bottom-reflected radiance were made for regions of known depth, allowing the bottom albedo and vegetative pixel fraction to be determined for shallow reef areas in the Florida Keys.

First results of our analysis reveal that the seas are most polluted along the main shipping routes. The sizes of the detected oil spills vary between < 0.1 km(2) and > 56 km(2). SAR images acquired during descending (morning) and ascending (evening) satellite passes show different percentages of oil pollution, because most of this pollution occurs during night time and is still visible on the SAR images acquired in the morning time. Moreover, we found a higher amount of oil spills on SAR images acquired during summer (April-September) than on SAR images acquired during winter (October-March). We attribute this finding to the higher mean wind speed encountered in all three test areas during winter. By using an ERS-2 SAR image of the North Sea test area we show how the reduction of the normalized radar backscattering cross section (NRCS) by an oil spill depends on wind speed.

Six cases, each of about 12 hours duration, are examined; three of these cases are characteristic of nondrizzling boundary layers and three of drizzling boundary layers. In all cases, microphysical retrievals are only performed when drizzle is negligible (radar reflectivity <-17 dBZ). It is shown that for the cases examined, there is, in general, no correlation between drop concentration and cloud base updraft strength, although for two of the nondrizzling cases exhibiting more classical stratocumulus features, these two parameters are correlated. On drizzling days, drop concentration and cloud-base vertical velocity were either not correlated or negatively correlated. There is a significant positive correlation between drop concentration and mean in-cloud vertical velocity variance for both nondrizzling boundary layers (correlation coefficient r = 0.45) and boundary layers that have experienced drizzle (r = 0.38). In general, there is a high correlation (r > 0.5) between radar reflectivity and in-cloud vertical velocity variance, although one of the boundary layers that experienced drizzle exhibited a negative correlation between these parameters. However, in the subcloud region, all boundary layers that experienced drizzle exhibit a negative correlation between radar reflectivity and vertical velocity variance.

Thirty-one river catchments drain directly into the waters of the Great Barrier Reef; NE Australia. This case study was undertaken on the floodplain of the Herbert River catchment in north Queensland, utilizing remote sensing and GIS to assess both spatial and temporal changes in freshwater wetlands and riparian forests. We demonstrate that there has been a very large reduction in the area of these ecosystems since European settlement in the mid nineteenth century, with an 80% decline in their extent since 1943. We provide a range of quantitative measures to show that the landscape diversity of these ecosystems has also declined. These changes are of importance in terms of regional, national and international trends. We argue that policy, planning and management reform is required if the remaining ecological, economic and social values of these systems and the adjacent Great Barrier Reef Marine Park are to be maintained.																	0376-8929					SEP	1999	26	3					229	235		10.1017/S0376892999000314								WOS:000083565600011

Lower backscatter conditions appearing in the SAR imagery after the onset of upwelling demonstrate the influence of the upwelling regime on the sea surface roughness. Satellite sea surface temperature (SST) observations and in-situ sea temperature vertical profiles confirm upwelling conditions, Three key mechanisms are suggested to explain the lower radar returns observed under upwelling conditions, an increase in the atmospheric marine boundary layer stability, an increase in the viscosity of surface waters, and the presence of biogenic surfactants in the upwelling region.

J	Voulgaris, G; Workman, M; Collins, MB				Voulgaris, G; Workman, M; Collins, MB			Measurement techniques of shingle transport in the nearshore zone	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												New, innovative techniques are presented for the detection of shingle movement. A passive acoustic technique is used for the remote sensing of instantaneous gravel motion in shallow offshore areas. Noise created by the intercollision of moving particles (self-generated noise, SGN) is proportional to the transport rate. This approach is used in conjunction with measurements of waves and currents in the benthic boundary layer, to study processes associated with shingle transport. The SGN method can be used in tidally-dominated areas and those experiencing shoaling (nonbreaking) waves; its use in the surf zone (beaches) is limited, due to increased ambient noise levels caused by wave breaking. A new shingle tracing technique has been developed, based upon the implantation of a miniature electronic transmitter into a shingle particle (of the same shape and specific gravity as the indigenous sediment population). This "transmitting pebble" can be detected remotely over a beach, to depths of burial of up to 70cm, offering high (80%) recovery rates, Application of the techniques developed have demonstrated the enhancing role of the waves in offshore shingle transport processes; modification of existing (steady current) shingle transport formulae are suggested, for use in the marine environment. Longshore shingle transport, in the surf zone, can be calculated using the energy flux equation, originally derived for sand. The coefficient (K) is shown to be constant for gravel particle sizes (D-50 > 20mm) and equal to 0.017.

The wave field images provided by the radars are sampled and analysed by a wave monitoring system (called WaMoS II) developed by the German research institute GKSS. This measuring system can be mounted on a ship. on offshore stations or at coastal locations. The measurement is based on the backscatter of microwaves from the ocean surface, which is visible as 'sea clutter' on the radar screen. From this observable sea clutter, a numerical analysis is carried out. The unambiguous directional wave spectrum, the surface currents and sea state parameters such as wave periods, wave lengths, and wave directions can be derived. To provide absolute wave heights, the response of the nautical radar must be calibrated. Similar to the wave height estimations for Synthetic Aperture Radars, the so-called 'Signal to Noise Ratio' leads to the determination of the significant wave height (H-S). In this paper, WaMoS II results are compared with directional buoy data to show the capabilities of nautical microwave radars for sea state measurements. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Although such a parameterization would have obvious operational advantages, the considerable scatter present between experiments, or within any one experiment, indicates that it is not easily achievable. One likely candidate for much of the scatter is the underlying wave field. Unfortunately, few campaigns over the years have included spectral measurements of the waves. Among those that have, the results are inconclusive. Here data are presented from the Surface Wave Dynamics Experiment and High Resolution Remote Sensing Program campaigns in which 3-m discus buoys were instrumented with K-Gill and sonic anemometers and complete motion packages to measure the direct (eddy correlation) stress and, concurrently, the directional ocean wave spectrum. These data are examined for the effects of swell on the drag coefficient. It is found that much of the scatter in the drag coefficient can be attributed to geophysical effects, such as the presence of swells or nonstationary conditions.

With the understanding that ocean research is often very costly, yet deemed extremely important by large funding agencies, geographers now have the opportunity to perform coastal and marine studies that are more quantitative in nature, to formulate and test basic hypotheses about the marine environment and to collaborate with geographers working in corollary subdisciplines (e.g., remote sensing, GIS, geomorphology, political geography as pertaining to the Law of the Sea, etc.), as well as with classically-trained oceanographers. This article reviews, for the non-specialist, the newest advances in mapping and management technologies for undersea geographic research (particularly on the ocean floor) and discusses the contributions that geographers stand to make to a greater understanding of the oceans.

J	Kracker, LM				Kracker, LM			The geography of fish: The use of remote sensing and spatial analysis tools in fisheries research	PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHER												Rather than seeing the oceans as an expansive void, researchers using acoustic technologies can detect the heterogeneity of biological resources and view the marine environment as a three-dimensional landscape. Underwater remote sensing, using acoustics, provides high resolution maps of the spatial distribution of organisms in aquatic ecosystems. Analyzing the spatial pattern of species distribution within the water column and the impact of that organization on ecological processes bridges the fields of fisheries and spatial analysis. Tools and concepts familiar to geographers, such as remote sensing, GIS, and landscape ecology, contribute to the investigation of large lake and marine ecosystems.																	0033-0124					AUG	1999	51	3					440	450		10.1111/0033-0124.00178								WOS:000081714000010

The boundary layer structure clearly resembled that of a cloud-topped mixed layer, and the cloud content is shown to be near adiabatic up to the cloud-top entrainment zone. A cloud retrieval algorithm using the radar reflectivity and cloud droplet concentration (either measured in situ or deduced using dual-channel microwave radiometer data) is applied to construct uniquely high-resolution cross sections of liquid water content and mean droplet radius. The combined evidence indicates that the 350-600 m deep, slightly supercooled (2.0 degrees to -2.0 degrees C) cloud, which failed to produce any detectable ice or drizzle particles, contained an average droplet concentration of 347 cm(-3), and a maximum liquid water content of 0.8 g m(-3) and mean droplet radius of 9 mu m near cloud top. Lidar data indicate that the K-a-band radar usually detected the cloud-base height to within similar to 50 m, such that the radar insensitivity to small cloud droplets had a small impact on the findings. Radar-derived liquid water paths ranged from 71 to 259 g m(-2) as the stratus deck varied, which is in excellent agreement with dual-channel microwave radiometer data, but similar to 20% higher than that measured in situ. This difference appears to be due to the undersampling of the few largest cloud droplets by the aircraft probes. This combination of approaches yields a unique image of the content of a continental stratus cloud, as well as illustrating the utility of modern remote sensing systems for probing nonprecipitating water clouds.

J	Pinkerton, MH; Aiken, J				Pinkerton, MH; Aiken, J			Calibration and validation of remotely sensed observations of ocean color from a moored data buoy	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY												Satellite remote sensing of ocean color has the potential to map global surface phytoplankton concentrations at rates of up to once per day, providing wide-area data on a number of fundamental ocean processes relating to biological production, air-sea exchange of biogenic greenhouse gases: climate change, and living resources. There remain a number of problems in the technique, including the possible decline of satellite-sensor sensitivity over time and the difficulty of correcting for light detected by the satellite sensor that originated from the atmosphere. To overcome these problems, the new generation of ocean-color sensors must be coupled with an extensive calibration and validation program. In this study, the authors report on progress to develop a methodology to measure water-leaving radiance and incident irradiance from a moored buoy in order to effect vicarious calibration and validation of ocean-color satellite data at a rate of up to twice daily. The Plymouth Marine Bio-Optical Data Buoy, which became operational on 19 April 1997, is assessed against rigorous specifications for surface and in-water radiometers and is shown to be capable of making high-quality optical measurements for a fraction of the cost associated with other calibration-validation projects.																	0739-0572	1520-0426				JUL	1999	16	7					915	923		10.1175/1520-0426(1999)016<0915:CAVORS>2.0.CO;2								WOS:000081507700011

For maximum reduction of effects, radiometric measurements should be made at a viewing zenith angle of similar to 45 degrees (near the Brewster angle) and a relative azimuth angle between solar and viewing directions greater than 90 degrees (backscattering), preferably 135 degrees. In this case the residual reflected skylight in the polarized signal exhibits minimum sensitivity to the sea state and can be corrected to within a few 10(-4) in reflectance units. For most oceanic waters the resulting relative error on the diffuse marine reflectance in the blue and green is less than 1%. Since the water body polarizes incident skylight, the measured polarized reflectance differs from the total reflectance. The difference, however, is small for the considered geometry. Measurements made at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography pier in La Jolla, Calif, with a specifically designed scanning polarization radiometer, confirm the theoretical findings and demonstrate the usefulness of polarization radiometry for measuring diffuse marine reflectance.

J	Rast, M; Bezy, JL; Bruzzi, S				Rast, M; Bezy, JL; Bruzzi, S			The ESA Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer MERIS - a review of the instrument and its mission	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Following the successful operations of the ERS-1 and 2 satellites which are mainly dedicated to physical oceanography and ice observations from space, the European Space Agency (ESA) developed a multidisciplinary Earth observation instrument within its polar Earth Observation Programme with a focus on biological ocean observations. The Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) will be launched onboard Envisat-1 in the 1999-2000 time frame, providing a European remote sensing capability for observing for example oceanic biology and marine water quality through observations of water colour: MERIS will have a medium spectral and high radiometric resolution and a dual spatial resolution, within a global mission, covering open ocean and coastal zone waters, important aspects of the atmosphere, and large ecosystems over land. The global mission of MERIS will have a major contribution to scientific projects aimed at greater understanding of the role of oceans and ocean productivity in the climate system and our ability to forecast change through models. Secondary objectives of the MERIS mission will be directed to the measurement of atmospheric parameters associated with clouds, water vapour and aerosols in addition to land surface parameters, important in particular for the understanding of vegetation processes. In advance of the launch of MERIS, algorithms are being developed for the interpretation of MERIS observations and dedicated studies are ongoing to establish the means of validating the data products. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of the MERIS concept, its mission and data products in context of the driving scientific requirements.																	0143-1161					JUN 15	1999	20	9					1681	1702		10.1080/014311699212416								WOS:000081047400002						
J	Bricaud, A; Morel, A; Barale, V				Bricaud, A; Morel, A; Barale, V			MERIS potential for ocean colour studies in the open ocean	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The interest of space observations of ocean colour for determining variations in phytoplankton distribution and for deriving primary production (via models) has been largely demonstrated by the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) which operated from 1978 to 1986. The capabilities of this pioneer sensor, however, were limited both in spectral resolution and radiometric accuracy. The next generation of ocean colour sensors will benefit from major improvements. The Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), planned by the European Space Agency (ESA) for the Envisat platform, has been designed to measure radiances in 15 visible and infrared channels. Three infrared channels will allow aerosol characterization, and therefore accurate atmospheric corrections, to be performed for each pixel. For the retrieval of marine parameters, nine channels between 410 and 705 nm will be available (as opposed to only four with the CZCS). In coastal waters this should, in principle, allow a separate quantification of different substances (phytoplankton, mineral particles, yellow substance) to be performed. In open ocean waters optically dominated by phytoplankton and their associate detrital matter, the basic information (i.e. the concentration of phytoplanktonic pigments) will be retrieved with improved accuracy due to the increased radiometric performances of MERIS. The adoption of multi-wavelength algorithms could also lead to additional information concerning auxiliary pigments and taxonomic groups. Finally, MERIS will be one of the first sensors to allow measurements of Sun-induced chlorophyll alpha in vivo fluorescence, which could provide a complementary approach for the assessment of phytoplankton abundance. The development of these next-generation algorithms, however, requires a number of fundamental studies.																	0143-1161					JUN 15	1999	20	9					1757	1769		10.1080/014311699212461								WOS:000081047400007						
J	Mumby, PJ; Harborne, AR				Mumby, PJ; Harborne, AR			Development of a systematic classification scheme of marine habitats to facilitate regional management and mapping of Caribbean coral reefs	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Most coastal habitat mapping is conducted on an ad hoc basis with little consistency in terminology and ambiguous documentation. These limitations obstruct interpretation and integration of maps for coral reef science and management, particularly at regional (international) scales where standardisation is urgently required. This paper advocates an objective, systematic approach to habitat classification which couples coastal geomorphology and benthic cover. Benthic classes are derived and described objectively using agglomerative hierarchical classification of field data and Similarity Percentage analysis of resulting clusters. The scheme has a hierarchical structure to accommodate various user requirements, variable availability of data, and the spatial scales of most remote sensing methods. We illustrate our approach with a scheme based on extensive field data from the Turks and Caicos Islands and Belize. While the scheme will not represent all habitats of the Caribbean, it provides a useful basis for a regional classification and illustrates the systematic approach. Standardised regional maps of coastal habitats will help development of predictive models of coral metapopulation dynamics, aid the identification of larval source and sink areas, and facilitate strategic transboundary planning of protected areas to maximise species, habitat, and ecosystem conservation. Habitats might also be interpreted to reflect ecosystem processes such as productivity and trophic guild structure, thereby allowing the ecosystem function to be examined at larger scales.

These measurements have usually been made using ground-based radar systems or aircraft in situ probes. Difficulties encountered in practice using these systems include accounting for the air motion at points remote from the radar systems and small sample volumes measured using the aircraft probes. An airborne W-band radar system provides a measurement from a much larger sample volume, close to the aircraft, with a correction for air motion possible using the data from the aircraft inertial navigation system. The Coastal Stratus Experiment conducted off the coast of Oregon in late 1995 provided W-band radar and microphysical probe data sampled from much of the same region of a marine stratus cloud. The unique combination of cloud probes and W-band radar on board the University of Wyoming King Air allowed the radar sampling to be only 60 m away from the probe sampling region. Doppler spectrum data from the W-band radar were used to produce estimates of the drop size spectrum density N(D). These estimates were compared to measurements of N(D) taken by the Particle Measuring Systems forward scattering spectrometer, 1D, and 2DC probes. This comparison suggests that a vertically pointing airborne W-band radar is a viable remote sensing tool for measuring N(D) in clouds and precipitation. This radar provides information on drop size distribution variation on a much smaller horizontal scale than the probes as a result of the much higher sample rate and larger measurement sample volume.																	0739-0572					MAY	1999	16	5					504	517		10.1175/1520-0426(1999)016<0504:CISAWB>2.0.CO;2								WOS:000080224700002

Res. Lett., 23, 3591-3594, 1996 and Nonlin. Processes Geophys., 3, 236-246, 1996). Thus, the aim of this paper is, first, to present the conceptual bases of multifractals and more precisely a stochastic multifractal framework which among different advantages lead in a rather straightforward manner to universal multifractals. We emphasize that contrary to basic analysis techniques such as power spectral analysis, universal multifractals allow the description of the whole statistics of a given field with only three basic parameters. Second, we provide a comprehensive detailed description of the analysis techniques applied in such a framework to marine ecologists and oceanographers; and third, we illustrate their applicability to an original time series of biological and related physical parameters. Our illustrative analyses were based on a 48 h high-frequency time series of in vivo fluorescence (i.e. estimate of phytoplankton biomass), simultaneously recorded with temperature and salinity in the tidally mixed coastal waters of the Eastern English Channel. Phytoplankton biomass, which surprisingly exhibits three distinct scaling regimes (i.e. a physical-biological-physical transition), was demonstrated to exhibit a very specific heterogeneous distribution, in the framework of universal multifractals, over smaller (<10 m) and larger (>500 m) scales dominated by different turbulent processes as over intermediate scales (10-500 m) obviously dominated by biological processes.

A reflectance model for remote sensing	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The spatial and temporal distribution of Trichodesmium in the world's oceans is highly variable and can potentially be assessed using satellite imagery. Distinguishing these organisms from other phytoplankton in the upper ocean using remotely sensed information, however, requires an optical model that uniquely characterizes Trichodesmium. Here, we parameterize a standard remote-sensing reflectance model using measured values of Trichodesmium's inherent optical properties, namely the spectral dependence of the chlorophyll-specific optical absorption cross-sections and the spectral dependence of the chlorophyll-specific backscatter cross-sections. Values for the chlorophyll-specific absorption cross-sections are described in the previous paper. We calculated the spectral chlorophyll-specific backscattering cross-section (b(b)*) from measurements of the chlorophyll-specific volume-scattering function and the spectral backscatter coefficients. b(b)* was 0.0027 m(2) (mg chlorophyll a [Chl a])(-1) at 436 nm and 0.002 m(2) (mg Chi a)(-1) at 546 nm; these cross-sections are approximately one order of magnitude higher than those for "typical" phytoplankton. The optical model revealed that the combination of high backscatter, absorption, and fluorescence could be used to distinguish moderate to high concentrations (>1 mg Chl m(-3)) of Trichodesmium from other phytoplankton. The model also predicted that surface scum blooms of Trichodesmium would have high reflectance in the near infrared. The high reflectance feature of surface Trichodesmium blooms was used in conjunction with sea truth and data from the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) to map a 300,000-km(2) Trichodesmium bloom off the Somali Coast in May 1995. The nitrogen fixed by this bloom was estimated to be 9.4 x 10(8) gN d(-1). These results demonstrate the potential of using remote-sensing techniques in the estimation of nitrogen fixation and the contribution of nitrogen fixation to global biogeochemical processes.

Fourier analysis of the data versus wind direction was carried out and the coefficients of Fourier series are illustrated against the wind speed at 45 degrees, 55 degrees, and 65 degrees incidence angles, There is a good agreement between the JPL aircraft Eight data and Wentz's Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) geophysical model function for the vertically polarized brightness temperatures, but Wentz`s SSR III wind direction model for horizontal polarization shows a significantly stronger upwind and downwind asymmetry than the aircraft Eight data. Comparison of the dual-frequency WINDRAD data shows that the wind direction signals are similar at 19 and 37 GHz, although the 37 GHz data have slightly stronger signals than the 19 GHz data. In general, the azimuthal variations of brightness temperatures increase with increasing wind speed from low to moderate winds, then level off and decrease at high winds. The only exception is the U measurements at 65 degrees incidence angle, which have a stronger than expected signal at low winds. An exponential function was proposed to model the sensitivities of wind direction signals to wind speeds, The coefficients of the empirical model are provided in this paper and are useful for the simulation of ocean brightness temperatures and for the development of geophysical retrieval algorithms.																	0196-2892					MAR	1999	37	2	2				949	959		10.1109/36.752213								WOS:000079231700007

The aim of this project is to develop a working tool to carry out comprehensive broad scale mapping surveys of sublittoral habitats and communities (or biotopes). Reliable marine benthic information, at a suitable level of detail, is required by SNH in its work in conservation management of coastal ecosystems. Increasingly it is required to assist with the implementation of the EC Habitats Directive through the identification, designation, management and monitoring of Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and for the protection of threatened species. The work to date has developed a survey strategy which employs a basic, low-cost acoustic system to produce maps, ground-truthed using a variety of techniques. The maps provide an estimation of the geographical distribution and extent of the biological resources in the survey area. The current paper provides a review of the areas covered to date and some examples of the use this information, in particular the resource maps, has been put to by SNH to support environmental management.																	0143-1161					FEB 15	1999	20	3					585	592		10.1080/014311699213352								WOS:000078973300009						
J	Devaraj, M; Vivekanandan, E				Devaraj, M; Vivekanandan, E			Marine capture fisheries of India: Challenges and opportunities	CURRENT SCIENCE												Marine fisheries production, which was only 0.5 million tonnes (mt) in 1950, increased through the time scale and peaked to 2.7 mt in 1997, Since by 1997 the production (2.2 mt) from inshore waters (< 50 m depth) reached the catchable potential (2.2 mt), scope for further increase in production from inshore waters is limited, The active fishers' population and the number and efficiency of fishing vessels have substantially increased. The improvements made so far on the craft and gear technologies with an objective to increase fish production are becoming counterproductive. Inappropriate exploitation patterns such as concentration of 80% of the total fishing effort in the inshore waters and over-dependence on trawlers are showing signs of detrimental effects on the fisheries, The catch rate of fishing vessels in several fishing centres is on the decline; the catch rate of the trawlers based at Chennai, for instance, has declined from 110.8 kg/h (1991) to 29.7 kg/h (1997), The fishing mortality coefficient (F) is higher than the natural mortality coefficient (M) for most of the exploited stocks, and the overall M:F proportion is 1:1.9. Fast-growing and high-fecund fishery groups such as prawns, cephalopods and many teleosts have been able to withstand exploitation thus far, but the slow-growing and/or low-fecund groups such as lobsters, sharks and catfishes are showing signs of vulnerability. As the fishers will not limit the fishing operations until zero profitability threshold is reached, there is a need to regulate the fishing activities and manage the fisheries. There are several biological, economic, social and political factors for the nonexistence of effective management policies and for the inadequate implementation of the existing policies. The concept of responsible fishing needs to be practised by introducing limited entry; temporal as well as spatial restrictions to sustain the coastal fisheries. Other options are to increase production by encouraging farsea fishing and utilizing remote sensing for locating potential fishing zones; increase coastal productivity by installing artificial fish habitats and sea-ranching; and to adopt coastal land-based mariculture and seafarming.																	0011-3891					FEB 10	1999	76	3					314	332										WOS:000078719900022

The main scientific objective of the GOME mission is to determine the global distribution of ozone and several other trace gases, which play an important role in the ozone chemistry of the earth's stratosphere and troposphere. GOME:measures the sunlight scattered from the earth's atmosphere and/or reflected by the surface in nadir viewing mode in the spectral region 240-790 nm at a moderate spectral resolution of between 0.2 and 0.4 nm. Using the maximum 960-km across-track swath width, the spatial resolution of a GOME ground pixel is 40 X 320 km(2) for the majority of the orbit and global coverage is achieved in three days after 43 orbits. Operational data products of GOME as generated by DLR-DFD, the German Data Processing and Archiving Facility (D-PAF) for GOME, comprise absolute radiometrically calibrated earthshine radiance and solar irradiance spectra (level 1 products) and global distributions of total column amounts of ozone and NO2, (level 2 products), which are derived using the DOAS approach (Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy). (Under certain conditions and some restrictions, the operational data products are publically available from the European Space Agency via the ERS Helpdesk.) In addition to the operational data products, GOME has delivered important information about other minor trace gases such as OClO, volcanic SO2, H2CO from biomass burning, and tropospheric BrO. Using an iterative optimal estimation retrieval scheme, ozone vertical profiles can be derived from the inversion of the UV/VIS spectra. This paper reports on the GOME instrument, its operation mode, and the retrieval techniques, the latter with particular emphasis on DOAS (total column retrieval) and advanced optimal estimation (ozone profile retrieval). Observation of ozone depletion in the recent polar spring seasons in both hemispheres are presented. OClO observed by GOME under twilight conditions provides valuable information on the chlorine activation inside the polar vortex, which is believed to be responsible for the rapid catalytic destruction of ozone. Episodes of enhanced BrO in the Arctic, most likely contained in the marine boundary layer, were observed in early and late spring. Excess tropospheric nitrogen dioxide and ozone have been observed during the recent Indonesian fire in fall 1997.

J	Colwell, RR; Huq, A				Colwell, RR; Huq, A			Global microbial ecology: biogeography and diversity of Vibrios as a model	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY					SfAM Symposium on Aquatic Microbiology	JUL, 1998	UNIV LANCASTER, LANCASTER, ENGLAND		UNIV LANCASTER			An environmental source of cholera was hypothesized as early as the late nineteenth century by Robert Koch, but not proven because of the ability of Vibrio cholera, the causative agent of cholera, to enter a dormant phase between epidemics. Standard bacteriological procedures for isolation of the vibrios from the environmental samples, including water, between epidemics generally were unsuccessful. Vibrio cholera, a marine vibrio requiring salt for growth, enters into a dormant 'viable but non-culturable' stage when conditions are unfavourable for growth and reproduction. The association of V. cholera with plankton, notably copepods, provides evidence for the environmental origin of cholera, as well as an explanation for the sporadic and erratic nature of cholera epidemics. Thus, the association of V. cholera with plankton was established only recently, allowing analysis of epidemic patterns of cholera, especially in those countries where cholera is endemic. The sporadic and erratic nature of cholera epidemics can now be related to climate and climate events, such as El Nino. Since zooplankton have been shown to harbour the bacterium and zooplankton blooms follow phytoplankton blooms, remote sensing can be employed to determine the relationship of cases of cholera with chlorophyll, as well as sea surface temperature (SST), ocean height, and turbidity. Cholera occurs seasonally in Bangladesh with two annual peaks in the number of cases occurring each year. From the data obtained and analysed to date, when the height of the ocean is high and sea surface temperature is also elevated, cholera cases are numerous. When the height is low and sea surface is also low, little or no cholera is recorded. From the examination of data for the 1992-1993 cholera epidemic in India, preliminary comparisons of cholera data for Calcutta show a similar relationship between cholera cases, ocean height and SST. In conclusion, from results of studies of SST, phytoplankton and zooplankton, and their relationships to incidence of cholera, correlation of selected climatological factors and incidence of V. cholera appears to be significant, bringing the potential of predicting conditions conducive to cholera outbreaks closer to reality.																	1364-5072						1999	85			S			134S	137S										WOS:000080995200017						
J	Moore, PA; Fields, DM; Yen, J				Moore, PA; Fields, DM; Yen, J			Physical constraints of chemoreception in foraging copepods	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The small-scale spatial and temporal dynamics of phycosphere-sized chemical signals entrained within the feeding current of copepods is quantified here by combining how visualization techniques with electrochemical technology (IVEC-10). Using the 30-mu m electrochemical probe sampling at 50 Hz and the velocity gradients created by two marine copepods, we evaluated how odor deformation improves the potential for remote chemoreception. Our data show that when shear is strong, as found in the feeding current of an omnivore, Pleuromamma xiphias, elongation of the chemical signal is greater than that found for an odor signal entrained in the low-shear feeding current of a carnivore, Euchaeta rimana. Furthermore, within the feeding current of a single species, E. rimana, certain areas provided greater potential for remote chemoreception. These results support the hypotheses that chemical signals are deformed by the feeding current and that the feeding current structure enhances signal detection. The deformation of the odor field within the laminar feeding current provides a leading edge that gives a chemosensitive copepod early warning of an approaching odor source. By sensing the leading edge, a copepod could have a few hundred milliseconds to reorient itself with respect to the odor source. Advance warning improves the probability of successful behavior in response to signal sources such as prey, predators, and mates.																	0024-3590					JAN	1999	44	1					166	177		10.4319/lo.1999.44.1.0166								WOS:000078378300015						
J	Frette, O; Stamnes, JJ; Stamnes, K				Frette, O; Stamnes, JJ; Stamnes, K			Optical remote sensing of marine constituents in coastal waters: a feasibility study	APPLIED OPTICS												Optical remote sensing of ocean color is a well-established technique for inferring ocean properties. However, most retrieval algorithms are based on the assumption that the radiance received by satellite instruments is affected only by the phytoplankton pigment concentration and correlated substances. This assumption works well for open ocean water but becomes questionable for coastal waters. To reduce uncertainties associated with this assumption, we developed a new algorithm for the retrieval of marine constituents in a coastal environment. We assumed that ocean color can be adequately described by a three-component model made up of chlorophyll a, suspended matter, and yellow substance. The simultaneous retrieval of these three marine constituents and of the atmospheric aerosol content was accomplished through an inverse-modeling scheme in which the difference between simulated radiances exiting the atmosphere and radiances measured with a satellite sensor was minimized. Simulated radiances were generated with a comprehensive radiative transfer model that is applicable to the coupled atmosphere-ocean system. The method of simulated annealing was used to minimize the difference between measured and simulated radiances. To evaluate the retrieval algorithm, we used simulated (instead of measured) satellite-received radiances that were generated for specified concentrations of aerosols and marine constituents, and we tested the ability of the algorithm to retrieve assumed concentrations. Our results require experimental validation but show that the retrieval of marine constituents in coastal waters is possible.

J	Chauvaud, S; Bouchon, C; Maniere, R				Chauvaud, S; Bouchon, C; Maniere, R			Remote sensing techniques adapted to high resolution mapping of tropical coastal marine ecosystems (coral reefs, seagrass beds and mangrove)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The need for high resolution maps in the management of tropical environments is increasing and emphasized by the rapid anthropogenic development often occurring in coastal zones. In areas subject to humid tropical climate, such as the West Indies, cloud coverage often disturbs image acquisition by orbital imagery. Moreover, as these tropical coastal ecosystems, i.e., coral reefs, mangroves and seagrass beds, are intricate and geographically complex, high resolution data must be used to accurately restore these features. Digitized aerial photographs meet these requirements by providing higher-resolution images than orbital remote sensing devices. This paper reports on the method applied to map coral reefs, mangroves and seagrass beds in the Bay of Robert in Martinique Island (French West Indies) by digitizing true-colour aerial photographs. But, as these photographs present two drawbacks, i.e., they are not geographically oriented and their margins are distorted, a reference map was used to design a rectification model. Aerial photographs were first subjected to true-colour digitization. After separation of the red, green and blue bands, an unsupervised classification was achieved, then various masks each corresponding to a given range of depths were built and applied to the initial image. The new images obtained were analysed. Great care was taken in the selection of training sites to gather the pixels characterized by a high spectral similarity which corresponded to precise themes. After ground identification, these training sites enabled a supervized classification to be established, then a confusion matrix was built. The final map consisted of 31 themes. Each theme was related to a particular feature of the benthic communities. The error matrix and subsequent field samplings confirmed the reliability of the final map. In addition to their use in ecosystem studies, e.g., calculation of surface areas; biocoenosis distribution, etc., these thematic maps are of overriding importance for the management of coastal areas.																	0143-1161					DEC	1998	19	18					3625	3639		10.1080/014311698213858								WOS:000077774800010						
J	Vasquez, JA; Camus, PA; Ojeda, FP				Vasquez, JA; Camus, PA; Ojeda, FP			Diversity, structure and functioning of rocky coastal ecosystems in northern Chile	REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL												This study, among others of the Fondecyt Sectorial Program directed toward the study of biodiversity of Antofagasta, was carried out in three rocky areas on the exposed coast of northern Chile selected for their representation of varying upwelling regimes: (a) Caleta Constitucion (Mejillones-Antofagasta Peninsula) located in a stable focus of coastal upwelling; (b) Carrizal Bajo (Huasco), a reference zone without permanent coastal upwelling; and (c) San Lorenzo (Punta Lengua de Vaca), a reference zone of contrast, on a focus of stable upwelling. The general objetives of our study were: (1) characterize the taxonomic composition and community structure, as a function of categories or trophic revels in subtidal and intertidal habitats; (2) characterize the spatio-temporal dynamics of the diversity and abundance of species in the communities studied, relating these to variations in productivity and sea surface temperature (obtained by remote sensing); and (3) evaluate the effects of upwelling on community attributes in relation to similar comparisons between areas with and without upwelling. Our results show that the frequency of upwelling was not a determining factor in the diversity of the rocky littoral communities which were studied. Although the species richness of the subtidal benthos and ichthyofauna is greater in Caleta Constitucion (permanent upwelling) than in Carrizal Bajo (seasonal upwelling), these values were lowest for San Lorenzo (permanent upwelling). In contrast, the species richness of intertidal habitats did not show evident differences among the communities studied. There was no relationship evident between the diversity of primary producer and benthic herbivores with the Frequency of coastal enrichment. However, patterns of abundance and diversity of some producers groups (eg. Chlorophytes) showed that the importance of coastal upwelling cannot be discarded in specific cases, although the changes may not be observed at the community level. An analysis of the relationship between the general trophic structure of benthic intertidal and subtidal communities did not show major differences in trophic linkage at the carnivore level. However, although trophic linkages between herbivores are similar between localities, there were significant differences between habitats. In contrast, trophic linkages between assemblages of fishes showed significant differences in structure and complexity between localities with and without permanent upwelling. Trophic relationships documented for subtidal habitats constitute the first contribution to the knowledge of the trophic structure in these habitats of northern Chile.																	0716-078X					DEC	1998	71	4					479	499										WOS:000078276100005						
J	Doran, PT; Wharton, RA; Des Marais, DJ; McKay, CP				Doran, PT; Wharton, RA; Des Marais, DJ; McKay, CP			Antarctic paleolake sediments and the search for extinct life on Mars	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												Evidence of lakes in Mars history is substantial. The proposed similarities between the ancient Martian environment and certain modern environments on Earth have led exobiologists to study antarctic lakes as analogs to those purported to have existed on Mars. We have investigated modern sedimentation processes (especially with respect to delta(13)C of carbonate and organic matter) in lakes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys region df east Antarctica and assessed various paleolake deposits with respect to their utility as Martian analogs and targets for future Mars exobiology missions. Three main types of paleolake deposit were identified and assessed: strand lines, perched deltas, and lacustrine sand mounds. Deltas are usually identified as good targets, but our research shows that authigenic carbonates are not readily identifiable in the sediments. Large deltas, although most likely to attract attention through remote sensing, generally are difficult sites for discovery of paleobiological matter, and delta(13)C signals follow no coherent pattern. Lacustrine sand mounds, on the other hand, contain abundant authigenic carbonate and freeze-dried organic matter and appear to be excellent records of paleolimnological conditions. The advantage of studying lake bottom deposits versus lake edge deposits is retrieval of a stable lake-wide signal. Deltas are therefore most useful in that they are generally large-scale features capable of drawing attention to a region of potential for the discovery of smaller lacustrine sand mounds.																	0148-0227					NOV 25	1998	103	E12					28481	28493		10.1029/98JE01713								WOS:000077290100004						
J	Prasad, S; Pandarinath, K; Gupta, SK				Prasad, S; Pandarinath, K; Gupta, SK			Geomorphology, tectonism and sedimentation in the Nal region, western India	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The low lying Nal region in western India, linking the Gulf of Kachchh with the Gulf of Kharnbhat through the Little Rann and Nal Sarovar is barely 15 m above msl and lacks surface exposures. The evolutionary history of the Nal region using remote sensing data and sub-surface lithological correlation indicated that late Quaternary sedimentation in the Nal region was governed by changes in sea level and by tectonism in the region of Cambay Graben. The geomorphic evidence for changes in sea level was found in the form of inland palaeo-deltas and old mud flats. Abrupt changes in lithological data in the vicinity of Nal region pointed to the role of tectonism. Contrary to the earlier view, a shallow sea linked the Gulf of Kachchh to the Gulf of Khambhat only in a time period around Marine Isotope Stage 5. Our studies also suggest that the Nal region itself may not have witnessed any major uplift (beyond similar to 10 m) during late Quaternary. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Phytoplankton production plays a key role in this so-called high nutrient, low chlorophyll environment, and factors that regulate production include those that control cell growth (Light, temperature, and nutrients) and those that control cell accumulation rate and hence population growth (water column stability, grazing, and sinking). Sea ice mediates several of these factors and frequently conditions the water column for a spring bloom which is characterized by a pulse of production restricted in both time and space. This study models the spatial and temporal variability of primary production within the Palmer LTER area west of the Antarctic Peninsula and discusses this production in the context of historical data for the Southern Ocean. Primary production for the Southern Ocean and the Palmer LTER area have been computed using both light-pigment production models [Smith, R.C., Bidigare, R.R., Prezelin, B.B., Baker, K.S., Brooks, J.M., 1987.

Chlorophyll concentrations, total photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) and sea ice concentrations were derived from satellite data. These same parameters, in addition to hydrodynamic conditions, have also been determined from shipboard and Palmer Station observations during the LTER program. Model results are compared, sensitivity studies evaluated, and productivity of the Palmer LTER region is discussed in terms of its space time distribution, seasonal and interannual variability, and overall contribution to the marine ecology of the Southern Ocean.

J	Thomas, A; Barber, DG				Thomas, A; Barber, DG			On the use of multi-year ice ERS-1 sigma degrees as a proxy indicator of melt period sea ice albedo	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Sea ice albedo is a critical factor determining the overall energy balance of the ocean-sea ice-atmosphere interface thereafter referred to as the marine cryosphere) and the seasonal processes of sea ice growth and decay. Small changes in sea ice albedo can affect regional and global climate through the existence of positive feedback loops such as those proposed by Budyko (Tellus, 21, 611-619, 1969). The sensitivity of Arctic regions to various climate change scenarios is largely due to the possibility of positive feedback effects between sea ice and surface albedo. Despite its importance, sea ice albedo has typically been parametrized in models as a simple function of temperature, latitude and ice type. Strong interannual variations in Arctic weather conditions necessitate improved parametrizations of surface albedo. Estimating surface albedo using remote sensing is a promising approach. In this paper we reveal strong relationships between ERS-1 sigma degrees and albedo over multi-year ice, sigma degrees is the average scattering coefficient which expresses the intensity of backscattered microwave energy per unit area received at the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR antenna. The relationship between sigma degrees and albedo is especially strong during the early phases of the melt period. We test general linear models linking observed surface albedo to ERS-1 sigma degrees for two transitional periods: winter to melt conditions; and melt conditions only. We find that change in ERS-1 scattering (Delta sigma degrees) vs albedo during the melt period produces the optimal empirical model. This model is then used to map sea ice albedo over multi-temporal ERS-1 imagery acquired over the Canadian Arctic Archipelago during the spring of 1995. Classes of multi-year ice albedo are formed based on the confidence limits of the general linear model and are mapped according to the magnitude of Delta sigma degrees in difference images generated from ERS-1 data. First-year ice and rubble ice are segmented from multi-year ice based on their Delta sigma degrees. First-year ice albedo is calculated as a linear offset of multi-year ice albedo to account for the contrasting snow distribution over the two ice types. Thematic albedo images indicate that spatial variability in ice types and their respective snow covers is the dominant influence on albedo.																	0143-1161					SEP 20	1998	19	14					2807	2821		10.1080/014311698214523								WOS:000076003800012						
J	Hamilton, LJ; Shi, Z; Zhang, SY				Hamilton, LJ; Shi, Z; Zhang, SY			Acoustic backscatter measurements of estuarine suspended cohesive sediment concentration profiles	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Methods of monitoring suspended sediment concentration profiles have largely relied on in situ point sampling by water bottles, coupled with optical instrumentation These intrusive methods can affect the measurements, and optical instrumentation must usually be raised and lowered through the water column at rates too slow to obtain near-instantaneous profiles. At the extremely high suspended sediment concentrations sustained by cohesive sediments in estuarial waters optical attenuation is severe, and optics cannot provide data on concentrations or gradients without very short path lengths, or use of multi-sensors. Remote sensing acoustic backscatter techniques overcome these difficulties, and provide high resolution spatial(similar to 1-10 cm) and temporal(similar to 0.1-1 s) concentration profiles. Despite their use for over a decade, acoustic backscatter measurements in the field have been confined almost wholly to noncohesive sediments. Measurements of suspended cohesive sediment concentration profiles in Changjiang Estuary demonstrate the capability of acoustic instrumentation to obtain high resolution profiles at dynamic scales in a difficult environment with high gradients and concentrations.

Called PEARL, for Pan-Oceanic Environmental and Atmospheric Research Laboratory, the platform will be a powerful tool for atmospheric and marine research on topics involving the global environment and US and international security matters. Numerous security issues, and understanding the impact of human activities on the environment, require observing wide varieties of chemical compounds in situ and often at considerable range from the observer. Optical remote sensing, with instruments such as light detection and ranging (lidar) systems, have the potential for the necessary studies, but their performance has heretofore been restricted by low power and limited wavelength tunability. In contrast, the FEL for the PEARL platform will have continuous wavelength tunability from 250 nm to 20 mu m and the power to project beams over large ocean expanses or basin-sized land regions. This paper summarizes the principal features of the PEARL FEL, in the context of PEARL's missions. Directly descended from the MkIII, the PEARL FEL will incorporate highly-traceable developments including a photoinjector, high current linac, high power RF system, and several features to increase efficiency. The challenges of giving the mobility needed for environmental and defense remote sensing applications to an instrument as large and heavy as a FEL will be met by mounting the laser in a large ship. Using a former US Naval vessel and existing FEL and optical apparatus result in an estimated cost less than one-fourth that of all-new construction. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Cultures of microalgae characterized by different pigment contents were analysed in the visible region on near UV laser excitation. The measured spectra allowed us to obtain a fingerprint of each species and to identify the emission wavelengths in relation to the main pigment contents. The remote-sensing apparatus was upgraded with a double-pulse laser source to test the effectiveness of a LIF technique based on a pump-and-probe laser excitation scheme suitable for directly measuring the algal quantum yield. In combination with photosynthetic active radiation, the electron transport rate of the investigated phytoplankton was obtained directly in the sea water. The instrumentation for local and remote analysis of phytoplankton was applied at the ICES/IOC workshop at the Kristineberg Marine Research Station (Sweden, 9-15 September 1996), where the LIF emission of natural communities and cultures has been monitored in vivo obtaining information on the algae species present and on their photosynthetic activity.

The VNIR subsystem has one backward-viewing band for stereoscopic observation in the along-track direction. Because the data will have wide spectral coverage and relatively high spatial resolution, we will be able to discriminate a variety of surface materials and reduce problems in some lower resolution data resulting from mixed pixels. ASTER will, for the first time, provide high-spatial resolution multispectral thermal infrared data from orbit and the highest spatial resolution surface spectral reflectance temperature and emissivity data of all of the EOS-AM1 instruments. The primary science objective of the ASTER mission is to improve understanding of the local- and regional-scale processes occurring on or near the earth's surface and lower atmosphere, including surface-atmosphere interactions. Specific areas of the science investigation include the following: 1) land surface climatology; 2) vegetation and ecosystem dynamics; 3) volcano monitoring; 4) hazard monitoring; 5) aerosols and clouds; 6) carbon cycling in the marine ecosystem; 7) hydrology; 8) geology and soil; and 9) land surface and land cover change. There are three categories of ASTER data: a global map, regional monitoring data sets, and local data sets to be obtained for requests from individual investigators. The ASTER instrument will have a limited (8%) duty cycle. Prioritization of data acquisition requests will be based on such factors as data category, user category, and science discipline.

The result is the Multicenter Airborne Coherent Atmospheric Wind Sensor (MACAWS), which has the capability to remotely sense the distribution of wind and absolute aerosol backscatter in three-dimensional volumes in the troposphere and lower stratosphere. A factor critical to the programmatic feasibility and technical success of this collaboration has been the utilization of existing components and expertise that were developed for previous atmospheric research by the respective institutions. For example, the laser transmitter is that of the mobile ground-based Doppler lidar system developed and used in atmospheric research for more than a decade at NOAA/ETL. The motivation for MACAWS is threefold: 1) to obtain fundamental measurements of subsynoptic-scale processes and features to improve subgrid-scale parameterizations in large-scale models, 2) to obtain datasets in order to improve the understanding of and predictive capabilities for meteorological systems on subsynoptic scales, and 3) to validate (simulate) the performance of existing (planned) satellite-borne sensors.

Here we present an account of one of the first coral reef applications. The CASI was flown over reefs of the Turks and Caicos Islands (British West Indies) and set to view 1 m pixels in 8 spectral bands. In addition, reef habitats were sampled in situ by visual assessment of percent cover in 1 m quadrats. Seagrass standing crop was assessed using a calibrated visual scale. Benthic habitats were classified using hierarchical cluster and similarity percentage analyses of the field survey data. Two levels of habitat discrimination were assessed: a coarse level (corals, algae, sand, seagrass) and a fine level which included nine reef habitats. Overall accuracies of CASI-derived habitat maps were 89% and 81% for coarse and fine levels of habitat discrimination, respectively. Accuracies were greatest once CASI data had been processed to compensate for variations in depth and edited to take account of generic patterns of reef distribution. These overall accuracies were significantly (P < 0.001) better than those obtained from satellite imagery of the same site (Landsat MSS, Landsat TM, SPOT XS, SPOT Pan, merged Landsat TM/SPOT Pan). Results from CASI were also significantly better than those from interpretation of 1:10 000 colour aerial photographs of reefs in Anguilla (Sheppard et al. 1995). However, the studies may not have been entirely com parable due to a disparity in the areas mapped.

J	Zuidema, P; Evans, KF				Zuidema, P; Evans, KF			On the validity of the independent pixel approximation for boundary layer clouds observed during ASTEX	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The two-dimensional radiative transfer behavior of nine marine stratocumulus clouds observed by cloud radar during the Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition Experiment is examined, The cloud radar resolves the vertical structure to 37.5 m, The method of [Frisch et ab., 1995] is used to convert radar reflectivities to extinction fields, Three constructions of the same cloud field help elucidate underlying causes of variability: one is fully two-dimensional, while the other two have vertically uniform extinction fields but possess either a flat cloud top or the original cloud top topography. Two-dimensional solar radiative transfer results are compared with the independent pixel approximation (IPA) result. At the scale of the domain (approximate to 7 km) the IPA albedo bias is small, even after including vertical structure. Locally, in contrast, the direct solar beam interaction with cloud top geometry competes with radiative smoothing as the dominant radiative process, Power spectral analysis of nadir reflectances is dominated by radiative smoothing for overhead Sun, and side illumination/shadowing of cloud top bumps for low Sun, A method that incorporates direct beam interactions with the cloud geometry, in addition to radiative smoothing, significantly improves correlations of a smoothed IPA radiance field with the 2-D reflectances, In a remote sensing application, optical depth and albedo retrieval biases from plane-parallel theory depend on the spatial scale chosen to emulate a satellite pixel size, For scales less than a few kilometers and with low Sun, cloud top topography can cause large positive optical depth biases even when averaged over the entire domain. At larger spatial scales the negative IPA bias always dominates. Domain-averaged monochromatic albedo retrieval errors remain below 0.005, a relative error of less than 1%.

Unlike clear marine/oceanic waters, for which linear regression retrieval relationships are valid, inland and coastal zone water masses with a high degree of optical complexity necessitate the development of more subtle retrieval approaches. At the basis of such approaches are models considering the conjoint optical impact of several co-existing aquatic components on the water leaving radiance spectral distribution. Such a model for Lake Ladoga is described. Monte Carlo simulations have been performed to analyse the spectral and angular variations of the upwelling radiance scattered by the water column into the atmosphere. Optimal conditions for conducting water quality remote sensing in case of natural waters of various optical complexity are explored and relevant recommendations are formulated.																	0143-1161					MAR 20	1998	19	5					957	979		10.1080/014311698215810								WOS:000073174700010

In this device, the polarization plane of incident light is rotated through 0 degrees, 45 degrees, 90 degrees or 135 degrees by an electrically-controllable polarization rotator composed of 45 degrees and 90 degrees twisted nematic liquid crystal cells, and the polarization component of reflected light is absorbed by a fixed polarizing film. It selectively absorbs more than 80% of incident white light linearly polarized in an arbitrary direction. With the drastic reduction of reflected light, the object images hidden by the bright reflected light are clearly captured in real time. Another type of polarizing filter, using a guest-host liquid crystal cell instead of the polarizing film, controls light absorption as well as polarization angle.																	1340-6000					MAR-APR	1998	5	2					93	98		10.1007/s10043-998-0093-x								WOS:000075315400006

It used a semi-submersible vessel with an observation pod that can be lowered 1 m below the sea surface; this provides a stable platform from which spatially accurate data can be collected in the sub-marine environment, free from atmospheric effects. The results indicated a link between the depth and composition of the seabed and the spectral values found in the associated satellite image. Hence, the semi-submersible vessel is an ideal tool for seafloor imaging in shallow waters, without the disadvantages associated with diving.																	1323-1650						1998	49	8					875	878		10.1071/MF97095								WOS:000078495500012

The bloom, which occurred during a period of calm winds and relatively high atmospheric iron content, was metabolically active. Carbon fixation by the bloom represented about one-quarter of water column primary productivity while input by N-2 fixation could account for a major fraction of the estimated 'new' N demand of primary production. Isotopic measurements of the N in surface suspended material confirmed a direct contribution of N-2 fixation to the organic nitrogen pools of the upper water column. Retrospective analysis of NOAA-12 AVHRR imagery indicated that blooms covered up to 2 x 10(6) km(2), or 20% of the Arabian Sea surface, during the period from 22 to 27 May 1995. In addition to their biogeochemical impact, surface blooms of this extent may have secondary effects on sea surface albedo and light penetration as well as heat and gas exchange across the air-sea interface. A preliminary extrapolation based on our observed, non-bloom rates of N-2 fixation from our limited sampling in the spring intermonsoon, including a conservative estimate of the input by blooms, suggest N-2 fixation may account for an input of about 1 Tg N yr(-1). This is substantial, but relatively minor compared to current estimates of the removal of N through denitrification in the basin. However, N-2 fixation may also occur in the central basin through the mild winter monsoon, be considerably greater during the fall intermonsoon than we observed during the spring intermonsoon, and may also occur at higher levels in the chronically oligotrophic southern basin. Ongoing satellite observations will help to determine more accurately the distribution and density of Trichodesmium in this and other tropical oceanic basins, as well as resolving the actual frequency and duration of bloom occurrence.

Focus has been primarily on stratocumulus because of their first-order effect on the Earth's energy balance (hence the global climate) due to their unusual horizontal extension and persistence. These cloud layers have quasi-flat upper/lower boundaries and appear to be quite uniform but are highly variable inside. The general strategy has been: utilization of spatial statistics of in situ and remotely sensed data pertaining to cloud structure to constrain stochastic cloud models used in turn for radiative transfer simulations where artificial radiation fields are generated; these fields are compared to actual measurements, and so on, until a degree of closure is achieved. The major trends have been: i) computation and understanding of cloud-radiative properties from the large scales of interest to Global Climate Models (over 10(2) km) down to the smallest observable scales (less than 10 m); ii) from predicting the outcome of "ideal" measurements to those of "real" ones with limited accuracy, sampling and averaging; iii) from passive to active remote-sensing methods; and iv) shifting from standard to wavelet-based analysis/modeling techniques. In terms of potential for impact on geophysical research at large, the most important contributions are: a) criteria for and measures of nonstationarity and intermittency in scale-invariant data; b) so-called "bounded" multifractal cascade models having a continuously variable degree of nonstationarity; c) a parameterization of the bulk effect of fractal variability on large-scale planetary albedo; and d) the basic scaling theory of radiative "smoothing" that explains non-trivially related multiple scattering phenomena in both solar-and lidar-based remote sensing. The last item also suggests new methods of observing clouds and new ways of processing cloud radiance data to retrieve physical cloud properties.

J	Zellmer, JT; Eastman, SM				Zellmer, JT; Eastman, SM			Incorporation of historical aerial photographs and land-use information into environmental site assessments	ENVIRONMENTAL & ENGINEERING GEOSCIENCE												Historical aerial photographs and historical land-use documents covering a period of 51 years were evaluated during the environmental site-assessment of Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) El Toro, a military installation slated for closure and conversion to civilian usage. Although the photographs and documents could not, by themselves, prove the existence of contamination, information interpreted from them helped identify features and areas commonly associated with environmental contamination, such as abandoned landfills, drum-storage areas, trenches possibly used for waste disposal, discolored soil, and surface-water discharge from maintenance facilities. These features served as focal points for follow-on investigations. The investigation identified about 600 new sites of "possible environmental concern," as defined by the criteria specified for the project by the sponsor, and verified approximately 600 previously identified features. The project team interpreted 106 aerial photographs during the investigation. We also evaluated numerous land-use and planning documents. The final report of the investigation includes annotated photographs depicting sites and areas of concern for each of the 21 years of photographic coverage that were considered, land-use maps for five time periods, and surface-drainage maps for nine years. The investigation resulted in about 60 of the newly-identified sites being scheduled for additional investigation.																	1078-7275					FAL	1997	3	3					431	441										WOS:000073842400009

Vector maps depicting distributions of bottom sediment, Copper, Iron, Cadmium and DDT, alpha-BHC and Lindane residues in water, are converted to raster format (5548 m(2) grid cells). The procedure employed can be applied to other environmental management tasks. Direct spatial correspondence between bottom muddy sediments and high concentrations of the three heavy metals studied, is detected. High concentrations of copper and iron indicate relationship to industrial sources in the western sector of the bay. No spatial correspondence is present between bottom sediments and pesticides.																	0749-0208					FAL	1997	13	4					1233	1237										WOS:A1997XZ99900025

The instrument, designated the benthic spectrofluorometer (BSF), is built around a single-board spectrometer with a 1024-element CCD array. Light input to the spectrometer is via a fiber optic cable, In fluorescence mode, the unit provides manual user-selectable excitation wavelength and measures fluorescence emission over the full visible spectrum. The BSF can also measure the spectrum of downwelling ambient light or of light reflected from surfaces of interest, enabling calculation of spectral reflectance.

The remote sensing algorithm is based on measurements of backscattered solar radiation which yield a measure of the ''radiatively equivalent'' aerosol optical thickness tau(sat)(A) (EAOT) over the oceans. Seasonally composited EAOT data for the period July 1989 to June 1991 reveal many spatially coherent plume-like patterns that can usually be interpreted in terms of known (or reasonably hypothesized) sources in association with climatological wind fields. The largest and most persistent areas of high EAOT values are associated with wind-blown dust and biomass burning sources; especially prominent are sources in Africa, the middle East, and the Asian subcontinent. Prominent plumes over the midlatitude North Atlantic are attributed to pollution emissions from North America and Europe. Large plumes attributed to pollution aerosols and dust from sources in Asia are clearly visible over the western and central North Pacific. On a global scale the annually averaged northern hemisphere EAOT values are about 1.7 times greater than those in the southern hemisphere. Considering each hemisphere separately, EAOT values in summer are about twice those in winter. Within the midlatitude band 30 degrees-60 degrees (i.e., where anthropogenic emissions are greatest) the summer/winter ratio is about 3. The temporal variability of monthly mean EAOT in specific ocean regions often shows characteristic seasonal patterns that are usually consistent with aerosol measurements made in the marine boundary layer. Nonetheless, there are features in the EAOT distributions that can not be readily interpreted at this time. The AVHRR EAOT distributions demonstrate that satellite products can serve as a useful tool for the planning and implementation of focused aerosol research programs and that they will be especially important in studies of climate-related processes.

Orographic effects combine with moisture-laden frontal systems originating in the Pacific Ocean to produce areas of very high precipitation on western slopes and dry basins of internal drainage on eastern hanks of the mountains. In the southern half of the region most of the runoff occurs during winter or spring, while in the northern part most occurs in summer, especially in glaciated basins, Analyses of long-term climatic and hydrological records, combined with palaeoclimatic reconstructions and simulations of future climates, are used as the basis for likely scenarios of climatic variations. The predicted hydrological response in northern California to a climate with doubled CO2 and higher temperatures is a decrease in the amount of precipitation falling as snow, and substantially increased runoff during winter and less in late spring and summer. One consequence of the predicted earlier runoff is higher salinity in summer and autumn in San Francisco Bay. In saline lakes, the incidence of meromixis and the associated reduction in nutrient supply and algal abundance is expected to vary significantly as runoff fluctuates. In subalpine lakes, global warming will probably will lead to increased productivity. Lacustrine productivity can also be altered by changes in wind regimes, drought-enhanced forest fires and maximal or minimal snowpacks associated with atmospheric anomalies such as Fl Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Reduced stream temperature from increased contributions of glacial meltwater and decreased channel stability from changed runoff patterns and altered sediment loads has the potential to reduce the diversity of zoobenthic communities in predominately glacier-fed rivers. Climatic warming is likely to result in reduced growth and survival of sockeye salmon in freshwater, which would, in turn, increase marine mortality. Further research activities should include expanded studies at high elevations and of glacier mass balances and glacial runoff, applications of remote sensing to monitor changes, further refinement of regional climatic models to improve forecasts of future conditions and continued analyses of long-term physical, chemical and biological data to help understand responses to future climates.

J	Mobley, CD; Stramski, D				Mobley, CD; Stramski, D			Effects of microbial particles on oceanic optics: Methodology for radiative transfer modeling and example simulations	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Radiative transfer numerical modeling provides a powerful means of separating and understanding the effects of various types of microbial panicles an oceanic light fields. We illustrate the methodology for achieving this separation and provide various idealized examples, We begin with a database of the single-particle optical properties of marine microbial particles and then construct the total absorption and scattering properties of natural waters for given concentrations of the various particle types. When used as input to the Hydrolight radiative transfer numerical model, these absorption and scattering properties generate underwater light fields. Because this modeling process rests upon the optical properties of the individual microbial components, rather than just on the total absorption and scattering properties of a water body, it is possible to analyze the effects of the various particulate components on quantities such as diffuse attenuation coefficients and remote-sensing reflectances. We find that different microbial compositions in two water bodies can give considerably different optical properties, even though the chlorophyll concentration is the same in each of the water bodies. Our simulations show how variability in chlorophyll concentrations obtained from remotely sensed ocean color signals can be explained by the detailed composition of the water body. This approach suggests that it may be possible to distinguish between blooms of small picophytoplankton and larger nanophytoplankton by using remotely sensed signals.																	0024-3590					MAY	1997	42	3					550	560		10.4319/lo.1997.42.3.0550								WOS:A1997XZ09100014

One of the approaches requires reliable estimates off-ratios (NO3- uptake/total N uptake) that can be either determined directly from N uptake by phytoplankton or derived from total phytoplankton Chi a biomass or production (P-T) or from NO3- concentrations. By using a combination of theoretical considerations and field measurements, we show that f-ratios are linear functions of size-fractionated (>5 mu m/total) phytoplankton production (P-L/P-T) and biomass. Comparison of our model with the more usual f-ratio = f(P-T) shows that the large residuals are spread over the range of P-L/P-T in the former, whereas they are concentrated at low P-T in the latter. Because P-T is low in most of the world oceans most of the time, use of our model may significantly improve the estimates off-ratio and thus of POCE.																	0024-3590					MAY	1997	42	3					595	601		10.4319/lo.1997.42.3.0595								WOS:A1997XZ09100020

These fluorescence measurements were compared with extracted chl a concentrations from water samples. The results showed that lidar can produce accurate synoptic estimates of surface chl a concentrations. The lidar instrument measured a variable fluorescence intensity F, which lies between the ground (F-0) and maximum (F-m) fluorescence intensity of chl a. The slope of the linear regression of lidar F against extracted chl a was steeper and less variable during the night than during the day. Monitoring of all variables over a 24-h period showed that photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) np to 100 W m(-2) did not significantly reduce lidar fluorescence-that is, up to 90 min after sunrise under cloud-free conditions. In the context of lidar remote sensing from an aircraft, dawn flights will allow measurements of F that lie close to dark-adapted values and that are little affected by PAR. At this time of day, light conditions would be adequate for safe low-altitude flights. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

The use of an image processing system, integrating bathymetric data, makes it possible to considerably refine the charting, through a layer of water of variable thickness and quality. Other limiting factors may have an impact on the quality of results. The identification of these factors makes it possible to propose a scale of reliability. Four examples of aerial teledetection surveys provide the basis for (i) assessing the reliability of the maps, (ii) determining the reasons for this variation in reliability, and (iii) using the scale as a means for assessing the reliability of a given map. The factors used are such that the reliability scale could subsequently be applied to the cartography of other marine assemblages.

J	Sasaki, M; Suzuki, M; Murata, K				Sasaki, M; Suzuki, M; Murata, K			Remote sensing of snowpack by microwave radiometer mounted on satellite	ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATIONS IN JAPAN PART I-COMMUNICATIONS												This paper uses measured data to analyze the relationship between the depth of the snowpack and the brightness temperature in the snowpack observation by microwave scanning radiometers (MSRs) on Marine Observation Satellite-1 (MOS-1) that is one of the satellite-borne microwave radiometers. In the analysis, a model is established in which the brightness temperature observed by the MSR captures mainly the effect of attenuation by scattering and absorption when the microwave radiated from the underlying ground passes through the snowpack. The measured data are statistically processed by taking into account the fluctuations of the data caused by the effect of various factors other than snowpack on brightness temperature. The MSR data from observations of the Hokkaido region from January to March in 1988 and the snowpack depth data observed on the ground are compared. It is found that the relationship between snowpack depth and the brightness temperature can be approximated by a straight line with a negative slope. The slope of the approximated straight line varies seasonally and this change reflects variations of the snowpack condition. Further, it is shown that there is a strong correlation between the average brightness temperature of the inland part of Hokkaido and that of the ocean surrounding Hokkaido. A possibility is suggested that the effect of atmospheric radiation can be estimated from the average brightness temperature of the nearby ocean.																	8756-6621					MAR	1997	80	3					58	66										WOS:A1997WU55100006

The system can perform area mapping at a rate of 100 km(2)/hr from low altitude light aircraft. Called the Scanning Low-Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SLFMR), the system is designed to operate from a small single-engine aircraft. The system is composed of an 8-beam 1.4 GHz microwave radiometer, a a-channel infrared radiometer, a Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) receiver for geolocation of the measurements and integral computer control. Working closely with personnel at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS), the SLFMR was fitted to the VIMS U6-A DeHavilland Beaver aircraft. The first test flights of the SLFMR were completed in August 1993 over the Chesapeake Bay and coincided with extensive boat-based monitoring missions conducted by VIMS and Old Dominion University. Due to extensive Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) the 1993 test was not totally successful. The system was subsequently re-flown in 1994 over the Chesapeake Bay in a more friendly RFI environment. In this case, successful remote sensing measurements were made, which compared favorably with in situ data collected by VIMS. A final flight was conducted over Delaware Bay in an even more friendly RFI environment, and the data compared favorably with historical data compiled from ship surveys.																	0749-0208					SPR	1997	13	2					363	372										WOS:A1997WW93600008

This sediment is predominantly suspended sediments. Calculation of suspended sediment flux requires the combination of suspended sediment concentration and water discharge records. A continuous record of suspended sediment concentration is derived for Land Ocean Interaction Study (LOIS) river monitoring sites using an innovative dual turbidity sensor system. Calibration of turbidity data, to provide a record of suspended sediment concentration, is achieved by comparisons with bulk water/sediment samples collected from Humber rivers, covering the full turbidity range usually encountered in British rivers. The equipment, methodologies and preliminary results are described, along with the potential errors and limitations. One of the functions of remote sensed data is to help understand the applicability of such point measurements. LOIS is using such data, acquired by imaging spectrometers mounted in an aircraft, to map the spatial distribution of suspended sediment concentration. A semi-empirical relationship has been developed between suspended sediment concentrations and the irradiance reflectance recorded in a near infra red band by the compact airborne spectral imager (CASI). The resulting data on the spatial distribution of suspended sediment concentration are illustrated by an example from the lower part of the River Ouse, Yorkshire. The next stage of the programme will integrate the field science and remote sensing studies with other LOIS rivers research on particle properties, river bank erosion and sediment source studies.

J	Considine, GD				Considine, GD			Modeling the diurnal variability in cloud microphysics in boundary layer clouds	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The purpose of this study is to understand and model the diurnal cycle in the microphysics of boundary layer clouds that has been inferred from recent remote sensing studies. To assess the modeled diurnal variation in cloud drop size, a one-dimensional cloud microphysics model is initialized with dynamical conditions that are typical of the contrast between daytime and nighttime clouds. The model-generated microphysics show a shift in droplet sizes from day to night that is consistent with that observed in satellite retrievals. The results indicate that the diurnal cycle in droplet size results from the shift in dynamical structure associated with the cloud becoming decoupled from the subcloud boundary layer during the day, along with an associated decrease in cloud-top entrainment. The effect of decoupling on drop size is also enhanced by a decreased concentration of activated droplets at cloud base associated with the characteristically smaller vertical updraft velocities for the decoupled clouds.																	2169-897X	2169-8996				JAN 27	1997	102	D2					1717	1726		10.1029/96JD02997								WOS:A1997WE65000003						
J	Chambers, LH; Wielicki, BA; Evans, KF				Chambers, LH; Wielicki, BA; Evans, KF			Accuracy of the independent pixel approximation for satellite estimates of oceanic boundary layer cloud optical depth	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												A theoretical study has been conducted on the effects of cloud horizontal inhomogeneity on the retrieval of optical depth by remote sensing of visible reflectance. Forty-five Landsat scenes of oceanic boundary layer clouds provide a sampling of real cloud fields, including trade cumulus, open and closed cell broken stratocumulus, and solid stratocumulus. The spherical harmonic discrete ordinate method (SHDOM) radiative transfer model is used to calculate two-dimensional reflectances from subsampled cloud strips representing the Landsat scenes. The independent pixel approximation (IPA) is used to retrieve optical depth for comparison to the original input. Results for tau(IPA) versus tau(ref) are presented on scales from the Landsat pixel scale (28.5 m) to an imager pixel scale (6 km) to near mesoscale (60 km). The random error decreases as the averaging scale increases, but error due to inhomogeneity remains. At the 60 km scale the average error is about 6% for high Sun, 2% for low Sun. Individual scenes, however, have retrieved optical depth errors as high as 45% due to horizontal radiative transport. The ability to retrieve higher statistical moments of the frequency distribution of optical depth is also assessed. Sigma, (sigma), the standard deviation of tau, is retrieved quite well up to a point, then is underestimated due to the smoothing effect of horizontal radiative transport. The gamma function parameter nu, another measure of the width of the tau frequency distribution, is retrieved quite well over a wide range but with a systematic bias which varies with solar zenith angle, again due to horizontal radiative transport. A method is sought to reduce the optical depth retrieval error using a simple correction based on remotely sensed cloud properties. Of those considered, cloud physical aspect ratio (computed here from one possible relation which depends on properties obtainable from remote sensing) is found to be the most effective correction parameter. The aspect ratio correction reduces the retrieved optical depth bias error by 50 to 100% and the RMS error by 20 to 50%. Correction coefficients are presented at three solar zenith angles. This work is limited by its consideration of only single-level marine boundary layer clouds, assumptions of conservative scattering, constant cloud droplet size, no gas absorption or surface reflectance, and restriction to two-dimensional radiative transport. Future work will attempt to remove some of these limitations. The Landsat data used are also limited due to radiative smoothing.																	2169-897X					JAN 27	1997	102	D2					1779	1794		10.1029/96JD02995								WOS:A1997WE65000007

These events will influence the geochemistry of adjacent waters, particularly the marine carbon system. Justification and design are provided for a study that would combine oceanographic satellite remote sensing (visible and infrared radiometry, altimetry and scatterometry) with shore-based facilities.

The geometry and chronology of the Cenozoic structures linked to the opening of this basin were studied in detail in Da Nang area (central Vietnam). An integrated onshore and offshore study was conducted, combining onland Landsat-Spot imagery interpretation and fracture analysis with marine geophysical data collected during the 1993 Ponaga cruise (R/V L'Atalante) and completed by previously unpublished industrial data. On land, two superposed fault sets were observed on remote sensing data: large N140 degrees E trending strike-slip faults are observed to link with E-W trending normal faults, and major N-S trending strike-slip faults are connected to N050 degrees E faults. At this scale of observation, no significant displacement can be demonstrated along these two strike-slip fault systems which show a cross-cutting map geometry without visible offset. The data collected offshore demonstrate that the N-S fault pattern is developed strongly, but there is no evidence of major N140 degrees E fault orientations. Important crustal extension on shallow-dipping fault planes striking N050 degrees E and connected to the N-S strike-slip faults, is compatible with dextral motion along these N-S faults. The discrepancy between the amount of motion observed onshore and offshore may be explained by the presence of a major N-S trending shear zone along the Vietnam margin. This shear zone is located in the region of the N-S Qui Nhon ridge, which is blanketed by Middle Miocene carbonates. Dextral motion along this shear zone became insignificant regionally during the late early Miocene (around 20 Ma), when carbonates deposition started. We suggest that central Vietnam records two distinct, and partly coeval, events of the strike-slip faulting that have contributed to the opening of the south China Sea: sinistral NW shear, then dextral N-S shear south of Hainan.

The present study is focused on the use of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) data as a powerful and efficient means for providing information about a case of coastal vegetation deterioration in Tuscany. This phenomenon, dating back about twenty-five years ago, mainly concerns the pine plantation which covers the plain south of the outlet of the Ombrone riper. In the last forty years this zone has also been affected by strong coastal erosion. The almost contemporaneous occurrence of the two phenomena, as well as the geographical distribution of the disease and some morpho-physiological features of the injured plants, has led to the formulation of an hypothesis which identifies the infiltration of marine salt water into the phreatic surface below the pine wood as the main cause of the deterioration. In this context, TM data not only provide precise and up-to-date information about the spatial distribution of the disease, but also give a straightforward means for quantitatively assessing vegetation conditions on a local scale (30-50 m.). The latter parameter has been related to the likely causative agent of the injury, i.e., the presence of salt water in the pine wood son. The results of the investigation confirm the working hypothesis and testify to the actual utility of high resolution satellite data in these situations.																	0749-0208					WIN	1996	12	1					103	111										WOS:A1996TW33400011

The main advantage of satellite data is the relatively low cost of acquisition over broad areas at regular intervals in time. Examples are (a) LANDSAT thematic mapper data and 'satellite pour l'observation de la terre' multispectral and panchromatic imagery which provide high resolution imagery for land-use mapping and bathymetric analysis, (b) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's advanced very high resolution radiometer which provides a synoptic view of sea surface temperature and meteorological conditions, and (c) European remote sensing satellites whose array of sensors provide information on wave characteristics and wind speed and direction. In the field of geographical information systems, the challenge is to create systems which can both store the large quantity of data available and incorporate models which can predict the effects of change to the environment.																	0951-7359					DEC	1996	10	6					423	428										WOS:A1996WB51600007

J	Morel, A; Gentili, B				Morel, A; Gentili, B			Diffuse reflectance of oceanic waters .3. Implication of bidirectionality for the remote-sensing problem	APPLIED OPTICS												The upwelling radiance field beneath the ocean surface and the emerging radiance field are not generally isotropic. Their bidirectional structure depends on the illumination conditions (the Sun's position in particular) and on the optical properties of the water body. In oceanic case 1 waters, these properties can be related, for each wavelength lambda, to the chlorophyll (Chl) concentration. We aim to quantify systematically the variations of spectral radiances that emerge from an ocean with varying Chl when we change the geometric conditions, namely, the zenith-Sun angle, the viewing angle, and the azimuth difference between the solar and observational vertical planes. The consequences of these important variations on the interpretation of marine signals, as detected by a satelliteborne ocean color sensor, are analyzed. In particular, the derivation of radiometric quantities, such as R(lambda), the spectral reflectance, or [L omega(lambda)](N), the normalized water-leaving radiance that is free from directional effects, is examined, as well as the retrieval of Chl. We propose a practical method that is based on the use of precomputed lookup tables to provide values of the f/Q ratio in all the necessary conditions [f relates R(lambda) to the backscattering and absorption coefficients, whereas Q is the ratio of upwelling irradiance to any upwelling radiance]. The f/Q ratio, besides being dependent on the geometric configuration (the three angles mentioned above), also varies with lambda and with the bio-optical state, conveniently depicted by Chl. Because Chl is one of the entries for the lookup table, it has to be derived at the beginning of the process, before the radiometric quantities R(lambda) or [L omega(lambda)](N) can be produced. The determination of Chl can be made through an iterative process, computationally fast, using the information at two wavelengths. In this attempt to remove the bidirectional effect, the commonly accepted view relative to the data-processing strategy is somewhat modified, i.e., reversed, as the Chl index becomes a prerequisite parameter that must be identified prior to the derivation of the fundamental radiometric quantities at all wavelengths.

We have analysed the precise altimeter data of the geodetic mission, and, by also using one year of Topex-Poseidon altimeter data, we have computed a global high-resolution mean sea surface. The various steps involved in pre-processing the ERS-1 data consisted of correcting the data for environmental factors, editing, and reducing, through crossover analyses, the radial orbit error, which directly affects sea-surface height measurements. For this purpose, we adjusted sinusoids at 1 and 2 cycle rev(-1) along the ERS-1 profiles in order to minimize crossover differences between ERS-1 and yearly averaged Topex-Poseidon profiles. In effect, the orbit of Topex-Poseidon is very accurately determined (within 2-3 cm for the radial component), so Topex-Poseidon altimeter profiles can serve as a reference to reduce the ERS-1 radial orbit error. The ERS-1 residual orbit error was further reduced through a second crossover analysis between all ascending and descending profiles of the geodetic mission. The along-track ERS-1 and Topex-Poseidon data were then interpolated over the whole oceanic domain on a regular grid of 1/16 degrees x1/16 degrees size. The mapping of the gridded sea-surface heights reveals the very fine structure of the marine geoid, up until now unknown at a global scale. This new data set will be most useful for marine geophysical and tectonic investigations.																	0956-540X					JUN	1996	125	3					696	704		10.1111/j.1365-246X.1996.tb06017.x								WOS:A1996UP51100003

The data are merged with surface wind output from a planetary boundary layer (PBL) model. The inputs to the PBL model are from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) global analyses. A method for interpolating these analyses to the time of the satellite passage, while preserving fundamental storm characteristics, was developed. Composite wind fields are constructed each time one or more of the satellites views the storms. These composite wind fields are compared to the near-surface wind fields from ECMWF analyses within the storm domain and to buoy wind data on a point-by-point basis. Comparison with ECMWF analyses shows that the composite winds are slightly higher and contain more mesoscale variability. Comparison with buoy data indicates that the composite winds are higher on average by 0.5 m s(-1). However, there was a lack of buoy data in the high wind regime (greater than 15 m s(-1)). Comparisons between the various wind sources in the high wind regions of midlatitude storms show significant diversity. Surface stress, divergence, vorticity, and air-sea heat flux fields are calculated using the composite winds. An example of the heat flux field associated with a midlatitude cyclone is shown, as well as the relationship between surface convergence and atmospheric water vapor.																	0894-8763					JUN	1996	35	6					769	781		10.1175/1520-0450(1996)035<0769:ASONSW>2.0.CO;2								WOS:A1996UV41900001

Because breaking waves generate bubble plumes, it could be possible to correlate the air-sea gas transport velocity k(L) with whitecap coverage. This correlation would then allow k(L) to be predicted from measurements of apparent microwave brightness temperature through the increase in sea surface microwave emissivity associated with breaking waves. In order to develop this remote-sensing-based method for predicting air-sea gas fluxes, a whitecap simulation tank was used to measure evasive and invasive k(L) values for air-seawater transfer of carbon dioxide, oxygen, helium, sulfur hexafluoride, and dimethyl sulfide at cleaned and surfactant-influenced water surfaces. An empirical model has been developed that can predict k(L) from bubble plume coverage, diffusivity, and solubility. The observed dependence of k(L) on molecular diffusivity and aqueous-phase solubility agrees with the predictions of modeling studies of bubble-driven air-water gas transfer. It has also been shown that soluble surfactants can decrease k(L) even in the presence of breaking waves.																	0148-0227					MAY 15	1996	101	C5					12027	12041		10.1029/96JC00121								WOS:A1996UL25800012

The developing understanding of turbulent entrainment and the understanding that turbulence is best described in the atmosphere by circulating self-contained entities, which are often buoyant and carry fluid from one level to another, has led to a unifying picture of clouds wherein all clouds and convective processes can be seen as one phenomenon in which various conditions decide the final form. The microphysical processes are described and the controlling effects of entity type entrainment mixing are shown to provide an explanation for many of the observations. The inadequacy of most computer calculations in providing viable models is pointed out. The need for self-consistent conceptual structures as a basis for adequate models is stressed. Improved instruments for remote sensing and aircraft measurements, along with the present conceptual developments and computational capabilities, suggest that adequate models of clouds may be soon developed.																	0169-8095					MAY	1996	40	2-4					261	282		10.1016/0169-8095(95)00038-0								WOS:A1996UR63800007						
J	Barducci, A; Pippi, I				Barducci, A; Pippi, I			Temperature and emissivity retrieval from remotely sensed images using the ''grey body emissivity'' method	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												The problem of extracting temperature and emissivity information from thermal infrared multispectral radiance data is of great importance in remote sensing applications. The Earth surface temperature is a relevant parameter for climatology, meteorology, oceanography, fire mapping, wind field determination, and energy balance at the atmosphere-Earth interface. In addition, ground emissivity is very important for lithological mapping, geological inspection, petrography, the dating of lava hows, etc. A new method for emissivity and temperature retrieval has been developed in our laboratory which is based on the assumption that emissivity is a slowly varying function of wavelength. It is shown that this assumption holds true for many kinds of natural targets. The resulting model is called ''grey body emissivity,'' and may be used to retrieve the emissivity of soils and other natural materials. The problem with using an effective wavelength or a bandwidth integral in order to represent the sampled radiance is discussed, thus leading to the implementation of two algorithms for the grey body emissivity. It is demonstrated that one of them, extensively discussed throughout the paper, provides the maximum likelihood values for temperature and emissivity. The other reveals two drawbacks: it produces noisy processed images and works well only for target temperatures greater than 274 K. Comparisons with other models are carried out utilizing remotely sensed images, laboratory measurements, and numerical simulations. The main approximations and the resulting errors, contained in the considered models, are briefly discussed. The influence of the atmospheric effects on utilized remote sensing data is taken into account. Finally, we investigate the emissivity dependence on the viewing angle. Theoretical predictions which rely on Fresnel's and Kirchhoff's laws are compared with the emissivity maps extracted from TIMS images over sea. Starting from the image data alone, the procedure allows us to compute the refraction index and the absorption coefficient of the concerned marine water.																	0196-2892					MAY	1996	34	3					681	695		10.1109/36.499748								WOS:A1996UM31400009

Four groups of spectra having distinct absorption characteristics and well-defined regional distributions were identified. The result of using general parameters to estimate the absorption coefficient of phytoplankton from any region, the 'general approach', was compared with the result of using specific parameters for each region, or the 'regional approach'. Two methods of estimating the absorption coefficient were tested for each approach. These were: a 'single-pigment' method (Prieur & Sathyendranath 1981, Limnol Oceanogr 26:671-689), and a 'multi-pigment' method (Hoepffner & Sathyendranath 1991, Mar Ecol Frog Ser 73:11-23). It was shown that the regional approach performed better (<10% average error) than the general approach (<20% average error). Nevertheless, the results given by the general approach could be acceptable for some applications. The multi-pigment and the single-pigment methods performed equally well in the context of the regional approach, whereas in the general approach, the single-pigment method gave better results than the multi-pigment method. Overall, it appears that partitioning the oceans into regions according to their absorption characteristics should improve regional models of light transmission and the algorithms for detection of pigments by remote sensing.																	0171-8630					MAY	1996	135	1-3					197	213		10.3354/meps135197								WOS:A1996UQ14500018

Throughout the study period, the Adelie penguin population size remained stable, whereas that of chinstrap penguins decreased slightly. For neither species were there significant relationships between population size and breeding success, except for an apparent inverse density-dependent relationship between the number of Adelie breeding pairs and the number of eggs hatching. For both species, no general relationship was found between either population size or breeding success and the local sea ice conditions. However, the regional sea ice extent at a particular time prior to the start of the breeding season was related to the number of birds that arrived to breed. For both species, this period occurred before the sea ice reached its maximum extent and was slightly earlier for Adelie than for chinstrap penguins. These results suggest that sea ice conditions outside the breeding season may play an important role in penguin population processes.																	0722-4060					MAY	1996	16	5					321	330										WOS:A1996UM01000002						
J	Panin, GN; Karetnikov, SG				Panin, GN; Karetnikov, SG			Density structure of the fine surface water layer of large lakes and remote measurement of the temperature	HYDROBIOLOGIA					1st International Lake Ladoga Symposium on Ecological Problems of Lake Ladoga	NOV 22-26, 1993	ST PETERSBURG, RUSSIA	Univ Joensuu, Finland, Russian Acad Sci, Inst Limnol				Remote sensing of surface temperatures in large lakes differs in some critical. respects from that in marine conditions. Firstly, the atmospheric structure over large lakes has some continental features, which makes the calculation of its influence more complicated. Secondly, the vertical temperature structure in the fine surface layer of a lake is more complex than in marine waters. A prominent feature of the thermal structure of spring heating of large lakes (e.g. in Lake Ladoga from May to July) is the existence of a thermal front, which is manifested on the lake surface as a tine strip with steep horizontal temperature gradient. The existence of a thermal front makes it possible to calibrate infra-red space survey data without using in situ surface temperature measurements. The calibration of arbitrary heat brightness values for +4 degrees C can be obtained by plotting a frequency distribution histogram of the heat brightness values obtained for the IR-image pixels. While the thermal front is in existence, the heat brightness frequency distribution appears bimodal, and the brightness value at the minimum between the peaks is assigned the temperature of +4 degrees C. Laboratory and field experiments have enabled us to separate two types of near-surface density structures. Under conditions of density instability in the fine surface layer, microconvection limits the magnitude of vertical temperature difference in this layer to a constant range of 0.6-0.8 degrees C. However, when a stable density structure prevails during calm conditions, much greater vertical temperature differences may exist.

The apparent lack of associated insects or diseases that could have caused this change led to an investigation of possible environmental causes. Suspected variables were fog chemistry and frequency, rain chemistry, and ozone exposure. Significant (p = 0.05-0.01) spatial and temporal correlations of foliar browning with the fog frequency and fog chemistry variables have been detected, and their possible cause-effect relationship evaluated using both conventional on the ground sampling and remote sensing techniques. The use of remote sensing techniques, though not conclusive over the time it was carried out, did show the potential for future investigation of this type. In this study the deterioration of the two principal taxa, paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) and mountain paper birch (Betula cordifolia Regel), were examined in terms of crown dieback and compared. These two taxa occur as separate stands or as a mixture in the birch plots. Comparisons of mortality responses of the two birch taxa together with results of leaf browning on transplanted young clones of the two taxa indicated a significantly (p < 0.001) greater sensitivity of B. cordifolia, whereas no significant differences between the taxa exist for percentage of trees with dieback. The potential role of sensitive indicators, such as B. cordifolia, as biomonitors of atmospheric change in an ecotonal situation like the Fundy coast is important, as these may give us the first indications of vegetation response to a changing chemical and physical environment.																	0045-5067					APR	1996	26	4					682	688		10.1139/x26-078								WOS:A1996UH46800021						
J	Sublette, MS; Young, GS				Sublette, MS; Young, GS			Warm-season effects of the Gulf Stream on mesoscale characteristics of the atmospheric boundary layer	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												The meteorological regime off the coast of North Carolina exhibits little synoptic-scale baroclinity during the summer months. As a result, the large-scale atmospheric forcing in this region is frequently weak. Given this weak synoptic forcing, mesoscale boundary layer circulations are dominant. One such circulation develops in response to the sea surface temperature discontinuity between the Gulf Stream and the relatively cooler water of the Continental Shelf. When synoptic conditions are favorable, differences in surface fluxes of heat and moisture across this discontinuity cause the development of an ageostrophic solenoidal circulation and the creation of an atmospheric boundary layer convergence zone. This resulting frontal zone, or Gulf Stream atmospheric front (GSAF), is a commonly observed feature in this region during the warm season. Simulations using The Pennsylvania State University-National Center for Atmospheric Research mesoscale model are combined with data gathered from the High-Resolution Remote Sensing Experiment to study the effects of the Gulf Stream on mesoscale circulations in the warm-season marine atmospheric boundary layer. Particular attention was given to determining whether a model with resolution and physics similar to those of operational mesoscale forecast models can adequately predict this phenomenon. Although limitations in the horizontal and vertical resolution of the model prevent detailed reproduction of the meso-gamma-scale structure of the GSAF, the model does produce a significant meso-beta boundary layer convergence zone in response to the local SST maximum associated with the Gulf Stream. The magnitude of the modeled response is primarily a function of air-sea temperature difference, the local wind vector, and the depth of the boundary layer.																	0027-0644					APR	1996	124	4					653	667										WOS:A1996UG73900007						
J	Alpers, W; Stilke, G				Alpers, W; Stilke, G			Observation of a nonlinear wave disturbance in the marine atmosphere by the synthetic aperture radar aboard the ERS 1 satellite	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												A nonlinear wave disturbance in the marine atmosphere associated with an atmospheric cold front has been identified on a spaceborne radar image of the North Sea by its imprint on the sea surface. This nonlinear wave disturbance is either a solitary wave disturbance or an undular bore propagating in the lower marine atmosphere. The radar image showing sea surface manifestations of this atmospheric wave disturbance was acquired over the North Sea by the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) aboard the first European Remote Sensing Satellite ERS 1 on March 8, 1992. Atmospheric waves become visible on radar images of the sea surface because they are associated with a varying wind field at the sea surface which modulates the sea surface roughness and thus the backscattered radar power. The identification of the wave pattern visible on the ERS 1 SAR image as a sea surface manifestation of an atmospheric nonlinear wave disturbance has been possible because this disturbance was also captured by meteorological sensors mounted on an 80-m high meteorological mast located on the island of Heligoland. Geophysical parameters characterizing the atmospheric wave disturbance are derived from the ERS 1 SAR image and from the in situ meteorological data. The wave period in the reference frame moving with the average wind is 9.5 min, the average wavelength is 2300 m, and the propagation velocity is 4.5-4.9 m s(-1). Estimates of the amplitude of the wind speed fluctuations in the wave propagation direction derived from the meteorological measurements at Heligoland and from the gray level variations in the SAR image yield values between 1.3 and 3.0 m s(-1). The experimental data are interpreted in terms of theories of atmospheric nonlinear gravity waves.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				MAR 15	1996	101	C3					6513	6525		10.1029/95JC03304								WOS:A1996UA57400014						
J	Hudak, DR; Stewart, RE; Thomson, AD; List, R				Hudak, DR; Stewart, RE; Thomson, AD; List, R			Warm frontal structure in association with a rapidly deepening extratropical cyclone	ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN												The detailed characteristics of a CASP II warm frontal passage are presented in this article. This storm, Intensive Operating Period (IOP) 13 (February 26-27, 1992), was observed in detail with an array of diverse instruments. It has the advantage over earlier freezing precipitation studies of having simultaneous, in situ and remote sensing measurements by aircraft and ground-based Doppler radar. The associated precipitation was in the form of banded structures parallel to the front. Within these bands were embedded precipitation cores, some parallel to the band, some perpendicular. The warm front itself was characterized by major perturbations in its kinematic and thermodynamic features. The cores oriented parallel to the front were the result of embedded convection generated, at least in part, by the irregularities in the frontal surface. The cores oriented perpendicular to the front were closely associated with the 0 degrees C isotherm on the underside of the frontal inversion. Precipitation phase changes played a significant role in the occurrence of wide near 0 degrees C regions, both vertically and horizontally These regions had a profound influence on the observed precipitation types and led to complex precipitation-thermodynamic-dynamic interactions. Instabilities produced by these interactions are seen in wave-like features observed by the Doppler radar in these regions, both parallel and perpendicular to the frontal zone.																	0705-5900					MAR	1996	34	1					103	132		10.1080/07055900.1996.9649559								WOS:A1996VC18500006

Three of them are fully equipped with a remote sensing system. This system, including a bispectral scanner system Daedalus AA 2000 and a multispectral scanner system Daedalus DS 1268, can make a quick and effective survey both of the shoreline and large areas offshore and process and interpret real time data. Environmental (oil pollution erosion, coastal assessment) and policing purposes (identification and appraisal of illegal releases, prevention and repression of unauthorized building) are supported by such surveys. Satellite platforms (ERS-1, ERS-2) can he utilized for surveillance duties, although, in the case of operational activities, a comparison with the data available from airborne remote sensing system must be made. The planning of such a programme cannot be carried out without a keen cost-benefit evaluation.

J	Robins, DB; Aiken, J				Robins, DB; Aiken, J			The Atlantic Meridional Transect: An oceanographic research programme to investigate physical, chemical, biological and optical variables of the Atlantic Ocean	UNDERWATER TECHNOLOGY												Oceanographers from the Plymouth Marine Laboratory, together with colleagues from the Southampton Oceanography Centre, University of Plymouth, University of Oviedo (Spain), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, USA) and Brookhaven National Laboratory (USA) have started a programme of research which consists of a series of transects of the Atlantic Ocean between the United Kingdom and Falkland Islands. The primary aim of the research is to measure physical, chemical. biological and optical variables in the upper 200 m of the water column along the 12 000 km transect in order to characterise the Atlantic Ocean over broad spacial scales. This will help further the understanding of the role of the world's oceans in carbon cycles and provide valuable information for the calibration and validation of satellite remote sensing (i.e. for ocean colour and surface temperature) of the oceans. The use of 'ships of opportunity' is essential to carry out broad scale research, and the development and use of new technology is an important part of this process. This report reviews the key issues and the relevance of such research and also highlights the new generation of technology that is required to work at these broad spatial scales. The data presented here are generated at sea in 'real' or 'near real' time and they define the areas of greatest plankton abundance and productivity, as well as regions of hydrographic contrast. In turn this will allow a more focused and targeted strategy for intensive sampling and analyses. The role of the oceans in interacting with atmospheric carbon dioxide (one of the so-called greenhouse gases) is also discussed.																	0141-0814					SPR	1996	21	4					8	14		10.3723/175605496783328529								WOS:A1996UN70700003						
J	Dabberdt, WF; Schlatter, TW				Dabberdt, WF; Schlatter, TW			Research opportunities from emerging atmospheric observing and modeling capabilities	BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												The Second Prospectus Development Team (PDT-2) of the U.S. Weather Research Program was charged with identifying research opportunities that are best matched to emerging operational and experimental measurement and modeling methods. The overarching recommendation of PDT-2 is that inputs for weather forecast models can best be obtained through the use of composite observing systems together with adaptive (or targeted) observing strategies employing both in situ and remote sensing. Optimal observing systems and strategies are best determined through a three-part process: observing system simulation experiments, pilot field measurement programs, and model-assisted data sensitivity experiments. Furthermore, the mesoscale research community needs easy and timely access to the new operational and research datasets in a form that can readily be reformatted into existing software packages for analysis and display. The value of these data is diminished to the extent that they remain inaccessible. The composite observing system of the future must combine synoptic observations, routine mobile observations, and targeted observations, as the current or forecast situation dictates. High costs demand fuller exploitation of commercial aircraft, meteorological and navigation [Global Positioning System (GPS)] satellites, and Doppler radar. Single observing systems must be assessed in the context of a composite system that provides complementary information. Maintenance of the current North American rawinsonde network is critical for progress in both research-oriented and operational weather forecasting. Adaptive sampling strategies are designed to improve large-scale and regional weather prediction but they will also improve diagnosis and prediction of flash flooding, air pollution, forest fire management, and other environmental emergencies. Adaptive measurements can be made by piloted or unpiloted aircraft. Rawinsondes can be launched and satellites can be programmed to make adaptive observations at special times or in specific regions. PDT-2 specifically recommends the following forms of data gathering: a pilot field and modeling study should be designed and executed to assess the benefit of adaptive observations over the eastern Pacific for mesoscale forecasts over the contiguous United States; studies should be done over the western Atlantic and Caribbean-Gulf of Mexico regions, particularly during hurricane season; and enhanced observations should be implemented for the mountainous western states and for the Mississippi and Missouri River Valleys. Data sensitivity tests and observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) are important tools for gauging the benefit of existing or proposed observing systems. OSSEs involve only model predictions and are essentially self-contained. Data sensitivity tests require the full consideration of modeling infrastructure, namely, observation ingest quality control, objective analysis, and numerical prediction. Sensitivity tests involving both wind and moisture profiles are particularly needed to determine their impact on improved precipitation forecasts. New variational analysis techniques are capable of assimilating so-called proxy observations. These techniques should be fully exploited. Diabatic initialization should be addressed through the assimilation of satellite cloud data and very high resolution WSR-88D radar measurements into very high resolution models with sophisticated cloud microphysics. Success in this area should improve quantitative precipitation forecasts in the first few (model) hours. There is a pressing need to better understand the interaction of moist convection with large-scale flow. One key is better characterization of the impact of precipitation formation and evaporation on the fluxes of mass, momentum, and heat in moist convection. Humidity measurement in precipitating downdrafts is a crucial measurement, which currently cannot be made reliably. The capabilities of polarization-diversity radar should be explored in a quasi-operational context to determine whether WSR-88D radars should be upgraded. Progress in quantitative precipitation forecasting is impeded by poorly resolved and inaccurate water vapor measurements. Further improvements in numerical weather prediction demand improved monitoring of Earth surface characteristics so that spatial and temporal variations in air-surface fluxes are realistically simulated. Over land, priority should be given to the coupling of mesoscale meteorological models with hydrological models and to routine assimilation of surface (soil, moisture, and plant) characteristics. Improved air-sea fluxes are essential to proper modeling of marine cyclogenesis. The most important, practical ocean measurements include sea surface temperature, thermocline depth, wave spectra, and ice coverage and thickness.

These applications ave discussed in the context of specific management objectives and sensors used. Remote sensing remains the only way to obtain synoptic data for large coastal areas uniformly in time and space, repeatedly and nonintrusively. Routine applications to tropical coastal management include the mapping of littoral and shallow marine habitats, change detection, bathymetry mapping, and the study of suspended sediment plumes and coastal currents. The case studies reviewed suggest that wider use of remote sensing in tropical coastal zone management is limited by (1) factors that affect data availability, such as cloud cover and sensor specification; and (2) the problems that decision makers face in selecting a remote sensing technique suitable to their project objectives. These problems arise from the difficulty in comparing the capabilities of different sensors and the limited amount of published information available on practical considerations, such as cost-effectiveness and accuracy assessments. The latter are essential if management decisions are to be based upon the results.

J	Siegel, DA; Michaels, AF				Siegel, DA; Michaels, AF			Quantification of non-algal light attenuation in the Sargasso Sea: Implications for biogeochemistry and remote sensing	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Observations of the diffuse attenuation coefficient spectrum (K-d(z,t,lambda)), made as part of the U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS), Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS), show significant seasonal variations that do not covary with the patterns in chlorophyll a concentrations. The spectral structure of these changes indicates that the variations in optical properties are caused by detrital particulate and/or colored dissolved organic materials. Multiple regression analyses over wavelength are used to deconvolve this ''colored dissolved or detrital material'' (CDM) signal from the chlorophyll signal. Generally, CDM light attenuation is nearly as large as the chlorophyll-related attenuation and it exhibits a seasonal signal related to changes in mixed-layer depth. In the winter, values of CDM are roughly uniform throughout the upper 150 m of the mixed layer, whereas in the summer significantly reduced CDM values are found in a shallow mixed layer with elevated values in the seasonal pycnocline. The summer-time pattern appears to be caused by the combination of reduction of CDM within the mixed layer by photo-oxidation and its production at depth. This seasonal cycle is different than that observed for dissolved organic or particulate organic carbon at BATS. Hence, optical inferences of CDM are not directly related to biogeochemically relevant materials, such as dissolved organic carbon. Quantification of the photon flux absorbed by CDM can be used to assess the role of CDM quanta absorption in photochemical transformations. We suggest that CDM-regulated rates of photo-oxidation play a critical role in the regulation of near-surface dimethyl sulfide concentrations on a seasonal timescale. Last, the existence of a strong CDM signal requires modification of the techniques used to estimate chlorophyll from satellite ocean color sensors.

Two physically distinct areas were studied: a well-mixed area in a shallow portion of the Bank and a stratified area on the deeper southern flank of the Bank. A submersible echo sounder with a down-looking transducer was mounted in a towed V-fin. Volume backscattering data were collected from near the sea surface to the bottom (40-80 m). Vertical and horizontal volume backscattering structure in the stratified region differed from that in the well-mixed area in both mean and variance, providing evidence that physical forcing of the pattern varied significantly between the two areas. Internal waves appeared to modulate the depth of dense mid-depth volume scattering layers in the stratified sites. In the mixed area, there was little horizontal layering or coarse-scale horizontal structure. However, fine-scale vertical lineations were evident with horizontal length scales on the order of the depth of the water column. One hypothesis to explain these vertical lineations in the well-mixed areas involves the development of secondary vertical circulation cells associated with the tidal hows over a rough bottom. Although volume backscattering at the stratified sites was 4-7 times higher than at the mixed site, there was no significant difference in MOCNESS (Multiple Opening/Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System) collected biovolumes between these locations. The difference in volume backscattering was due to differences in both the acoustic scattering properties of zooplankton taxa and the taxonomic composition of the plankton between the sites. Correlations between taxon abundance and volume scattering were positive and significant only for pteropods and euphausiid larvae. The abundances of copepods, chaetognaths, fish larvae, and amphipods were not significantly correlated with volume scattering. When taxon-specific model predictions of acoustic backscattering cross-section, developed by Stanton et al. (ICES Journal of Marine Science, 51 (1994) 505-512), were used with field collected individual size and abundance data to predict measured volume backscattering data, good agreement was found between observed and predicted volume backscattering strengths.

J	Burnett, TL				Burnett, TL			Petroleum exploration risk reduction using new geoscience technology	ENERGY EXPLORATION & EXPLOITATION												As economics of the oil and gas industry become more restrictive, the need for new means of improving exploration risks and reducing expenses is becoming more acute. Partnerships between industry and academia are making significant improvements in four general areas. Seismic acquisition, reservoir characterization, quantitative structural modeling, and geochemical inversion. In marine seismic acquisition the vertical cable concept utilizes hydrophones suspended at fixed locations vertically within the water column by buoys. There are numerous advantages of vertical cable technology over conventional 3-D seismic acquisition. In a related methodology, 'Borehole Seismic,' seismic energy is passed between wells and valuable information on reservoir geometry, porosity, lithology, and oil saturation is extracted from the P-wave and S-wave data. In association with seismic methods of determining the external geometry and the internal properties of a reservoir, 3-dimensional sedimentation-simulation models, based on physical, hydrologic, erosional and transport processes, are being utilized for stratigraphic analysis. In addition, powerful, 1-D, coupled reaction-transport models are being used to simulate diagenesis processes in reservoir rocks. At the regional scale, the bridging of quantitative structural concepts with seismic interpretation has lead to breakthroughs irt structural analysis, particularly in complex terrains. Such analyses are becoming more accurate and cost effective when tied to highly advanced, remote-sensing, multi-spectral data acquisition and image processing technology. Emerging technology in petroleum geochemistry enables geoscientists to infer the character, age, maturity, identity and location of source rocks from crude oil characteristics ('Geochemical Inversion') and to better estimate hydrocarbon-supply volumetrics, which can be invaluable in understanding petroleum systems and in reducing exploration risks and associated expenses.																	0144-5987						1996	14	6					507	534		10.1177/014459879601400602								WOS:A1996WH92800002						
J	Frihy, OE				Frihy, OE			Some proposals for coastal management of the Nile delta coast	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Although the 260 km coastline of the Nile delta is undergoing regional retreat, there are a number of localities experiencing accretion. Recent studies on the Nile delta coast have confirmed that significant erosion has affected approximately half of the coastline, with the greatest effects being adjacent to the Rosetta and Damietta promontories. Significant erosion has also occurred along the central bulge of the delta coast at Burullus. On the whole, the eroded sand is carried along the shore eastward, or locally to the west, migrating from the Nile promontories. The sand is then deposited in areas of beach accretion within the saddles or embayments between these promontories. Recognition of long-term trends of shoreline changes along the delta coast provides a basis for proposing a coastal management scheme for new resort benches. In this study, five presently unused accretionary coastal stretches have been identified for development possibilities to serve the northern delta region. Evaluation of these coasts was based on rates of annual coastline encroachment, littoral drift and morphodynamic status, all of which would provide information on management of these beaches. A database management system, using remote sensing and conventional field survey methods in combination with a geographical information system (GIS) tool, is proposed for implementing an integrated coastal zone management plan for multiple uses of the Nile delta coastal zone, and the identified unused benches in particular This system would help in carrying out activities related to coastal and marine management, including holiday resort beach industry, tourism, marine recreation, fisheries, land reclamation, human settlement and planning infrastructures.

J	Barale, V; Folving, S				Barale, V; Folving, S			Remote sensing of coastal interactions in the Mediterranean region	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												The coastal regions of the Mediterranean are the site of countless economic and recreational activities, but are threatened by dramatic dangers of misuse and pollution. Adequate tools are needed to study the environmental pressure imposed on these regions by the conflicting needs of protecting their ecological balance and exploiting their natural resources. Coastal ecosystems are very sensitive to the environmental impact of land use in watersheds, along the coast and further inland, of fluvial discharges, and of marine processes. Weathering, erosion, or waste disposal on land, as well as other activities at sea, such as shipping, dumping or oil extraction, are but a few of the factors which would require that the coastal areas be suitably monitored. Modern techniques of environmental assessment call for the rise of integrated observation systems. The collection of data with traditional coastal installations remains an important component of such research. However, the large space scales and short time scales of many near-coastal and/or marine processes require the use of (orbital) remote sensors. In particular, optical sensors, operating in the visible/infrared spectral region, have shown their usefulness for providing novel information on physical, gee-chemical and biological processes of the coastal area. Optical remote sensing of the coastal zone finds applications in studies of land use, surface cover, hydrology and coastal ecology at large; of water quality and sediment transport, coastal runoff and circulation, or dynamical processes (looking, e.g., at the evolution of pigment and/or temperature patterns, and their distribution as related to plankton dynamics, currents or river plumes); as well as in those of energy transfer, carbon cycling and climatology in general. Selected applications of optical observation techniques in the Mediterranean region, conducted in the framework of international demonstration programmes (i.e. the Ocean Colour European Archive Network, OCEAN, Project), provide examples of the remote sensing potential in the field of integrated coastal/marine environmental management.

During these flights the laser environmental airborne fluorosensor was operated to test its ability to detect off in an actual marine environment. This joint project was sponsored by the United States Minerals Management Service and the Emergencies Science Division of Environment Canada. The Santa Barbara area of the California coastline contains numerous gas and petroleum deposits, which are slowly released from faults under the water and rise to the surface in the form of gas, oil and tar. In and around several of these seeps are kelp beds that release biogenic material, which can be mistaken for petroleum oil by certain remote sensors and human observers. This biogenic oil does not fluoresce when irradiated with ultraviolet light since it contains none of the aromatic compounds necessary to absorb the ultraviolet light and return fluorescence. The laser environmental airborne fluorosensor is, therefore, able to discriminate between this non-fluorescing oil and petroleum oils, which fluoresce with characteristic spectral signatures and intensities. High-resolution colour reconnaissance camera images and down-looking video images were collected concurrently with the fluorescence data for documentation purposes. Fluorescence data were collected at 100 Hz and correlated in real-time against reference spectra characteristic of light refined, crude and heavy oils. Maps of oil detection locations were produced in flight aml printed in the aircraft. This paper will present details of the overflights and post-flight analysis of the fluorescence data using the Pearson correlation coefficient.

The results obtained indicate that simple algorithms, which operate on data recorded by SeaWiFS bands 2, 3, and 5, should have the capability to discriminate pixels containing Trichodesmium at concentrations as low as 0.1-0.3 mg m(-3) chlorophyl a, as well as to yield an estimate of the concentration.

Undesirable radiation components such as ground-reflected solar radiation and thermal radiation are guessed from satellite-received radiances in channels 1, 3, and 4 of AVHRR and subtracted from radiances in channels 1 and 3 to derive the reflected solar radiation of a cloud layer that includes information about cloud microphysical properties. This method can be applied to a broad range of water clouds from semitransparent to thick clouds. This method was applied to AVHRR data acquired over oceans during the First ISCCP Regional Experiment and the Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition Experiment; The authors found good agreement between satellite-derived and in situ microphysical quantities. The presence of drizzle droplets in optically thin clouds was also confirmed from the satellite observation. Furthermore, the results show that marine stratocumulus clouds were drastically modified by ship track effluents and dust-contaminated airflow from the continent.

One backscatter regime is mottled. In contrast to that, the second backscatter regime is marbled. The authors hypothesize that the mottled backscatter pattern is a characteristic SAR backscatter pattern linked to the presence of the convective (i.e., statically unstable/convective-eddy containing) marine atmospheric boundary layer (CMABL) and can be used to help determine CMABL structure [convective-eddy type (cellular convection versus longitudinal rolls), eddy wavelength, and CMABL depth (via mixed-layer similarity theory for aspect ratio)]. The hypothesis linking the presence and structure of the CMABL to the mottled backscatter pattern on SAR imagery is validated by analyzing data from a number of sources gathered in the vicinity of the boundary between the mottled and marbled regimes on the SAR image.																	0027-0644					DEC	1995	123	12					3623	3632		10.1175/1520-0493(1995)123<3623:UOSSAR>2.0.CO;2								WOS:A1995TG28500016						
J	Piazena, H; Hader, DP				Piazena, H; Hader, DP			Vertical distribution of phytoplankton in coastal waters and its detection by backscattering measurements	PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY												Remote sensing using backscattering data sampled by satellite or airplane is a promising method of monitoring the content of phytoplankton in marine waters. Usually the analysis of the organism concentration is based on the ratio of signals in suitable spectral channels. However, the attenuation of the optical signals involved in the analysis does not only depend on the concentration of organisms but also on their vertical distribution in the water column, on the water type and on the individual content of chlorophyll and accessory pigments in the species that establish the population. The present paper discusses the results of direct measurements of both vertical distribution of phytoplankton concentration and of solar spectral irradiation scattered and absorbed in different waters of the Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean. From these measurements relations are derived between backscattered spectral signals, water type and the vertical distribution of the organisms. The content of organisms in the column is consistently underestimated if no additional information on water type and vertical distribution of the organisms is taken into account. These data can be estimated from backscattering data of high resolution. In addition, a calibration and adaptation of the remote sensing data by ground truth is necessary to determine the optical properties of different species.																	0031-8655					DEC	1995	62	6					1027	1034										WOS:A1995TQ24500014

A programme of remote sensing was undertaken in connection with two cruises by research vessels in the North-East Water polynya at the north-east corner of Greenland. Data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument on the NOAA satellites and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) on ERS-1 was used supported by ground information collected by the research vessel, USCGC Polar Sea. The observations made are reported with examples of special events that control the state of the polynya. Based on repeated observations of flees the motion pattern is determined, for 1992 by means of AVHRR and for 1993 by ERS-1 SAR. They confirm the anti-cyclonic movement around the Belgica Bank supported by a system of troughs surrounding the Bank. The influence of a storm is studied as well as that of the break-off of major parts of the shorefast ice that limit the polynya in the north and the south. On this basis the maintenance of the polynya during the summer is discussed and the possible influence of these barriers. They are probably very important for the existence and the extent of the polynya. The periods studied are considered too short to reveal conclusive results and they give only a hint of what happens during the winters preceding the opening of the polynya in spring.																	0143-1161					NOV 20	1995	16	17					3307	3324		10.1080/01431169508954632								WOS:A1995TH68900008

This statement is true whether the climate change of interest is caused by changing emissions of greenhouse gases and sulfates, deforestation, ozone depletion, volcanic eruptions, or changes in the solar constant. This paper presents an overview of the role of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Earth Observing System (EOS) satellite data in understanding the role of clouds in the global climate system. The paper gives a brief summary of the cloud/radiation problem, and discusses the critical observations needed to support further investigations. The planned EOS data products are summarized, including the critical advances over current satellite cloud and radiation budget data. Key advances include simultaneous observation of radiation budget and cloud properties, additional information on cloud particle size and phase, improved detection of thin clouds and multilayer cloud systems, greatly reduced ambiguity in partially cloud-filled satellite fields of view, improved calibration and stability of satellite-observed radiances, and improved estimates of radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere, at the surface, and at levels within the atmosphere. Outstanding sampling and remote sensing issues that affect data quality are also discussed. Finally, the EOS data are placed in the context of other satellite observations as well as the critical surface, field experiment, and laboratory data needed to address the role of clouds in the climate system. It is concluded that the EOS data are a necessary but insufficient condition for solution of the scientific cloud/radiation issues. A balanced approach of satellite, field, and laboratory data will be required. These combined data can span the necessary spatial scales of global, regional, cloud cell, and cloud particle physics (i.e., from 10(8) to 10(-7) m).

J	GRIFFITH, LL; SHOCK, EL				GRIFFITH, LL; SHOCK, EL			A GEOCHEMICAL MODEL FOR THE FORMATION OF HYDROTHERMAL CARBONATES ON MARS	NATURE												IT IS often argued(1-3) that substantially more carbon dioxide and water were degassed from the martian interior that can be found at present in the atmosphere, polar caps and regolith. Calculations have shown that atmospheric escape cannot account for all of the missing volatiles(4). Suggestions that carbon dioxide is stored as marine or lacustrine deposits(5), are challenged by Earth-based and spacecraft remote-sensing data(6,7). Moreover, recent modelling of the martian atmosphere suggests that rainfall or open bodies of water are in any case unlikely to have persisted for extended periods of time(8,9). Hydrothermal carbonates therefore provide a possible solution to this dilemma. Using an accessible terrestrial system (Iceland) as a guide to the underlying processes, and a host rock composition inferred from the least-altered martian meteorite(10), we present a geochemical model for the formation of carbonates in possible martian hydrothermal systems. Our results suggest that an extensive reservoir of carbonate minerals--equivalent to an atmospheric pressure of carbon dioxide of at least one bar--could have been sequestered beneath the surface by widespread hydrothermal activity in the martian past.																	0028-0836					OCT 5	1995	377	6548					406	408		10.1038/377406a0								WOS:A1995RY19000041	7566116					
J	AAS, E; SORENSEN, K				AAS, E; SORENSEN, K			FIELD OBSERVATIONS OF THE RELATION BETWEEN SATELLITE AND SEA RADIANCES IN COASTAL WATERS	APPLIED OPTICS												Estimates of the different contributions to the satellite radiance above the outer Oslofjord are presented. The contribution from the sea is of the order of 10% of the total signal, and the part due to reflection from the sea surface constitutes 10-20%. The presence of land may increase the satellite radiance up to 4-9%, but such effects, which are probably reduced to 1/e at a distance of 1 km from the coast, cannot be detected in the present measurements. In situ observations of the marine radiance are corrected for shadings by ship and instrument and for varying solar altitude. The average correction for the self-shading effect of the marine instrument becomes 30-50% in these waters. The linear relations between satellite and sea radiances are determined with correlation coefficients of better than 0.95. The observed minimum value of the satellite radiance (or darkest pixel) is not a satisfactory approximation for the atmospheric correction. It is concluded that, in coastal waters and at the present stage, satellite observations have to be combined with held measurements to obtain reliable results.

These measurements were taken during five different marine field programs. A progression is made from a midlatitude marine stratocumulus regime with an average cloud fraction of 0.7 and a median cloud base of 460 m to a marine tropical regime with an average cloud fraction of 0.2 and a median cloud base of 1050 m. Measurements of the solar transmission coefficient taken during the Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition Experiment (ASTEX) were used in a radiative transfer algorithm to produce values of albedo, absorption, and optical depth. A microwave radiometer provided measurements of the liquid water path (LWP). For a given LWP, the ASTEX optical depths averaged a factor of 2 smaller than the optical depths observed during the marine stratocumulus phase of the First International Cloud Climatology Program Regional Experiment (FIRE) at San Nicolas Island, off the coast of southern California. The variability of boundary-layer aerosol concentrations measured during ASTEX is sufficient to produce a factor of 2 change in optical depth. Further evidence suggests that the cloud droplet effective radius was nearly a factor of 2 larger during ASTEX than during FIRE.																	0022-4928					AUG 15	1995	52	16					2827	2838		10.1175/1520-0469(1995)052<2827:SBRSOM>2.0.CO;2								WOS:A1995RN65500011

The change in its surface area was investigated by means of satellite remote sensing using spot scene. The satellite picture enabled us to locate the colony and to determine that the surface area occupied by the colony has increased by 56% between 1962 and 1988. The increase in the surface area occupied by the colony was confirmed by a map realised in 1982 (by the Institut Geographique National). The high resolution system available on the spot system which allows at present at 10 m ground resolution, and 5 m in the near future, can thus be a useful tool for monitoring medium to long-term changes in marine bird populations breeding in colonies composed of birds spaced a constant distance from one another. Based on the surface area occupied by the colony and the published data on the population size on Possession Island, as well as information on the breeding frequency of the species, we estimated that the total breeding population is about 1,000,000 pairs for the whole archipelago and that about 70% of birds breed at Ile aux Cochons.																	0722-4060					AUG	1995	15	7					511	515										WOS:A1995RR49900007						
J	CULLEN, JJ; LEWIS, MR				CULLEN, JJ; LEWIS, MR			BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND OPTICAL MEASUREMENTS NEAR THE SEA SURFACE: SOME ISSUES RELEVANT TO REMOTE SENSING	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The advent of remote sensing, the development of new optical instrumentation, and the associated advances in hydrological optics have transformed oceanography: it is now feasible to describe ocean-scale biogeochemical dynamics from satellite observations, verified and complemented by measurements from optical sensors on profilers, moorings, and drifters. Only near-surface observations are common to both remote sensing and in situ observation, so it is critical to understand processes in the upper euphotic zone. Unfortunately, the biological principles that must be used to interpret optical variability near the sea surface are weaker than we would like, because relatively few experiments and analyses have examined bio-optical relationships under high irradiance characteristic of the upper optical depth. Special consideration of this stratum is justified, because there is good evidence that bio-optical relationships are altered near the surface: (1) the fluorescence yield from chlorophyll declines, leading to bias in the estimation of pigment from fluorometry; (2) the modeled relationship between solar-stimulated fluorescence and photosynthesis seems to deviate significantly from that presented for the lower euphotic zone; and (3) carbon-specific and cellular attenuation cross sections of phytoplankton change substantially during exposures to bright light. Even the measurement of primary productivity is problematic near the sea surface, because vertical mixing is not simulated and artifactual inhibition of photosynthesis can result. These problems can be addressed by focusing more sampling effort, experimental simulation, and analytical consideration on the upper optical depth and by shortening timescales for the measurement of marine photosynthesis. Special efforts to study near-surface processes are justified, because new bio-optical algorithms will require quantitative descriptions of the responses of phytoplankton to bright light.

Many schemes have been developed to retrieve optical depth from measurements of reflectance in the visible or near-infrared. In this paper the impact of cloud inhomogeneity and vertical structure on the retrieval of optical depth is discussed. Retrievals of cloud optical depth and effective radius using the multi-channel radiometer flown on the UK Meteorological Research Flight C130 are presented for clouds studied during the Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition Experiment. A new technique for retrieving cloud optical depth, which is less susceptible to cloud inhomogeneity, using combined microwave and near-infrared radiometry, is presented. This technique is tested for three flights both in the Azores and the South Atlantic and shows good agreement with in situ measurements. Finally the use of these retrieved parameters in radiation codes is considered.

J	HOOD, RR				HOOD, RR			LIGHT RESPONSE OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN THE SOUTH-ATLANTIC OCEAN - INTERPRETATION OF OBSERVATIONS AND APPLICATION TO REMOTE-SENSING	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												A simplified, nonspectral derivation of a classical theory in plant physiology is presented and used to derive an absorption-based primary productivity algorithm. Field observations from a meridional transect (4 degrees N to 42 degrees S) in the Atlantic Ocean are then described and interpreted in this theoretical context. The observations include photosynthesis-irradiance curve parameters (alpha and P-max), chlorophyll a and phaeopigment concentration, and estimated phytoplankton absorption coefficients at lambda = 440 nm (a(ph)(440)). Observations near the top (50% I-0) and bottom (6% I-0) of the euphotic zone are contrasted. At both light levels, alpha, P-max, (a(ph)(440)), and pigment concentration varied similarly along the transect: values were highest at the equator and at the southern end of the transect and lowest in the central South Atlantic. It is concluded that this pattern was related to increased nutrient availability due to equatorial upwelling in the north, and increased wind mixing in the south. At the 50% Light level, alpha increased relative to a(ph) at the southern end of the transect. This result appears to reflect a large-scale meridional (southward) increase in the average quantum efficiency of the photosynthetic units of the phytoplankton. A correlation analysis of the data reveals that at the 50% light level, variations in P-max were more closely related to a(ph) (440) than chlorophyll concentration and that phytoplankton absorption explains 90% of the variability in P-max. In theory, this shows that the ratio of the average quantum efficiency of the photosynthetic units of the phytoplankton to the product of their average absorption cross section and turnover time is relatively constant. This result is used to simplify the absorption-based primary productivity algorithm derived previously. The feasibility of using this model to estimate production rate from satellite ocean color observations is discussed. It is concluded that an absorption-based algorithm should provide more accurate production rate estimates than one based upon chlorophyll (pigment) concentration.				hood, raleigh/F-9364-2013													0148-0227					JUN 15	1995	100	C6					10927	10942		10.1029/95JC00465								WOS:A1995RD77500022

The main goal of ASTEX was to study the climatologically important transition between solid stratocumulus and subtropical trade cumulus cloud regimes using island, aircraft, ship, and satellite measurements. Typically, the boundary layer was found to support cumulus clouds detraining into a patchy and fairly thin upper-stratocumulus layer. The substantial microphysical variability between clean marine and polluted continental air masses observed during ASTEX affected both drizzle and cloud properties. Highlights of the ASTEX research strategy included use of the ECMWF operational forecast model for assimilation of ASTEX soundings to obtain improved regional meteorological analyses; ''Lagrangian'' measurements of boundary-layer evolution following an air mass using aircraft and balloons, extensive coordinated use of surface, airborne, and satellite platforms; and an extensive suite of island-based remote sensing systems including millimeter-wavelength radars.

As there were photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) but no spectral irradiance measurements for the primary production incubations, three ways are presented here for the calculation of the absorbed photons (AP) by phytoplankton for the purpose of calculating phi. The first is based on a simple, nonspectral model; the second is based on a nonlinear regression using measured PAR values with depth; and the third is derived through remote sensing measurements. We show that the results of phi calculated using the nonlinear regression method and those using remote sensing are in good agreement with each other, and are consistent with the reported values of other studies, In deep waters, however, the simple nonspectral model may cause quantum yield values much higher than theoretically possible.																	0148-0227					APR 15	1995	100	C4					6655	6663		10.1029/94JC02793								WOS:A1995QT22200011

Descriptions of the radar hardware, signal processing, and calibration provide an overview of the radar's capabilities. An important component of the signal processing is the application of two cloud-mask schemes to the data to provide objective estimates of cloud boundaries and to detect significant returns that would otherwise be discarded if a simple threshold method for detectability was applied to the return power. Realistic profiles of atmospheric pressure, temperature, and water vapor are used in a radiative transfer model to address clear-sky attenuation. A physically relevant study of beam extinction and backscattering by clouds is attempted by modeling cloud drop size distributions with a gamma distribution over a range of number concentrations, particle mean diameters, and distribution shape factors; cloud liquid water contents and mean drop size diameters reported in the literature are analyzed in this context. Results of observations of a number of cloud structures, including marine stratocumulus, cirrus, and stratus and cirrus associated with a midlatitude cyclone are described.

J	PAERL, HW				PAERL, HW			COASTAL EUTROPHICATION IN RELATION TO ATMOSPHERIC NITROGEN DEPOSITION - CURRENT PERSPECTIVES	OPHELIA					International Symposium on Nutrient Dynamics in Coastal and Estuarine Environments	OCT 13-16, 1993	HELSINGOR, DENMARK	Danish Envirnm Protect Agcy, Commiss European Communities, Directorate Gen Sci Res & Dev				Nitrogen-limited estuaries, shallow coastal and continental shelf waters account for nearly half the global oceanic primary production. Accelerating primary production, or eutrophication, of these waters appears linked to increasing anthropogenic N loading. Among loading sources, atmospheric nitrogen deposition (AND) (as wet- and dryfall) is of considerable and increasing importance (100 to over 1000 mgN . m-2 . yr(-1)). Current contributions of AND to total external N loading range from 10 to over 50%. AND may play a central role in mediating ''new'' production in coastal oceans downwind of emissions. Examples of AND-impacted waters include: US Atlantic coastal waters, where atmospheric N inputs can significantly enhance CO2 fixation and chlorophyll a production, the Baltic and North Seas, the Canadian Atlantic seaboard, and the Western Mediterranean Sea. Recent increases in toxic and non-toxic phytoplankton blooms in these waters may be linked to accellerating nutrient loading at the land-sea interface; a significant fraction of it attributable to AND. This hitherto-neglected nutrient-production interaction requires evaluation on regional and larger synoptic scales. Aircraft and satellite-based ocean color remote sensing (i.e. SeaWiFS) will be useful in characterizing and linking the spatial-temporal interactions of this and other >>new<< nutrient inputs with eutrophication of estuarine and coastal waters.																	0078-5326					MAR	1995	41						237	259		10.1080/00785236.1995.10422046								WOS:A1995QQ83600012

The first part of the paper deals with the evaluation of remote sensing images (SPOT, Landsat Thematic Mapper and ERS-1 radar). The availability of the right images with respect to low tide conditions is discussed. Well-established classifications are used for both visible and radar images, which produce mainly geomorphological information: coastline, sediments, vegetation. Living resources at risk are compiled mostly out of ancillary data, i.e., maps and reports. These two types of information lead to ranking the shoreline in terms of its ecological sensitivity. Man-made objects and human activities are also incorporated. After collecting all relevant data, we examine in a second part how to merge them and produce environmental sensitivity maps, using both CAD (Computer Assisted Design) and GIS (Geographic Information Systems) tools.																	0143-1161					JAN 10	1995	16	1					3	15		10.1080/01431169508954368								WOS:A1995QE99000001

Merchant marine vessels can play a major role in ocean monitoring, yet apart from routine weather observations and upper-ocean temperature measurements, they constitute a vastly underutilized resource due to lack of suitable instrumentation. Examples of ways in which vessels can assist include profiling techniques of physical properties, chemical sampling via automated water samplers, optical techniques to measure various biological parameters, and ground truth measurements for remote sensing from orbiting and geostationary satellites. Further, ships can act as relays between subsurface instrumentation and satellite communication services. To take advantage of the opportunities that the maritime industry can provide, two steps must be taken. The first is to initiate an instrumentation development program with emphasis on techniques optimized for highly automated use onboard ships at 15-20-kt speeds. The second is to forge partnerships or links between academic and government laboratories and the maritime industry for the institution and maintenance of such monitoring programs. No doubt significant resources will be required, but in the long run the improved ability to monitor the state of ocean in situ will make the effort more than worthwhile.																	0003-0007					JAN	1995	76	1					5	11		10.1175/1520-0477(1995)076<0005:TVOSAF>2.0.CO;2								WOS:A1995QD94400001						
J	THOMAS, JP				THOMAS, JP			REMOTE-SENSING AND RELATING COASTAL DEVELOPMENT TO LIVING MARINE RESOURCES AND THEIR HABITATS	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Coastal ecosystems, including those with natural areas (e.g., reserves, refuges, parks) receive virtually all of the water flowing off the continental United States. As the human population increases, so do waste loads and use of the terrestrial surface. Changes in land use result in changes in land cover, which affect water quality and, subsequently, coastal and estuarine habitats, and their living resources. Lack of understanding of the cumulative effects of land cover and changes in land cover on these habitats and their resources has limited the appropriate management of landscape activities. Additionally, in the United States, as elsewhere, human population in the coastal region is increasing at an ever-quickening pace. Our ability to monitor resultant land cover and habitat change has not kept pace with the change, and management, thus, has been more reactive than proactive. Remote sensing is a key element of monitoring land cover changes over broad areas of the coastal zone in a synoptic, relatively inexpensive, and dependable way. Such information, when assimilated into a geographical information system and integrated with transport and process-oriented models, would allow us to relate land cover and changes in land cover(i.e., development in the coastal zone) to effects on living marine resources; it also would permit proactive responses to continuing degradation and loss of coastal and estuarine habitats and their living marine resources.																	0885-8608					JAN	1995	15	1					21	36										WOS:A1995QH04000005

DIMETHYLSULFIDE IN SEAWATER AND IN THE ATMOSPHERIC BOUNDARY-LAYER	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												We measured dimethylsulfide (DMS) in air (DMS(a)) and surface seawater (DMS(w)) on board the R/V Meteor during February-March 1991 on the tropical South Atlantic, Samples for the determination of DMS(a) were taken through a fluorinated ethylene/propylene Teflon inlet approximate to 33 m above sea level, preconcentrated by adsorption onto gold wool in quartz tubes, and analyzed by gas chromotography with flame photometric detection. The DMS(a) instrument is fully automated, providing improved precision, and processes up to four samples per hour. Over most of the cruise track, which followed the 19 degrees S parallel between Brazil and Africa, DMS(w), was significantly correlated to climatologically averaged chlorophyll concentrations obtained from coastal zone color scanner data, suggesting that remote sensing may be useful for estimating seawater DMS levels at least in some ocean regions. The cruise track proceeded from waters of low productivity (off the coast of Brazil and in the subtropical gyre) to higher productivity (the Benguela Current and the upwelling region off Namibia and Angola); meteorological conditions were steady with consistent easterly winds. DMS values for air and water were low (approximate to 50 ppt and 1-2 nmol L(-1), respectively) in the areas of low productivity and increased simultaneously (approximate to 100-300 ppt and 3-15 nmol L(-1)) as productivity increased. DMS sea-to-air fluxes (average 7.3 mu mol m-2 d(-1)) were calculated based on different parameterizations; for the study region the differences between the results obtained from the different models were minor. DMS(a) was strongly correlated to its emission flux from the sea surface as estimated from DMS(w) and meteorological parameters. This suggests that the air/sea transfer parameterizations used are suitable for providing estimates of DMS flux from the oceans.

(Turbulence in the presence of a temperature gradient gives rise to variations in sound speed which in turn scatter sound.) Our calculations indicate that the target strength of a 2-cm-long single shrimp can be comparable to the scattering level from 1 m(3) of turbulence in the ocean. Because of the potential ambiguities in acoustic remote sensing of the two type of scatterers, laboratory measurements were made of the acoustic scattering properties of a small patch of turbulence and a 2-cm-long decapod shrimp over a frequency range of 300-800 kHz. The data were also used to emulate echoes that one might expect in the ocean environment. The spectrum of a single echo of the laboratory turbulence and its time evolution was quite irregular and different than the more stable spectra of the echoes from the individual animals near broadside incidence which contained consistent major peaks and nulls. There were also noticeable differences between incoherent averages of the echoes as the averaged spectrum of the turbulence echo was observed to remain irregular (although with reduced variability), while that of the animals retained some regularity. These results indicate the potential for discriminating between turbulent fields and single animals.

The focus is on understanding the process linkages between the atmosphere, cryosphere and ocean at the sea ice interface and in establishing a method by which these processes can be modeled numerically. Remote sensing plays a significant role as a major source of temporally and spatially consistent data in this relatively inaccessible region. In this program, we combine in situ measurement of geophysical characteristics of the sea ice interface, electromagnetic radiation interactions with the interface, and numerical modeling of marine cryosphere processes operating across this interface. Our primary objective is to observe and simulate the mechanisms that may contribute to change and variability. We conclude by proposing a conceptual spatial signature of an icescape as the basis for integration of these processes and illustrate how remote sensing data can be used to identify these functional signatures.																	0004-0843					SEP	1994	47	3					256	264										WOS:A1994PJ50800006

Remote sensing the susceptibility of cloud albedo to changes in drop concentration	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												The role of clouds in reflecting solar radiation to space and thereby reducing surface heating is of critical importance to climate. Combustion processes that produce greenhouse gases also increase cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations which in turn increase cloud drop concentrations and thereby cloud albedo. A calculation of cloud susceptibility, defined in this work as the increase in albedo resulting from the addition of one cloud drop per cubic centimeter (as cloud liquid water content remains constant), is made through satellite remote sensing of cloud drop radius and optical thickness. The remote technique uses spectral channels of the Advance Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument on board the NOAA polar orbiting satellites. An approximation for the effect of the atmosphere on the signal received by the AVHRR is included in the analysis. Marine stratus clouds, as well as being important modifiers of climate, are cleaner than continental clouds an so likely to be of higher susceptibility. Analysis of several stratus scenes, including some containing ship tracks, supports this expectation.

J	Wei, C; Lu, DR				Wei, Chong; Lu, Daren			A universal regression retrieval method of the ground-based microwave remote sensing of precipitable water vapor and path-integrated cloud liquid water content	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												An attempt has been made to obtain two respective universal equations, applying to different regions, elevations and seasons in the world, for remote sensing the atmospheric precipitable water vapor (Q) and the path-integrated cloud liquid water content (L) by using a ground-based dual-frequency (20.6 and 31.4 GHz) microwave radiometer (GBDFMR). To do so, a set of a priori radiosonde data with a total of 2742 cases was selected in typical seasons (winter and summer) at eight radiosonde stations (Beijing, Guangzhou, Guam, Yap, Lhasa, Zhangye, Nagqu and Lijiang) typical of the climates of mid-latitude mainland, tropical marine, plain, plateau and mountain, respectively. A cloud model was constructed in a way much the same as that by Decker et al. (1978, pp. 1789-1790) and an ensemble of cloudy- and clear-day mixed samples were elaborately constructed. Based on this ensemble, numerical simulation was done for each case by using a microwave radiation transfer model to compute the radiometric brightness temperatures T-b1 and T-b2 as well as the dependent variables L and Q. The simulated T-b1 and T-b2 together with surface air temperature, surface humidity, surface pressure, the index of clear or cloudy day, cloud base height and their combinations were used as the candidates for the predictors of multivariate regression. The stepwise regression and ridge regression techniques ensure the two respective resultant regression equations to be steady, optimal and feasible for retrieval of L and Q. The tests on these equations by using temporal and spatial extrapolation samples with total of 1020 cases show that they have quite good accuracies for predicting the Q and L and can be used operationally. This work suggests a broad prospect in the application of GBDFMR in cloud liquid water and precipitable water vapor measurements.																	0169-8095	1873-2895				JUN 20	1994	34	1-4					309	322		10.1016/0169-8095(94)90099-X								WOS:000209344800022

False color composites generated from Landsat Thematic Mapper and SPOT image data, digital elevation models derived from stereophotogrammetric analysis of SPOT data, and field observations document that a approximately 10-km-wide swath inland from the coast is covered in many places with coalescing alluvial fans of Quaternary age. Wadis cutting through the fans exhibit several pairs of fluvial terraces, and wadi walls expose alluvium interbedded with coralline limestone deposits. three distinct coral terrace are evident along the coastline. Climatic, eustatic, and tectonic uplift controls on the overall system were simulated using a cellular automata algorithm with die following characteristics: (1) uplift as a function of position and time, as defined by the elevations and ages of corals; (2) climatic variations driven by insolation changes associated with Milankovitch cycles; (3) sea level fluctuations based on U/rh ages of coral terraces and eustatic data; and (4) parameterized fluvial erosion and deposition. Results imply that the fans and coralline limestones were generated in a setting in which the tectonic uplift rate decreased over the Quaternary to negligible values at present. Coralline limestones formed during eustatic highstands when alluvium was trapped upstream and wadis filled with debris. During lowstands, wadis cut into sedimentary deposits; coupled with continuing uplift, fans were dissected, leaving remnant surfaces, and wadirelated terraces were generated by down cutting. Only landforms from the past three to four eustatic sea level cycles (i.e., approximately 300 to 400 kyr) are likely to have survived erosion and deposition associated with fluvial processes.

J	WHITEHOUSE, BG; LANDERS, PM				WHITEHOUSE, BG; LANDERS, PM			TRANSFERRING EARTH OBSERVATION IMAGERY TO THE COASTAL ZONE VIA CELLULAR TELEPHONY	MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL												Systems designed to provide the marine user with operational environmental information require a means to communicate data to sea in near-real time. The transfer of data (images) obtained by environmental remote sensing satellites is complicated by the raster-based structure of the corresponding data files and by their relatively large size. Analysis of marine mobile communications technologies indicates that the least expensive for this application is cellular telephony. Experiments were conducted off the coast of eastern Canada to determine the usefulness of cellular telephony for transferring remote sensing imagery to the coastal zone. They included sea surface temperature (SST) images derived from NOAA AVHRR data and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images obtained by ERS-1. For comparison, simple ASCII text files also were transferred. Results demonstrate that cellular telephony can satisfy the technical, time, and cost requirements of coastal operational remote sensing applications. By incorporating data compression techniques, SST images were transmitted at a maximum rate of 12.2 kbps (kilobits per second). Processed SAR images were transmitted at significantly lower rates. Transmissions up to 50 km from shore were completed successfully. Comparison of these results with those obtained in other regions indicate that processed SST images have been transmitted at rates of 21 kbps and to distances as great as 150 km from shore. Investigation of such variances indicate transmission speed is influenced by the extent to which the image has been processed prior to transmission and by the use of compression techniques. Transmission distance varies from location to location, largely due to variances in regional atmospheric effects and quality of shipboard installations.																	0025-3324					SUM	1994	28	2					78	81										WOS:A1994PQ19700011

J	BALCH, WM; BYRNE, CF				BALCH, WM; BYRNE, CF			FACTORS AFFECTING THE ESTIMATE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTION FROM SPACE	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Remote sensing of primary production in the euphotic zone has been based mostly on visible-band water-leaving radiance measured with the coastal zone color scanner. There are some robust, simple relationships for calculating integral production based on surface measurements, but they also require knowledge of photoadaptive parameters such as maximum photosynthesis which currently cannot be obtained from space. A 17,000-station data set is used to show that space-based estimates of maximum photosynthesis could improve predictions of psi, the water column light utilization index, which is an important term in many primary productivity models. Temperature is also examined as a factor for predicting hydrographic structure and primary production. A simple model is used to relate temperature and maximum photosynthesis; the model incorporates (1) the positive relationship between maximum photosynthesis and temperature and (2) the strongly negative relationship between temperature and nitrate in the ocean (which directly affects maximum growth rates via nitrogen limitation). Since these two factors relate to carbon and nitrogen, ''balanced carbon/nitrogen assimilation'' was calculated assuming the Redfield ratio. It is expected that the relationship between maximum balanced carbon assimilation versus temperature is concave-down, with the peak dependent on nitrate uptake kinetics, temperature-nitrate relationships, and the carbon/chlorophyll ratio. These predictions were compared with sea truth data. The minimum turnover time for nitrate was also calculated using this approach. Lastly, sea surface temperature gradients were used to predict the slope of isotherms (a proxy for the slope of isopycnals in many waters). Sea truth data show that at size scales of several hundred kilometers, surface temperature gradients can provide information on the slope of isotherms in the top 200 m of the water column. This is directly relevant to the supply of nutrients into the surface mixed layer, which is useful for predicting integral biomass and primary production.																	0148-0227					APR 15	1994	99	C4					7555	7570		10.1029/93JC03091								WOS:A1994NG71000021

A calculation of cloud susceptibility, defined in this work as the increase in albedo resulting from the addition of one cloud droplet per cubic centimeter (as cloud liquid water content remains constant), is made through the satellite remote sensing of cloud droplet radius and optical thickness. The remote technique uses spectral channels of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument on board NOAA polar-orbiting satellites. Radiative transfer calculations of reflectance and effective surface and cloud emissivities are made for applicable sun and satellite viewing angles, including azimuth, at various radii and optical thicknesses for each AVHRR channel. Emission in channel 3 (at 3.75 mum) is removed to give the reflected solar component. These calculations are used to infer the radius and optical thickness that best match the satellite measurements. An approximation for the effect of the atmosphere on the signal received by the AVHRR is included in the analysis. Marine stratus clouds, as well as being important modifiers of climate, are cleaner than continental clouds and so likely to be of higher susceptibility. Analysis of several stratus scenes, including some containing ship tracks, supports this expectation. The retrieved range of susceptibilities for all marine stratus clouds studied varied by about two orders of magnitude. This variation implies that climate studies that include possible marine stratus albedo modification from anthropogenic CCN are incomplete without accounting for existing susceptibilities.

Information technology, and in particular, the integration of data base management systems, GIS, remote sensing, and image processing, simulation and optimization models, expert systems, and computer graphics provide some of the tools to support environmental impact assessment. Using several examples including surface and groundwater pollution, coastal marine systems, water resources development, air pollution, and technological risk (eg., Fedra 1993; Fedra 1991; Fedra et al. 1991), some basic principles and practical solutions in the design and implementation of integrated environmental information and decision support system for environmental impact assessment, planning, and policy making are discussed. Based on a common architecture and a shared tool kit, these systems combine models, GIS, and expert systems in a number of customized implementations for specific problem situations. An easy-to-use graphical user interface, extensive visualization of complex and often abstract information, animation of dynamic systems behaviour, embedded expert systems functionality to support qualitative aspects and assist less experienced users, and context sensitive help- and explain functions based on hypertext are common characteristics of these systems. Built around an analytical core in the form of simulation models and expert systems, transparent linkages to various data bases provide the necessary input information. And the linkage to GIS and visualization components provides direct and immediate graphical display and interpretation of results. Rule-based interpretation and discrete multi-criteria optimization methods are used for the comparative evaluation of alternatives. The integration of complex and powerful software tools in problem oriented systems provides direct and easy access to large volumes of data. It supports their analysis and the prediction of environmental impacts. And it helps to display and interpret results in a directly understandable and useful manner. Integrated information systems support a more interactive, exploratory, and participatory, and thus useful, approach to environmental impact assessment.																	0926-5481		0-444-81838-3				1994	16						269	288										WOS:A1994BA10D00026						
J	KRAUSE, DC; ANGEL, MV				KRAUSE, DC; ANGEL, MV			MARINE BIOGEOGRAPHY, CLIMATE-CHANGE AND SOCIETAL NEEDS	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Pelagic biogeography deals with the large scale distributional patterns of pelagic organisms in the world's oceans, their origins through evolution and the changes in ocean morphology during the geological past, and the factors which currently control and maintain them. The knowledge it generates has a wide variety of uses in science, both basic and applied, and in socio-economics. Its products include: (1) Distributional data compiled in data bases, maps and atlases; (2) Explanatory scientific and non-scientific publications on the distributions and their implications; (3) Standardisation of methodologies; (4) Trained specialists; (5) Advice to society on oceanic aspects of global resource management; and (6) Assessments of oceanic biodiversity in relation to the Biodiversity Convention. The immediate users of this knowledge include oceanographers in other disciplines, ecologists, applied scientists and engineers, resource managers, fishermen, environmentalists, teachers, international lawyers and policy-makers. At present the largest users are the natural resource managers seeking to optimise and to sustain the resource for which they are responsible. There is a considerable body of national and international legislation which is underpinned by biogeographical information. Similarly much of our understanding about past climate which is being used to predict future trends, is based on applying information on present-day distributional patterns to the interpretation of the fossil record in marine sediments. Global change, in the ocean, the atmosphere and on land, is strongly modulated by the feedback between marine organisms, nutrients and greenhouse gases, The marked coherence observed between the distributions of physical, chemical and biological patterns suggest that the processes involved in this feedback are linked with pelagic community structure. Remote sensing of sea-surface properties and the heat content of the mixed-layer, offer considerable potential for linking ecological and biogeographical processes to large scale features of ocean circulation and climatology. The long-term monitoring of the ocean in the Global Ocean Observing System will need to integrate physical, chemical and ecological data, if the models used to predict future change are to achieve adequate precision. The future use and resource management of the oceans has to involve biogeographical information. Traditional sampling methods, even when supplemented by large scale surveys such as CALCOFI and the Continuous Plankton Recorder surveys,will never provide sufficient data, so new techniques for intensive sampling and monitoring are being sought. Some surrogate measures such as chlorophyll fluorescence are already well established as standard oceanographic methodology; others involving acoustics and optical properties have the potential for sampling the biological characteristics at the same time/space scales as the physicochemical properties of the oceans are being studied. However, the calibration of these new techniques against traditional sampling and observational methods remains problematic. Information technology is beginning to be used, not only to unify the systematics of many taxonomic groups, but also to improve information exchange. Improvements in digital data bases will lead to freer exchange of information, and also facilitate the production of maps and interpretations customized for other users. The scientific resources being devoted to pelagic biogeography are declining with potentially serious consequences. This trend can only be reversed if the biogeographers themselves make their output more accessible and user-friendly for non-scientists, and take advantage of the new technologies which promise to re-vitalise the field.																	0079-6611						1994	34	2-3					221	235		10.1016/0079-6611(94)90010-8								WOS:A1994QB20400010

To better understand how these sensory structures interface with the 3-dimensional fluid environment, it is necessary to understand both their functional morphology and their physiology. These appendages possess setae which are the suspected sites of signal transduction. Ultrastructural studies reveal that the setae differ in their patterns of innervation. and it is believed that these dissimilarities reflect differences in function. In this study, we label the sensilla of copepod antennules using a fluorescent carbocyanine dye, DiI, which becomes inserted in the lipid bilayer of neuronal cell membranes. Aesthetascs on the antennules can then be identified using standard fluorescent microscopy. Because the copepod exoskeleton is transparent to the laser, we were able to utilize laser scanning confocal microscopy to identify other neuronal structures and patterns of musculature within the antennule, while simultaneously visualizing the orientation and larger scale structure of the sensilla.																	0171-8630					DEC	1993	102	1-2					1	14		10.3354/meps102001								WOS:A1993MH48400001

High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has proven effective in rapidly separating and distinguishing chlorophylls, chlorophyll-degradation products, and carotenoids within monotypic and mixed algal samples. When coupled with absorbance and/or fluorescence spectroscopy, HPLC can accurately characterize phylogenetic groups and changes in community composition and yield information concerning microalgal physiological status, production, trophic interaction, and paleolimnology/paleooceanography. The recent widespread occurrence of toxic and noxious phytoplankton blooms has necessitated the use of remote imagery of pigment and reflectance ''signatures'' for monitoring and predicting bloom distribution. Because HPLC allows the processing of large numbers of samples from numerous locations relatively quickly, it is ideally suited for large-scale ''ground truthing'' of remotely sensed imagery. Coupled with rapidly evolving computer-based remote sensing technologies, HPLC-based pigment analyses may provide accurate assessments of aquatic biogeochemical flux, primary production, trophic state, water quality, and changes therein un local, regional, and global scales.

J	PAERL, HW				PAERL, HW			EMERGING ROLE OF ATMOSPHERIC NITROGEN DEPOSITION IN COASTAL EUTROPHICATION - BIOGEOCHEMICAL AND TROPHIC PERSPECTIVES	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Approximately half of the world's ocean ic primary production originates in coastal waters wh ich are often nitrogen (N) limited and sensitive to externally supplied N. Among anthropogenically generated N sources, atmospheric deposition of N (ADN) (as wet- and dryfall) contributes 10-50% of the total external N load at present (20-100 mmol N.m(-2).yr(-1)), and this will increase. At current levels, atmospheric N inputs lead to a significant enhancement of CO2 fixation and chlorophyll a production. ADN may play a central role in mediating ''new'' production in coastal oceans downwind of emissions. Alterations in productivity, nutrient flux, and trophic changes have recently been documented from the Baltic and North seas, the Northwest Atlantic seaboard, and the Western Mediterranean. The recently noted ''epidemic'' of toxic and nuisance phytoplankton blooms is possibly due to accelerating nutrient loading inshore, especially from atmospheric sources. A need exists to spatially and temporally evaluate, quantify, and potentially manage this nutrient-production interaction on regional and larger synoptic scales. Aircraft- and satellite-based multiband ocean color remote sensing (SeaWiFS) will help characterize and link the spatial-temporal interactions of this (and other) ''new'' nutrient inputs with biogeochemical and trophic changes in coastal and offshore waters.																	0706-652X					OCT	1993	50	10					2254	2269		10.1139/f93-251								WOS:A1993MU35200023

J	SIKORA, TD; YOUNG, GS				SIKORA, TD; YOUNG, GS			OBSERVATIONS OF PLANVIEW FLUX PATTERNS WITHIN CONVECTIVE STRUCTURES OF THE MARINE ATMOSPHERIC SURFACE-LAYER	BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY												Air/sea flux variability on horizontal scales from 50 m to several km results, in part, from the presence of coherent convective structures within the atmospheric boundary layer. The horizontal distribution of fluxes within these convective updrafts and downdrafts is, therefore, central to studies of air/sea interaction and remote sensing of sea surface wind and wave fields. This study derives these flux patterns from observations of the Marine Atmospheric Surface Layer (MASL). Research aircraft flights through the MASL provide an optimal means for sampling large numbers of the above-mentioned coherent structures. The NCAR Electra flew numerous legs through the MASL at a height of 50 m during the 1987 stratocumulus phase of Project FIRE (First ISSCP (International Satellite Cloud Climatology Program) Regional Experiment). In situ measurements from these legs serve as the dataset for this paper. The data are processed in such a way as to retain only the turbulence fluctuations. Conditional sampling, based on the vertical velocity field, results in the isolation of convective updrafts and downdrafts. Compositing of the data for these two classes of convective drafts results in horizontal planviews of the vertical fluxes of buoyancy, absolute humidity, along-mean-wind component of momentum, and vertical velocity. To ensure dynamical similarity, these horizontal planviews are oriented in a coordinate system aligned with the mean wind.																	0006-8314					AUG	1993	65	3					273	288		10.1007/BF00705530								WOS:A1993LU20200004

The most rapid emissions of >500 nmol m-2 h-1 occurred in red mangrove-dominated sites that were adjacent to open seawater and contained numerous crab burrows. Poorly drained red mangrove sites exhibited lower fluxes of approximately 60 nmol m-2 h-1 which were similar to fluxes from the black mangrove areas which dominated the marine-influenced wetland sites in the Everglades. DMS was the dominant organo-S gas emitted especially in the freshwater areas. Spectral data from a scene from the Landsat thematic mapper were used to map habitats in the Everglades. Six vegetation categories were delineated using geographical information system software and S gas emissions were extrapolated for the entire Everglades National Park. The black mangrove-dominated areas accounted for the largest portion of S gas emissions to the area. The large area extent of the saw grass communities (42%) accounted for approximately 24% of the total S emissions.

This has been documented in a number of unpredicted events along the coast of Norway, such os storm surges, harmful algal blooms, and oil spills. Systematic integration of remote sensing observations, field observations, and numerical model results is critical for such improvement. We will demonstrate this by presenting examples of (1) model validation by spaceborne infrared (IR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing observations; and (2) water quality monitoring and simulation using airborne spectrometry and models. High resolution, coupled physical-chemical-biological models, as well as implementation of data assimilation schemes, are needed before a dedicated system for monitoring and forecasting of the coastal environment can become fully operational.																	0099-1112					MAR	1993	59	3					351	361										WOS:A1993LC77500007

The high-resolution bathymetry is important, not only to determine the topography of the area surveyed, but to provide accurate bottom slope corrections needed to convert the arrival angles of the seafloor echoes received by the sonars into true angles of incidence. An angular dependence of seafloor acoustic backscatter can then be derived for each region surveyed. making it possible to construct maps of acoustic backscattering strength in geographic coordinates over the areas of interest. Such maps, when combined with the high-resolution bathymetric maps normally compiled from the data output by the above sonar systems, could be very effective tools to quantify bottom types on a regional basis, and to develop automatic seafloor classification routines.

Qualitative observations and analyses of the spreading behaviour of the thermal discharge are presented for a range of tidal states, using ATM data from a series of aircraft overflights of the site. It is demonstrated that. under ebb flow conditions. the discharges from two adjacent outfalls are merged into an integrated surface plume in the far-field, and that the plume behaves subsequently as if generated by a single source. It is shown that the lateral spreading of the plume is inhibited significantly by coastal attachment and local thermal forcing and cross-flow effects. Calibrated overflight data from the thermal infrared bands have been used to quantify the unimpeded offshore spreading, and estimates are presented of the transverse turbulent diffusion coefficient epsilon(t) for the site in question. Values of epsilon(t) thus derived are shown to be in satisfactory agreement with estimates made directly at similar sites. Evidence is also presented to show how the presence of suspended sediment in the receiving waters, and the entrainment of bubbles and debris on the surface, can lead to the detection of the thermal discharge in visible and infrared spectral bands.																	0143-1161					JAN 20	1993	14	2					253	273		10.1080/01431169308904336								WOS:A1993KL65300006

Calculation of the momentum flux, for example, requires that the stratification function include both temperature and humidity effects and that the solution to the equation set be based on full set iteration. We find that over warm water, particularly during cases of low humidity, the momentum flux and stratification estimates are very sensitive to the reported relative humidity. Similarly, we find that the ERS 1 radar cross section, when treated as a function of the wind stress (or momentum flux), varies significantly with relative humidity, particularly when surface temperatures are warm. This study suggests that any calibration/validation campaign using remote-sensing observations, in particular the ERS 1 scatterometer, should utilize high-quality ground truth relative humidity measurements in addition to the traditional suite of high-quality wind and temperature gradient measurements.																	0148-0227					JAN 15	1993	98	C1					927	932		10.1029/92JC02220								WOS:A1993KG67500006

Time-series sediment trapping, combined with remotely sensed observations of sea surface temperature (AVHRR) and color (CZCS), have been used to examine the mechanism of varve formation in the central Gulf. SST and surface pigment concentration records for both the mainland and Baja sides of the Gulf display similar seasonal trends. High temperatures and low pigment concentrations occur synchronously on both sides of the central Gulf from June through to October. In association with the 1991/92 El Nino, warm temperatures persist in the central Gulf until December. Low SSTs typically occur from December through May, with high pigment concentrations marking the period from November through April. The summer-early fall (June-October) is a time of high terrigenous and biogenic sediment fluxes. During this time of year, the total flux is dominated by eolian-transported lithogenic material and dark laminae are deposited during this period. During El Nino years, high terrigenous fluxes may extend into winter. Light laminae represent deposition from November through May, during which time biogenic material dominates the total sediment flux. High opal fluxes beginning in November are attributed to seasonal cooling of surface water and upward mixing of nutrients. True upwelling conditions do not develop in the Gulf until late winter-spring. During this time, the total flux is still dominated by opal but the magnitude of the flux is reduced. This may be an artifact of phytoplankton grazing and not lower production rates.																	0277-3791						1993	12	6					451	&		10.1016/S0277-3791(05)80009-5								WOS:A1993NK62900009

The first scheme developed here is based on theory and numerical calculations of droplet condensational growth, while the second is based on Twomey's analytical approach. Both methods are evaluated against detailed model calculations, and a method for implementing either scheme in general circulation models and remote sensing applications is described. The new parameterization produces accurate (within a few percent) estimates of the effective droplet radius as a function of height, while the cloud optical thickness compares favorably (often to within < 10%) with the model calculations. Twomey's scheme gives reasonable estimates of optical thickness, but tends to underestimate the droplet concentration and overestimate the effective radius for typical maritime and continental CCN spectra.

These theories [2], [4]-[6] have been developed to explain the SAR signal modulation in relationship with small variations of water roughness induced by internal wave or current or wind field variations. Analysis of the RAREM data indicates, for the first time, that the marine surface life (here, tuna schools and marine mammals) and fishing activities (here, nets and fish traps) can generate a SAR signal modulation of comparable order of magnitude at the C-band ( 5.3 GHz). This has confirmed expectation for SAR, after the preliminary experiment made in X-band (9.6 GRz). From the RAREM data, the results of satellite simulations, considering ERS1 characteristics, are presented and show good promise for fishing activity surveys. This high sensitivity of SAR provides unique opportunities to obtain direct information on fishing and surface marine life activities in large survey areas. From that, we assume that the aerial SAR data and, under certain conditions, satellite SAR data may dramatically enhance and complement classical methods (statistics) used in fishery management, the essential goal in halieutics.																	0196-2892	1558-0644				SEP	1992	30	5					1085	1089		10.1109/36.175346								WOS:A1992JZ98400029

J	SATHE, PV; SATHYENDRANATH, S				SATHE, PV; SATHYENDRANATH, S			A FORTRAN-77 PROGRAM FOR MONTE-CARLO SIMULATION OF UPWELLING LIGHT FROM THE SEA	COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES												This paper presents a FORTRAN program for Monte Carlo simulation of spectral and angular composition of upwelling light emerging from a wind-roughened sea under given physical conditions and for a given water quality. The program also simulates the light field prevailing immediately below the sea surface and at its bottom. Besides, the program simulates the angular composition of upwelling light for individual spectral channels, as well as its spectral composition for each angular interval. The physical conditions of radiative transfer, which are specified by the user, include solar elevation, fraction of diffuse light present, spectral composition of incident light, wind speed prevailing over the sea surface and depth of the sea. The program computes the optical properties of the seawater by taking into account the individual contributions from the chlorophyll, suspended sediments and yellow organic dissolved matter in user-supplied proportions. Remote sensing of ocean color involves measurement and interpretation of upwelling light from the sea under given conditions in terms of concentrations of different oceanic constituents. The program is expected to serve as a useful tool to the remote-sensing community for development and validation of retrieval algorithms for various constituents of the sea which influence the quality of upwelling light. Because the program is a direct simulation of radiative transfer from the atmosphere to the sea and vice versa, it may be put to a variety of uses in studies in marine optics. Simulated results are in agreement with both theoretically computed spectral signatures of different oceanic constituents and in situ measured spectrometric observations at sea.																	0098-3004					JUN	1992	18	5					487	507		10.1016/0098-3004(92)90090-E								WOS:A1992JG19700002

The correction of the emission spectrum is based on the measurement of a calibrated light source. The excitation spectra are corrected by means of a quantum counter solution that measures the spectral intensity of the excitation system and separate correction for wavelength-dependent effects of the excitation optics. The correction procedures give technically corrected spectra, i.e. spectral that are free from wavelength dependent bias, but do not give absolute intensity values. Spectra that have been properly corrected for instrumental wavelength dependencies are suitable for intercomparison, both intra- and interlaboratory. Another application is the derivation of spectral data that will be obtained by other techniques that make use of fluorescence measurements, Such as flow cytometry, remote sensing and in situ instruments. A necessary condition is that the spectral response functions of these instruments must be known.																	0142-7873					MAY	1992	14	5					625	636		10.1093/plankt/14.5.625								WOS:A1992HV65500001						
J	ALLAN, TD				ALLAN, TD			THE MARINE-ENVIRONMENT	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The European marine community has lent strong support to satellite remote sensing techniques that have emerged over the last 15-20 years. Now Europe has its own remote sensing satellite, the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-1) largely directed to ocean measurements-especially surface winds, waves and currents-by means of its suite of microwave sensors. European marine scientists also played a significant role in the arduous task of extracting reliable ocean colour signals from the record of the Coastal Zone Colour Scanner (1978-1986) over European waters. Unlike meteorologists the marine community has not yet enjoyed the benefits of an operational satellite system [c.f. the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's satellites (NOAA) and Meteosat], but the analysis of data provided by United States satellites indicates that this decade will see substantial benefits accrue to a wide variety of marine activities. Through its European Space Agency and through dedicated national programmes, Europe is now cast as one of the key players in remote sensing of the marine environment.																	0143-1161	1366-5901				APR 10	1992	13	6-7					1261	1276		10.1080/01431169208904190								WOS:A1992HP28300019

Faced with the urgent need for reconnaissance surveys, the Directorate of Marine Development and Environment of the Port of Bordeaux proposed to the authorities responsible for safety in the channels of the Arcachon Basin that unconventional methods should be employed, using satellite and helicopter. Spatial remote sensing, which furnishes information that is rich as regards the morphology of the site but poor as regards bathymetry, finds that bathymetric surveying from a helicopter, which is poor in sounding points but rich as regards their spread over the area to be sounded, is an indispensable supplement to back up the bathymetry of the "pixels" composing the "Spot" image. The complementary nature of the two techniques proved to be most efficient in situations where reconnaissance was urgent but when meteorological conditions on site prevented conventional surveys being carried out using a boat.																	0020-6946					MAR	1992	69	1					117	131										WOS:A1992HR14300007

The specific absorption and backscattering spectra for suspended minerals (SM), the specific absorption spectra for chlorophyll-a (C), and the absorption spectrum for water were determined solely from irradiance measurements collected simultaneously with the concentration of SM, C, and yellow substance (YS). The glacial SM in Chilko Lake have backscattering properties similar to SM found in Lake Ontario, but only about one-third the absorption. The absorption properties of C remain uncertain with two analysis techniques giving different results at shorter wavelengths and failing to find significant values at red wavelengths. The measured absorption of water closely matches reported laboratory results of Smith and Baker (1981). Tests showed that the calibrated R-model was slightly biased (less than 10%) with a standard deviation of +/- 6-16% depending on wavelength. When the model was used to solve for component concentrations, SM were found with a standard deviation of +/- 20%, C +/- 40%, and YS +/- 30%.																	0034-4257	1879-0704				FEB	1992	39	2					103	118		10.1016/0034-4257(92)90130-C								WOS:A1992HE85900003						
J	BARBER, DG; RICHARD, PR				BARBER, DG; RICHARD, PR			USE OF AVHRR IMAGERY IN ARCTIC MARINE MAMMAL RESEARCH	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Remote sensing has traditionally been afforded only limited use in Arctic marine mammal research. This is primarily because the summers are short and often cloud covered; winters are long and solar illumination is limited to a few hours of twilight. Orbital sensors operating on a repeat cycle of 16 days simply do not offer the biologist a sufficiently reliable tool for habitat assessment studies. Compounding the data availability problem was the substantial entry cost to acquire and interpret digital remote sensing imagery. With the increase in computational power of microcomputers and the increasing availability of orbital remote sensing imagery (both the decreasing costs and increase in the number of available sensors) the utility of orbital platforms for Arctic marine mammal research should be re-examined. This review describes the activities of the Marine Mammal Management section of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), Central and Arctic Region, specifically relating to the use of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administrations (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery in support of marine mammal aerial survey programs. NOAA offers inexpensive timely imagery which can be interpreted on a variety of microcomputer platforms, which are well within the financial means of the marine mammal biologist's budget.																	0143-1161					JAN 20	1992	13	2					167	175		10.1080/01431169208904033								WOS:A1992HD26800002

MODIS consists of two separate instruments that scan a swath width sufficient to provide nearly complete global coverage every 2 days from a polar-orbiting, sun-synchronous, platform at an altitude of 705 km. MODIS-N (nadir) will provide images in 36 spectral bands between 0.415 and 14.235-nu-m with spatial resolutions of 250 m (2 bands), 500 m (5 bands), and 1000 m (29 bands). These bands have been carefully selected to enable advanced studies of land, ocean, and atmospheric processes. In this paper we describe the status of MODIS-N and its companion instrument MODIS-T (tilt), a tiltable cross-track scanning spectrometer with 32 uniformly spaced channels between 0.410 and 0.875-nu-m. In addition, we review the various methods being developed for the remote sensing of atmospheric properties using MODIS, placing primary emphasis on the principal atmospheric applications of determining the optical, microphysical, and physical properties of clouds and aerosol particles from spectral reflection and thermal emission measurements. In addition to cloud and aerosol properties, MODIS-N will be used for determining the total precipitable water vapour and atmospheric stability. The physical principles behind the determination of each of these atmospheric products will be described herein, together with an example of their application to aircraft and/or satellite measurements. Extensions of these and related methods to MODIS observations pose an extraordinary challenge as well as a unique opportunity to enhance our understanding of the earth-atmosphere-ocean system.

On the basis of 6 limnetic and 6 marine studies we found a good similarity for the correlations of BOC vs PhytoC in both systems although the slope was substantially lower than for similar correlations on the basis of bacterial abundance and chlorophyll a. Limnetic systems, however, differed from marine systems in that they supported more BOC relative to PhytoC, as indicated by significantly higher y-intercepts of the correlation (p < 0.001). Our analysis also generalizes findings from marine to limnetic environments that the food-web structure in oligotrophic systems is fundamentally different from eutrophic systems, e.g. that BOC/PhytoC dramatically increases with decreasing PhytoC concentrations. This has implications for the significance of planktonic bacteria in particle abundance and size-dependent properties of lakes and oceans such as trace metal and radionuclide adsorption, biogeochemical dynamics and in light scattering and remote sensing.

Remote sensing offers large benefits because of the high costs of monitoring using only traditional methods. Nevertheless, much work is needed to refine the technology to address even basic marine pollution problems. This paper briefly outlines studies of water quality assessment, including photyplankton standing stock, turbidity, suspended sediment load, dissolved organic material, temperature, salinity, wind stress, wave direction and wavelength, current speed and direction, and light attenuation coefficients. An increasing number of techniques useful to monitor marine pollution will be available in the 1990s. As part of this effort, it is important that a solid scientific base for remote sensing methods be established, and that multidisciplinary, international training programs be developed. It is capable human resources that we currently lack the most.																	0025-326X	1879-3363					1992	25	1-4					54	60		10.1016/0025-326X(92)90186-A								WOS:A1992KC05000014

Zonal hydrographic bands defined by a coastal current, North Atlantic Water, the Polar Front, and thc seasonally variable marginal ice edge zone create a meridional zonation of thc ecosystem during the spring-summer transition. The features reveal themselves in satellite imagery and by high-resolution (vertical and horizontal) physical-optical-biological sampling. Surprisingly, the long-term (7-year) mean of Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) imagery reveals the Barents Sea as an anomalous "blue-water" regime at high latitudes that are otherwise dominated by satellite-observed -surface blooms. A combination of satellite imagery and in situ bio-optical analyses indicate that,this pattern is caused by strong stratification in summer with surface nutrient depletion. Thc onset of stratification of the entire region is linked to the extent of thc winter ice edge: cold years with extensive sea ice apparently stratify early due to ice melt; warm years stratify later, perhaps due to weaker thermal stratification of the Atlantic waters (e.g. Skjoldal et al. 1987). The apparent "low chlorophyll" indicated by the CZCS 7-year mean is partly due to sampling error whereby the mean is dominated by images taken later in the summer. In fact, massive blooms of subsurface phytoplankton embedded in the pycnocline persist throughout the summer and maintain substantial rates of primary production. Further. these subsurface blooms that are not observed by satellite are responsible for dramatic gradients in the beam (c(t)) and spectral diffuse (k) attenuation coefficients. The Barents Sea exemplifies the need to couple satellite observations with spatially and temporally resolved biogeographic ecosystem models in order to estimate the integrated water column primary production, mass flux or spectral light attenuation coefficients.																	0800-0395					DEC	1991	10	1					147	162		10.1111/j.1751-8369.1991.tb00641.x								WOS:A1991HX55900013

From 410 nm to about 640 nm, particulate phytoplankton degradation products including pheopigments, detritus, and bacteria have absorption curves that are similar in shape to that of CDOM. In coastal areas and areas downstream from upwelling regions, these constituents of seawater often absorb much more light than do living phytoplankton, leading to errors in satellite-derived chlorophyll estimates as high as 133%. Proposed NASA sensors for the 1990s will have spectral channels as low as 412 nm, permitting the development of algorithms that can separate the absorption effects of CDOM and other phytoplankton degradation products from those due to biologically viable pigments. A reflectance model has been developed to estimate chlorophyll a concentrations in the presence of CDOM, pheopigments, detritus, and bacteria. Nomograms and lookup tables have been generated to describe the effects of different mixtures of chlorophyll a and these degradation products on the R(412):R(443) and R(443):R(565) remote-sensing reflectance or irradiance reflectance ratios. These are used to simulate the accuracy of potential ocean color satellite algorithms, assuming that atmospheric effects have been removed. For the California Current upwelling and offshore regions, with chlorophyll a less-than-or-equal-to 1.3 mg m-3, the average error for chlorophyll a retrievals derived from irradiance reflectance data for degradation product-rich areas was reduced from +/- 61% to +/- 23% by application of an algorithm using two reflectance ratios (R(412):R(443) and R(443):R(565)) rather than the commonly used algorithm applying a single reflectance ratio (R(443):R(565)).																	0148-0227					NOV 15	1991	96	C11					20599	20611		10.1029/91JC02117								WOS:A1991GQ69300016

Remote sensing techniques require calibration data and consequently in-situ experiments to yield those data. Over the sea, aircraft seem to be the most convenient means of conducting validation experiments because they allow exploration of a large range of scales (from local measurements to measurements of pixel scale). This paper reports on some in-situ atmospheric aircraft measurements that were conducted as part of the TOSCANE-T experiment organized by the European Space Agency to calibrate the scatterometer for launch on ERS-1 in the early 1990's for global ocean wind measurement. The data analysed are the thermodynamic and turbulent variables measured by an instrumented aircraft, the Hurel Dubois, flying at a constant level of 50 m over the sea surface. Special attention was drawn to the variability of the boundary conditions within areas of 25 x 30 km. In fact, the two-dimensional fields of fluxes and thermodynamic parameters were inhomogeneous with some rather strong wind distortion. The eddy fluxes were parameterized with the aid of bulk aerodynamic formulations at a basic scale of 30 km samples, which corresponds to the aircraft flux computation legs. The bulk aerodynamic coefficients for momentum and heat were found to remain independent of windspeed (for wind velocities less than 12 m/s). Fluxes and thermodynamic parameters were also investigated at two other scales: the integration scale was either reduced to small areas of which size always remains larger than several characteristic lengths of turbulent transfer, or extended to a large area of 25 x 30 km. The results of the bulk aerodynamic relationships appeared to be scale invariant, which would therefore justify the application of average values, within the range of scales under study.																	0006-8314					NOV	1991	57	3					219	249		10.1007/BF00120886								WOS:A1991GM28900002

The solutions of these problems were applied to calculate the ratio of bioluminescence signal to astronomical light back-ground and the instrument sensitivity necessary for airborne remote sensing of marine bioluminescence.

Maximum total heat fluxes occurred over the Gulf Stream northeast of Cape Hatteras where very cold, dry air encountered the Gulf Stream and where the wind speeds were very large. Maximum 6-h values for the total heat flux were as high as 2015 W m-2. The magnitude of the area-average heat flux in the MBL was influenced not only by the surface air and dewpoint temperatures and the surface wind speeds off the coast but also by the area covered by Gulf Stream water (sea surface temperature greater than 22-degrees-C). The heat flux distribution off the coast rapidly produced large horizontal temperature (approximately 10-degrees-C) and humidity (4 g kg-1) differences over distances on the order of 100 km. The large influx of moisture at the surface in response to the large latent heat fluxes caused the lifting condensation level relative to the surface to lower, influencing the production of offshore cloudiness and subsequently lowering the cloud-base height. Destablization of the (or increased instability in the) boundary layer also occurred over short distances offshore. The boundary-layer depth increased rapidly, the rate of increase being largest between the coast and the Gulf Stream.																	0027-0644	1520-0493				SEP	1991	119	9					2252	2279		10.1175/1520-0493(1991)119<2252:AOTEOT>2.0.CO;2								WOS:A1991GF87600011

In order to enhance the power of the echo sounder, a postprocessing system has been designed and realized in standard software that is essentially machine independent. This has been done by adhering to the following international standards: UNIX operating system, C programming language, X Window Systems, Structured-Query Language (SQL) for communication with a relational database, and Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Preprocessed data are transferred from the echo sounder to the postprocessing system by means of a local-area network (LAN), namely Ethernet. Development of the postprocessing system, for analysis of such diverse scatterers as plankton, pelagic, and bottom fish, and the bottom itself, is documented in the following way. The history of echo integration is summarized. User requirements for the new system are listed. Reasons are given for the choice of the particular computing environment, including both hardware, software, and external communications. The system design, consisting of data flow and graphical user interfaces, is described. Implementation of the system is defined through integration techniques and a discussion of performance issues. Operating procedures and the first field trials of the system are described. Several features characteristic of and perhaps unique to the postprocessing system are, for example: (1) user definition of arbitrarily shaped integration regions, including non-constant-depth intervals, by means of interactive graphics; (2) preprocessor error correction, e.g., adjustment of the noise threshold or redefinition of the detected bottom; (3) use of several color map techniques in order to extract such information as signal strength and shape; and (4) the scheme of interconnections of graphical user interfaces, database, and data files. This work does not introduce a set of computer instructions. It does describe a design philosophy and method of realization that may have broader applications in acoustics than that ostensibly concerned only with the quantitative estimation of fish abundance.																	0001-4966					JUL	1991	90	1					37	47		10.1121/1.401261								WOS:A1991FV28000005

Unique signature variations in the SAR backscatter due to upper ocean circulation features and wind fronts were found. It is documented that a current jet of 0.3 m s-1 with a shear of about 0.3 x 10(-3) s-1 is correlated with a narrow, bright curved line in the backscatter. In comparison a rapid wind shift of 9 m s-1 resulted in a sharp transition from dark to brighter backscatter regions. The corresponding profiles of backscatter modulation across these features are expressed by a peak of about 2 dB in contrast to a steplike increase of 5-8 dB. This suggests that SAR image expressions of upper ocean circulation features and wind fronts can be distinguished and classified. On the basis of this classification, we attempt to quantify the dominating marine geophysical variables. This method for systematic interpretation of SAR images should be further validated with the use of airborne or satellite data such as from the first European Space Agency remote sensing satellite, ERS 1.																	0148-0227					JUN 15	1991	96	C6					10411	10422		10.1029/91JC00301								WOS:A1991FT34300002

The surface tuna fishery, case is thoroughly studied, considering its specificity and its economical importance. From there, it appears that conclusive strides will be made by halieutic science through the knowledge of the relationship between tuna and its environment. Some tuna environment studies are presented through typical remote sensing examples and introduce the basis of a coherent theory of tuna behaviour which can be schematically summarized by this basic general hypothesis; namely, that if tuna are present in a zone they will be inclined to aggregate close to any anomalies (gradients) of parameters in their environmental sensing field. From there, several models are presented in order to assess or forecast surface tuna stocks. A second part analyses the potential and contribution of the aerospatial remote sensing in the halieutic field through several original examples which point out clearly that this technique is one of the only tools able to visualize some essential concepts in oceanography and halieutic science. Last, we propose a study in several countries within the framework of several activities to integrate remote sensing tools in the fishery management structure, and to establish the data acquisition system in remote sensing satellites. From this study, a true operational halieutic field can be created.																	0143-1161					APR	1991	12	4					713	724		10.1080/01431169108929688								WOS:A1991FD71600006						
J	BARALE, V				BARALE, V			SEA-SURFACE COLOR IN THE FIELD OF BIOLOGICAL OCEANOGRAPHY	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Variations of marine surface optical properties (generally grouped under the term 'sea surface colour') are due to dissolved and suspended materials, with different absorption and scattering characteristics, present in sea water. Remote assessments of sea surface colour, therefore, can be used to determine the presence and abundance of water constituents such as biological pigments, suspended sediments or other products of organic matter degradation (the so-called yellow substance). In open sea waters, the pigments due to biological activities, and particularly phytoplankton chlorophyll-like pigments, are the main contributors to surface colour. Hence, observations in the visible spectrum can provide synoptic and repetitive information on parameters linked to biological production and patchiness, or bio-geo-chemical cycles in general. Since water constituents act as tracers of various marine processes, bio-optical patterns on the sea surface can also provide indications about the relationships existing between forcing mechanisms and biological response in the marine environment. These capabilities render optical remote sensing an invaluable tool in the field of biological oceanography, although atmospheric processes and signal ambiguities in the water column may pose severe limitations on this technique. The feasibility and potential of passive remote sensing in the visible spectrum have been demonstrated primarily by the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) experiment. Important results of this experiment have been reported in the study of coastal phenomena, sediment transport, frisheries, upwelling, climatic events, and factors controlling the distribution, growth and fate of phytoplankton. On these latter topics, indications of a strong coupling between dynamical and bio-optical conditions of the marine environment are emerging from the analysis of CZCS image series, for open ocean, near-coastal and enclosed basin conditions. Examples of such studies, covering regions of both the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans and of the Mediterranean Sea, provide clues on the promises of large-scale sea surface colour assessments in the field of biological oceanography.																	0143-1161					APR	1991	12	4					781	793		10.1080/01431169108929694								WOS:A1991FD71600012						
J	BARALE, V				BARALE, V			MARINE REMOTE-SENSING INFORMATION-SYSTEM (MARSIS) - A CONCEPTUAL DESIGN	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Remote observations of the sea produce large quantities of data, which must pass through several levels of processing, requiring special facilities and expertise, before reaching the end user. As a consequence, most marine remote-sensing data available at this time are not fully used because the average potential user does not have the means or competence to do so. These information-management problems could be eased through the development of a Marine Remote-Sensing Information System (MARSIS), capable of delivering value-added data sets both according to standard statistical and dynamical procedures and according to specific user requests. A regional MARSIS Centre is envisioned as the nodal point of a distributed information system, which includes three basic modules, devoted respectively to processing, management and communication, as well as a dedicated knowledge-based system connecting the modules themselves to original data repositories and final users. The MARSIS concept has been designed to enable the full exploitation of oceanographic data, and to lead to the development of future oceanological forecast services.																	0143-1161					APR	1991	12	4					795	802		10.1080/01431169108929695								WOS:A1991FD71600013

MARINE STRATOCUMULUS OBSERVATIONS	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												A multispectral scanning radiometer has been used to obtain measurements of the reflection function of marine stratocumulus clouds at 0.75, 1.65 and 2.16-mu-m. These observations were obtained from the NASA ER-2 aircraft as part of the First ISCCP [International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project] Regional Experiment (FIRE), conducted off the coast of southern California during July 1987. Multispectral images of the reflection function were used to derived the optical thickness and effective particle radius of stratiform cloud layers on four days. In addition to the radiation measurements, in situ microphysical measurements were obtained from the University of Washington Convair C-131A aircraft. In this paper we compare remote sensing results with in situ observations, which show a good spatial correlation for both optical thickness and effective radius. These comparisons further show systematic differences between remote sensing and in situ values, with a tendency for remote sensing to overestimate the effective radius by approximately 2-3-mu-m, independent of particle radius. The optical thickness, in contrast, is somewhat overestimated for small optical thicknesses and underestimated for large optical thicknesses. An introduction of enhanced gaseous absorption at a wavelength of 2.16-mu-m successfully explains some of these observed discrepancies. Marginal probability density functions of optical thickness, liquid water path and effective radius have been derived from our remote sensing results. The joint probability density function of liquid water path and effective radius shows that the effective radius increases as the liquid water path increases for optically thin clouds, in contrast to optically thick clouds for which the effective radius decreases with increasing liquid water path.

No knowledge of the scattering body is required. The general formulas require the field and its normal derivative; however, some geometries require only the field. The application of the technique to the acoustic marine seismic problem is explored. This paper demonstrates a problem of interest in hydrocarbon exploration where one observes the "solution" of a PDE and must reconstruct the source.																	0036-1445					MAR	1991	33	1					109	113		10.1137/1033007								WOS:A1991FD40400007

What others have termed spectral signatures obtained by such methods as total luminescent spectroscopy can serve as representative indicators of both background conditions and those deviating from the normal. In this paper we show how, with the aid of laboratory catalogs of spectral signatures, it is possible to detect oil pollution at levels substantially below those of slicks (of a few microliters per liter) and to identify groups of pollutants (by remote sensing). And we describe a spectroscopic lidar we developed for marine studies.																	0003-6935					FEB 1	1991	30	4					453	458		10.1364/AO.30.000453								WOS:A1991EW64400023	20582013

J	PRANDLE, D				PRANDLE, D			A 5-YEAR SCIENTIFIC-RESEARCH PROGRAM FOR MANAGING COASTAL SEAS	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												The management of coastal seas requires scientific knowledge to: (i) link inputs to resulting concentrations, (ii) distinguish between natural variability and man's impact, and (iii) predict long term trends. This knowledge incorporates: (i) movement and dispersion of both water and sediments, (ii) partitioning of contaminants between dissolved and particulate phases, (iii) successive exchange processes between river/estuary/coastal zone/sea/ocean and between sea/sea-bed and sea/atmosphere. The UK is presently mid-way into a 5-year, 15M pound sterling oceanographic research programme in the North Sea involving the development of numerical models, systematic observations and fundamental research to fill gaps in basic knowledge. The programme will proceed through three stages, simulating physical, biological, chemical and sedimentological parameters: (i) over the well-defined annual seasonal cycle, (ii) over inter-annual variations, (iii) for long term trends. Long-term data sets are vital for such programmes, systematic marine monitoring programmes must be initiated, involving combinations of remote sensing, sea-truth moorings and coastal stations. This programme will be extended to consider the contribution to and effect from global pollution, specifically possible greenhouse effects such as rise in mean sea level and meterological changes. The widespread impact of such phenomena emphasises the necessity for international co-operation in all aspects of these studies.																	0025-326X	1879-3363					1991	23						63	68		10.1016/0025-326X(91)90651-8								WOS:A1991FJ01200015						
J	ANDRE, JM; MOREL, A				ANDRE, JM; MOREL, A			ATMOSPHERIC CORRECTIONS AND INTERPRETATION OF MARINE RADIANCES IN CZCS IMAGERY, REVISITED	OCEANOLOGICA ACTA												In a previous study (Bricaud and Morel, Oceanologica Acta, 1987), a reflectance model developed for oceanic Case 1 waters was introduced into CZCS data processing, mainly with the aim of improving the atmospheric correction scheme and permitting discrimination between Case 1 and turbid Case 2 waters. The present paper, not limited to CZCS, examines the possible extension of the use of this reflectance model. In particular, it is proposed that the relationships required in iterative computations when estimating marine radiances in the four (visible) channels be those which derive from the model rather than the empirical expressions. Also, in order to ensure an internal coherency, it is proposed to operate the modelled relationships between the reflectance ratios and the chlorophyllous pigment concentration as algorithms for pigment retrieval. The performances of a pixel-by-pixel procedure (PPP), which iteratively produces the best estimates of both the atmospheric and the marine signals, are assessed through sensitivity analyses. To this end, the application of PPP (or any other procedure) is simulated by using a modelled ocean-atmosphere system, in which the aerosol properties, the pigment content, the sun and viewing geometrical conditions can be changed. We also examine the consequences: of using a mean Angstrom exponent instead of those which result at the pixel level from the application of the PPP; of considering the "full" pigment concentration range when applying the PPP, i.e. a range which considerably exceeds that of "clear water"; of the inevitable deviation of actual waters with regard to the modelled Case 1 waters (which are underlying as reference waters in such a processing). It is believed that improvements can be expected from the present procedure, with the proviso that well calibrated, remotely sensed data should be available.																	0399-1784						1991	14	1					3	22										WOS:A1991EZ66900001

The colour imagery was able to identify several physical processes on the shelf (such as outflows and upwelling) to approximately the same degree as previously reported with thermal imagery. Because processing CZCS data requires the use of atmospheric and marine models defined by a range of input parameters, the various processing steps and assumptions were evaluated for potential impact on any marine interpretation of the imagery. The shelf waters were not a pure oceanic water mass throughout the year and turbidity levels were found to be the most significant interfering factor in successful interpretation of the majority of the ocean colour imagery. During spring and autumn, possible bloom periods, pigment material began to dominate the optical environment and hence permitting pigment algorithms to successfully explain most of the variance observed in the satellite imagery. Although it was not possible to associate individual colour features on the shelf with particular in-water constituents, the long term trend in shelf water turbidity was related to the general level of biological material. As a consequence the satellite derived mean monthly levels of pigment material for the whole shelf were found to be in good agreement with the measured seasonal cycle.																	0399-1784						1991	14	6					533	547										WOS:A1991HA02600001						
J	GREGG, WW; CARDER, KL				GREGG, WW; CARDER, KL			A SIMPLE SPECTRAL SOLAR IRRADIANCE MODEL FOR CLOUDLESS MARITIME ATMOSPHERES	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A simple spectral atmospheric radiative transfer model specific for oceanographic applications begins with spectral extraterrestrial solar irradiance corrected for earth-sun orbital distance. Irradiance is then attenuated in passing through the atmosphere by Rayleigh scattering, ozone, oxygen, and water vapor absorption, and marine aerosol scattering and absorption, and is finally reduced by reflectance at the air-sea interface. The model is an extension of the continental aerosol model of Bird and Riordan, modified to include maritime aerosol properties, irradiance transmittance through the air-sea interface, and atmospheric absorption at very high spectral resolution (1 nm). Atmospheric optical constituents and the surface reflectance are functions of the local meteorological conditions, imparting flexibility to the model to reproduce the spectral irradiance under a variety of maritime atmospheres. The model computes irradiance at or just below the ocean surface at high spectral resolution in the range 350-700 nm, i.e. within the range required for photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) calculations. It agrees spectrally with observed surface spectral irradiances to within +/- 6.6% (rms) and as integrated PAR to within +/- 5.1%. The computed spectral irradiance is useful as an input to bio-optical models in the ocean, to phytoplankton growth and primary production models, and in remote-sensing applications.																	0024-3590					DEC	1990	35	8					1657	1675		10.4319/lo.1990.35.8.1657								WOS:A1990FE65500001

Data collected since 1932 during the Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey show consistent patterns of geographical, seasonal and annual variation in the distribution of phytoplankton and its major taxonomic components. There is a trend of increased colouration in Recorder silks in the southern North Sea until approximately 1975 since when Colour levels (assumed to be indicative of algal biomass) have declined. In the eutrophic Dutch Wadden Sea the algal crop continued to increase; in Dutch coastal North Sea waters a trend of biomass increase reversed since 1984, apparently due to a reduction in Rhine river outflow. Long-term observations made at Helgoland since the 60's also show trends of increasing nutrients and phytoplankton biomass only to 1984. Adverse effects such as deoxygenation, foam formation and toxin production have been linked to mass concentrations of algae known as blooms. There is no evidence from existing reports for an increase in their frequency, although some years stand out with larger numbers. Occurrence of blooms can partly be explained by hydrographic conditions. More than 30 taxa are recognised as occurring in bloom proportions in the North Sea, approximately one third of which can be toxic. The crop of Bacillariophyceae (diatoms) is not likely to increase with eutrophication due to silicate limitation. An extensive subsurface maximum of armoured dinoflagellates, its abundance governed by hydrographic conditions, is the most characteristic feature of the central and northern North Sea in the summer months. Abundance, sometimes dominance, of picoplankton and of species that are not readily detected by microscopic observations has been documented by measurements of taxon-specific pigments such as chlorophyll b (green algae), alloxanthin (Cryptophyceae) and 19' - hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin (Prymnesiophyceae or Haptophyceae). Analysis of time series of satellite images is a promising way to assess in a quantitative and, more important, synoptic way the patchy distribution of phytoplankton over large regions. Growth processes of the phytoplankton respond according to variables amenable to such satellite remote sensing. Empirical and theoretical relationships that can be established between chlorophyll a, C-14 uptake, turbidity, stratification, suspended sediment type, irradiance and temperature in some well-investigated areas make remote sensing a potential tool to obtain reliable estimates of primary production in the whole North Sea. The C-14 method for estimates of the rate of algal growth processes appears to agree reasonably well with other methods, both involving incubation of samples and in situ measurements of temporal changes of oxygen and pH. The level of net primary production is 250 g C.m-2.a-1 in the central North Sea, 150 to 200 g C.m-2.a-1 in the northern North Sea, and 200 g in the South. The main metabolic processes involved in phytoplankton growth have been modelled mathematically in terms of the most important controlling environmental parameters. Such parameters comprise not only those of a chemical signature (micro- and macronutrients, both inorganic and organic) but also physical effects of vertical mixing and sinking, and biological effects including allelopathic interactions, antibiotic excretions, vertical migration, and mortality due to grazing and parasitism. The balance between primary production and consumption of organic matter appears to vary both geographically and seasonally. The process of regeneration of primary products both in the water column and in and near the bottom seems to be of major importance. Future research should center around a study of growth-controlling parameters in laboratory culture experiments. The studies should include uptake of dissolved organic compounds by all taxonomic groups, including pico- and nanophytoplankton, and all aspects of ecosystem structure and function involving the relation between algae and microheterotrophs making up the small food web. There is a need to synthesize existing information on phytoplankton in the North Sea and the factors governing its growth, such as nutrients, river input and stratification intensity. Complicated inter-relationships and successional patterns between individual species which are limited by varying physiological requirements and adaptation to differing hydrographic regimes reemphasizes the importance of species identification in phytoplankton studies. Many future problems in phytoplankton research will not be resolved without accurate identification of algal species. Taxonomic expertise takes many years to acquire; there is at present a shortage of skills in this area and more resources should be turned towards training and long-term support.																	0077-7579					NOV	1990	26	2-4					295	331		10.1016/0077-7579(90)90094-W								WOS:A1990FA34200004
