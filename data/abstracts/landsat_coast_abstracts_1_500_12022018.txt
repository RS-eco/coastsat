In particular, we characterized the temporal and spatial variability of turbidity and sea surface temperature (SST) in the Po River prodelta (Northern Adriatic Sea, Italy) during the period 2013-2016. To perform this analysis, a two-pronged processing methodology was implemented and the resulting outputs were analysed through a series of statistical tools. A pixel-based spatial correlation analysis was carried out by comparing temporal curves of turbidity and SST hypercubes with in situ time series of wind speed and water discharge, providing correlation coefficient maps. A geostatistical analysis was performed to determine the spatial dependency of the turbidity datasets per each satellite image, providing maps of correlation and variograms. The results show a linear correlation between water discharge and turbidity variations in the points more affected by the buoyant plumes and along the southern coast of Po River delta. Better inverse correlation was found between turbidity and SST during floods rather than other periods. The correlation maps of wind speed with turbidity show different spatial patterns depending on local or basin-scale wind effects. Variogram maps identify different spatial anisotropy structures of turbidity in response to ambient conditions (i.e. strong Bora or Scirocco winds, floods). Since the implemented processing methodology is based on open source software and free satellite data, it represents a promising tool for the monitoring of maritime ecosystems and to address water quality analyses and the investigations of sediment dynamics in estuarine and coastal waters.																	0303-2434					APR	2018	66						210	225		10.1016/j.jag.2017.11.012								WOS:000423650500019						
J	Kelly, JT; Gontz, AM				Kelly, Joshua T.; Gontz, Allen M.			Using GPS-surveyed intertidal zones to determine the validity of shorelines automatically mapped by Landsat water indices	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Satellite remote sensing has been used extensively in a variety of shoreline studies and validated using aerial photography. This ground truth method only represents an instantaneous depiction of the shoreline at the time of acquisition and does not take into account the spatial and temporal variability of the dynamic shoreline boundary. Landsat 8's Operational Land Imager sensor's capability to accurately delineate a shoreline is assessed by comparing all known Landsat water index-derived shorelines with two GPS-surveyed intertidal zones that coincide with the satellite flyover date, one of which had near-neap tide conditions. Seven indices developed for automatically classifying water pixels were evaluated for their ability to delineate shorelines. The shoreline is described here as the area above and below maximum low and high tide, otherwise known as the intertidal zone. The high-water line, or wet/dry sediment line, was chosen as the shoreline indicator to be mapped using a handheld GPS. The proportion of the Landsat-derived shorelines that fell within this zone and their alongshore profile lengths were calculated. The most frequently used water index and the predecessor to Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), was found to be the least accurate by a significant margin. Other indices required calibration of their threshold value to achieve accurate results, thus diminishing their replicability success for other regions. MNDWI was determined to be the best index for automated shoreline mapping, based on its superior accuracy and repeatable, stable threshold value.																	0303-2434					MAR	2018	65						92	104		10.1016/j.jag.2017.10.007								WOS:000418312200009

This phenomenon directly challenges the agricultural landscape multifunctionality, including its carbon (C) storage capacity. Using satellite data, we mapped peri-urban C stocks in soil and built-up surfaces over three areas from 1993 to 2014 in the Emilia-Romagna region, Italy: a thinly populated area around Piacenza, an intermediate-density area covering the Reggio Emilia-Modena conurbation and a densely anthropized area developing along the coast of Rimini. Satellite-derived maps enabled the quantitative analysis of spatial and temporal features of urban growth and soil sealing, expressed as the ratio between C in built-up land and organic C in soils (Cc/Co). The three areas show substantial differences in C stock balance and soil sealing evolution. In Piacenza (Cc/Co = 0.07 in 1993), although questioned by late industrial expansion and connected residential sprawl (Cc/Co growth by 38%), most of the new urbanisation spared the best rural soils. The Reggio Emilia-Modena conurbation, driven by the polycentricism of the area and the heterogeneity of economic sectors (Cc/Co rising from 0.08 to 0.14 from 1993 to 2014), balances sprawl and densification. Rimini, severely sealed since the 1960s (Cc/Co = 0.23 in 1993), densifies its existing settlements and develops an industrial expansion of the hinterland, with Cc/Co growth accelerating from + 15% before 2003 to + 36% for the last decade.

(2016) was proposed. By employing that method, the calculated sea levels calculated from simulated tidal heights and instantaneous shoreline positions rather than simulated tidal heights were used to correct fluctuations in instantaneous shoreline positions caused by tidal height and seasonal sea level changes and other random sea level fluctuations. When calculating the shoreline erosion rates and beach slopes, a statistical analysis of a large number of corrected shoreline positions was used to reduce the influence of random errors that were mainly caused by waves and other casual factors. The shoreline erosion rates and beach slopes presented in this paper are therefore more precise and reliable than those derived in previous studies, which only used two satellite images. The results of this study show that the shoreline of the southern Yellow River Delta primarily experienced gradual erosion during 1976-2016, with an average erosion rate of 26.9 m/year. The average shoreline erosion rate increased from 24.9 m/year in 1976-1996 to 34.9 m/year in 1996-2016-an increase of 40%-probably due to the reduction in sediment discharge and shifting northward course of the Yellow River after 1996. The shoreline erosion rate of the central coast decreased from 50.2 m/year in 1976-1996 to 27.1 m/year in 1996-2016-a decrease of 46%-probably due to the protection offered by coastal hard structures. The average shoreline erosion rate caused by relative sea level rise was 8.5 m/year or 32% of the total average shoreline erosion rate. Relative sea level rise plays an important role in the erosion of the southern Yellow River Delta due to its flat beach. The beach slope of the southern Yellow River Delta was flat and stable in 1976-2016, and the average slope over most of the beach was 0.043%.																	0025-3227	1872-6151				JAN 1	2018	395						188	197		10.1016/j.margeo.2017.10.006								WOS:000423645300014

While significant advances have been made in mangrove mapping using remote sensing, no study has documented long-term changes in mangrove extents in Sierra Leone-one of the most vulnerable countries in West Africa. Such understanding is critical for devising regional management strategies that can support local livelihoods. We utilize multi-date Landsat data and cloud computational techniques to quantify spatiotemporal changes in land cover, with focus on mangrove ecosystems, for 1990-2016 along the coast of Sierra Leone. We specifically focus on four estuaries-Scarcies, Sierra Leone, Yawri Bay, and Sherbro. We relied on the k-means approach for an unsupervised classification, and validated the classified map from 2016 using ground truth data collected from Sentinel-2 and high-resolution images and during field research (accuracy: 95%). Our findings indicate that the Scarcies river estuary witnessed the greatest mangrove loss since 1990 (45%), while the Sierra Leone river estuary experienced mangrove gain over the last 26 years (22%). Overall, the Sierra Leone coast lost 25% of its mangroves between 1990 and 2016, with the lowest coverage in 2000, during the period of civil war (1991-2002). However, natural mangrove dynamics, as supported by field observations, indicate the potential for regeneration and sustainability under carefully constructed management strategies.																	1424-8220					JAN	2018	18	1							12	10.3390/s18010012								WOS:000423286300012						
J	Wu, XL; Liu, CX; Wu, GF				Wu, Xueling; Liu, Chaoxian; Wu, Guofeng			Spatial-Temporal Analysis and Stability Investigation of Coastline Changes: A Case Study in Shenzhen, China	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												Coastlines are some of the most important dynamic linear features on the Earth's surface. Conducting research on coastline changes is essential to improve the environmental management and development of the coast. In this study, Landsat satellite images that cover the entire coastal zone of Shenzhen, which was the first special economic zone in China, are used to study coastline changes. Multitemporal coastline information for Shenzhen from 1988 to 2015 is extracted based on the object-oriented classification approach. The overall classification accuracy of this approach can reach 85% or more when it is used to classify the land-use types present within the coastal zone in this study. Moreover, coastline change rates are calculated using a point-based approach. Coastline stability changes are analyzed, and driving rules are explored, using a data-mining approach that addresses natural and social factors. The research results demonstrate that the object-based approach can extract accurate coastline information from Landsat images and that the coastlines in Shenzhen have varied with time and location. The coastline changes in Shenzhen from 1988 to 2015 can be divided into two stages: one displays accelerated change (1988-2003), whereas the other displays decelerated change (2003-2015). Completely different change characteristics of coastline stability are found between the eastern and western coastlines in Shenzhen, and the differences are mainly reflected in the coastline's morphological changes and varying rules.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				JAN	2018	11	1					45	56		10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2755444								WOS:000422950700005

Historical changes in the shoreline positions and inundation based on projected sea-level scenarios of 0.5 and 1 m were assessed for Nagapattinam District, a low-lying coastal area in the southeast coast of India, using high-resolution Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data; multi-dated Landsat satellite images of 1978, 1991, 2003, and 2015; and census data of 2011. Image processing, geographical information system, and digital shoreline analysis system methods were used in the study. The shoreline variation indicated that erosion rate varied at different time scales. The end point rate indicated the highest mean erosion of - 3.12 m/year, occurred in 73% of coast between 1978 and 1991. Weighted linear regression analysis revealed that the coast length of 83% was under erosion at a mean rate of - 2.11 m/year from 1978 to 2015. Sea level rise (SLR) impact indicated that the coastal area of about 14,122 ha from 225 villages and 31,318 ha from 272 villages would be permanently inundated for the SLR of 0.5 and 1 m, respectively, which includes agriculture, mangroves, wetlands, aquaculture, and forest lands. The loss of coastal wetlands and its associated productivity will severely threaten more than half the coastal population. Adaptation measures in people participatory mode, integrated into coastal zone management with a focus on sub-regional coastal activities, are needed to respond to the consequences of climate change.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JAN	2018	190	1							51	10.1007/s10661-017-6426-0								WOS:000422680800051

An assessment of commonly employed satellite-based remote sensors for mapping mangrove species in Mexico using an NDVI-based classification scheme	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Optimizing the classification accuracy of a mangrove forest is of utmost importance for conservation practitioners. Mangrove forest mapping using satellite-based remote sensing techniques is by far the most common method of classification currently used given the logistical difficulties of field endeavors in these forested wetlands. However, there is now an abundance of options from which to choose in regards to satellite sensors, which has led to substantially different estimations of mangrove forest location and extent with particular concern for degraded systems. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of mangrove forest classification using different remotely sensed data sources (i.e., Landsat-8, SPOT-5, Sentinel-2, and WorldView-2) for a system located along the Pacific coast of Mexico. Specifically, we examined a stressed semiarid mangrove forest which offers a variety of conditions such as dead areas, degraded stands, healthy mangroves, and very dense mangrove island formations. The results indicated that Landsat-8 (30 m per pixel) had the lowest overall accuracy at 64% and that WorldView-2 (1.6 m per pixel) had the highest at 93%. Moreover, the SPOT-5 and the Sentinel-2 classifications (10 m per pixel) were very similar having accuracies of 75 and 78%, respectively. In comparison to WorldView-2, the other sensors overestimated the extent of Laguncularia racemosa and underestimated the extent of Rhizophora mangle. When considering such type of sensors, the higher spatial resolution can be particularly important in mapping small mangrove islands that often occur in degraded mangrove systems.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JAN	2018	190	1							23	10.1007/s10661-017-6399-z								WOS:000422680800032						
J	Ahmed, A; Drake, F; Nawaz, R; Woulds, C				Ahmed, Asib; Drake, Frances; Nawaz, Rizwan; Woulds, Clare			Where is the coast? Monitoring coastal land dynamics in Bangladesh: An integrated management approach using GIS and remote sensing techniques	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												This paper draws upon the application of GIS and remote sensing techniqueS to investigate the dynamic nature and management aspects of land in the coastal areas of Bangladesh. The geomorphological characteristic of the coastal areas is highly dynamic where land erosion and accretion with different rates remain a constant phenomenon. This study focuses on three coastal zones: western, central and eastern that comprise the entire coastal area of the country. At its core, this study uses the past 30 year Landsat satellite images. This research reveals that the rate of accretion in the study area is slightly higher than the rate of erosion. Overall land dynamics indicate a net gain of 237 km(2) (7.9 km(2) annual average) of land in the area for the whole period from 1985 to 2015. The results also demonstrate that the rates of both erosion and accretion are higher in the central zone compared to the western and the eastern zones of the coastal area. This is the first time that the entire coastal areas of Bangladesh have been considered for assessment. This study also recommends that coastal managers, planners and policymakers to consider the identified dynamic trends of coastal land before opting for any specific measure. Constant monitoring using the GIS and remote sensing techniques would be a viable management for this purpose. This study has identified some causes of land dynamics, particularly for the three coastal zones, that might be helpful for policymakers in identifying the nature of interventions needs to be taken for specific coastal zones.																	0964-5691	1873-524X				JAN 1	2018	151						10	24		10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2017.10.030								WOS:000418973100002						
J	Shumack, S; Hesse, P; Turner, L				Shumack, Samuel; Hesse, Paul; Turner, Liam			The impact of fire on sand dune stability: Surface coverage and biomass recovery after fires on Western Australian coastal dune systems from 1988 to 2016	GEOMORPHOLOGY												This study aims to determine the common response of coastal sand dunes in Western Australia (WA) to fire on decadal time-scales, in terms of ecological-geomorphic-climatic interactions to test the hypothesis that fire plays a role in coastal dune destabilisation. Fires are commonly suggested to have contributed to widespread dune reactivation in Australia and globally, a hypothesis that is relatively untested. We used data from the Landsat Thematic Mapper, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, and Operational Land Imager missions to monitor changes in surface coverage on coastal sand dunes in south-west WA after fires. We analysed 31 fire scars from 1988 to 2016 in two Landsat scenes on the west and south coast of WA. Recovery ratios derived from the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were used to monitor patterns in post-fire biomass and surface cover. Recovery ratios are correlated with indices of bum severity, and meteorological data to investigate relationships. We also used Maximum Likelihood Classification to monitor changes in bare sand area. Results suggest that recovery followed a strongly consistent pattern, and is characterised by rapid vegetation cover re-establishment within six to twelve months. Prior to this, some aeolian activity may have occurred but without substantial surface changes. Initial germination and/or resprouting were followed by steady growth up to seven years, where NDVI typically neared pre-fire values. Some variation in early recovery occurred between the west and south coast, possibly owing to relative proportions of reseeding and resprouting plants. A log regression explained 75% of the recovery pattern (79% on the south coast). Precipitation had some ability to explain recovery up to nine months post-fire (r(2) = 029 to 0.54). No relationships were observed between estimates of bum severity and recovery. After nine months, the biggest cause of spatial variation in recovery was the pre-fire community composition and related seedbank or resprouting density. Image classification did not identify any new blowout features except where fires were not the primary cause. Results suggest that fires are not presently contributing to the destabilisation of coastal dunes in south-west WA. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Shupe, SM				Shupe, Scott M.			High resolution stream water quality assessment in the Vancouver, British Columbia region: a citizen science study	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Changing land cover and climate regimes modify water quantity and quality in natural stream systems. In regions undergoing rapid change, it is difficult to effectively monitor and quantify these impacts at local to regional scales. In Vancouver, British Columbia, one of the most rapidly urbanizing areas in Canada, 750 measurements were taken from a total of 81 unique sampling sites representing 49 streams located in urban, forest, and agricultural-dominant watersheds at a frequency of up to 12 times per year between 2013 and 2016. Dissolved nitrate (NO3N) and phosphate (PO4-P) concentrations, turbidity, water temperature, pH and conductivity were measured by citizen scientists in addition to observations of hydrology, vegetation, land use, and visible stream impacts. Land cover was mapped at a 15-mresolution using Landsat 8 OLI imagery and used to determine dominant land cover for each watershed in which a sample was recorded. Regional, seasonal, and catchment-type trends in measurements were determined using statistical analyses. The relationships of nutrients to land cover varied seasonally and on a catchment-type basis. Nitrate showed seasonal highs in winter and lows in summer, though phosphate had less seasonal variation. Overall, nitrate concentrations were positively associated to agriculture and deciduous forest and negatively associated with coniferous forest. In contrast, phosphate concentrations were positively associated with agricultural, deciduous forest, and disturbed land cover and negatively associated with urban land cover. Both urban and agricultural land cover were significantly associated with an increase in water conductivity. Increased forest land cover was associated with better water quality, including lower turbidity, conductivity, and water temperature. This study showed the importance of high resolution sampling in understanding seasonal and spatial dynamics of stream water quality, made possible with the large number of measurements taken with the help of trained volunteers. The results underscore the value of citizen science in freshwater research. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A Multi-Sensor Approach for Assessing Mangrove Biophysical Characteristics in Coastal Odisha, India	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES												Mangroves around the world play a major role in coastal ecosystem processes by mitigating erosion and serving as a barrier against storm surges. India holds approximately 5% of the world's mangroves, over half of which are found along its east coast. Situated in the state of Odisha, Chilika Lagoon and Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary are two wetlands of local importance in need of effective management. This study demonstrated the use of Terra, Landsat, and Sentinel-1 satellite data for spatio-temporal monitoring of mangrove health at these two sites. Several indices, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Enhanced Vegetation Index, were examined to develop biophysical prediction tools and derive a 17-year time-series (from 2000 to 2016) of leaf chlorophyll (CHL), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP). The long-term analysis revealed phenological patterns in the biophysical characteristics such as high values during wet season and low values during the dry season. Correlations between biophysical characteristics and meteorological factors revealed a time lag exists in response to precipitation and associated runoff. In contrast, surface temperature did not show any lag in response time. This study also utilized Sentinel-1 radar data for the first time for Odisha mangroves to show seasonal variability in LAI, GPP, and CHL. The results from radar data were consistent with optical sensors and proved useful for capturing the rainy season, where data were limited due to cloud cover. This study revealed the advantages of using a multi-sensor approach for monitoring mangrove health and defining future monitoring protocols.																	0369-8203	2250-1762				DEC	2017	87	4					679	700		10.1007/s40010-017-0441-y								WOS:000418819200015

For species exclusively inhabiting coastal and estuarine waters, such as the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, Sousa chinensis, irreversible habitat loss can have dramatic implications for population viability. >A Landsat image database was used to determine the extent of coastal changes along the northern Beibu Gulf, where a large humpback dolphin population is found. The results were compared with the standardized sighting gradient (SPUF) determined from a questionnaire survey of fishermen and likely core habitats identified by application of a global digital elevation model. >Both SPUF and likely core habitat results indicated a continuous distribution of the humpback dolphin along the northern Beibu Gulf. Landsat images revealed that 129.6km(2) of coastal waters were permanently lost in the past 40years, 60km(2) within the likely core habitats. Although this may be considered small, the impact of such habitat loss could be substantial in some local habitats. >The humpback dolphin population in the northern Beibu Gulf should be regarded as one management unit, with two or more social subunits. Immediate systematic surveys are needed to fill information gaps on true distribution range and habitat-use patterns. >Habitat protection actions for dolphins in the northern Beibu Gulf should include both core and linking habitats, including enacting protected areas in core habitats, mitigating anthropogenic impacts in likely habitats, restoring both coastal waters and surrounding landscape quality, effective treatment of industrial sewage discharge, and comprehensive environmental impact assessments for the planning of coastal development projects.

Coastal landuse and land cover change and transformations of Kanyakumari coast, India using remote sensing and GIS	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES												The coastal landuse and land cover features in the South West coast of Kanyakumari are dynamically regulated due to marine and terrestrial processes and often controlling by natural and anthropogenic activities. The primary objective of this study is to estimate the decadal changes and their transformations of landuse and land cover (LULC) features under Level II category of USGS-LULC Classification System using Landsat ETM+ and TM images using Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) algorithm for the period 2000-2011. The classified LULC features are categorized as beachface land cover, cultivable lands, plantation and shrub vegetation, fallow land, barren land, settlements and built-ups, water bodies, and mining area, etc. The geo-database is prepared for LULC feature class with an attributes of name, location, area and spatial distribution, etc. It shows the larger area in beachface land cover (sandy beaches, foredunes, uplands, Teri dunes (laterite) and associated nearshore landforms), plantations, cultivable lands, fallows, and barren lands are converted into built-ups and it increases more than twice in the period of 10 years. Using GIS techniques, the analysis of change detection matrix reveals that the total area of 45.90 km(2) in different LULC features periodically shifted or transformed from one state to another one or more states, i.e. the beachface land cover area of 1.24 km(2) is encroached for built-ups and 0.63 km(2) for placer mining during the decade. Meanwhile, the area of 0.21 km(2) in this cover is transformed into wetlands and saltwater bodies. During the past decade, the expansion of area in the built-ups and settlements are directly proportional to the growth of population, which produces severe threat to the coastal resources. Accuracy assessment of classified images shows the overall accuracy is estimated as 81.16% and 77.52% and overall Kappa coeffient statistical values of 0.83 and 0.76 for the year 2000 and 2011 respectively. Ground truth verification of the extracted LULC features performed using 120 samples (10 samples per class) reveals that the accuracy of classified features is 89%. This indicates the acceptable accuracy of the classified LULC features for landuse and land cover change studies. The geodatabase of LULC features is used as primary source for sustainable land resource management in the coastal region. (C) 2017 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

Spatial data sources, such as, topographical map published by Survey of India, Landsat ETM+ (30 m) image, IKONOS image (0.82 m), SRTM and ASTER DEM datasets have been comprehensively analyzed for extracting coastal landforms. Change detection methods, such as, (i) topographical change detection, (ii) crossshore profile analysis, (iii) Geomorphic Change Detection (GCD) using DEM of Difference (DoD) were adopted for assessment of volumetric changes of coastal landforms for the period between 2000 and 2011. The GCD analysis uses ASTER and SRTM DEM datasets by resampling them into common scale (pixel size) using pixel-by-pixel based Wavelet Transform and Pan-Sharpening techniques in ERDAS Imagine software. Volumetric changes of coastal landforms were validated with data derived from GPS-based field survey. Coastal landform units were mapped based on process of their evolution such as beach landforms including sandy beach, cusp, berm, scarp, beach terrace, upland, rockyshore, cliffs, wave-cut notches and wave-cut platforms; and the fluvial landforms. Comprising of alluvial plain, flood plains, and other shallow marshes in estuaries. The topographical change analysis reveals that the beach landforms have reduced their elevation ranging from 1 to 3 m probably due to sediment removal or flattening. Analysis of cross-shore profiles for twelve locations indicate varying degrees of loss or gain of coastal landforms. For example, the K3-K30 profile across the Kovalam coast has shown significant erosion (-0.26 to -0.76 m) of the sandy beaches resulting in the formation of beach cusps and beach scarps within a distance of 300 m from the shoreline. The volumetric change of sediment load estimated based on DoD model depict a loss of 241.69 m(3)/km(2) for 62.82 km(2) of the area and land gain of 6.96 m(3)/km(2) for 202.80 km(2) of the area during 2000-2011. However, an area of 26.38 km(2) unchanged by maintaining equilibrium in sediment budgeting along the coastal stretch. The study apart from providing insight into the decadal change of coastal settings also supplements a database on the vulnerability of the coast, which would help the coastal managers in future.

Sirinivasa			Impact of sea level rise and coastal slope on shoreline change along the Indian coast	NATURAL HAZARDS												Densely populated coastal zones of India are highly exposed to natural environment. These are impacted by episodic natural events, continuous coastal process, gradually rising sea levels and coexisting human interventions. The present study is an attempt to assess the implication of the sea level rise and coastal slope in the coastal erosion for entire mainland of India. In this regard, two methods were employed to estimate the shoreline change rate (SCR): (1) satellite-derived SCR using the Landsat TM and ETM+ acquired during 1989-2001 and (2) SCR derived by Bruun Rule using the parameters coastal slope and sea level trend derived from satellite altimetry. Satellite-derived SCR has been compared with the shoreline change estimated based on Bruun Rule, revealing a better agreement with each other in terms of trend. Peaks of shoreline retreat calculated using Bruun model and satellite-observed SCR offset by 25-50 km. Offset in these peaks was observed due to net drift towards north in the east coast and south in the west coast of India, revealing the applicability of the Bruun Rule along the Indian coast. The present study demonstrates that coastal slope is an additional parameter responsible for the movement of shoreline along with sea level change. The results of satellite-derived SCR reveal the highest percentage of erosion along West Bengal coast with 70% followed by Kerala (65%), Gujarat (60%) and Odisha (50%). The coastlines of remaining states recorded less than 50% of coasts under erosion. Results of this study are proving critical inputs for the coastal management.																	0921-030X	1573-0840				DEC	2017	89	3					1227	1238		10.1007/s11069-017-3018-9								WOS:000415325500012

Assessment of Sea Water Inundation Along Daboo Creek Area in Indus Delta Region, Pakistan	JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA												Indus Deltaic Region (IDR) in Pakistan is an erosion vulnerable coast due to the high deep water wave energy. Livelihood of millions of people depends on the fisheries and mangrove forests in IDR. IDR consists of many creeks where Daboo is a major creek located at southeast of the largest city of Pakistan, Karachi. Unfortunately, there has been no detailed study to analyze the damages of sea water intrusion at a large temporal and spatial scale. Therefore, this study is designed to estimate the effects of sea water inundation based on changing sea water surface salinity and sea surface temperature (SST). Sea surface salinity and SST data from two different surveys in Daboo creek during 1986 and 2010 are analyzed to estimate the damages and extent of sea water intrusion. Mean salinity has increased 33.33% whereas mean SST decreased 13.79% from 1987 to 2010. Spatio-temporal analysis of creek area using LANDSAT 5 Thematic mapper (TM) data for the years 1987 and 2010 shows significant amount of erosion at macro scale. Creek area has increased approximately 9.93% (260.86 m(2) per year) which is roughly equal to 60 extensive sized shrimp farms. Further Land Use Land Cover (LULC) analyses for years 2001 and 2014 using LANDSAT 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) has indicated 42.3% decrease in cultivated land. Wet mud flats have spread out at the inner mouth of creek with enormous increase of 123.3%. Significant sea water intrusion has increased the area of barren land by 37.9%. This also resulted in overall decrease of 6.7% in area covered by mangroves. Therefore, this study recorded a significant evidence of sea water intrusion in IDR that has caused serious damages to community living in the area, economical losses. Additionally, it has also changed the environment by reducing creek biological productivity as reported by earlier studies over other regions of the world.																	1672-5182	1993-5021				DEC	2017	16	6					1055	1060		10.1007/s11802-017-3350-4								WOS:000414791700014						
J	Wang, CY; Chen, SS; Li, D; Wang, DN; Liu, W; Yang, J				Wang, Chongyang; Chen, Shuisen; Li, Dan; Wang, Danni; Liu, Wei; Yang, Ji			A Landsat-based model for retrieving total suspended solids concentration of estuaries and coasts in China	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT												Retrieving total suspended solids (TSS) concentration accurately is essential for sustainable management of estuaries and coasts, which plays a key role in the interaction between hydrosphere, pedosphere and atmosphere. Although many TSS retrieval models have been published, the general inversion method that is applicable to different field conditions is still under research. In order to obtain a TSS remote sensing model that is suitable for estimating TSS concentrations with wide range in estuaries and coasts by Landsat imagery, after reviewing a number of Landsatbased TSS retrieval models and improving a comparatively better one among them, this study developed a quadratic model using the ratio of logarithmic transformation of red band and near-infrared band and logarithmic transformation of TSS concentration (QRLTSS) based on 119 in situ samples collected in 2006-2013 from five regions of China. It was found that the QRLTSS model works well and shows a satisfactory performance. The QRLTSS model based on Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper), ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) and OLI (Operational Land Imager) sensors explained about 72 % of the TSS concentration variation (TSS: 4.3-577.2 mg L-1, N = 84, P value < 0.001) and had an acceptable validation accuracy (TSS: 4.5-474 mg L-1, root mean squared error (RMSE) < 25 mg L-1, N = 35). In addition, a threshold method of red-band reflectance (OLI: 0.032, ETM+ and TM: 0.031) was proposed to solve the two-valued issue of the QRLTSS model and to retrieve TSS concentration from Landsat imagery. After a 6S model based atmospheric correction of Landsat OLI and ETM + imagery, the TSS concentrations of three regions (Moyangjiang River estuary, Pearl River estuary and Hanjiang River estuary) in Guangdong Province in China were mapped by the QRLTSS model. The results indicated that TSS concentrations in the three estuaries showed large variation ranging from 0.295 to 370.4 mg L-1. Meanwhile we found that TSS concentrations retrieved from Landsat imagery showed good validation accuracies with the synchronous water samples (TS S : 7-160 mg L-1, RMSE: 11.06 mg L-1, N = 22). The further validation from EO-1 Hyperion imagery also showed good performance (in situ synchronous measurement of TSS: 106-220.7 mgL(-1), RMSE: 26.66 mgL(-1), N = 13) of the QRLTSS model for the area of high TSS concentrations in the Lingding Bay of the Pearl River estuary. Evidently, the QRLTSS model is potentially applied to simulate high-dynamic TSS concentrations of other estuaries and coasts by Landsat imagery, improving the understanding of the spatial and temporal variation of TSS concentrations on regional and global scales. Furthermore, the QRLTSS model can be optimized to establish a regional or unified TS S retrieval model of estuaries and coasts in the world for different satellite sensors with medium- and high-resolution similar to Landsat TM, ETM + and OLI sensors or with similar red bands and near-infrared bands, such as ALI, HJ-1 A and B, LISS, CBERS, ASTER, ALOS, RapidEye, Kanopus-V, and GE.																	1991-959X	1991-9603				NOV 30	2017	10	12					4347	4365		10.5194/gmd-10-4347-2017								WOS:000416560600002

Improving geological mapping of the Farasan Islands using remote sensing and ground-truth data	JOURNAL OF MAPS												We integrated satellite imagery (Landsat-8) with ground-truth data to produce a detailed and complete geological map of the Farasan Islands, off the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia at a scale of 1:100,000. This new map improves upon past efforts by expanding the mapped lithologies on the islands into four categories. We used different techniques to enhance this lithological differentiation, including band combination with ratio stretching and supervised classification techniques based on direct field validation. The former was used to distinguish differences in reflectance values across sets of bands to create a classification image from typical reflectance patterns. The geological feature boundaries were constrained by open-source high-resolution satellite imagery (WorldView-2) as well as field observations. The resulting map clearly distinguishes between different geomorphic and geologic features, including lineaments and lithologies. As the Farasan Islands are relatively remote and not easily accessible, with an area of 739 km(2), these imagery-analysis techniques were an effective tool for using remote sensing data to produce new and better mapping products of this important area.																	1744-5647					NOV 15	2017	13	2					900	908		10.1080/17445647.2017.1401492								WOS:000418848000001

Mapping critical areas for migratory songbirds using a fusion of remote sensing and distributional modeling techniques	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Of the 338 species identified as Nearctic-Neotropical migrants occurring in North America, 98.5% have been recorded in Texas. The seasonal migration of these birds is a well-studied natural phenomenon individuals weighing < 15 g will cross in the Gulf of Mexico approximately 965 km non-stop, completing a total distance of 1900-3200 km over the course of 26-80 h. The physiologically demanding nature of this feat makes the Texas coastline crucial to the success of these species. We used a fusion of multi-spectral remote sensing data and distributional modeling techniques to generate and evaluate predictive maps identifying critical areas for migratory passerines on the Texas coast. Imagery acquired from Landsat 8 OLI, maps provided by United States Geological Survey and the Texas Department of Transportation, and migratory bird occurrence records from the eBird citizen-contributed database were used to build predictive distribution models using three algorithms. Using the AUC to compare model performance, the Random Forest produced the most accurate distribution model, followed by MaxEnt, and Support Vector Machine (0.98, 0.81, and 0.79, respectively). We interpreted, from Boosted Regression Tree analysis, that elevation is the single most influential factor in determining migrant occupancy, with vegetative biomass the least influential predictor. Our approach here allows conservation biologists a more sophisticated approach to identifying critical areas for migratory passerines across large spatial extents in a short amount of time.																	1574-9541	1878-0512				NOV	2017	42						55	60		10.1016/j.ecoinf.2017.09.007								WOS:000418985600007						
J	Liu, YL; Wang, X; Ling, F; Xu, S; Wang, CC				Liu, Yaolin; Wang, Xia; Ling, Feng; Xu, Shuna; Wang, Chengcheng			Analysis of Coastline Extraction from Landsat-8 OLI Imagery	WATER												Coastline extraction is a fundamental work for coastal resource management, coastal environmental protection and coastal sustainable development. Due to the free access and long-term record, Landsat series images have the potential to be used for coastline extraction. However, dynamic features of different types of coastlines (e.g., rocky, sandy, artificial), caused by sea level fluctuation from tidal, storm and reclamation, make it difficult to be accurately extracted with coarse spatial resolution, e.g., 30 m, of Landsat images. To access this problem, we analyze the performance of coastline extraction by integrating downscaling, pansharpening and water index approaches in increasing the accuracy of coastline extraction from the latest Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery. In order to prove the availability of the proposed method, we designed three strategies: (1) Strategy 1 uses the traditional water index method to extract coastline directly from original 30 m Landsat-8 OLI multispectral (MS) image; (2) Strategy 2 extracts coastlines from 15 m fused MS images generated by integrating 15 m panchromatic (PAN) band and 30 m MS image with ten pansharpening algorithms; (3) Strategy 3 first downscales the PAN band to a finer spatial resolution (e.g., 7.5 m) band, and then extracts coastlines from pansharpened MS images generated by integrating downscaled spatial resolution PAN band and 30 m MS image with ten pansharpening algorithms. Using the coastline extracted from ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) 5.8 m MS image as reference, accuracies of coastlines extracted from MS images in three strategies were validated visually and quantitatively. The results show that, compared with coastline extracted directly from 30 m Landsat-8 MS image (strategy 1), strategy 3 achieves the best accuracies with optimal mean net shoreline movement (MNSM) of -2.54 m and optimal mean absolute difference (MAD) of 11.26 m, followed by coastlines extracted in strategy 2 with optimal MNSM of -4.23 m and optimal MAD of 13.54 m. Further comparisons with single-band thresholding (Band 6), AWEI, and ISODATA also confirmed the superiority of strategy 3. For the various used pansharpening algorithms, five multiresolution analysis MRA-based pansharpening algorithms are more efficient than the component substitution CS-based pansharpening algorithms for coastline extraction from Landsat-8 OLI imagery. Among the five MRA-based fusion methods, the coastlines extracted from the fused images generated by Indusion, additive a trous wavelet transform (ATWT) and additive wavelet luminance proportional (AWLP) produced the most accurate and visually realistic representation. Therefore, pansharpening approaches can improve the accuracy of coastline extraction from Landsat-8 OLI imagery, and downscaling the PAN band to finer spatial resolution is able to further improve the coastline extraction accuracy, especially in crenulated coasts.					ling, feng/0000-0002-0685-4897												2073-4441					NOV	2017	9	11							816	10.3390/w9110816								WOS:000416798300002

Accurately monitoring the distribution of S. alterniflora is urgent and essential for developing cost-effective control strategies. In this study, we applied the One-Class Classification (OCC) methods of Maximum entropy (Maxent) and Biased Support Vector Machine (BSVM) based on Landsat time-series imagery to detect the species on the middle coast of Jiangsu in east China. We conducted four experimental setups (i.e., single-scene analysis, time-series analysis, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series analysis and a compressed time-series analysis), using OCC methods to recognize the species. Then, we tested the performance of a compressed time-series model for S. alterniflora detection and evaluated the expansibility of this approach when it was applied to a larger region. Our principal findings are as follows: (1) Maxent and BSVM performed equally well, and Maxent appeared to have a more balanced performance over the summer months; (2) the Maxent model with the Default Parameter Set (Maxent-DPS) showed a slightly higher accuracy and more overfitting than Maxent with the Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small samples sizes (AICc)-selected parameter set model, but a t-test found no significant difference between these two settings; (3) April and December were deemed to be important periods for the detection of S. alterniflora; (4) a compressed time-series analysis modelincluding only three variables (December NDVI, March green and the third Principal Component in January, PC3)yielded higher accuracy than single-scene analyses, which indicated that time-series analysis can better detect S. alterniflora than single-scene analyses; and (5) the Maxent model using the reconstructed optimal variables and 70 training samples over a larger region produced encouraging results with an overall accuracy of 90.88% and a Kappa of 0.78. The one-class classification method combined with a phenology-based detection strategy is therefore promising for the application of the long-term detection of S. alterniflora over extended areas.					liu, huiyu/0000-0003-3976-481X												2072-4292					NOV	2017	9	11							1120	10.3390/rs9111120								WOS:000416554100035

Conservation and relative habitat suitability for an arboreal mammal associated with old forest	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Contraction of native old forest can limit occurrence of old forest associated species, especially species with limited vagility. Patterns of size and distribution of remaining patches of old forest along with forest disturbance and what replaces old forest can influence whether species adapt or perish after forest loss. The arboreal red tree vole (Arborimus longicaudus) is a small arvicoline rodent that is associated with old coniferous forest and typically emigrates short distances. Since 1911, old forest (>= 80 years old) in the northern half of the Oregon Coast Range has been reduced by >80%, primarily due to large stand replacing wildfires, timber harvest, and subsequent conversion to young forest (<80 years old). In 2011, the tree vole population in the northern half of the Oregon Coast Range was listed as a candidate species as a distinct population segment under the United States Endangered Species Act, primarily due to habitat loss. We examined the contribution of current and historical (early 20th century) old forest cover, and recent disturbances (1984-2012) on relative habitat suitability for tree voles using light detecting and ranging (LiDAR) data, Landsat imagery, and machine learning. We used a step -wise variable removal procedure to build a parsimonious model and to rank contribution of variables in our final model. We further described the configuration of large patches of old forest using metrics of amount and distance from patch for historical, current, two forest loss scenarios, and two forest restoration scenarios within our study area. Red tree vole relative habitat suitability was positively correlated with current old forest cover at the local scale and negatively correlated with distance from large patches of current old forest. Landscape context, specifically proximity to old forest and absence of recent disturbance contributed most to relative habitat suitability of young forest matrix. If old forest contracted to only reserves on federal lands, amount would decrease from 10.9% to 9.5% and be spatially clumped with an increase in average distance to nearest patch from 3.1 km to 11.1 km. Alternatively, a random addition of patches equivalent to a 1.4% increase in amount, would reduce distance to nearest patch to 1.8 km. Given the history of large historical wildfires in the Oregon Coast Range, restoration of even a small amount of old forest throughout the study area would likely enhance connectivity and resiliency of red tree vole populations in the event of large-scale loss of old forest.																	0378-1127	1872-7042				OCT 15	2017	402						1	11		10.1016/j.foreco.2017.07.004								WOS:000411534000001

Since human activities as well as natural disturbances pose major threats to the coral reefs, these livelihoods may also be at risk. Currently, no comprehensive information on the status and condition of coral reefs in this area is available for this resource management. We determined the changes of coral reef habitat over a period of 20 years from 1994 to 2014 using a satellite Landsat multi-temporal image substantiated with in situ measurement data collected in 2014. The spectral value of coral reefs was extracted from multi-temporal Landsat imagery data, while the diffuse attenuation coefficient of water was obtained by using statistical analysis between the ratio of live coral cover and the spectral value of the visible bands. By using the unsupervised classification integrated with the data ground truth, it is stated that there has been a decline in live coral cover over a period of 20 years from 7716 ha in 1994 to 4236 ha in 2014, with a degradation rate of 174 ha/year. Based on the results, the ratio of the coral cover in the coral reef transects varied from the average of 24% for live corals to 96% for coral rubbles, implying the degraded status of coral reefs in the study area.																	0916-8370	1573-868X				OCT	2017	73	5					623	645		10.1007/s10872-017-0422-4								WOS:000412313300008						
J	Ma, P; Dai, XY; Guo, ZY; Wei, C; Ma, WC				Ma, Pin; Dai, Xiaoyan; Guo, Zhongyang; Wei, Chao; Ma, Weichun			Detection of thermal pollution from power plants on China's eastern coast using remote sensing data	STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT												The acceleration of the industrialization process in China has increased the demand for electricity and triggered a power-plant building boom, especially along China's eastern coast, where the economy gets off early and enjoys a fast development. The thermal plumes, residual chlorine, nuclides and other pollutions produced by the thermal and nuclear power plants have exerted an impact on the coastal eco-environment. To monitor the thermal pollution from the power plants at Yueqing Bay on the eastern coast, in this research, the distribution of sea surface temperature (SST) surrounding the power plants is obtained by using the SST retrieval methods developed for Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), HJ-1B infrared sensor (IRS) and Terra moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The comparison of the SST retrieval results before and after the operation of power plants indicates that the total area of sea waters that is impacted by the thermal discharge from the two power plants at Yueqing Bay is approximately 17.95 km(2), with the highest SST rise of 4.5 A degrees C appearing over the waters around the outlet of the Huaneng Yuhuan power plant on the eastern shore, whereas the highest SST rise around the Zheneng Yueqing power plant on the western shore reaches 3.8 A degrees C. The intensity and scope of influence of the thermal discharge mainly depend on the installed capacity of power plants, coastal terrain, and tide. Although the area where the SST rise is more than 3 A degrees C is not large, thermal discharge still has an impact on bay ecosystems due to the relatively closed nature of the bay environment. Due to the influence of rising water temperatures on the reproduction and individual evolution of fish, shrimp, crabs, shellfish and other aquatic creatures, in the long term, the thermal pollution from coastal power plants will affect the volume of natural fishery and biological resources throughout the waters. The quantitative retrieval results also suggest that relative to MODIS data, Landsat ETM+ and HJ-1B IRS data with a high spatial resolution are more applicable to the estimation of small-scale SST, and IRS data with a high temporal resolution are more helpful in the study of spatio-temporal variability of thermal plumes from coastal power plants.																	1436-3240	1436-3259				OCT	2017	31	8					1957	1975		10.1007/s00477-016-1293-8								WOS:000413233000005

Remote Sensing techniques are the most promising ones to deliver a satisfactory result in this regard. In our study, the objective was to retrieve performance level of certain image processing techniques vigorously used for the purpose to delineate coastline automatically and they were tested against two images acquired almost on the same period by LISS III and LANDSAT ETM+ sensors. The algorithms used in the study are Water Index, NDVI, Complex Band Ratio, ISODATA, Thresholding, ISH Transfirmation techniques. Accuracy of the shoreline detection by classifying the image in land and water has been tried to be estimated in three ways, firstly with comparison to the visually interpreted high resolution google earth image, secondly field collected GCP data of reference points of classes and thirdly the raw image itself. But problem in temporal disparity caused the constraint doing accuracy assessment from the first two reference data and maps along the coast. As a whole although four techniques among six, show satisfactory results namely density slicing, ISODATA classification, Water Index and ISH transformation technique, in the case of LISS-III and ETM+, Water Index (with kappa value being 0.95 for LISS-III and 0.97 for ETM+) and Intensity-Hue-Saturation transformation techniques give better performance. Sensor to sensor variation might have introduced certain differences in shoreline detection in images of same season with similar tidal influence.																	1865-0473	1865-0481				SEP	2017	10	3					321	330		10.1007/s12145-017-0289-3								WOS:000407240900003

Landsat identifies aeolian dust emission dynamics at the landform scale	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The modelling of windblown mineral dust emissions remains a challenge. This is in part due to the coarse spatial and temporal resolution of the data on which these models are based, but also because the processes and mechanisms of aeolian dust emission are not well understood. Satellite imagery has been used extensively in the study of dust from the late 1990s with important contributions being made in terms of sources, transport pathways and deposition areas. Using MODIS imagery, the Namib Desert has been identified as one of the largest sources of dust in southem Africa. The opening of the Landsat archive presents the opportunity to investigate these events at a higher spatial resolution (up to 15 x 15 m) than previously possible. Despite the low temporal resolution, we used Landsat imagery to identify 40 major dust episodes over the last 25 years that originated primarily from the ephemeral river valleys and pan complexes, providing new insight into the spatial and temporal evolution of the dust sources from dryland surfaces. Examination of the imagery enabled the identification of local-scale landform source points to direct ground based testing of the surfaces responsible for dust emission. Emissivity tests were undertaken using a PI-SWERL portable wind tunnel in three of the major dust producing river systems along the Namib coast, namely the Kuiseb, Omaruru and Huab Rivers. Preliminary observations suggest that human impact on the hydrological systems in two of the river basins, to cater for the increasing demand of water, have dramatically altered the emission patterns of dust. The source areas of greatest dust emission are found to be located on recently deposited fluvial surfaces which are not active in the contemporary environment.

Instead of a triple crop scheme like other areas in the Delta, a prawn and rice rotational cultivation scheme was initiated to facilitate agricultural production in Kien Giang. In this paper, the ecosystem services (ES) generated from the agriculture ecosystem under the prawn and rice rotational crops (PRRC) were assessed using an integrated approach. The specific ES identified here include water and nutrition regulation in the soil together with climate regulation in favor of the cultivated crops. A multi-disciplinary approach including remote sensing, GIS, social surveys and statistical analysis was adopted to comprehensively evaluate the geographical, biophysical, economic and social aspects of the ES. Firstly, Landsat 8 images were processed with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NVDI) and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) to identify the areas cultivating PRRC. The accuracy of image classification was assessed by ground truthing and we found an 80% coincidence between the simulated results and the field observations. Then, the social survey was conducted using face to face interviews at 50 local households to collect data related to farming practices. Economic values of ecosystem services were obtained using the revised market methods by annual crop yields per unit area. The mean estimated value of ES provided through the PRRC was 1300 USD/ha/year (standard deviation of 600 USD/ha/year) which accounted for 38.1% and 59.4% of the averaged economic revenue and net benefit, respectively. The analysis of social survey data revealed the factors having the greatest effects on ecosystem services values were selling prices of prawn and farming experiences. Finally, results were synthesized with GIS to describe how ES values vary across the research area which facilitates effective communication of the importance of ES concepts to policy makers regarding land use planning and natural resources management decisions.

Recurring Emergence of the Mud Islands on Shelf of the Arabian Sea along the Makran Coast of Pakistan - Historical Perspective using Remote Sensing Techniques	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA												Recurring emergences of mud islands on shelf of the Arabian Sea, along the Makran coast of Pakistan are now known to be submarine mud volcanoes. They are expressions of enhanced extrusions of fluidized mud and gases coupled with compressional tectonics in convergent margin settings. Since 1945 the Malan island has emerged four times, and some other mud islands have also been emerging repeatedly, at their own positions. The first known emergence, during November 1945, was concurrent with an earthquake of magnitude 8.0 (M8.0), the 2nd and 3rd emergences, in March 1999 and November 2010 respectively, were not related apparently with earthquakes. The 4th emergence concurred with the Awaran earthquake (M7.7) of 24th September 2013. Landsat images of March 1999 and November 2010 emergences indicate appearance of round-shaped island of 4.4 and 5.2 hectare area, followed by erosion and disappearance. The island was composed of mud breccias and circular vents spewing mud slurry and methane gas. The emergence of Malan island, in March 1999 and November 2010 was compared with earthquake data before and after the emergences. The earthquakes data, two years before March 1999 and November 2010 emergences and two years afterwards, shows correlation with both small and large earthquakes, prior to the emergence, in the radius of over 400 km. It is proposed that mud islands develop in response to the episodes of enhanced mud extrusion, which inturn are related with the enhanced compressional and/or seismic events. These events are followed by periods of relative quiescence characterized by normal activity of mud extrusion and marine erosion.																	0016-7622	0974-6889				AUG	2017	90	2					201	208		10.1007/s12594-017-0700-1								WOS:000408991300011

This work analysed specific environmental characteristics, such as spits, sabkhas and wadis. Assessments used Landsat imagery to examine coastal change between 1973 and 2011. The cumulative temporal change identified regression trends given by coefficients of determination that explained a significant percentage of data variation for Jizan (R-2 = 69%) and Turfah (R-2 = 72%), while Ash Shuqayq was insignificant ( R-2 = 14%). Inter-survey results predicted future change, although trends were not significant, i.e. Jizan (R-2 = 22%), Turfah (R-2 = 14%) and Ash Shuqayq (R-2 = 3 and 61% with outlying value removed). Aerial photos showed regional coastal changes, which included a maximum accretion of 36.4 m and maximum erosion of 12.9 m. These are scientifically effective techniques to monitor regional coastal change, i.e. erosion and accretion and identified rates of 0.59, 1.80 and 3.53 myr(-1) for Ash Shuqayq, Turfah and Jizan.

J	Duru, U				Duru, Umit			Shoreline change assessment using multi-temporal satellite images: a case study of Lake Sapanca, NW Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The research summarized here determines historical shoreline changes along Lake Sapanca by using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Six multi-temporal satellite images of Landsat Multispectral Scanner (L1-5 MMS), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (L7 ETM+), and Operational Land Imager Sensors (L8 OLI), covering the period between 17 June 1975 and 15 July 2016, were used to monitor shoreline positions and estimate change rates along the coastal zone. After pre-possessing routines, the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), and supervised classification techniques were utilized to extract six different shorelines. Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), a toolbox that enables transect-based computations of shoreline displacement, was used to compute historical shoreline change rates. The average rate of shoreline change for the entire cost was 2.7 m/year of progradation with an uncertainty of 0.2 m/year. While the great part of the lake shoreline remained stable, the study concluded that the easterly and westerly coasts and deltaic coasts are more vulnerable to shoreline displacements over the last four decades. The study also reveals that anthropogenic activities, more specifically over extraction of freshwater from the lake, cyclic variation in rainfall, and deposition of sediment transported by the surrounding creeks dominantly control spatiotemporal shoreline changes in the region. Monitoring shoreline changes using multi-temporal satellite images is a significant component for the coastal decision-making and management.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				AUG	2017	189	8								10.1007/s10661-017-6112-2								WOS:000405440300028	28688069					
J	Potter, C				Potter, Christopher			Fire-climate history and landscape patterns of high burn severity areas on the California southern and central coast	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												There is mounting evidence that fire size and severity have been growing on the central and southern California coastal landscape over the past several decades. Landsat satellite data was analyzed for the 20 largest fires on the Central California coast since 1984 to determine the relationships between climate/weather conditions at the time of ignition and the size of high burn severity (HBS) areas. The study also examined the relationship between area burned and landscape patterns of HBS coverage, including patch size, edge complexity, perimeter-to-area ratio, and aggregation metrics. Results showed that climate conditions at the time of ignitions have been significant controllers of the total area of HBS and the complexity of HBS patches on the fire landscape. As maximum air temperatures for the month of ignition approached 40(o) C, the percentage of HBS to total area burned frequently exceeded 20%. The percentage of HBS to total area burned also exceed 20% when the precipitation total recorded during the previous 12 months was less than 25% of the annual average precipitation. Landscape analysis results showed that, as the total area burned in fires on the Central California coast grows, the edge lengths and areas of HBS patches also grows at a rapid rate. At the same time, the perimeter-to-area ratio of HBS patches decreases gradually and the HBS patches become more aggregated as total burned area grows.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				JUN	2017	21	3					393	404		10.1007/s11852-017-0519-3								WOS:000404531100008

Alexis			Post-Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Monitoring of Louisiana Salt Marshes Using Landsat Imagery	REMOTE SENSING												The Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the second largest marine oil spill in history, contaminated over a thousand kilometers of coastline in the Louisiana salt marshes and seriously threatened this valuable ecosystem. Measuring the impacts of the oil spill over the large and complex coast calls for the application of remote sensing techniques. This study develops a method for post-Deepwater Horizon oil spill monitoring of the damaged marsh vegetation using Landsat imagery. This study utilizes 10 years of Landsat data, from 2005 to 2014, to examine the longevity of the oil spill's impacts on the marsh vegetation. AVIRIS data collected between 2010 and 2012 are used to validate the Landsat results. Landsat imagery documents the significant effect of oiling on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of the marsh vegetation in 2010 and 2011 (p < 0.01 in both cases). These results are corroborated by the AVIRIS data, which recorded the most severe impact in May 2011 followed by progressive recovery in October 2011 and October 2012. The Landsat imagery, combined with relevant environmental information and appropriate statistical tools, provides a robust and low-cost method for long-term post-oil spill monitoring of the marshes, revealing that the major aboveground impacts (at 30 m scale) of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on Louisiana salt marshes lasted for two years. The method presented is applicable for other hazardous events whenever pre-event referencing and long-term post-event monitoring are desired, thereby offering an effective and economical tool for disaster management.																	2072-4292					JUN	2017	9	6							547	10.3390/rs9060547								WOS:000404623900038						
J	Wang, XY; Wu, FX; Zhu, Q; Huang, SL				Wang, Xianyan; Wu, Fuxing; Zhu, Qian; Huang, Shiang-Lin			Long-term changes in the distribution and core habitat use of a coastal delphinid in response to anthropogenic coastal alterations	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												The influence of anthropogenic habitat loss on animal distribution and core habitat use can be particularly strong in animals with narrow habitat selectivity, such as the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis), a delphinid species that specifically inhabits coastal and estuarine waters. This study measured the extent of habitat loss in the waters around Xiamen City, China, where intense environmental changes and coast utilization have occurred in the past 40years. The extent of occurrence and the core habitat of the humpback dolphin were measured based on sighting records from censuses conducted in different years. A Landsat image series revealed a permanent 119.95km(2) loss of coastal waters to land reclamation, coastal modification and harbour construction from 1973 to 2013. The distribution of the humpback dolphin showed a significant shift from inshore to offshore waters and away from artificial shorelines. Though the extent of occurrence appears to change minimally, a significant shift in the core habitat from the original coastal habitats into mid-channel waters was observed in the eastern Xiamen Bay. These results imply multiple consequences of anthropogenic coastal alterations for the humpback dolphin: the elimination of vital habitats, changes in habitat use preferences, and the partitioning of the social structure of the population. The need to adjust current protected area designations along with adequate measures to restore habitat quality and population connectivity, both locally and regionally, are considered.																	1052-7613	1099-0755				JUN	2017	27	3					643	652		10.1002/aqc.2720								WOS:000404372400007						
J	Kang, YY; Ding, XR; Xu, F; Zhang, CK; Ge, XP				Kang, Yanyan; Ding, Xianrong; Xu, Fan; Zhang, Changkuan; Ge, Xiaoping			Topographic mapping on large-scale tidal flats with an iterative approach on the waterline method	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Tidal flats, which are both a natural ecosystem and a type of landscape, are of significant importance to ecosystem function and land resource potential. Morphologic monitoring of tidal flats has become increasingly important with respect to achieving sustainable development targets. Remote sensing is an established technique for the measurement of topography over tidal flats; of the available methods, the waterline method is particularly effective for constructing a digital elevation model (DEM) of intertidal areas. However, application of the waterline method is more limited in large-scale, shifting tidal flats areas, where the tides are not synchronized and the waterline is not a quasi-contour line. For this study, a topographical map of the intertidal regions within the Radial Sand Ridges (RSR) along the Jiangsu Coast, China, was generated using an iterative approach on the waterline method. A series of 21 multi-temporal satellite images (18 HJ-1A/B CCD and three Landsat TM/OLI) of the RSR area collected at different water levels within a five month period (31 December 2013-28 May 2014) was used to extract waterlines based on feature extraction techniques and artificial further modification. These 'remotely-sensed waterlines' were combined with the corresponding water levels from the 'model waterlines' simulated by a hydrodynamic model with an initial generalized DEM of exposed tidal flats. Based on the 21 heighted 'remotely-sensed waterlines', a DEM was constructed using the ANUDEM interpolation method. Using this new DEM as the input data, it was re-entered into the hydrodynamic model, and a new round of water level assignment of waterlines was performed. A third and final output DEM was generated covering an area of approximately 1900 km(2) of tidal flats in the RSR. The water level simulation accuracy of the hydrodynamic model was within 0.15 m based on five real-time tide stations, and the height accuracy (root mean square error) of the final DEM was 0.182 m based on six transects of measured data. This study aimed at construction of an accurate DEM for a large-scale, high-variable zone within a short timespan based on an iterative way of the waterline method. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This study extracted coastlines of Qinghai Lake and surrounding lakes in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau from multitemporal remote sensing data from 1973 to 2015. The geomorphological processes and the reasons for area and coastline variations were then analyzed. The results showed that: the changes of the total lake area were divided into three stages: the stable decrease stage (1973-1988), the fluctuant decrease stage (1988-2005), and the rapidly increase stage (2005-2015). The changes of Qinghai Lake area and Gahai Lake area showed a similar trend as the total lake area. The Erhai Lake area fluctuated from 1973 to 2004 and then increased from 2004 to 2015. Haiyanwan Lake was isolated from Qinghai Lake in 2003 and was linked into Qinghai Lake in 2006, again. The lakes area variations, excluding Erhai Lake and Shadao Lake, were positively correlated with the variation of the Qinghai Lake level, and estuary area variations were significantly negatively correlated to the lake level, indicating that the higher lake level led to more land being submerged. The evolutionary processes of lakes in the Shadao Region were influenced by aeolian sand and lake water balance experiencing relatively low precipitation and strong evaporation. Erhai Lake was also influenced by river runoff from Daotang River. Sediment loads from rivers flowing into Qinghai Lake, except for Buha River, were relative low and only slightly influenced the estuary. Aeolian sand transported by the lake waves and currents from west coast to east coast will form subaqueous barriers, the Shadao Region land area will increase slowly, and the coastline of the Shadao Region will extend towards the lake. Therefore, the diameter of Qinghai Lake from the west to east coast will become shorter, while the diameter from the south to north coast will become longer in future. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Ozturk, D				Ozturk, Derya			MODELLING SPATIAL CHANGES IN COASTAL AREAS OF SAMSUN (TURKEY) USING A CELLULAR AUTOMATA-MARKOV CHAIN METHOD	TEHNICKI VJESNIK-TECHNICAL GAZETTE												The evolution of cities over a specific time period and the determination of relevant trends are important to simulate for the proper development and planning of a city. In particular, coastal areas experience intense pressure from developers with respect to settlements, tourism, trade and industry, and built-up areas are being observed near coasts. The inability to direct development and control growth is destroying natural resources in coastal areas at a rapid pace. Thus, determining these trends is the key component for ensuring the protection of natural resources and planned growth. Because a complete estimation of urban expansion is not possible, likely changes can be determined using simulations. In this study, a 30-year urban expansion simulation (2004-2034) was obtained using land use/land cover (LU/LC) data for 1987 and 2004 at Samsun (Turkey) coastal areas and using the Cellular Automata-Markov Chain (CA-Markov) method. To verify the method, urban expansion simulation for the year 2014 was compared with real LU/LC data for the same year, and the kappa value was found to be 0,82. To determine LU/LC, Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI satellite images were used, and the analyses were realised in a geographic information system (GIS) environment. As a result of the study, the CA-Markov Chain approach integrated with GIS and remote sensing was shown to be effective in the study of urban growth dynamics. Using the simulation for the year 2034, probable urban expansion in the 20142034 period was estimated as approximately 3683 ha and the probable destructions of absolute agricultural lands, forests and pastures were predicted as approximately 968 ha, 228 ha and 24 ha, respectively.																	1330-3651	1848-6339				MAY	2017	24			1			99	107		10.17559/TV-20141110125014								WOS:000401236500014

The results indicated that the metal flux had been increasing since the 1980s. Enrichment factor values (Pb, Zn and Cu) suggested only slight enrichment. The proportion of anthropogenic Pb changed from 9% to 15% during 2000-2014. Coal combustion might be an important contamination source in the Dongshan Bay. The historical variation in the metal flux reflected the economic development and urbanization in the Zhangjiang drainage area in the past 30 years. According to the Landsat satellite remote sensing data, the urbanization area expanded approximately three times from 1995 to 2010. The delta C-13 values (-21%o to 23%o) of the organic matter (OM) in the sediments indicated that the OM was primarily sourced from aquatic, terrigenous and marsh C-3 plants. Nitrogen was mainly derived from aquatic plants and terrigenous erosion before the 1980s. However, the total organic carbon (TOC) contents, total nitrogen (TN) contents and delta N-15 had been increasing since the 1980s, which suggested that the sources of nitrogen were soil erosion, fertilizer and sewage. In addition, the TOC and TN fluxes in the Dongshan Bay had significantly increased since the 1980s, which reflected the use of N fertilizer. However, the TOC and TN fluxes significantly decreased in the past decade because environmental awareness increased and environmental protection policies were implemented. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Quader, MA; Agrawal, S; Kervyn, M				Quader, Mohammad Abdul; Agrawal, Shefali; Kervyn, Matthieu			Multi-decadal land cover evolution in the Sundarban, the largest mangrove forest in the world	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Having one of the most vulnerable coasts of the world to climate change, Bangladesh and India are facing new challenges to protect Sundarban, the largest mangrove in the world, from adverse impacts of climate-driven changes. In this study, unsupervised classification of mangrove density is performed on Landsat images of folk time periods over 35 years (1975-77, 1989, 2000 and 2010) to identify the spatiotemporal evolution of the Sundarban mangrove, and infer the causes of observed changes. Specifically the influences of environmental and anthropogenic drivers on these changes are discriminated by correlating the observed change patterns with cyclones' tracks, erosion processes and areas of expected human influences as assessed by local stakeholders. Results highlight a very dynamic systerh, with rapid changes characterized by decreasing mangrove density, mainly in India, erosion and accretion. There is similar to 1.2% (or 11,500 ha) net erosion in 35 years in Sundarban, which remains limited relative to the documented high rate of sea level rise of 6 mm/yr. Mangrove density changes are attributed to cyclones, increased salinity and anthropogenic influences. Based on interpretation of the spatial pattern of density changes by local stakeholders, we conclude that the zones accessible to human activities are significantly more affected by land cover changes. Management policies of Sundarban by Bangladeshi and Indian authorities should acknowledge the important role played by natural or global drivers like sea level change, cyclones in affecting the mangrove as well as manage the localized anthropogenic pressures.

J	Yan, JF; Su, FZ; Wang, MH				Yan, Jinfeng; Su, Fenzhen; Wang, Menghan			The development processes and regional differentiation of both banks of the Strait of Malacca during 1980-2010	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												As one of the international waterways connecting the Indian and Pacific Oceans, the Strait of Malacca has different degrees of influence on the surrounding coastal development and construction. In this study, the Landsat MSS/TM images during four periods (1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010) were selected in order to extract the coastlines of both banks of the Strait of Malacca, as well as the development and utilization intensity information on the landward side within a 20 km area, for the purpose of conducting research regarding the development processes and regional differentiation of both of the banks. The results revealed that during the past 30 years, due to the construction of the coastal cities and the river diversion and sediment accumulation, the Malaysian west coast has been extended by 4.8%. In the study area on the eastern coast of Sumatra, the coastline has been extended by 2.96%. Furthermore, after 30 years of land development processes, the urban construction land areas have respectively expanded by 2.3 times and 3.5 times on the Malaysian western coast and the Sumatra eastern coast. In regards to the agricultural land, the areas with moderate development intensity and above (>0.5) were respectively expanded from 36.37% to 54.96% and 22.02%-44.56% on the western coast of Malaysia and eastern coast of Sumatra. Up until 2010, the urban construction land areas of Singapore accounted for 61.66%, and 58.2% of the areas were high-intensity development zones (>0.6). The differences between each of these are obvious. The regional differentiation in the coastal development degree of the Strait of Malacca was found to be closely related to port construction, channel distances, economic policies, infrastructure, and security. The development and construction degrees were different on each of the banks, which also produced certain effects on the stability of the strait (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

These disasters caused changes in the land use and land cover (LULC) in Japan's Tohoku district. While the LULC map created before the disaster is available, as yet there is no precise LULC map of the district after the disaster. In this study, we created a precise LULC map for the years 2013-2015 post-disaster with 30-m spatial resolution using the Landsat-8 with the Operational Land Imager (OLI) to evaluate the changes in LULC induced by the disaster. Our results indicate many changes in areas categorized as rice paddies primarily into grass categories along the coast damaged by the tsunami and in the evacuation zone around the FDNPP. Since there is a possibility of future LULC changes according to the change of the evacuation zone and implementation of reconstruction and revitalization efforts, we recommend continual monitoring of the changes in LULC by the use of satellite data in order to evaluate the long-term effects of the disaster.																	2045-2322					MAR 31	2017	7								45769	10.1038/srep45769								WOS:000397883500002	28361911

The port construction, land reclamation, urban development and silt deposition in the Ningbo coastal zone have resulted in extensive coastline change. In this study, the spatio-temporal change of the Ningbo coastlines during 1976-2015 was detected and analysed using Landsat time-series images from different sensors, including Multispectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Operational Land Imager (OLI). Fourteen individual scenes (covering seven phases) of cloud-free Landsat images within the required tidal range of +/- 63 cm were collected. The ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) image of 2015 was used to extract the reference coastline for the accuracy assessment. The normalised difference water index (NDWI) and the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) were applied to discriminate surface water and land features, respectively. The on-screen digitising approach was then used to further refine the extracted time-series coastlines in the period from 1976 to 2015. Six relevant indices, length, length change, annual length change, fractal dimension (FD), average net shoreline movement (NSM) and average annual NSM, were calculated to analyse and explore the spatio-temporal change features of Ningbo coastlines. Results show that the length of the Ningbo coastlines increased from 910 km to 986 km, and the value of FD increased from 1.09 to 1.12, and the coastline morphology changed from sinuous to straight. The average NSM increased from 187 m to 298 m and the average annual NSM reached 85 m/year, indicating the advance of coastlines towards the sea at a high level. The spatio-temporal change patterns also varied in different areas. In Hangzhou Bay, significant advancement along the coastlines was experienced since 2001 mainly because of urban construction and land reclamation. In Xiangshan Bay, the forces of nature played a major role in coastline dynamics before 2008, whilst port construction, urban construction and island link projections moved the coastlines towards the sea. The coastline changes of Sanmen Bay were affected by the interaction of nature and human activities. All these observations indicate that forces of nature and human activities were the two important influential factors for the observed coastline change. In this case, the coastline complexity variation was considered responsible for various coastline patterns change of the Ningbo coast. In addition, erosion and accretion occurred in turn because of forces of nature and human activities, such as urban development and agricultural exploitation.				ling, feng/E-4811-2013	ling, feng/0000-0002-0685-4897												2220-9964					MAR	2017	6	3							68	10.3390/ijgi6030068								WOS:000398732200011

Y.; Keith, Mark			Distribution of a Coastal Delphinid Under the Impact of Long-Term Habitat Loss: Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins off Taiwan's West Coast	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												For the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, Sousa chinensis, an obligatory shallow water inshore species, the degradation of coastal habitats can have major consequences for population persistence and distribution. Off Taiwan's west coast (TWC), these animals are predominantly seen in two areas separated by a stretch of coast with only sporadic sightings, suggesting that either (a) only two sectors of TWC offer sufficiently suitable habitat for the dolphins or (b) a recent environmental change limits the population connectivity. We measured the extent of habitat destruction due to land reclamation off TWC since 1972 using a habitat integrity index (HII) and applied general linear models (GLMs) to compare HII with sightings of dolphins per unit effort (SPUE). While early Landsat data reveal extensive continuity and diversity of coastal habitats, by 2013, a total area of over 222 km(2) was lost to land reclamation (23 % of dolphin habitat and 40 % of dolphin foraging habitat). GLM analysis showed a significant relationship between HII and SPUE; the lower HII the lower SPUE, indicating that off TWC, the current discontinuous distribution of humpback dolphins is likely due to a different extent of habitat degradation rather than natural patchiness of their environment. We emphasize that the history of coastal habitat alteration must be considered when interpreting cetacean distribution from survey data and formulating habitat management decisions, especially in areas experiencing extensive anthropogenic coastal change.																	1559-2723	1559-2731				MAR	2017	40	2					594	603		10.1007/s12237-016-0146-5								WOS:000398099100022

Utilizing Landsat-8 data in mapping of sabkha, mangroves, and land covers in Jizan coastal plain, southwestern Saudi Arabia	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Digital image processing methods were applied on Landsat-8 data to differentiate different natural land covers and urban areas in Jizan, Red Sea Coast, Saudi Arabia. The computer-aided works were combined with field investigation to confirm the achieved results. The false-color image with bands 5, 4, and 3 in RGB, respectively, was found useful in delineating between sabkha and non-sabkha areas. The sabkha areas are characterized by hues of light brown color, and the non-sabkha areas have hues of light grey to light bluish color. A false-color image with bands 5, 6, and 4 clearly differentiates between mangroves in hues of red color and other vegetation in hues of orange color. The principal component analysis (PCA) image clearly shows the wadi drainage and estuary in several shades of green color; the coastal sabkha areas have hues of blue, which range from light blue (denoting dry sabkha) to dark blue (denoting wet sabkha), and sand dunes are shown in fuchsia color. The results of this study identify features such as urban populated areas, land vegetation, moisture intensity in the sediments, shallow and deep waters, reef islands, sabkha and non-sabkha areas, salt dome, shores, tidal flats, wadi drainage, mangrove habitat, the width of shallow seawater, and land-seawater contacts. Several maps are produced in this study showing the distribution of the abovementioned features. These maps will be useful as a base reference for further studies by geologists, engineering geologists, hydrogeologists, and governmental decision leaders.

Monitoring of wetland inundation dynamics in the Delmarva Peninsula using Landsat time-series imagery from 1985 to 2011	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Wetlands provide important ecosystem services, the provision of which is largely controlled by fluctuations in inundation and soil saturation. Inundation is highly dynamic and can vary substantially through time in response to multiple drivers, including precipitation and evapotranspiration. This research focused on developing a practical and effective framework for regional, long-term monitoring of wetland inundation dynamics using airborne LiDAR intensity data (Lang et al., 2013) and Landsat time-series imagery. Subpixel water fraction (SWF) maps indicating the percent of surface water within each 30-m pixel were generated on an annual basis over the entire Delmarva Peninsula on the East Coast of the United States from 1985 to 2011. Comprehensive accuracy assessments of the SWF maps were conducted using historical high-resolution aerial photography to determine the reference condition. The assessment resulted in an estimated root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.78% for the sample of open water areas (mean SWF was similar to 40% for this region of the map). Moreover, a separate accuracy assessment targeting inundation in wetlands (i.e. presence or absence of water) yielded an overall accuracy of 93%. Accuracies derived indicated that Landsat data can be calibrated to accurately extract long-term water information at the regional scale. Characteristics of inundation were examined with respect to different wetland types defined by water regime and dominant vegetation types, as well as different physical drivers. Results showed that tidal wetlands typically exhibited more intensive inundation than nontidal wetlands, and a higher degree of inundation was associated with emergent wetlands compared to wetland areas dominated by woody vegetation. Analysis of change drivers revealed that tide exerted a statistically significant influence on coastal inundation with r(2) values of 32-36% and p < 0.01, whereas inundation changes in inland wetland areas were in part driven by precipitation with r(2) values of 25-34% and p < 0.08. Because an up-to-date archive of Landsat imagery is globally available and LiDAR data are becoming increasingly more affordable, the developed framework can be easily implemented to generate a continuous inundation record in many regions of the globe to assist in ongoing and future studies focused on wetland hydrology and wetland management.

Coastal morphodynamics of Tupilipalem Coast, Andhra Pradesh, southeast coast of India	CURRENT SCIENCE												Coastal zones are dynamic interfaces of land and water of high ecological diversity and critical economic importance. The boundaries, shape and size of this coast change constantly under the influence of both natural and anthropogenic factors. The study area, Tupilipalem is one of the proposal sites for constructing a major port, to be named Dugarajapatnam Port, along the east coast of Andhra Pradesh, India. We have used multitemporal satellite images of IRS P6 LISS-III and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS data from 2011 to 2015 to delineate changes in Tupilipalem coast. The subsequent short-term lagoon mouth closure and the long-term coastal erosion and accretion rates have been calculated for the periods between 2011 and 2015. Low river inflow, wind, tides, the movement of the waves and littoral currents play a key role in the closure of the lagoon mouth and also for the dynamic activities of erosion and accretion. Moreover, the impact on socio-economy and ecology of the study area during the lagoon mouth closure period has been studied.																	0011-3891					FEB 25	2017	112	4					823	829										WOS:000398128400036

Green tides first appeared near the Jiangsu Province on May 14 before increasing in size and number and moving northward to the Shandong Peninsula in mid-June. Typhoon Cham-hom passed through the Yellow Sea on July 12, significantly decreasing the algal population. An algae patch moved east toward Korea and on June 18 and July 4, several masses were found between the southwestern shores of Korea and Jeju Island. The floating masses found in Korean waters were concentrated at the boundary of the open sea and the Jindo cold pool, a phenomenon also observed at the boundary of coastal and offshore waters in China. Sea surface temperatures, derived from NOAA SST data, were found to play a role in generation of the green tides.																	1225-6161	2287-9307				FEB	2017	33	1					97	109		10.7780/kjrs.2017.33.1.10								WOS:000408873800010

Field surveys were used to assess and complement to the results of the remote sensing (RS)-based analysis. The RS-based biodiversity hotspot (BH) identification process was accomplished in three steps. The lands with native vegetation cover, including the national natural reserve lands, were first selected as the baseline BHs (BBHs). Then, after assigning resistance coefficients to each land use, the least accumulative cost (LAC) of the BBHs was calculated by distance analysis, while the normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) from the Landsat Thematic Mapper was reclassified into 20 grades based on the Euclidean distance to the main anthropogenic sources. Finally, the RS-based BH identification was realized through the logistic calculation of LAC less than a series of thresholds and NDVI more than 10. While the field survey-based BH identification was through the logistic calculation between HM potential ecological risks of low to moderate and BHs acquired by NDVI-based integrated assessments. The results proved that RS-based analysis could be an important surrogate for necessary field surveys to manage BHs along coasts.

J	Betzabeth, PJE; de los Angeles, LCM				Betzabeth, Palafox-Juarez E.; Maria de Los Angeles, Liceaga-Correa			Spatial diversity of a coastal seascape: Characterization, analysis and application for conservation	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Recent conservation approaches have focused on the landscape as either a conservation target or a mechanism by which conservation can be achieved. A seascape is a spatially heterogeneous surface that is generally represented as a mosaic of patches (homogeneous units of natural vegetation) with spatial and functional relationships that are organized as puzzle pieces, which represent one or several ecosystems. Spatial analysis using a landscape ecology approach offers a wide range of tools to study, monitor, manage, and conserve these areas. The objective of this study was to identify the benthic community and spatially characterize the submarine habitats of the shallow coast along the Yucatan, Mexico, to identify priority conservation areas. The study area was divided into 3 zones based on their environmental qualities, and a total of 290 sampling sites were defined from a stratified random sample based on the unsupervised classification of Landsat ETM + images. For each site, a video was taken; the substrate type was identified; and the organisms present were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level. Training groups were defined by ordination analysis for the supervised classification of spectral bands and bathymetric modeling to obtain maps of the seascape, and the composition and configuration of the seascape were analyzed using spatial diversity metrics and indices. A total of 40 benthic morphotypes, predominantly brown algae and seagrass, were identified. Seven habitat types were defined along the coast based on the arrangement and spatial organization of the benthic community: bare substrate (A), sand with seagrass (B), seagrass meadow (C), seagrass with macroalgae (D), macroalgae on sand (E), flagstone with macroalgae (F), and macroalgal forest (G). The spatial configuration of the coastal seascape reflected the geomorphological characteristics of the study area and was significantly different among the three zones. Habitats G and F were present everywhere along the coast and dominated the seascape, whereas habitat C only occurred in Zone 3. Due to their structural complexity and biological richness, habitats C, D, F, and G are potentially critical for turtle, grouper, octopus, and lobster species, so these habitats are suggested as priority conservation areas to promote the conservation of these species as well as the productivity and functionality of these ecosystems.

J	Pu, R; Bell, S				Pu, Ruiliang; Bell, Susan			Mapping seagrass coverage and spatial patterns with high spatial resolution IKONOS imagery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Seagrass habitats in subtidal coastal waters provide a variety of ecosystem functions and services and there is an increasing need to acquire information on spatial and temporal dynamics of this resource. Here, we explored the capability of IKONOS (IKO) data of high resolution (4m) for mapping seagrass cover [submerged aquatic vegetation (%SAV) cover] along the mid-western coast of Florida, USA. We also compared seagrass maps produced with IKO data with that obtained using the Landsat TM sensor with lower resolution (30m). Both IKO and TM data, collected in October 2009, were preprocessed to calculate water depth invariant bands to normalize the effect of varying depth on bottom spectra recorded by the two satellite sensors and further the textural information was extracted from IKO data. Our results demonstrate that the high resolution IKO sensor produced a higher accuracy than the TM sensor in a three-class % SAV cover classification. Of note is that the OA of %SAV cover mapping at our study area created with IKO data was 5-20% higher than that from other studies published. We also examined the spatial distribution of seagrass over a spatial range of 4-240 m using the Ripley's K function [L(d)] and IKO data that represented four different grain sizes [4 m (one IKO pixel), 8 m (2 x 2 IKO pixels), 12 m (3 x 3 IKO pixels), and 16 m (4 x 4 IKO pixels)] from moderate-dense seagrass cover along a set of six transects. The Ripley's K metric repeatedly indicated that seagrass cover representing 4m x 4m pixels displayed a dispersed (or slightly dispersed) pattern over distances of <4-8 m, and a random or slightly clustered pattern of cover over 9-240m. The spatial pattern of seagrass cover created with the three additional grain sizes (i.e., 2 x 24m IKO pixels, 3 x 34m IKO pixels, and 4 x 4m IKO pixels) show a dispersed (or slightly dispersed) pattern across 4-32 m and a random or slightly clustered pattern across 33-240m. Given the first report on using satellite observations to quantify seagrass spatial patterns at a spatial scale from 4m to 240m, our novel analyses of moderate-dense SAV cover utilizing Ripley's K function illustrate how data obtained from the IKO sensor revealed seagrass spatial information that would be undetected by the TM sensor with a 30 m pixel size. Use of the seagrass classification scheme here, along with data from the IKO sensor with enhanced resolution, offers an opportunity to synoptically record seagrass cover dynamics at both small and large spatial scales.(C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We calculated the changes in glacier area between 1975 and 2015 and the number of glacial lakes between 1985 and 2015 using Landsat images. Glacier shrinkage in our study region was most likely to have caused the expansion of numerous glacial lakes in recent decades. In contrast to observed glacier fluctuations in the western cordilleras of the tropical Andes, continuous glacier shrinkage was observed in the eastern cordilleras of Peru and Bolivia. The estimated glacier mean area loss between 1975 and 2015 in the Cordillera Apolobamba and the Cordillera Carabaya was about 51% and 79%, respectively. Glaciers situated below 5000 m a.s.l. nearly disappeared (93% and 95.5% in the cordilleras Apolobamba and Carabaya, respectively) during this period, but glaciers above 5500 m a.s.l. were relatively stable (13.5% and 31% in Apolobamba and Carabaya, respectively). Further on, glacier area loss by aspect revealed that glaciers oriented towards the Amazon Basin were retreating faster (74.5% and 86%, respectively) than those oriented towards the Pacific coast (40% and 68%, respectively). We observed the formation of 206 new glacial lakes between 1985 and 2015 in these two mountain ranges with an increase in the total area of 3.8 km(2), which is a significant growth in just 30 yr.

Several activities on mangrove restoration have been conducted to escalate this remnant mangrove forest area. Conversely, rapid increase of shrimp pond area become threat for mangrove ecosystem in Bogowonto lagoon since the early of 21st century. Hence, This study is aimed to investigate mangrove composition, distribution and abundance, progress of mangrove restoration program and shrimp pond extensification in 2002 to 2014. Conducted from April 2015 to May 2015, this research consists of several steps namely survey, vegetation analysis, literature study, sociological study using questionnaire, measurement of mangrove and shrimp pond area using Landsat 8 imageries and Arc GIS 10.1. We determined 15 sites along Bogowonto Lagoon using random sampling by quadratic plot (10 m x 10 m for tree, 5 m x 5 m for sapling) and total counts (for seedling). The result showed that there were seven species of mangrove and six species of associate mangrove. Rhizopora mucronata Lamb. was dominant in each growthform with clumped distribution. R. mucronata and Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh. also dominate from backswamp to rivermouth. Satellite imageries revealed that there was a hope due to upward trends of mangrove area in last 12 yr (approximately 5 ha). However, the significant increase sof shrimp pond area (approximately 34 ha) surrounding mangrove area become current and future threat. Based on sociological study, most of people around Bogowonto Lagoon have high awareness, but less participated on mangrove restoration program. Besides, the river mouth covered by sand become another obstacle of it.																	2413-0877						2017							1	13		10.18502/kls.v3i4.680								WOS:000417434100001

The accuracy of model was tested using error estimation and statistical analysis. Colour of waters, transparency and reflectance values showed, the clear water has high transparency and low reflectance while the turbid waters have low transparency and high reflectance. The estimation of TSM concentrations in Lombok coastal waters are 0.39 to 20.7 mg/l. TSM concentrations becoming high when it is on coast and low when it is far from the coast. The statistical analysis showed that TSM model from Landsat 8 OLI data could describe TSM from field measurement with correlation 91.8% and RMSE value 0.52.

S	Zhu, CM; Zhang, X		Zhang, X; Wang, L; Jiang, X; Zhu, C		Zhu, Changming; Zhang, Xin			Coastal Remote Sensing	MODELING WITH DIGITAL OCEAN AND DIGITAL COAST	Coastal Research Library											Coastal zones are a junction between the land and the ocean. The dynamic nature of the coast makes it difficult to clearly define the borders of coastal zones. Sometimes these zones are referred to as tidewater areas, extending from the coast to approximately 10 miles inland. Ketchum defined a coastal zone as the band of dry land and adjacent ocean space (water and submerged land) in which terrestrial processes and land uses directly affect oceanic processes and uses and vice versa (Ketchum BH, The water's edge: critical problems of the Coastal zone. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1972). Coastal zones are one of the most ecologically valuable and biodiverse regions in the world. They provide food, freshwater and other marine products for human beings, as well as play an important role in the local environment. However, human activities and global climate change have given rise to natural disasters that threaten coastal zones environmental security. In particular, the effect of industrial projects on coastal zones is worsening. Thus, it is important to study these areas to provide guidance for coastal resource management and environmental protection. Numerous researchers have attempted to monitor coastal zone dynamics based on remote sensing data. In this chapter, we summarize various topics concerning the application of remote sensing in coastal zones. We focus on describing several new methods, including coastline automatic extraction, intertidal zone identification, coastal wetland classification and coastal invasive plant detection, using remote sensing.																	2211-0577		978-3-319-42710-2; 978-3-319-42708-9				2017	18						169	203		10.1007/978-3-319-42710-2_8	10.1007/978-3-319-42710-2							WOS:000399043100009

Ocean color remote sensing is an efficient tool to monitor SPM spatio-temporal variability in coastal waters. However, near-shore satellite images are complex to correct for atmospheric effects due to the proximity of land and to the high level of reflectance caused by high SPM concentrations in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions. The water reflectance signal ((w)) tends to saturate at short visible wavelengths when the SPM concentration increases. Using a comprehensive dataset of high-resolution satellite imagery and in situ SPM and water reflectance data, this study presents (i) an assessment of existing atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms developed for turbid coastal waters; and (ii) a switching method that automatically selects the most sensitive SPM vs. (w) relationship, to avoid saturation effects when computing the SPM concentration. The approach is applied to satellite data acquired by three medium-high spatial resolution sensors (Landsat-8/Operational Land Imager, National Polar-Orbiting Partnership/Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite and Aqua/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) to map the SPM concentration in some of the most turbid areas of the European coastal ocean, namely the Gironde and Loire estuaries as well as Bourgneuf Bay on the French Atlantic coast. For all three sensors, AC methods based on the use of short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands were tested, and the consistency of the retrieved water reflectance was examined along transects from low- to high-turbidity waters. For OLI data, we also compared a SWIR-based AC (ACOLITE) with a method based on multi-temporal analyses of atmospheric constituents (MACCS). For the selected scenes, the ACOLITE-MACCS difference was lower than 7%. Despite some inaccuracies in (w) retrieval, we demonstrate that the SPM concentration can be reliably estimated using OLI, MODIS and VIIRS, regardless of their differences in spatial and spectral resolutions. Match-ups between the OLI-derived SPM concentration and autonomous field measurements from the Loire and Gironde estuaries' monitoring networks provided satisfactory results. The multi-sensor approach together with the multi-conditional algorithm presented here can be applied to the latest generation of ocean color sensors (namely Sentinel2/MSI and Sentinel3/OLCI) to study SPM dynamics in the coastal ocean at higher spatial and temporal resolutions.

This study evaluated the potential of an oyster Suitability Sites Occurrence Model (SSOM) to predict the status of littoral areas in the future due to sea warming. Data sources comprised Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat 7 ETM+. The suitable sites were ranked on a scale of 1 (least suitable) to 5 (most suitable). In the suitability model, score 5 had the highest proportion (35.8%) of oyster suitability which shrank to 16.2% with a 4 degrees C increase in sea temperature. Future increases in sea temperature are likely to cause shrinkage in the spatial extent of most suitable and suitable oyster sites. Thus changes in marine oyster suitability in littoral zones are predicted to worsen gradually as sea temperatures increase in the future. Differences in the recorded sea temperature of <= 6 degrees C within and between sites may influence spatial variations in oyster habitat due to future sea warming. Such concepts could form an alternative scientific basis for quantification of potential global climate change effects on biodiversity for marine systems policy adaptation analysis, aquaculture potential, and management.

Recently, a number of studies have been performed to estimate temporal topographic changes in tidal flats based on the waterline method using a number of remote sensing data that were acquired at different tidal heights. However, the effect of seasonal variation has not been taken into consideration, nor been understood so far. In this study, 18 scenes of Landsat TM and ETM+ data, covering the period 2003-2004, and corresponding tidal gauge observation data, were used to estimate seasonal topographic variations in two major tidal flats in Gomso and Hampyeong Bay in the southern part of the west sea of South Korea, using the waterline method. Our results showed that the summer deposition was dominant in Gomso Bay with overall average seasonal topographic increase of approximately 18.6 cm. In contrast, Hampyeong Bay showed more dominant summer erosion with overall average seasonal topographic subsidence of about 5.0 cm. In addition; the net overall sedimentation budget was estimated as 6,308,047 m(3) and -2,210,986 m(3) in Gomso and Hampyeong Bay, respectively. The results also indicates that although both bays of Gomso and Hampyeong are classified as semi enclosed tidal flat, the sedimentary fades caused by formation geometry and sediment type led to different topographic changes. The results demonstrate that the amount of seasonal topographic variations is not negligible and are expected to improve the accuracy of topographic change derived by the waterline method.

J	Lee, S; Kim, G; Lee, C				Lee, Seulki; Kim, Gyuyeon; Lee, Changwook			Preliminary Study for Tidal Flat Detection in Yeongjong-do according to Tide Level using Landsat Images	KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Yeongjong- do is seventh largest island in the west coast of Korea which is 4.8 km away in the direction of south- west from Incheon. The mudflat area around the Yeongjong- do has variable dimension according to tide level. In addition, Yeongjong- do is important area with high environmental value as wintering sites for migratory birds. The mudflat of Yeongjong- do is also meaningful region because it is used as place of education and tourist attraction. But, there are increasing concerns about preservation of mudflat area caused by artificial development such as land reclamation project and Incheon airport construction. In this paper, mudflat area was detected using Landsat 7 ETM+ images that United States Geological Survey (USGS) is providing the data in 16 days period. The false color composite was made from band 7, 5, and 3 that could dividing boundary between water and land for the purpose of appearance of boundary line in mudflat region. This area was calculated using results of classification based on false color composite images and was digitized through repetitive algorithm during research of period. Therefore, the change of northeastern area in Yeongjong- do was detected according to tide level during 16 years from 2000 to 2015 on the basis of providing period at tide station. This paper will expect as indicator for range of area in same tide level prior to the start of the research for preservation of mudflat. It will be also scientific grounds about change of mudflat area caused by artificial development.																	1225-6161	2287-9307				DEC	2016	32	6					639	645		10.7780/kjrs.2016.32.6.8								WOS:000408871300008

Earth Observation and Geospatial techniques for Soil Salinity and Land Capability Assessment over Sundarban Bay of Bengal Coast, India	Geodesy and Cartography												To guarantee food security and job creation of small scale farmers to commercial farmers, unproductive farms in the South 24 PGS, West Bengal need land reform program to be restructured and evaluated for agricultural productivity. This study established a potential role of remote sensing and GIS for identification and mapping of salinity zone and spatial planning of agricultural land over the Basanti and Gosaba Islands(808.314sq. km) of South 24 PGS. District of West Bengal. The primary data i.e. soil pH, Electrical Conductivity (EC) and Sodium Absorption ratio (SAR) were obtained from soil samples of various GCP (Ground Control Points) locations collected at 50 mts. intervals by handheld GPS from 0-100 cm depths. The secondary information is acquired from the remotely sensed satellite data (LANDSAT ETM+) in different time scale and digital elevation model. The collected field samples were tested in the laboratory and were validated with Remote Sensing based digital indices analysisover the temporal satellite data to assess the potential changes due to over salinization. Soil physical properties such as texture, structure, depth and drainage condition is stored as attributes in a geographical soil database and linked with the soil map units. The thematic maps are integrated with climatic and terrain conditions of the area to produce land capability maps for paddy. Finally, The weighted overlay analysis was performed to assign the weights according to the importance of parameters taken into account for salineareaidentification and mapping to segregate higher, moderate, lower salinity zonesover the study area.																	2080-6736	2300-2581				DEC	2016	65	2					163	192		10.1515/geocart-2016-0012								WOS:000392720000004

Mangrove Response to Environmental Change in Kakadu National Park	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												The responses of mangroves to climate-related phenomena are difficult to decipher in many areas as human activities also influence changes in their extent and biophysical properties. In Kakadu National Park (KNP) in Australia's Northern Territory, human disturbance of mangroves is minimal and hence observed changes are more likely to indicate a natural environmental change, including that associated with climatic fluctuation. Using fine (<2m) resolution aerial photography, hyperspectral, and light detection and ranging data from 1991, 2002, and 2011, respectively, maps of mangroves were generated for four catchments in the Alligator Rivers Region, the Wildman, West, South and East Alligator Rivers, and Field Island. The net change in mangrove for all areas where data intersected were 1.29 km(2), but redistributions approximating 18.5 km(2) occurred with both losses and gains toward the coast and inland intrusion along many smaller creeks. A close correspondence between the planimetric canopy cover (PCC; %) within 25-m cells, as determined from aerial sensor data, and Landsat-derived foliage projected cover (FPC) was observed. A FPC threshold of >= 30% (similar to 50% PCC) best captured mangrove extent and was used to quantify annual changes in the area for all catchments and Field Island from 1987-2012 Landsat sensor data. Over the period of the time-series, fluctuations in extent above this threshold were observed with these corresponding to changes in sea level and, to a lesser extent, river discharge. The study concludes that changes in mangrove extent and cover in KNP are indicating a changing climate, as manifested by fluctuations (and a general) rise in sea level and changes in rainfall amounts. Such changes are anticipated to lead to alterations of the hydrological regime, with these further affecting mangroves and potentially impacting on the internationally important wetlands of KNP.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				DEC	2016	9	12	2				5612	5620		10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2616449								WOS:000391468900006						
J	Giri, C; Long, J				Giri, Chandra; Long, Jordan			Is the Geographic Range of Mangrove Forests in the Conterminous United States Really Expanding?	SENSORS												Changes in the distribution and abundance of mangrove species within and outside of their historic geographic range can have profound consequences in the provision of ecosystem goods and services they provide. Mangroves in the conterminous United States (CONUS) are believed to be expanding poleward (north) due to decreases in the frequency and severity of extreme cold events, while sea level rise is a factor often implicated in the landward expansion of mangroves locally. We used similar to 35 years of satellite imagery and in situ observations for CONUS and report that: (i) poleward expansion of mangrove forest is inconclusive, and may have stalled for now, and (ii) landward expansion is actively occurring within the historical northernmost limit. We revealed that the northernmost latitudinal limit of mangrove forests along the east and west coasts of Florida, in addition to Louisiana and Texas has not systematically expanded toward the pole. Mangrove area, however, expanded by 4.3% from 1980 to 2015 within the historic northernmost boundary, with the highest percentage of change in Texas and southern Florida. Several confounding factors such as sea level rise, absence or presence of sub-freezing temperatures, land use change, impoundment/dredging, changing hydrology, fire, storm, sedimentation and erosion, and mangrove planting are responsible for the change. Besides, sea level rise, relatively milder winters and the absence of sub-freezing temperatures in recent decades may be enabling the expansion locally. The results highlight the complex set of forcings acting on the northerly extent of mangroves and emphasize the need for long-term monitoring as this system increases in importance as a means to adapt to rising oceans and mitigate the effects of increased atmospheric CO2.																	1424-8220					DEC	2016	16	12							2010	10.3390/s16122010								WOS:000391303000030

Morphodynamic changes as an impact of human intervention at the Ras El-Bar-Damietta Harbor coast, NW Damietta Promontory, Nile Delta, Egypt	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												Due to the absence of a national strategic plan for coastal management, the Nile Delta coast is no longer described as a fully dissipative, divergent, low-gradient beach face composed of fine to very fine sand. Instead, new patterns have emerged depending on rock type, geomorphology of the coast, direction of the shoreline in relation to waves and current, and the implemented defense measures. This study attempts to record the morphodynamic changes which occurred due to human intervention. Landsat satellite images acquired for the periods of time of 1973, 1984, 1989, 2003, and 2015 are used together with geomorphologic observations in order to monitor the changes along the coastal strip between Ras El-Bar and Damietta Harbor. This study reveals two beach segments; one of which lies to the east, it is protected with detached breakwater system, and shows average shoreline accretions of +4.73 myr(-1), +5.0 myr(-1), and +0.89myr(-1) during the periods of 1984-1998, 1998-2003, and 2003-2015 respectively. This segment still has the geomorphologic imprints of the dissipative beach, wave divergence, low-gradient beach face, fine grained sand and spilling breakers. The second is to the west, between the detached breakwaters and the eastern jetty of the Damietta Harbor. It is an erosional segment with shoreline retreat of -7.43 myr(-1),-10.90 myr(-1), and -3.11myr(-1) for the same periods. This segment shows intermediate "d" beach or intermediate-reflective, wave convergence, rip currents, with the characteristic steep sloped and cuspate beach face, cliffy, reworked sediments of coarse grained sands, mud clasts, discoidal gravels, shelly beach, and plunging breakings. The presence of convergent waves along this segment confirms the concept of an emergence of a new wave pattern of reversed eddy which enhances the steepness of the beach face, accelerates erosion, and increases the possibility of drowning of swimmers at Ras El-Bar resort. Under such circumstances the plunge step approaches the shore and its shell content forced by wave to accumulate forming the shelly beach. To secure the coastal strip against erosion and sea level changes the detached breakwaters should be extended to reach the eastern jetty of the Damietta Harbor. The protection of this segment is a matter of interest for investment projects related to industries and trading along the Damietta Harbor as well as the touristic investments at Ras El Bar, as one of the important tourist destinations in Egypt. Millions of pounds spent by beach visitors and investment annually provide significant input to local and regional economy. Hazards associated with the morphodynamic effects on recreational beaches can influence the suitably of any given stretch of coast as a recreational resource, and thus impact tourist money spent in addition to the safety and well-being of beach visitors.

Because of its obvious land-use changes and ecosystem deterioration in recent decades, a sustainable development management and environmental protection project should be urgently proposed. Therefore, the remote-sensing images of Landsat are adopted to analyze the land use evolution and to evaluate its ecological security during the past 35 years in Silver Beach of this paper. The results show: in the period of 1979a-2013a, the areas of constructive land and artificial wetland are considerably increased and mainly transformed from cultivated land and forest land. The areas of cultivated land and forest land are substantially reduced accordingly, but the areas of grassland, water area and intertidal zone have no great extent of variation. Its land use intensities are consistently increased, but its land use diversities are abundant before 2000a and then significant decreased. Overall, the land use evolution presents slow in development speed, strengthen in development intensity, down in ecological richness and fragment in spatial patterns. In terms of ecological security, although there has short-term rising of ecological service value and security in 2006a, the whole structure, stability and ecological service function in Silver Beach are declined, and its vulnerabilities are accordingly increased. As a matter of fact, these results are achieved by shortly to improve the utilization rate of the artificial wetland and the intertidal zone resources with the cost of ecosystem structure and stability destruction. The impact factors of leading to above results are not only climatic factors as air temperature, typhoon, tide, but also even more important human activity factors as urbanization, sea reclamation, fishing, tourism and planning management in the studied time period. In consequence, the research findings from this study should be able to help understand the interacting mechanism among above multiple factors and to quantify respective contribution to land use evolution and its ecological security, which would provide an importantly scientific instruction for the future development management protection in Silver Beach.																	1386-7857	1573-7543				DEC	2016	19	4			SI		1907	1924		10.1007/s10586-016-0659-5								WOS:000388972000016

Spatially distributed, process-based, carbon cycle simulation models provide a means to integrate information on these various influences to estimate carbon pools and flux over large domains. Here we apply the Biome-BGC model over the four-state Northwest US region for the interval from 1986 to 2010. Landsat data were used to characterize disturbances, and forest inventory data were used to parameterize the model. The overall disturbance rate on forest land across the region was 0.8 % year(-1), with 49 % as harvests, 28 % as fire, and 23 % as pest/pathogen. Net ecosystem production (NEP) for the 2006-2010 interval on forestland was predominantly positive (a carbon sink) throughout the region, with maximum values in the Coast Range, intermediate values in the Cascade Mountains, and relatively low values in the Inland Rocky Mountain ecoregions. Localized negative NEPs were mostly associated with recent disturbances. There was large interannual variation in regional NEP, with notably low values across the region in 2003, which was also the warmest year in the interval. The recent (2006-2010) net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) was positive for the region (14.4 TgC year(-1)). Despite a lower area-weighted mean NECB, public forestland contributed a larger proportion to the total NECB because of its larger area. Aggregated forest inventory data and inversion modeling are beginning to provide opportunities for evaluating model-simulated regional carbon stocks and fluxes.																	1436-3798	1436-378X				DEC	2016	16	8			SI		2345	2355		10.1007/s10113-016-0956-9								WOS:000388959100016

Shrinking of Vann Island, Gulf of Mannar, SE coast of India: assessing the impacts	NATURAL HAZARDS												Vaan Island, which is one of 21 islands in Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park, is chosen as study area which is formed above the coral reef by sedimentation and deposition of tidal and current activities. By using Landsat images, the area (Vann Island) was calculated from the year 1973-2015 with analyzing tools of Qgis and Saga Gis. Multispectral Landsat images were processed to extract and delineate the interface line of island surface and seawater. The area of each year polygon vector is calculated using the Qgis field calculator tool. During the 1973, the area of Vaan Island is about 265,479 m(2) and at present the area is calculated as 40,733 m(2). About 84 % of the island area is reduced and inundated by the seawater due to sea level rise and anthropogenic activities such as coral sand mining, local tourism and fishing activities. At this rate of submergence, it can be predicted that by 2022 Vaan Island will completely submerge into the sea. From this study, it is concluded that geospatial techniques are one of the successful and reliable techniques to map this type of low-lying island to conserve and manage the resources that affected by the geogenic and anthropogenic processes.																	0921-030X	1573-0840				DEC	2016	84	3					1529	1538		10.1007/s11069-016-2496-5								WOS:000388187900002						
J	Baumstark, R; Duffey, R; Pu, RL				Baumstark, Rene; Duffey, Renee; Pu, Ruiliang			Mapping seagrass and colonized hard bottom in Springs Coast, Florida using WorldView-2 satellite imagery	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The offshore extent of seagrass habitat along the West Florida (USA) coast represents an important corridor for inshore-offshore migration of economically important fish and shellfish. Surviving at the fringe of light requirements, offshore seagrass beds are sensitive to changes in water clarity. Beyond and intermingled with the offshore seagrass areas are large swaths of colonized hard bottom. These offshore habitats of the West Florida coast have lacked mapping efforts needed for status and trends monitoring. The objective of this study was to propose an object-based classification method for mapping offshore habitats and to compare results to traditional photo-interpreted maps. Benthic maps were created from WorldView-2 satellite imagery using an Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) method and a visual photo interpretation method. A logistic regression analysis identified depth and distance from shore as significant parameters for discriminating spectrally similar seagrass and colonized hard bottom features. Seagrass, colonized hard bottom and unconsolidated sediment (sand) were mapped with 78% overall accuracy using the OBIA method compared to 71% overall accuracy using the photo-interpretation method. This study suggests an alternative for mapping deeper, offshore habitats capable of producing higher thematic and spatial resolution maps compared to those created with the traditional photo interpretation method.

River mouth dynamics of Swarnamukhi estuary, Nellore coast, southeast coast of India	GEODESY AND GEODYNAMICS												Swarnamukhi is an east flowing river having a total length of 130 km. This is an independent river which rises at an elevation of 300 m in the eastern Ghats ranges near Pakala village in Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh, India. This study was carried out using multitemporal satellite images of IRS P6 LISS-III and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS data from 2011 to 2015. The subsequent short term river mouth dynamics, coastal erosion and accretion rates have been calculated for the years between 2011 and 2015. Low river inflow, wind, tides, movement of the waves and littoral currents play a key role in the dynamic activities of erosion and accretion. The erosion rate from 2011 to 2015 was slightly decreased from 0.081 to 0.027 km(2). The total net rate of accretion was estimated at 0.438 km(2). The study shows during last five years (2011-2015) accretion is more than the erosion. High fluctuation of erosion and accretion are characteristics for the short term scale at river mouth.

This mythical river figures prominently in ancient literature, although at present no river exists in the proximity of the Konark Sun Temple. This study investigates the possibility of existence of a 'lost' river system near Konark through integrated geological and geophysical exploration in conjunction with historical evidence. Landsat, Aster Terra Look and Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission images have been used to identify and delineate the channel of an ancient river. A number of thematic maps have been generated and analysed in analytical hierarchy process and later integrated on a GIS platform to delineate the most probable trace of a palaeo-channel. The existence of a palaeo-channel at some locations is further corroborated through shallow surface geophysics using ground penetrating radar. The identified palaeo-channel passes north of the Konark Sun Temple, extending approximately parallel to the coast.																	0011-3891					OCT 25	2016	111	8					1387	1393		10.18520/cs/v111/i8/1387-1393								WOS:000385930000029

In this study, a total of 50 Landsat 8 operational land imager (OLI) images were used to analyze the geological features and spectral characteristics of the Nansha reefs. The exposed islands/sandbanks, reef flats and sub-tidal reefs were identified with the near-infrared band, the red and green bands, and the blue band, respectively. Based on the relationships among various characteristics and bands illustrated in the OLI images, the maximum between-cluster variance threshold algorithm (OTSU method) and the mathematical morphology were employed to extract characteristic parameters of the spatial geometry of the reefs from top to bottom, which were subsequently operated by a series of post-processing methods such as vectorization, simplification and topological analysis. Among the 132 standalone reefs and 16 atolls that are identified in the study, four reefs have yet to be named in the Standard Names of Various Islands in the South China Sea and the website Nansha Islands Online (http://www.nansha.org/). Another 24 ones are exposed to the atmosphere even during high tides. Taiping Island with an area of 0.57 km(2) represents the largest exposed geological feature. This study demonstrated the applicability of medium-resolution satellite images to derive the coral reef information effectively and thus provided information for the related departments that are responsible to manage the coast. An improved resolution of multispectral bands with the panchromatic band in higher spatial resolution (15 m for OLI image) is expected to provide an optimum satellite based approach to map marine habitats.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				OCT	2016	35	10					11	19		10.1007/s13131-016-0898-6								WOS:000385152000002

Streamflow response to the rapid retreat of a lake-calving glacier	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												There has been increasing attention over the last decade to the potential effects of glacier retreat on downstream discharge and aquatic habitat. This study focused on streamflow variability downstream of Bridge Glacier in the southern Coast Mountains of BC between 1979 and 2014, prior to and during a period in which the glacier experienced enhanced calving and rapid retreat across a lake-filled basin. Here we combined empirical trend detection and a conceptual-parametric hydrological model to address the following hypotheses: (1) streamflow trends in late summer and early autumn should reflect the opposing influences of climatic warming (which would tend to increase unit-area meltwater production) and the reduction in glacier area (which would tend to reduce the total volume of meltwater generated), and (2) winter streamflow should increase because of displacement of lake water as ice flows past the grounding line and calves into the lake basin. In relation to the first hypothesis, we found no significant trends in monthly discharge during summer. However, applying regression analysis to account for air temperature and precipitation variations, weak but statistically significant negative trends were detected for August and melt season discharge. The HBV-EC model was applied using time-varying glacier cover, as derived from Landsat imagery. Relative to simulations based on constant glacier extent, model results indicated that glacier recession caused a decline in mean monthly streamflow of 9% in August and 11% in September. These declines in late-summer streamflow are consistent with the results from our empirical analysis. The second hypothesis is supported by the finding of positive trends for December, January, and February discharge. Despite the modelled declines in late-summer mean monthly streamflow, recorded discharge data exhibited neither positive nor negative trends during the melt season, suggesting that Bridge Glacier may currently be at or close to the point of peak water. Further analysis of the impact of lake-terminating glaciers on downstream discharge is needed to refine the peak water model.

Based on the instantaneous water line position data, a new statistical method for studying annual shoreline change was proposed. The annual shoreline movement of the northern Yellow River delta after the latest deltaic course shift in 1976 was obtained. The results showed that the shoreline on northern Yellow River delta was mostly undergoing a retreat back process since 1976 due to the river course shift, relative sea level change, regional marine hydrodynamic forces and the local engineering constructions. The influence of the Yellow River deltaic course shift in 1976 on the shoreline change mainly occurred in the first 20 years in 1976-1996 after the course shift, and was mostly limited within 10 km range around the abandoned Diaokou river mouth. The coastal engineering constructions caused decrease of the erosion area by 61 km(2), or 31% of the total erosion area. Most of the northern Yellow River delta was relatively insensitive to the relative sea level change except for the coast around sections S10 and S11; The annual shoreline movement due to the relative sea level change along most of the coast was only 1-3% of the actual annual shoreline movement; the total erosion area due to the relative sea level change was 9 km(2), or 5% of the actual erosion area. The coast erosion in the northern Yellow River delta was mainly influenced by the regional marine hydrodynamic forces, which gradually increase from west to east, resulting in gradually eastward increase of annual shoreline movement and slope steepness of the coast.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SEP	2016					74		48	58		10.2112/SI74-005.1								WOS:000383795300006

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of mangrove conservation efforts in two adjacent protected areas in China that were under the management policies of the Ramsar Convention (Mai Po Marshes Nature Reserve (MPMNR), Hong Kong) and China's National Nature Reserve System (Futian Mangrove National Nature Reserve (FMNNR), Shenzhen). To achieve this goal, eleven Landsat images were chosen and classified, areal extent and landscape metrics were then calculated. The results showed that: from 1973-2015, the areal extent of mangroves in both reserves increased, but the net change for the MPMNR (281.43 hm(2)) was much higher than those of the FMNNR (101.97 hm(2)). In general, the area-weighted centroid of the mangroves in FMNNR moved seaward by approximately 120 m, whereas in the MPMNR, the centroid moved seaward even farther (410 m). Although both reserves saw increased integrality and connectivity of the mangrove patches, the patches in the MPMNR always had higher integrality than those in the FMNNR. We concluded that the mangroves in the MPMNR were more effectively protected than those in the FMNNR. This study may provide assistance to the formulation of generally accepted criteria for remote sensing-based evaluation of conservation effectiveness, and may facilitate the development of appropriate mangrove forest conservation and management strategies in other counties.					, Mingming/0000-0002-4548-899X												2072-4292					AUG	2016	8	8							627	10.3390/rs8080627								WOS:000382458700014						
J	Das, S; Singh, PK; Chaudhari, S				Das, Sanjay; Singh, P. K.; Chaudhari, Swapnil			Neotectonic Activities in Northern Saurashtra Peninsula Bordering Gulf of Kachchh	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												This study points out the evidences of neotectonics and possible existence of active fault in northern part of Saurashtra Peninsula. The methodology used for the detection of neotectonism are: a) analysis of numerical data obtained from Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and its derivatives (morphometric indices), b) study of geomorphic markers and c) correlation of seismic & palaeoseismic data and geomorphology with structural lineaments. Morphometric indices such as drainage density, stream frequency, bifurcation ratio, basin length, basin relief, relief ratio, elongation ratio, stream gradient index, hypsometric index and sinuosity ratio have been used to assess the tectonic signatures. Morphometric indices suggest that Aji river basin is tectonically active, whereas Und and Sasoi river basins show some of the parameters in active tectonic range. Regional study using remotely sensed data (Landsat OLI multispectral) has helped to show a) about 100A degrees dextral rotation of Aji river trunk channel near the Gulf coast and b) dextral deflection of both Aji and Und river about 25 km from the coast. Study of a segment of Aji river basin near Ranjitpura- Balamba proved upliftment and tilting of land resulting a) narrowing of trunk channel towards sea, b) development of new sets of channels over tilted river terrace, c) development of beheaded channels, d) presence of palaeo-channels and palaeo-delta in different directions with the present ones and e) formation of estuary with definite geometric shape. Occurrence of earthquake epicentres, in conformity with predicted lineaments in addition to paleoseismic records supports the existence of the fault. On the basis of integrated evidences it has been established that the Saurashtra coast along the Gulf of Kachchh is tectonically active with the existence of a dextral strike slip fault (ENE-WSW trending) with a rotational component manifesting tilting of the northern block towards east.																	0255-660X	0974-3006				AUG	2016	44	4					553	562		10.1007/s12524-015-0514-9								WOS:000379742400007

Shoreline change and impacts of coastal protection structures on Puducherry, SE coast of India	NATURAL HAZARDS												This study examines the shoreline changes that have occurred in past 23 years along Puducherry region, SE coast of India. Satellite data sets such as Landsat, Cartosat-1, Resourcesat-1 and 2 of different periods-i.e., 1991, 2000, 2006, 2008, 2012, 2013 and 2014, were used for shoreline change analysis. Shoreline extracted from these data sets was used for estimation of shoreline change rate at every 20-m interval. The overall result found that 55.9 % shows erosion, 34.9 % falls under stable, and 9.2 % shows accretion in Puducherry coast. High accretion rate of 5.0 (+/- 1.9) m/year was noticed along the Veerampattinam region located immediate south to the Puducherry port. Medium erosion of about -3.2 (+/- 1.9) m/year was observed along the Thengaithittu region. Remaining coast was noticed with stable to low erosion. Severe erosion was observed in northern side of the breakwater during 1991-2000 periods, whereas southern side high accretion was noticed. Groins constructed at Thandrayankuppam and Nadukuppam region protected the coast from erosion. Due to this groin construction, erosion was shifted toward the northern portion (Chinna Mudaliar Chavadi, Periya Mudaliar Chavadi and to certain extend of Bommaiyarpalayam). This study demonstrates that combined use of satellite imagery after considering the uncertainties and statistical methods can be a reliable method for shoreline change analysis for any coastal conditions.																	0921-030X	1573-0840				AUG	2016	83	1					293	308		10.1007/s11069-016-2332-y								WOS:000379501000014

Chronic, Anthropogenic Hydrocarbon Discharges in the Gulf of Mexico	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Satellite-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) was used to obtain more precise estimates of the magnitude of the chronic hydrocarbon discharges described in qualitative pollution reports associated with the production and transportation network of the U.S. coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The National Response Center (NRCen) oil pollution reports were collected and filtered for the period of 2001 to 2012 to determine which of the reports coincided with archived SAR images. Some of the images covered multiple reports and some of the oil discharges described in one report could be observed in more than one image. In all, 177 reports could be investigated from 137 SAR images collected on or near the corresponding report dates. Further analysis found that oil slicks observed in 66 of these SAR images could be attributed to 67 of the reported incidents. Objective measurements indicated that the area of these transient oil slicks visible in SAR images was, on average, significantly larger than what was reported to the NRCen. The only recurring point source for oil slicks was the former site of the Taylor offshore platform. Here chronic, oil slicks were observed that were consistently much larger than other anthropogenic discharges. The SAR images of floating oil discharged from the Taylor site were verified by visual inspection from a boat and aerial photography. For some of the oil slicks discharged from the Taylor site, the accuracy of SAR images for detecting oil slick areas was validated by comparing SAR results to Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. These results show that surveillance by SAR would improve accuracy for estimates of chronic anthropogenic oil pollution, particularly where continuous discharges are on-going.

J	Li, WY; Gong, P				Li, Wenyu; Gong, Peng			Continuous monitoring of coastline dynamics in western Florida with a 30-year time series of Landsat imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Continuous monitoring of coastline dynamics is of crucial importance to the understanding of relative contributions of various potential driving factors behind the long-term coastline change. While a large number of efforts have been made to extract coastline and detect coastline change with remotely sensed data, the temporal frequency and spatial resolution of coastline datasets obtained are generally not fine enough to reflect the detailed process of coastline retreat and/or advance, particularly in coastlines with subtle variability. To overcome these limitations, we developed a method to continuously monitor the dynamics of a muddy coastline with subtle variability in western Florida at annual and subpixel scales using time-series Landsat data (1984-2013). First, robust indicators were used to indicate the annual "average" location of the dynamic coastline. Due to the complexity of muddy-coast morphology, the annual average location is represented not by the coast "line", but by the fractional inundated "area" of coastline pixels (pixels where the coastline is located), namely annually inundated area. Second, the annually inundated area of coastline pixels was estimated with a model proposed in this study, and the uncertainty was estimated with the Monte Carlo method. The retrievals were validated at 10 sites with aerial imagery, and the overall RMSE (root mean square error) is 11.48%. Third, the long-term trend for the time series of annually inundated area was derived with a statistical model. The results indicate that the muddy coast in western Florida continues to shrink with an average rate of 0.42 +/- 0.05 km(2)/year during the three decades. This study demonstrates the feasibility of time-series Landsat data in continuous monitoring of coastline dynamics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Examination of Abiotic Drivers and Their Influence on Spartina alterniflora Biomass over a Twenty-Eight Year Period Using Landsat 5 TM Satellite Imagery of the Central Georgia Coast	REMOTE SENSING												We examined the influence of abiotic drivers on inter-annual and phenological patterns of aboveground biomass for Marsh Cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, on the Central Georgia Coast. The linkages between drivers and plant response via soil edaphic factors are captured in our graphical conceptual model. We used geospatial techniques to scale up in situ measurements of aboveground S. alterniflora biomass to landscape level estimates using 294 Landsat 5 TM scenes acquired between 1984 and 2011. For each scene we extracted data from the same 63 sampling polygons, containing 1222 pixels covering about 1.1 million m(2). Using univariate and multiple regression tests, we compared Landsat derived biomass estimates for three S. alterniflora size classes against a suite of abiotic drivers. River discharge, total precipitation, minimum temperature, and mean sea level had positive relationships with and best explained biomass for all dates. Additional results, using seasonally binned data, indicated biomass was responsive to changing combinations of variables across the seasons. Our 28-year analysis revealed aboveground biomass declines of 33%, 35%, and 39% for S. alterniflora tall, medium, and short size classes, respectively. This decline correlated with drought frequency and severity trends and coincided with marsh die-backs events and increased snail herbivory in the second half of the study period.

J	Zhang, KQ; Thapa, B; Ross, M; Gann, D				Zhang, Keqi; Thapa, Bina; Ross, Michael; Gann, Daniel			Remote sensing of seasonal changes and disturbances in mangrove forest: a case study from South Florida	ECOSPHERE												Knowledge of the spatial and temporal changes caused by episodic disturbances and seasonal variability is essential for understanding the dynamics of mangrove forests at the landscape scale, and for building a baseline that allows detection of the effects of future environmental change. In combination with LiDAR data, we calculated four vegetation indices from 150 Landsat TM images from 1985 to 2011 in order to detect seasonal changes and distinguish them from disturbances due to hurricanes and chilling events in a mangrove-dominated coastal landscape. We found that normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) performed best in identifying both seasonal and event-driven episodic changes. Mangrove responses to chilling and hurricane events exhibited distinct spatial patterns. Severe damage from intense chilling events was concentrated in the interior dwarf and transition mangrove forests with tree heights less than 4 m, while severe damage from intense hurricanes was limited to the mangrove forest near the coast, where tree heights were more than 4 m. It took 4-7 months for damage from intense chilling events and hurricanes to reach their full extent, and took 2-6 yr for the mangrove forest to recover from these -disturbances. There was no significant trend in the vegetation changes represented by NDMI over the -27-yr period, but seasonal signals from both dwarf and fringe mangrove forests were discernible. Only severe damage from hurricanes and intense chilling events could be detected in Landsat images, while damage from weak chilling events could not be separated from the background seasonal change.																	2150-8925					JUN	2016	7	6							e01366	10.1002/ecs2.1366								WOS:000378523100028						
J	Asbridge, E; Lucas, R; Ticehurst, C; Bunting, P				Asbridge, Emma; Lucas, Richard; Ticehurst, Catherine; Bunting, Peter			Mangrove response to environmental change in Australia's Gulf of Carpentaria	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Across their range, mangroves are responding to coastal environmental change. However, separating the influence of human activities from natural events and processes (including that associated with climatic fluctuation) is often difficult. In the Gulf of Carpentaria, northern Australia (Leichhardt, Nicholson, Mornington Inlet, and Flinders River catchments), changes in mangroves are assumed to be the result of natural drivers as human impacts are minimal. By comparing classifications from time series of Landsat sensor data for the period 1987-2014, mangroves were observed to have extended seawards by up to 1.9 km (perpendicular to the coastline), with inland intrusion occurring along many of the rivers and rivulets in the tidal reaches. Seaward expansion was particularly evident near the mouth of the Leichhardt River, and was associated with peaks in river discharge with LiDAR data indicating distinct structural zones developing following each large rainfall and discharge event. However, along the Gulf coast, and particularly within the Mornington Inlet catchment, the expansion was more gradual and linked to inundation and regular sediment supply through freshwater input. Landward expansion along the Mornington Inlet catchment was attributed to the combined effects of sea level rise and prolonged periods of tidal and freshwater inundation on coastal lowlands. The study concluded that increased amounts of rainfall and associated flooding and sea level rise were responsible for recent seaward and landward extension of mangroves in this region.

Giashuddin; Inoue, Yoshio			ANALYSIS OF LAND USE AND LAND COVER CHANGES IN THE COASTAL AREA OF BANGLADESH USING LANDSAT IMAGERY	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Coastal land use across the globe has experienced remarkable rapid change over the recent decades because of extraordinary anthropogenic pressure and climate variability and change. Therefore, quantitative information about coastal land use change is imperative for effective management and planning resources for sustainable development. We analysed the quantitative land use and land cover changes during 1989-2000-2010 periods in three important agroecological zones of the most vulnerable coastal region of Bangladesh using Landsat images (Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus). In the Ganges Tidal Floodplain, the area under shrimp cultivation greatly increased at the rate of 2.05% per annum. The majority of the shrimp area gained from conversion of single cropland. In the Meghna Estuarine Floodplain, decreased mudflat and water bodies were observed, which was predominantly converted into cropland. In Chittagong Coastal Plain, salt pan-shrimp area increased with the expense of single and/or double cropland. In all the study areas, settlement area considerably increased over time. The dynamics of land use change have been attributed to low and unstable food production in the coastal region. The approach adopted in study and the results obtained from the study would likely be useful for policy making and identifying direction for future studies on the coastal land use in Bangladesh.

J	Elmahdy, SI; Mohamed, MM				Elmahdy, Samy Ismail; Mohamed, Mohamed Mostafa			Factors controlling the changes and spatial variability of Junipers phoenicea in Jabal Al Akhdar, Libya, using remote sensing and GIS	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The Junipers phoenicea, which covers 70 % of the Jabal Al Akhdar (Green Mountain) in Cyrene on the northeast coast of Libya, has deteriorated over large scales. To deal with this problem, the images of the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) in conjunction with the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) were used to map factors controlling the J. phoenicea mortality using a set of automated algorithms and tools. These factors include altitude, slope, aspect, curvature, drainage pattern, seawater intrusion, and land cover. As a first step, changes of J. phoenicea and land cover during the period from the year 2000 to 2015 were mapped. The results showed a sharp decline in J. phoenicea covering an area of 396 km(2) (22 %) of the total area. The result also showed that areas at a lower elevation with steep slope and faced to the south and southeast directions have a higher probability of J. phoenicea distribution. The spatial analysis showed a positive correlation between wetness and the intensity of J. phoenicea mortality. The results also show that altitude and slope have the most influencing power on the J. phoenicea morality. This study is of great help for decision makers and agriculture engineers and permits a better understanding of ecological and biomass changes in the Jabal Al Akhdar, Libya, over a regional scale.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				MAY	2016	9	6							478	10.1007/s12517-016-2500-0								WOS:000376611000052

Analysis of Landsat satellite images from 1973 to 2014 shows that nearly 70% of the 160km - long South China Sea shoreline of the delta has strongly eroded. This trend represents a reversal of the massive, long-term Holocene progradation that characterized this part of the delta. Erosion and land loss along the South China Sea coast are not related to lobe switching, but more likely to decreasing river sediment supply and variations in patterns of sediment storage in the delta that appear to be due to human-induced modifications. These include fluvial sediment trapping by dams, enhanced subsidence due to massive groundwater abstraction, and riverbed aggregate extractions. Shoreline erosion is further exacerbated by the replacement of protective mangroves by shrimp farms. This erosion constitutes an additional hazard to the future integrity of a mega-delta already considered particularly vulnerable to subsidence, and to future large-capacity dams.

J	Sadeghi, V; Ahmadi, FF; Ebadi, H				Sadeghi, Vahid; Ahmadi, Farshid Farnood; Ebadi, Hamid			Design and implementation of an expert system for updating thematic maps using satellite imagery (case study: changes of Lake Urmia)	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Thematic maps are fundamental for decision-making in natural resources and ecosystem management and planning. Thematic information, land cover in particular, is dynamic and changeable with the passage of time. Hence, providing up-to-date and precise data in a short period of time is considered as a key factor for successful utilization of these maps. Field inspection and visual interpretation of satellite images and topographic maps are necessary for this purpose. These processes are labor intensive, time consuming, and costly. An expert system, as a computer system with the capability of an expert's performance simulation, could be an assistant for experts involved with the thematic map updating process. In this paper, a knowledge-based expert (KBE) system was designed, implemented, and tested to automate, facilitate, and expedite the conventional thematic map updating procedure. The developed system in this research is based on using existing thematic map and satellite images together with the new acquired satellite image of the desired region. It entails the following five major steps: (1) relative radiometric normalization, (2) change detection, (3) spectral database construction, (4) identifying the content of the changes, and (5) cartographic operations. In order to assess the effectiveness of the proposed KBE system for automatic updating of thematic maps, two different case studies related to Urmia Lake and surrounding areas were considered. Near-anniversary bi-temporal Landsat TM 4,5 imagery, acquired on 30 June 1989 and 24 June 2007 over the eastern coast of the lake alongside the existing land cover map of 1989, were used in the first case study. Utilized data sets in the second case study were near-anniversary Landsat 8 satellite images (OLI sensor) taken on 20/7/2014 and 23/7/2015 over the southern coast of lake alongside the outdated land cover map of interest region in 2014. Test results of different parts of the system were confirmed by the experts, and finally the system could satisfy the assessment criteria from the experts' point of view in this particular application. Overall accuracy of the updated thematic map in the first and second case studies was 97.18 and 87.81 %, respectively.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				APR	2016	9	4							257	10.1007/s12517-015-2301-x								WOS:000374256200014						
J	Ju, JC; Masek, JG				Ju, Junchang; Masek, Jeffrey G.			The vegetation greenness trend in Canada and US Alaska from 1984-2012 Landsat data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												To assess the North American high-latitude vegetation response to the rising temperature, we derived NDVI trend for 91.2% of the non-water, non-snow land area of Canada and Alaska using the peak-summer Landsat surface reflectance data of 1984-2012. Our analysis indicated that 29.4% and 2.9% of the land area of Canada and Alaska showed statistically significant positive (greening) and negative (browning) trends respectively, at significance level p < 0.01, after burned forest areas were masked out. The area with greening trend dominated over that with browning trend for all land cover types. The greening occurred primarily in the tundra of western Alaska, along the north coast of Canada and in northeastern Canada; the most intensive and extensive greening occurred in Quebec and Labrador. The browning occurred mostly in the boreal forests of eastern Alaska. The Landsat-based greenness trend is broadly similar to the 8-km GIMMS AVHRR-based trend for all vegetation zones. However, for tundra, the Landsat data indicated much less extensive greening in Alaska North Slope and much more extensive greening in Quebec and Labrador, and substantially less extensive browning trend in the boreal forests that were free of fire disturbances. These differences call for further validation of the Landsat reflectance and the AVHRR NDVI datasets. Correlation study with local environmental factors, such as topography, glacial history and soil condition, will be needed to understand the heterogeneous greenness change at the Landsat scale.

A total of 232 ground sample plots were used to estimate the biomass distribution in the Nakdong River estuary. Field data were overlain and correlated with digital values from an atmospherically corrected multispectral image (Landsat 8). The AGB distribution was derived using empirical models trained with field-measured AGB data. The final regression model for AGB estimation was composed using the OLI3, OLI4, and OLI7 spectral bands. The Pearson correlation between the observed and predicted biomass was significant (R = 0.84, p < 0.0001). OLI3 made the largest contribution to the final model (relative coefficient value: 53.4%) and revealed a negative relationship with the AGB biomass. The total distribution area of B. planiculmis was 1,922,979 m(2). Based on the model estimation, the total AGB had a dry weight (DW) of approximately 298.2 tons.

Cyclic behavior of sandy shoals on the ebb-tidal deltas of the Wadden Sea	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Ebb-tidal deltas are bulges of sand that are located seaward of tidal inlets. Many of these deltas feature shoals that cyclically form and migrate towards the coast. The average period between successive shoals that attach to the coast varies among different inlets. In this study, a quantitative assessment of the cyclic behavior of shoals on the ebb-tidal deltas of the Wadden Sea is presented. Analysis of bathymetric data and Landsat satellite images revealed that at the majority of inlets along the Wadden Sea migrating shoals occur. The average period between succeeding shoals correlates to the tidal prism and has values ranging between 4 and 130 years. A larger tidal prism favors larger periods between successive shoal attachments. However, such a relationship was not found for wide inlets with multiple channels. There is a positive relationship between the frequency with which the shoals attach to the coast and their migration velocity, and a negative relationship between the migration velocity of the shoal and the tidal prism. Finally, the data were too sparse to assess whether the longshore sediment transport has a significant effect on the period between successive shoals that attach to the coasts downdrift of the observed tidal inlets.

The study aims to assess the shoreline changes and prediction in Sagar Island, a delta of the Ganges, situated in West Bengal, India. Shorelines have been delineated by using Tasseled Cap Transformation techniques from the Landsat MSS (1975), Landsat TM (1989, 1991) and Landsat ETM+ (1999, 2002, 2005, 2008, and 2011) images. The uncertainty was calculated for every year for assessing the positional error related to shoreline extraction. Total shoreline change rate/year has also been calculated and the uncertainty of total shoreline change rate was found +/- 3.20 m/year. In the present study, End Point Rate (EPR) and Linear Regression (LR) methods have been used for shoreline change rate calculation and prediction of shoreline. Long term (1975-2002) and short term (2002-2011) erosion and accretion rates were calculated for the study area. Sagar is the biggest island of the Sundarban region; so, it was divided into three segments in order to analyze the change on a segment basis. It was observed that the most of erosion occurred in the Segment B (south Sagar). The rate of erosion was -7.91 and -7.01 m/year for the periods 1975-2002 and 2002-2011 respectively. The mean shoreline change rate was high in Segment B (South Sagar) with values of -6.46 m/year (1975-2002) but the rate was decreased into -5.25 m/year during the later period (2002-2011). The study reveals that most of the southern part of Sagar Island is vulnerable to high rate of shoreline erosion.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				FEB	2016	20	1					61	80		10.1007/s11852-015-0418-4								WOS:000373149500006

Geomorphological evolution of marine heads on the eastern coast of Red Sea at Saudi Arabian region, using remote sensing techniques	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The eastern coast of the Red Sea is characterized by the presence of numerous marine heads that differ in terms of shape, size, geological setting, structures, and composition. This difference directly affects geomorphological evolution. In the present study, Ras Al-Shabaan was chosen as a most important area in this coast. Field investigations supported with photo-interpretation techniques were performed for studying of geomorphological features of Ras Al-Shabaan. On the other hand, the remotely sensed imagery data has been used extensively in the identification of geological and geomorphological details of Ras Al-Shabaan. The geomorphological studies showed that depositional processes of wadis and channels are predominant at the Ras Al-Shabaan coast. The changes in geomorphological and geological data of Ras Al-Shabaan were identified by remote sensing image software. Two Landsat ETM+ images from 1990 and 2010 have been processed. The analysis of remote sensing data combined with field investigations and reference data were used to monitor, delineate, and describe the geomorphological changes of Ras Al-Shabaan coast during proceedings of supervised classification of ground units. Hence, the change detection statistics have been used in ground units. Geological and geomorphological maps were digitized by using ArcGIS software. Remote sensing techniques and geographic information system (GIS) were employed in order to monitor the results of changes occurred in the line of the coast. The satellite image processing and water index data were transferred to the ArcGIS program to draw the coast lines and to stand on the changes occurred. Thereby, it was possible to identify the most prominent landforms and geomorphic units of this area. Results showed that platforms, barriers, rocky heads, islands, coral reefs, submerged reefs, tidal channels, dissolution grooves, sabkhas, inlet system, waves work, and shoreline processes were included in coastal prominent landforms. The circumstances that formed this coast are not permanent, as it is changing rapidly and continuously due to erosion and uplift processes.

Mexico lacks long-term time series to determine trends for major eelgrass populations and has made no conservation efforts. Therefore, we present the first report on the historic presence of this annual coastal ecosystem in two wetlands of the Gulf of California (GC), the Infiernillo Channel (CIF, largest Z. marina population inside GC) and Concepcion Bay (BCP, the only eelgrass population along GC's west coast), combining field surveys (1999-2010), aerial photography (2000-2010), satellite imagery (1972-2005), and published reports (1994-2007). Three parameters were used as indicators of conservation status: shoot density, seed banks, and aerial coverage. Average shoot density in the CIF (741 shoots m(-2)) was 3.8 times higher than in BCP (194 shoots m(-2)), and average seed bank density was similar in both wetlands (17,442 seeds m(-2) vs. 17,000 seeds m(-2)). Opportunistic seagrass Ruppia maritima was observed in both wetlands, with higher abundance in summer when Z. marina disappears due to high water temperatures. Eelgrass coverage was three orders of magnitude greater in the CIF (9725 ha) than in BCP (3 ha). The striking difference between these wetlands is the lack of environmental protection for BCP and the protection of the CIF by the Seri indigenous community, which increases human pressure in the former, putting it at high risk of disappearing. Conservation of eelgrass meadows is not only necessary to preserve their ecosystem services but to insure the survival of migratory populations (Pacific brant goose, Branta bernicla), endangered species (Black turtle, Chelonia mydas), and fisheries-related species.																	0960-3115	1572-9710				FEB	2016	25	2					261	273		10.1007/s10531-016-1045-6								WOS:000370137100004						
J	Choung, YJ; Jo, MH				Choung, Yun-Jae; Jo, Myung-Hee			Shoreline change assessment for various types of coasts using multi-temporal Landsat imagery of the east coast of South Korea	REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												Shoreline change assessment is an important task for protecting coastal properties and preserving coastal environments. This research aimed to assess the shoreline changes using the multi-temporal Landsat imagery, acquired from the east coast of South Korea during 1994 and 2014. The procedure for the shoreline change assessment consists of the following steps: (i) generating the normalized difference water index (NDWI) map from each Landsat image; (ii) extracting the shorelines from each NDWI map through the thresholding method; and (iii) assessing the shoreline changes in the various types of coasts such as the sandy, rocky and harbour coasts using the checkpoints with 1km intervals. The statistical results showed that 94% of the shorelines in the sandy coasts and 96% of the shorelines in the rocky coasts moved landward between 1994 and 2014 due to coastal erosions, while 91% of the shorelines in the harbour coasts moved seaward during the same period due to the land reclamation works. This research contributed to the assessment of the shoreline changes and the calculation of the erosion rates in the various coasts of the study area between 1994 and 2014.																	2150-704X	2150-7058				JAN 2	2016	7	1					91	100		10.1080/2150704X.2015.1109157								WOS:000363955300004

The tsunami generated by this earthquake reached up to 7 m run-up height and extended over 1.3 km inundation. This paper aims to revisit the impact of the 2001 Peruvian tsunami on the coastal area and its morphology along Camana city. The tsunami source is reconstructed through inversion of tsunami waveform records observed at several tide gauge stations and the impact is analyzed using the numerical result and moderate-resolution satellite images to calculate the inundation features in the coast. Finally we propose the tsunami source model suitable for further analysis of this event through tsunami numerical simulations. In addition, environmental changes, in particular the impact to vegetation areas, were evaluated using satellite imagery. An important reduction of agricultural areas due to tsunami impact and soil salinization was confirmed.

Shoreline and Coastal Morphological Changes Induced by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami in the Katchal Island, Andaman and Nicobar A Study Using Archived Satellite Images	TSUNAMIS AND EARTHQUAKES IN COASTAL ENVIRONMENTS: SIGNIFICANCE AND RESTORATION	Coastal Research Library											The December 24, 2004 Sumatra earthquake and Tsunami had caused large damage to the coastal environment in the Indian Ocean countries. Continuous monitoring of shorelines are needed to understand the causes and consequences of recent changes and to assess the long term impact of tsunami waves. Assessment of the shoreline and coastal morphological changes due to tsunami in Katchal Island have been lacking due to obstacles in the fi eld data acquisition owing to their remote location. As access to the ground information is limited, the only possibility is the monitoring of shorelines from multi-temporal satellite images. In this study, we demonstrate the methods used in extracting shorelines and analyzing their changes using the data from Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites, the EO1-ALI and Landsat images in a GIS environment. Eight satellite images acquired between 2004 and 2014 where used for the shoreline change and coastal morphology analysis in the Katchal Island. The results showed that the island experienced extensive erosion and signifi cant loss in land area of about 20 km(2). Erosion has been more prevalent than accretion at an average linear regression rate of similar to-13 m/year between 2004 and 2010. Net shoreline movement of more than 4 km landward has been observed at the western coast of the island. Regions of high net shoreline movements were associated with bay-mouth areas, and regions linked with coastal inlets. This study demonstrates the strong potential of archived satellite images for detecting shoreline movements in far-off islands. The results will likewise help in understanding the response and recovery of shorelines in Indian Ocean regions after the 2004 tsunami.																	2211-0577		978-3-319-28528-3; 978-3-319-28526-9				2016	14						65	77		10.1007/978-3-319-28528-3_5	10.1007/978-3-319-28528-3							WOS:000398067600006

Advanced optical and radar satellite imagery is the most applicable tool for mapping and identification of inaccessible regions in Antarctic. Consequently, an improved scientific research using remote sensing technology would be essential to provide new and more complete lithological and structural data to fill the numerous knowledge gaps on Antarctica's geology. In this investigation, Oscar coast area in Graham Land, Antarctic Peninsula (AP) was selected to conduct a remote sensing study using Landsat-7 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat-8 and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data. Contrast-enhanced Red-Green-Blue (RGB) composites, band ratios and Relative Band Depth (RBD) image processing techniques were applied to Landsat-8 and ASTER dataset for establishing the spectral separation of the main lithologic groups exposed in the study area. The outcomes of this investigation demonstrated the applications of SWIR and TIR bands of the multispectral remote sensing datasets to identify lithological units and producing geological maps with suitable accuracy of ice-free rock regions in the Antarctic Peninsula. The results could be extended to map coverage of non-investigated regions further east and validated previously inferred geological observations concerning other rocks and mineral deposits throughout the Antarctica.																	2194-9034						2016	42-4	W1					77	81		10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-4-W1-77-2016								WOS:000402559600011

Moreover, spatial resolution remains coarse compared to the image resolution because state-of-the-art wave analysis techniques decompose images into large-size patches. The method proposed here is based on adaptive wave tracing where the patch size depends on the wavelength observed. Waves are tracked from the open sea to the coast. When the waves approach the coast, their wavelength decreases and so does the patch size. Combining this method with linear wave theory leads to improved water depth estimation. Furthermore, with wave tracing we are also able to compute the wave period, allowing the estimation of water depth without resorting to ancillary data.

There is an urgent need for coastal managers and researches to monitor and assess spatial and temporal distributions of the SAV rapidly. Because of the repetitive coverage, satellite hi-resolution images are proved to be efficient but not suitable in large-scale spatial and multiple temporal assessment due to the concern of cost. Thus, the objective of this research is to probe into the suitability of Landsat-8 OLI data in the mapping of SAV habitats at Albemarle Sound, North Carolina, USA. With SONAR data as in situ measurement, the overall accuracy based on the number (n) of SAV points detected the SONAR per cell was 66.7% if n >= 1, 68.3% when n >= 6, and 67.8% if n >= 10. The cell size was 15mx15m. Thus, the distribution of SAV beds was efficiently depicted using multi-temporal Landsat-8 data. The phenological changes of SAV were revealed.																	2153-6996		978-1-5090-3332-4				2016							3802	3805		10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729986								WOS:000388114603211

Near the basal stress boundary between the ice shelf and the West Antarctic ice sheet, ice velocity ranges from a few meters per year to several hundred meters per year in ice streams. Ice velocity increases as the ice moves seaward, reaching more than 1 km yr-1 in the central portions of the ice front. Most of the drainage from West Antarctica into the Ross Ice Shelf flows down two major ice streams, each of which discharges more than 20 km3 of ice each year. Along with velocity changes the warmest water below parts of the Ross Ice Shelf resides in the lowest portion of the water column because of its high salinity. Vertical mixing caused by tidal stirring can thus induce ablation by lifting the warm water into contact with the ice shelf. This process can cause melting over a period of time and eventually cause breakup of ice shelf. With changes occurring over many years a validation is needed for the Antarctic Snow Accumulation and Ice Discharge (ASAID) basal stress boundary created in 2003. After the 2002 Larsen B Ice Shelf disintegration, nearby glaciers in the Antarctic Peninsula accelerated up to eight times their original speed over the next 18 months. Similar losses of ice tongues in Greenland have caused speed-ups of two to three times the flow rate in just one year. Rapid changes occurring in regions surrounding Antarctica are causing concern in the polar science community to research changes occurring in coastal zones over time. During the research, the team completed study on the Ross Ice Shelf located on the southwestern coast of the Antarctic. The study included a validation of the ABSB vs. the natural basal stress boundary (NBSB) along the Ross Ice Shelf. The ASAID BSB was created in 2003 by a team of researchers headed by National Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA GSFC), with an aim of studying coastal deviations as it pertains to the mass balance of the entire continent. The point data file was aimed at creating a replica of the natural BSB. Select cloud free Landsat satellite imagery from satellites 1 through 7 was used to detect changes occurring over the span of 19 years. The last major interest in the study included documenting the deviations or incorrect placements of the ABSB vs NBSB. ENVI 4.7 as well as ENVI 5.0 image manipulation software was used in the geo-rectifying and the geo-referencing process. Changes that occurred were documented in the form of a data table with the change that occurred along with the latitude and longitude geographic coordinates.																	2153-6996		978-1-5090-3332-4				2016							4897	4900		10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730278								WOS:000388114604215

Both IKO and Landsat TM data were preprocessed to calculate water depth invariant bands and the textural information was extracted from IKO data. Our results demonstrate that the IKO sensor produced a higher accuracy than the TM sensor in a three-class % SAV cover classification, and the overall accuracy of % SAV cover maps created with IKO data was 5-20% higher than these from other studies published. We also examined the spatial patterns of seagrass over a spatial range of 4-240 m using the Ripley's K function and IKO data that represented four different grain sizes (4 m, 8 m, 12 m, and 16 m) from seagrass cover. The Ripley's K metrics repeatedly show a dispersed (or slightly dispersed) pattern across 4-32 m and a random or slightly clustered pattern across 33-240 m. Therefore, use of the seagrass classification scheme introduced in the paper, along with data from the IKO sensor, offers an opportunity to synoptically record seagrass cover dynamics at both small and large spatial scales.																	2153-6996		978-1-5090-3332-4				2016							7663	7666		10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730998								WOS:000388114607118

They protect the coast from sea erosion and other natural disasters like tsunami and cyclone. In view of their increased destruction and degradation in the current scenario, mapping of this vegetation is at priority. Globally researchers mapped mangrove vegetation using visual interpretation method or digital classification approaches or a combination of both (hybrid) approaches using varied spatial and spectral data sets. In the recent past techniques have been developed to extract these coastal vegetation automatically using varied algorithms. In the current study we tried to delineate mangrove vegetation using LISS III and Landsat 8 data sets for selected locations of Andaman and Nicobar islands. Towards this we made an attempt to use segmentation method, that characterize the mangrove vegetation based on their tone and the texture and the pixel based classification method, where the mangroves are identified based on their pixel values. The results obtained from the both approaches are validated using maps available for the region selected and obtained better accuracy with respect to their delineation. The main focus of this paper is simplicity of the methods and the availability of the data on which these methods are applied as these data (Landsat) are readily available for many regions. Our methods are very flexible and can be applied on any region.																	2194-9034						2016	41	B8					555	561		10.5194/isprsarchives-XLI-B8-555-2016								WOS:000393156000094

MAPPING OF THE SEAGRASS COVER ALONG THE MEDITERRANEAN COAST OF TURKEY USING LANDSAT 8 OLI IMAGES	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VIII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				Benthic habitat is defined as ecological environment where marine animals, plants and other organisms live in. Benthic habitat mapping is defined as plotting the distribution and extent of habitats to create a map with complete coverage of the seabed showing distinct boundaries separating adjacent habitats or the use of spatially continuous environmental data sets to represent and predict biological patterns on the seafloor. Seagrass is an essential endemic marine species that prevents coast erosion and regulates carbon dioxide absorption in both undersea and atmosphere. Fishing, mining, pollution and other human activities cause serious damage to seabed ecosystems and reduce benthic biodiversity. According to the latest studies, only 5-10% of the seafloor is mapped, therefore it is not possible to manage resources effectively, protect ecologically important areas. In this study, it is aimed to map seagrass cover using Landsat 8 OLI images in the northern part of Mediterranean coast of Turkey. After pre-processing (e.g. radiometric, atmospheric, water depth correction) of Landsat images, coverage maps are produced with supervised classification using in-situ data which are underwater photos and videos. Result maps and accuracy assessment are presented and discussed.

Gregoric			SPATIAL CHANGES AND POPULATION MOVEMENTS ON THE ALBANIAN COASTLINE	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VIII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				The last decade has seen a large increase in construction along the southern Albanian coastline, mainly in the rise of large tourist complexes comprising hotels, apartment houses, touristic villages, and so on. These constructions rarely follow urban planning and not only change its landscape but also often threaten the ecological value of the coastal zone. The uncontrolled and devastating construction along the coast has been accompanied by coastal erosion caused by the sea with the intensity up to 50 cm/year. This paper investigates the environmental change monitoring on the Albanian Riviera by analysing optical remote sensing data (Landsat 5 and 8) in the period between 1984 and 2015. The image analysis results grounded on the change vector analysis indicate coastal morphology changes and land cover changes in the coastal environment, which appear mostly due to erosion in river delta and urban growth. Apart from identifying both phenomena through time, the objective of this study is to show that these landscape changes in fact correlate with the population migration as well as to explain why and the extent to which Albania is one of the most migratory countries in Europe. Based on the multidisciplinary research, which combines anthropological method with spatial analysis, this presentation anticipates future changes in this area. It argues that movements of both people and in landscape formations strongly influence each other, constituting a closely corresponding relationship.																	2194-9034						2016	41	B8					1141	1146		10.5194/isprsarchives-XLI-B8-1141-2016								WOS:000393156000192

DETECTION OF COASTLINE DEFORMATION USING REMOTE SENSING AND GEODETIC SURVEYS	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VIII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				The coastal areas are being destroyed due to the usage that effect the natural balance. Unconsciously sand mining from the sea for nearshore nourishment and construction uses are the main ones. Physical interferences for mining of sand cause an ecologic threat to the coastal environment. However, use of marine sand is inevitable because of economic reasons or unobtainable land-based sand resources. The most convenient solution in such a protection-usage dilemma is to reduce negative impacts of sand production from marine. This depends on the accurate determination of criteriaon production place, style, and amount of sand. With this motivation, nearshore geodedic surveying studies performed on Kilyos Campus of Bogazici University located on the Black Sea coast, north of Istanbul, Turkey between 2001-2002. The study area extends 1 km in the longshore. Geodetic survey was carried out in the summer of 2001 to detect the initial condition for the shoreline. Long-term seasonal changes in shoreline positions were determined biannually. The coast was measured with post-processed kinematic GPS. Besides, shoreline change has studied using Landsat imagery between the years 1986-2015. The data set of Landsat 5 imageries were dated 05.08.1986 and 31.08.2007 and Landsat 7 imageries were dated 21.07.2001 and 28.07.2015. Landcover types in the study area were analyzed on the basis of pixel based classification method. Firstly, unsupervised classification based on ISODATA (Iterative Self Organizing Data Analysis Technique) has been applied and spectral clusters have been determined that gives prior knowledge about the study area. In the second step, supervised classification was carried out by using the three different approaches which are minimum-distance, parallelepiped and maximum-likelihood. All pixel based classification processes were performed with ENVI 4.8 image processing software. Results of geodetic studies and classification outputs will be presented in this paper.																	2194-9034						2016	41	B8					1169	1174		10.5194/isprsarchives-XLI-B8-1169-2016								WOS:000393156000198

Remote Sensing and GIS analysis for demarcation of coastal hazard line along the highly eroding Krishna-Godavari delta front	EARTH RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMOTE SENSING/GIS APPLICATIONS VII	Proceedings of SPIE				SPIE Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications VII	SEP 27-29, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE				Coastal regions, especially river deltas are highly resourceful and hence densely populated; but these extremely low-lying lands are vulnerable to rising sea levels due to global warming threatening the life and property in these regions. Recent IPCC (2013) predictions of 26-82cm global sea level rise are now considered conservative as subsequent investigations such as by Met Office, UK indicated a vertical rise of about 190cm, which would displace 10% of the world's population living within 10 meters above the sea level. Therefore, predictive models showing the hazard line are necessary for efficient coastal zone management. Remote sensing and GIS technologies form the mainstay of such predictive models on coastal retreat and inundation to future sea-level rise. This study is an attempt to estimate the varying trends along the Krishna Godavari (K-G) delta region. Detailed maps showing various coastal landforms in the K-G delta region were prepared using the IRS-P6 LISS 3 images. The rate of shoreline shift during a 31-year period along different sectors of the 330km long K-G delta coast was estimated using Landsat-2 and IRS-P6 LISS 3 images between 1977 and 2008. With reference to a selected baseline from along an inland position, End Point Rate (EPR), Shoreline Change Envelope (SCE) and Net Shoreline Movement (NSM) were calculated, using a GIS based Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). The results showed that the shoreline migrated landward up to a maximum distance of 3.13km resulting in a net loss of about 42.10km(2) area during this 31-year period. Further, considering the nature of landforms and EPR, the future hazard line is predicted for the area, which also indicated a net erosion of about 57.68km(2) along the K-G delta coast by 2050 AD.

However, this can become a cumbersome and expensive task to undertake for large populations of buildings, scattered in large urban areas. To optimize the use of available resources, appropriate tools are required for the assessment of corrosion risk of reinforced concrete construction. This paper proposes a framework for the production of digital corrosion risk maps for urban areas; Cyprus was used as a case study. This framework explored multi-temporal satellite remote sensing data from the Landsat sensors as well as corrosion risk factors derived from the results of a recently completed research project, entitled "STEELCOR". This framework was used to develop two corrosion risk scenarios within Geographical Information Systems, and to produce corrosion risk maps for three coastal cities of Cyprus. The thematic maps indicated that, for slight corrosion damage, the distance of reinforced concrete buildings from the coast was more influential than the building age. While, for significant corrosion damage, the maps indicated that the age of RC buildings was more influential than the distance from the coast.

The research database was composed of Landsat satellite images, and standardized NDVI vegetation indexes from the years 1998 and 2015, as well as multi-temporal vector maps and aerial orthophotomaps. The result map of Change detection allowed to locate areas, in which diametrical changes in land coverage took place. Satellite images reflecting the condition of the examined area for twenty years enabled outlining changes of Baltic coastal zone, and then determining the rate and extent of transformations of examined part of coast (erosion and accumulation), and also made it possible to trace the migration of dunes. The analysis showed the range of shifting dune displacement in the years 1998-2015 amounts to ca. 180 m. On the examined section of seashore (32 km), the process of erosion and accumulation was detected respectively on the length of 21 km and 10 km along the coast. The changes of accumulation and erosion of the sea coast are easily identifiable and clearly visible. Properly conducted workflow of processing the satellite images have allowed the rapid and efficient detection of changes coastline, dunes and vegetation.

However, concomitant with the accelerated development of nuclear power stations, the environmental effects of thermal discharge will become a problem that cannot be avoided. Real-time monitoring of water temperature needs to be installed following station construction in order to measure its variation with time and to ensure that the operation of the nuclear plant does not result in adverse environmental damage. Landsat is the world's oldest, continuously acquired collection of space-based, moderate-resolution, land remote sensing data. On May 30, 2013, data from the Landsat 8 satellite became available, and the data quality and radiometric quantization of the thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) are significantly greater than those of previous Landsat instruments. The analysis of sea surface temperature (SST) obtained from Landsat 8's TIRS data was used to enhance information about the plume shape, dimensions, and direction of dispersion of the thermal discharge from the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant in Hangzhou Bay on the East China Sea coast. Both single-channel and split-window algorithms were used and focused. The detection of temperature increases through split-window algorithms is considered a preferable method for warm-discharge monitoring. Recent results showed that the thermal discharge from the nuclear plant was controlled over a small area, and that it never breached national water quality standards.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0402-5; 978-1-5106-0403-2				2016	9999								UNSP 99991E	10.1117/12.2242253								WOS:000391353700037

Impact of rapid urbanization on the microclimate of Indian cities: a case study for the city of Bhubaneswar	LAND SURFACE AND CRYOSPHERE REMOTE SENSING III	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Land Surface and Cryosphere Remote Sensing III	APR 04-07, 2016	Indian Soc Remote Sensing, New Delhi, INDIA	SPIE, Indian Space Res Org, Minist Earth Sci, Natl Aeronaut & Space Adm	Indian Soc Remote Sensing			The impact of rapid urbanization in cities on their microclimate is at present a great cause of global concern. One of the major consequences is the unexpected rise in temperatures in the cities compared to their surrounding areas, termed as the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. Over the past many years, several Indian cities are under severe stress owing to such extreme anomalous changes in their micro-meteorological conditions making them unfriendly for habitation. Presented here is a case study on Bhubaneswar - one such city on the east coast of India undergoing rapid urbanization in recent times. In this study, Land Surface Temperatures (LST) from MODIS Terra and Aqua instruments at 1 km(2) spatial resolution along with the Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) change data from Landsat was used over a 25 km radius about the city for a 15 years' period from 2000 to 2014. Preliminary analyses indicate spatio-temporal changes in LULC to be one of the primary and significant factors responsible for changes in the UHI effect over the city. Investigations on the spatio-temporal variations in LST across the city and its relationship with vegetation cover indicate that over-exploitation of various resources demanded by a fast growing population has led to significant changes in LULC patterns in the last few years. Analysis of the changes in the urban energy balance and resulting UHI effect across the city under various urban growth scenarios and different proportions of green urban area are in progress.

After recalibrating and validating the form with the highest correlation coefficient between reflectance and TSS concentration and other TSS retrieval models that have been successful applied in many places, we found that the quadratic model of the ratio of logarithmic transformation of red band and near infrared band and logarithmic transformation of TSS concentration (QRLTSS) shows the highest performance. QRLTSS model based on Landsat OLI, ETM+ and TM can explained about 71% of the TSS concentration variation (4.3 similar to 577.2 mg/L) in the five regions and has a high and acceptable validation accuracy with root mean square error (RMSE) of 21.5-25mg/L and mean relative error (MRE) of 27.2-32.2%. We concluded that QRLTSS model can be used to quantify the TSS concentration of multiple estuaries and coasts of south China which would be helpful to understand the temporal and spatial variation of TSS in a large region. QRLTSS model should be applied to Landsat imagery for further validation in the future. The approach proposed in the paper also could promote the research work of establishing regional and uniform TSS retrieval model forward.																	2380-8039		978-1-5090-1479-8				2016																		WOS:000389576700032

The impact of land cover changes on the environmental functions such as surface water, loss water, and soil moisture is considered in this paper on the Kelantan river basin. The study area at the east coast of the peninsular Malaysia has suffered significant land cover changes in the recent years. The current research tried to assess the impact of land cover changes in the study area focused on the surface water, loss water, and soil moisture from different land use classes and the potential impact of land cover changes on the ecosystem of Kelantan river basin. To simulate the impact of land cover changes on the environmental hydrology characteristics, a deterministic regional modeling were employed in this study based on five approaches, i.e. (1) Land cover classification based on Landsat images; (2) assessment of land cover changes during last three decades; (3) Calculation the rate of water Loss/Infiltration; (4) Assessment of hydrological and mechanical effects of the land cover changes on the surface water; and (5) evaluation the impact of land cover changes on the ecosystem of the study area. Assessment of land cover impact on the environmental hydrology was computed with the improved transient rainfall infiltration and grid based regional model (Improved-TRIGRS) based on the transient infiltration, and subsequently changes in the surface water, due to precipitation events. The results showed the direct increased in surface water from development area, agricultural area, and grassland regions compared with surface water from other land covered areas in the study area. The urban areas or lower planting density areas tend to increase for surface water during the monsoon seasons, whereas the inter flow from forested and secondary jungle areas contributes to the normal surface water.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0341-7; 978-1-5106-0342-4				2016	9975								UNSP 997507	10.1117/12.2238897								WOS:000389368700004

Review and combination of recent remote sensing based products for forest cover change assessments in Cameroon	INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW												Two recent remote sensing derived products providing assessment of forest cover change in the Congo Basin for the last two decades were compared and combined to obtain estimates of forest cover change in Cameroon for the period 1990-2012. The intensity of deforestation in the whole region decreased from the 1990s to the 2000s. Forest loss is observed everywhere in Cameroon but present higher intensity nearby the Atlantic coast. The analysis of the spatial distribution of the forest loss in Cameroon reveals that an important part of the loss is happening outside the permanent and the non-permanent forest domain. The Landsat spatial resolution used in the two products allows us to capture change caused by agro-industrial exploitation as well as shifting cultivation, infrastructure and selective logging when the area affected is large enough. But it fails to monitor forest degradation and small scale deforestation events.																	1465-5489	2053-7778					2016	18			1	SI		14	25		10.1505/146554816819683807								WOS:000388553900003

In this study, supervised classification and post-classification change detection techniques were applied to Landsat images acquired in 1987 and 2015 to map LULC changes along the north part of the Nile delta coastal zone specifically, at Damietta promontory. Landsat images were radio-metrically and geometrically corrected, and then, multi-temporal post-classification analysis was performed to detect LULC changes rates of the Nile delta coast around Damietta promontory where the Damietta branch (of the Nile River) meets the Mediterranean Sea. Four categories including seawater, developed (agriculture and urban), and undeveloped areas were selected to evaluate their temporal changes by comparing the processed images. The objective of this study is to map and assess the rate of changes LULC changes at the study area which can help the decision makers to replan the use of natural resources efficiently. By applying remote sensing/GIS technique, areas of rapid change are identified and targeted for more detailed monitoring in the field. Changes among different LULC classes were assessed.

In this paper, the Burullus Lake was selected as a case study. It is the second largest of the Egyptian northern coastal lakes along the Mediterranean coast. It has economic and environmental impacts on the nearby society of Kafr El-Sheikh, Egypt. ERDAS IMAGINE and ArcGIS software are used in this study for processing of the images and managing the database of each image. Different classification techniques are tested, the results showed that the maximum likelihood supervised classification technique was more accurate to monitor changes in the water bodies of the Lake. The method is applied to subsets of the Landsat TM, ETM+ and OLI/TIRS images acquired on 1984, 1990, 1998, 2003 and 2015, respectively. Five classes are detected including sea water, lake water, floating vegetation, sand bar and urban, and agriculture land. The results showed that the water bodies of the lake decreased by 44.97% (14,503.68 ha), while floating vegetation area increased mostly by the same amount during the period from 1984 to 2015. This increase in floating vegetation is mainly due to discharging of agriculture wastes and municipal wastes in the lake without adequate treatment. The sea water has minor changes during the period of study. The agriculture area increased by 45.52% (10,529.02 ha), while the sand bar and urban area decreased mostly by the same amount during the period from 1984 to 2015. Statistical models were developed using statistical tools. The models indicated that the water bodies of the lake will be reduced by 58.95% (19,013.42 ha) in 2030. The results of the present study shall help the decision-makers to take the necessary measures to reduce the environmental risk and maintain the lake in order to sustain the lake water area against further reduction.

These needs are met through imports from aboard. The raw materials for alginate, namely brown seaweed (Phaeophyceae) are very abundant in Indonesian coastal zones, but its stock level is not yet known. This study aims: to explore the biomass of brown seaweeds along the coastal areas of Bitung-Bentena, North Sulawesi Province by mapping their habitat, distribution and density using the effective and efficient tool of satellite remote sensing; and to compile preliminary results on the quality of alginate extracted from brown seaweeds. Result show that based on the isocluster analysis of Landsat-7 ETM+ and field sampling, we successfully classified 6 different habitats in the reef flats of Bitung-Bentena with map which had accuracy of 73.6%. The total area of brown seaweeds was approximately 127.1 ha. Meanwhile, from 53 field transects, there were 6 species of brown seaweed with an average density for all species of 690.4 grams/m2. Thus, the biomass of brown seaweed was 2,133.5 tons wet weight, equal to 29.9 tons of alginate. This study proves that satellite remote sensing is an effective and efficient tool for such kind of works, and must be continued along the entire of Indonesian coastal zones. In this study, the preliminary results on extracting alginate from brown seaweed are also presented. (C) 2016 The Authors.

J	Alphan, H; Guvensoy, L				Alphan, Hakan; Guvensoy, Laden			DETECTING COASTAL URBANIZATION AND LAND USE CHANGE IN SOUTHERN TURKEY	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT												One of the most important needs in contemporary landscape planning is quantitative land use/land cover (LU/LC) change information. The reason a strong emphasis is placed on landscape change information is that it serves as an ecological and geographical basis for preparing and implementing development plans in a more sustainable manner. Multi-temporal analysis of LU/LC changes on the Eastern Mediterranean coast of Turkey revealed that there is a marked preference for these areas primarily for building development. This paper demonstrates a methodology that relies on quantitative analysis techniques for assessing spatiotemporal changes in LU/LC in the case of the eastern Mediterranean coast of Turkey. In this respect, satellite image datasets (SPOT panchromatic, Landsat TM) acquired in 1989, 1995, 2001 and 2007 were enhanced. Resulting images were classified and compared to detect coastal urbanization and development trends. Post-classification change analyses were employed to quantify land cover conversions in three periods from 1985 to 1995, from 1995 to 2001 and from 2001 to 2007. This paper demonstrated that urban, agriculture and shrublands changed rapidly in this part of the Mediterranean coast.																	1648-6897	1822-4199					2016	24	2					97	107		10.3846/16486897.2016.1113976								WOS:000377467400003

Estimation of TSM plays a vital role in monitoring, evaluating, and protecting water quality. Many empirical and semianalytical models have been established for clear open ocean waters or extremely turbid coasts/lakes. However, few are generally applicable to inland, optically complex, deep waters. Using data sets of observed in situ data for the slightly turbid water of the Xin'anjiang Reservoir, we developed a semianalytical algorithm to estimate the TSM concentration for slightly turbid waters (TSM < 25 mg L-1; TSM/Chla < 2.2 x 10(3)) [chlorophyll a (Chla)] using [R-rs(542)(-1) -R-rs(600)(-1)] x R-rs (668), (R-rs: remote sensing reflectance), with a coefficient of determination (R-2) > 0.9 and a normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) < 12%. The semianalytical model was then applied to 14 Landsat 8 OLI images from December 2013 to April 2015, with R-2 = 0.85 and NRMSE = 23%, indicating the feasibility of the semianalytical model for estimating TSM. The TSM concentration estimated from Landsat 8 OLI data in the Xin'anjiang Reservoir exhibited a significant spatial and seasonal difference. The spatial heterogeneity, significantly higher in incoming rivers than the main body of the reservoir, was due to watershed inputs and anthropogenic dredging activity. The temporal heterogeneity of TSM, significantly higher in summer and autumn than in winter and spring, was mainly caused by the seasonal rainfall and seasonal growth of phytoplankton. Our study showed that the semianalytical model for Landsat 8 OLI images could be used to quantitatively monitor TSM in slightly turbid, inland waters.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				JAN	2016	9	1					398	413		10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2509469								WOS:000370541400040						
J	Abdullah, MM; Feagin, RA; Musawi, L; Whisenant, S; Popescu, S				Abdullah, Meshal M.; Feagin, Rusty A.; Musawi, Layla; Whisenant, Steven; Popescu, Sorin			The use of remote sensing to develop a site history for restoration planning in an arid landscape	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Developing a site history and ecological site description is one of the critical steps in restoration planning for arid landscapes. This study focuses on Umm Nigga, Northeast of Kuwait, which was damaged by various human activities. The northern portion of Umm Nigga falls within the boundaries of the demilitarized zone (DMZ) adjacent to Iraq, and was fenced off to restrict public access since 1994. The central objective of this project was to use remote sensing, field assessment, and Geographical Information System (GIS) spatial data to develop a site history for restoration planning of Umm Nigga. Field observation and GIS analysis indicated that the landscape could be divided into three units along a gradient ranging from the coast to inland locations, based on geology, soil properties, and dominant vegetation. Reference sites in the DMZ were also matched for each unit. Remote sensing was used to compare vegetation cover between damaged and reference sites at selected units. Results showed that vegetation cover increased in the unfenced damaged site after the 1991 Gulf War from 2% in 1988 to 37% in 1998, but then it decreased to 23% in 2013. In the DMZ reference site, the vegetation cover also increased from 0% in 1988 to 40% in 1998, but it continued increasing through 2013 to 64%. We conclude that overgrazing and destructive camping are the major source of disturbance in the damaged areas.

J	Sun, SJ; Hu, CM; Tunnel, JW				Sun, Shaojie; Hu, Chuanmin; Tunnel, John W., Jr.			Surface oil footprint and trajectory of the Ixtoc-I oil spill determined from Landsat/MSS and CZCS observations	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												The Ixtoc-I oil spill occurred in 1979 in shallow waters (50 m) of the Bay of Campeche, Mexico. Although it is known that a large portion of the released oil from this second largest accidental marine oil spill in history reached the surface, to date there has been no attempt to document the surface footprint and trajectory of the released oil. Our study attempts to fill this knowledge gap using remote sensing data collected by Landsat/MSS and CZCS. Both showed the same general patterns of oil trajectory to the northwest and north, nearly parallel to the coastline of the western Gulf of Mexico (GoM) with possible oil landing on Mexican and Texas beaches. Field observations at selected beaches and islands along the coast of the western and southern GoM during and after the spill confirmed these satellite-based findings, which were also used to help in planning a recent field campaign to collect sediment samples in the southern GoM.

An accurate and robust method to extract water bodies is critical to effectively manage these irreplaceable resources. Conventional methods are frequently limited in terms of the uncertainty related to the coarse resolution and regional reflectance heterogeneity of satellite images. The fuzzy clustering method (FCM) considering local spatial information has a proven capability to compensate for these limitations. Nevertheless, this technique is highly sensitive to immense false signals in original satellite images. Therefore, a systematic surface water extraction method by taking advantage of the complementarity between a water index (WI) and a modified FCM (WIMFCM) was designed in this study to improve the water extraction accuracy, the rationale of which is a background reflectance bias correction. Applications were performed to sixteen test sites varying from coasts to inland waters to comprehensively evaluate the reliability of the WIMFCM using the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. Results showed the WIMFCM improved the accuracy of water extraction in comparison to alternative methods in terms of kappa coefficients (KCs) and total classification errors (TEs). Overall, the mean KC of the WIMFCM was 0.94 and its mean TE was 1139%, compared with original WI (KC = 0.89, TE = 19.84%) and a support vector machine (SVM) method (KC = 0.89, TE = 22.39%). In addition, a seasonal analysis revealed the WIMFCM could maintain consistent reliability throughout the year, demonstrating its potential for accurate dynamic water monitoring associated with seasonal water probability mask. Additional tests using Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data revealed the WIMFCM could be extended to large-scale regions, as well as be used in near-real time surface water body extraction. The findings of this study offer a new method to improve target detection accuracy under reflectance heterogeneous environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Guneroglu, A				Guneroglu, Abdulaziz			Coastal changes and land use alteration on Northeastern part of Turkey	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT					3rd International Symposium on Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM)	OCT 14-18, 2014	Marmara Res Ctr, Antalya, TURKEY		Marmara Res Ctr			Coasts, not only today but throughout history, have been valuable, important and attractive areas for mankind. Unfortunately, the link between coasts and user has not been stayed in balance due to growing pressure from increasingly diverse human activities. Anthropogenic pressure on coastal areas is rising because of the fact that people are tend to settle by the coast for some reasons such as better transportation, nutrition and commerce. Many conflicts were observed during the establishment of mega cities on coastal zones. Unfortunately, sustainability is generally neglected through the solution process of the coastal problems. Even though, it is a relatively late step, the recent initiatives have a potential to decrease the anthropogenic pressure on coastal zones in Turkey. To achieve the best management strategy, there should be a well established connection between science and policy. Therefore novel technologies should be used for better monitoring and mapping the coastal zones. Coastline mapping is one of the fundamental steps of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) planning. In this study, coastal zone of the Trabzon city which comprises approximately 110 km length including central district and 9 coastal counties was investigated in terms of decadal coastline changes and associated land use/cover (LULC) types. Automatic extraction of the coastline was achieved by applying proposed methodology on multispectral Landsat TM/ETM images. To obtain the LULC classes, Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was implemented and four classes, water, vegetation, impervious surface and bare soil were identified. Finally all graphical data was transferred and analyzed within GIS environment. The coastline changes were evaluated by using a GIS tool of Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). DSAS results revealed that, the net coastline change was reached up to 88.2 m in central region of Trabzon. It was found that during the time span (1984-2011) coastal agricultural lands were intentionally converted to impervious surfaces. The ratio analyses of the study area showed that impervious surface area was doubled for the last 27 years. The coastal zone of the region can be characterized with "accretion" type zone. The geomorphologic character, linear-littoral development of the city and recently completed North Anatolian highway might be dominant effects in shaping the coastal zone character. In conclusion, decadal change analyses prove that the coastal zone of the city is under severe anthropogenic effects as it can be observed in some other coasts of Turkey. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ozturk, D; Sesli, FA				Ozturk, Derya; Sesli, Faik Ahmet			Shoreline change analysis of the Kizilirmak Lagoon Series	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT					3rd International Symposium on Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM)	OCT 14-18, 2014	Marmara Res Ctr, Antalya, TURKEY		Marmara Res Ctr			Comprising many small and large lagoons, the Kizilirmak Lagoon Series is located in the Kizilirmak Delta, which is one of the most important wetlands protected by the Ramsar Convention in Turkey. This study examines the changes that have occurred in the shoreline of the Kizilirmak Lagoon Series between 1962 and 2013. Furthermore, shoreline changes in the delta were also determined to discuss whether there is a relationship between the shoreline changes in the Kizilirmak Delta and lagoons. The shorelines in 1962, 1974, 1987 and 2013 were used to analyze the shoreline changes. Landsat-MSS/TM/OLI satellite images and 1/100,000 topographic maps were used to measure the shorelines. The changes in area, shoreline length and the shoreline development index (SDI) were compared to determine the changes in the lagoon shorelines, and the changed and unchanged parts of the lagoon areas were spatially analyzed using polygon overlay analysis. The Net Shoreline Movement (NSM), End Point Rate (EPR) and Shoreline Change Envelope (SCE) methods were used to determine the changes in the delta shoreline. The results showed that the lagoons tended to shrink in the periods when the Kizilirmak River carried abundant amounts of sediment, prior to the construction of the Altinkaya and Derbent Dams between 1962 and 1987. However, after the construction of the dams, between 1987 and 2013, the delta development stopped due to the disruption of the sediment flow to the delta. As a result, coastal erosion occurred due to an increase in wind and wave erosion, which led to narrowing of the barrier spit in front of the lagoons along the eastern coasts of the delta. The maximum erosion along the coasts of the delta was 827 m, and the total shrinkage in lagoon areas was 963.7 ha between 1962 and 2013. This study reveals that it is crucial to take necessary measures to sustainably manage the Kizilirmak Lagoon Series, which is highly important for the delta ecosystem. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Habitat mapping is a key step to monitor the spatio-temporal dynamics of vegetation and detect on-going changes. However, it is still a challenge to produce reliable vegetation maps at the regional scale. This study aims to evaluate the potential of new Landsat-8 imageries (acquired in September and December 2013) for mapping fine-grained plant communities in coastal marshlands. Field-based vegetation maps were collected for 270 km of marshlands along the French Atlantic coast. In order to be identifiable on the satellite image, fine-grained vegetation units were aggregated into fewer plant community combinations. The classification accuracy was assessed by comparison with field-based vegetation data and compared between the supervised methods used, including Minimum Distance, Mahalanobis, Maximum Likelihood, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine. The best result was obtained with the Maximum Likelihood classifier and by combining the two Landsat-8 images (85.9 % accuracy overall). Three main habitat types dominated the coastal Atlantic marshlands: croplands, Trifolio maritimae-Oenantheto silaifoliae geosigmetum and Puccinellio maritimae-Arthrocnemeto fruticosi geosigmetum. The reliability of the vegetation map produced will provide a good basis for monitoring the conservation status of the various habitats.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				DEC	2015	35	6					1043	1054		10.1007/s13157-015-0693-8								WOS:000365749900003

An assessment is presented on the capabilities and limitations of utilizing Landsat Thematic Mapper data for mapping mangrove species and stand age structure in the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve. The cloud-free subset satellite images used in this study were acquired in May 1988, February 1995, December 1999, March 2001, December 2009 and November 2013. The December 1999 Landsat 7 ETM+ image was used for the error and accuracy assessment because it coincided with the year the reference map was produced. The image classification process included both pixel-based and object-based approaches conducted on a combination of software which included ENVI, ArcGIS 10.1 and eCognition. Results revealed that the pixel-based approach was not effective in delineating species and stand age structure due to the presence of the 'salt and pepper effect' in the image output. The object-based approach accurately delineated between commercial and non-commercial mangrove species. It also produced a reliable and accurate stand-age structure map based on three designated classes: clear-felled areas; young mangrove forest (less than 13 years old); and mature mangrove forest (13 years or older). The analysis highlights that the mapping and analysis of mangrove species and stand age structure with Landsat Thematic Mapper image datasets can play a useful role in achieving cost-efficient and ecologically sustainable outcomes in a production mangrove forest.

However, remote estimation of leaf and canopy biochemical properties and vegetation condition remains challenging. In this paper, we (i) tested the performance of selected hyperspectral and broad band indices to predict chlorophyll concentration (CC) on mangrove leaves and (ii) showed the potential of Landsat 8 for estimation of mangrove CC at the landscape level. Relative leaf CC and leaf spectral response were measured at 12 Elementary Sampling Units (ESU) distributed along the northwest coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Linear regression models and coefficients of determination were computed to measure the association between CC and spectral response. At leaf level, the narrow band indices with the largest correlation with CC were Vogelmann indices and the MTCI (R2> 0.5). Indices with spectral bands around the red edge (705-753 nm) were more sensitive to mangrove leaf CC. At the ESU level Landsat 8 NDVI green, which uses the green band in its formulation explained most of the variation in CC (R-2 > 0.8). Accuracy assessment between estimated CC and observed CC using the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method yielded a root mean squared error (RMSE) = 15 mu g center dot cm(-2), and R2 = 0.703. CC maps showing the spatiotemporal variation of CC at landscape scale were created using the linear model. Our results indicate that Landsat 8 NDVI green can be employed to estimate CC in large mangrove areas where ground networks cannot be applied, and mapping techniques based on satellite data, are necessary. Furthermore, using upcoming technologies that will include two bands around the red edge such as Sentinel 2 will improve mangrove monitoring at higher spatial and temporal resolutions.																	2072-4292					NOV	2015	7	11					14530	14558		10.3390/rs71114530								WOS:000366185200012

Decadal shoreline assessment using remote sensing along the central Odisha coast, India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												One of the major requirements of planning coastal protection works is to understand the processes of erosion, deposition, sediment transport, flooding and sea level changes which continuously alter the shoreline. Significant erosion can affect the stability and productivity of aquatic environment which may have severe implications for coastal inhabitants. The middle coastal plains of Odisha State on the east coast of India were investigated for morphological assessment of shoreline. Accurate demarcations of shorelines were carried out at parts of Odisha coast specifically along Gahirmatha, Paradip and coast above Devi River to quantify erosion and accretion at annual to decadal scale for the years 1990, 2000 and 2012. Satellite-derived remote sensing data (Landsat and IRS P6) were used in the study. Digital shoreline analysis system discovered the eroded and accreted parts of the study area. Gahirmatha and coast above Devi River experienced heavy erosion during 2000-2012 compared with 1990-2000, whereas Paradip coast has comparatively undergone accretion during 2000-2012. Some accreted spots are identified nearby river mouths, which are attributed to heavy accretion of eroded materials by the action of sediment transport. The detailed analysis reveals a maximum erosion of 124, 33 and 154 m in a decade at Gahirmatha, Paradip and coast above Devi River, respectively. Southern parts of Gahirmatha coast showed highly dynamic behavior near Hukitola Bay and Barrier Island and are acting as a natural breakwater to conserve the shoreline. This region had undergone severe geomorphologic changes due to natural as well as human interventions and poses a threat. This coast exhibits unique reasons for erosion with various degrees of combinations of sediment depletion, human activities, high frequency of cyclones and floods, sea level rise, etc. This study concludes that the shoreline of Odisha coast is under heavy erosion and needs scientific and management attention.

Landslide scar/soil erodibility mapping using Landsat TM/ETM+ bands 7 and 3 Normalised Difference Index: A case study of central region of Kenya	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Landsat series multispectral remote sensing imagery has gained increasing attention in providing solutions to environmental problems such as land degradation which exacerbate soil erosion and landslide disasters in the case of rainfall events. Multispectral data has facilitated the mapping of soils, land-cover and structural geology, all of which are factors affecting landslide occurrence. The main aim of this research was to develop a methodology to visualize and map past landslides as well as identify land degradation effects through soil erosion and land-use using remote sensing techniques in the central region of Kenya. The study area has rugged terrain and rainfall has been the main source of landslide trigger. The methodology comprised visualizing landslide scars using a False Colour Composite (FCC) and mapping soil erodibility using FCC components applying expert based classification. The components of the FCC were: the first independent component (IC1), Principal Component (PC) with most geological information, and a Normalised Difference Index (NDI) involving Landsat TM/ETM+ band 7 and 3. The FCC components formed the inputs for knowledge-based classification with the following 13 classes: runoff, extreme erosions, other erosions, landslide areas, highly erodible, stable, exposed volcanic rocks, agriculture, green forest, new forest regrowth areas, clear, turbid and salty water. Validation of the mapped landslide areas with field GPS locations of landslide affected areas showed that 66% of the points coincided well with landslide areas mapped in the year 2000. The classification maps showed landslide areas on the steep ridge faces, other erosions in agricultural areas, highly erodible zones being already weathered rocks, while runoff were mainly fluvial deposits. Thus, landuse and rainfall processes play a major role in inducing landslides in the study area. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Resolution vs. image quality in pre-tsunami imagery used for tsunami impact models in Aceh, Indonesia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Land cover roughness coefficients (LCRs) have been used in multivariate spatial models to test the mitigation potential of coastal vegetation to reduce impacts of the 2004 tsunami in Aceh, Indonesia. Previously, a Landsat 2002 satellite imagery was employed to derive land cover maps, which were then combined with vegetation characteristics, i.e., stand height, stem diameter and planting density to obtain LCRs. The present study tested LCRs extracted from 2003 and 2004 Landsat (30m) images as well as a combination of 2003 and 2004 higher spatial resolution SPOT (10 m) imagery, while keeping the previous vegetation characteristics. Transects along the coast were used to extract land cover, whenever availability and visibility allowed. These new LCRs applied in previously developed tsunami impact models on wave outreach, casualties and damages confirmed previous findings regarding distance to the shoreline as a main factor reducing tsunami impacts. Nevertheless, the models using the new LCRs did not perform better than the original one. Particularly casualties models using 2002 LCRs performed better (delta AIC >2) than the more recent Landsat and SPOT counterparts. Cloud cover at image acquisition for Landsat and low area coverage for SPOT images decreased statistical predictive power (fewer observations). Due to the large spatial heterogeneity of tsunami characteristics as well as topographic and land-use features, it was more important to cover a larger area. Nevertheless, if more land cover classes would be referenced and high resolution imagery with low cloud cover would be available, the full benefits of higher spatial resolution imagery used to extract more precise land use roughness coefficients could be exploited.

It covers the area from the Bernam River basin in south Perak to the Linggi River basin in Negri Sembilan. The analysis of the land use change patterns and the prediction of future changes can highlight the problems of continuing current pattern of growth. Kuala Langat as the case study is located in the strategic area, because this area is identified as a Klang Valley II. The district has been experiencing rapid development, influence by some fast growing new centers like Kuala Lumpur International Airport, Klang Valley, Cyberjaya, Putrajaya and Kuala Lumpur mega-urban region. These have caused degradations of the natural habitats located in this area such as forests, peat swamp, mangroves and wetlands and land use changes from forest and agriculture to development areas. Also some sensitive area such as reclaimed lands, geo-disaster area, flash flood prone areas, dumping grounds and high erosion area need urgent sustainable plan for future development. Also, coastal lands are being developed very fast through establishments of residential, industrial and commercial centers. The analysis of land use changes have led to a better understanding in exploring suitable growth pattern for future development. The land use map obtained from Department of Agriculture for the year 1974 and 1981 and data of Landsat TM for the years of 1988, 1991, 1996 and 2010 obtained from the Malaysian Center for Remote Sensing were analyzed using GIS. From the investigation of land use changes detection over 35 years, the current unsustainable pattern of growth was highlighted. This emphasizes the urgent need for a sustainable development plan.																	1387-585X	1573-2975				OCT	2015	17	5					1003	1016		10.1007/s10668-014-9585-y								WOS:000361483600003

Remote monitoring of giant kelp biomass and physiological condition: An evaluation of the potential for the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) mission	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												This study examines the potential of the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) mission for monitoring the biomass and physiological condition of giant kelp forests on local to global scales. Giant kelp is a highly dynamic foundation species that supports an ecologically and economically important ecosystem found throughout the globe. Satellite, airborne, and field data are used to evaluate the suitability of HyspIRI's spatial, temporal, and spectral coverage for capturing variability in giant kelp biomass and physiological state. We analyze a 28-year time series of giant kelp biomass derived from Landsat satellite imagery in order to identify the dominant temporal modes of variability in giant kelp biomass using the California coast as a model region likely to be relevant to other regions of the globe. Temporal variability in California kelp canopy biomass is compared to the expected availability of cloud-free HyspIRI Visible Shortwave Infrared (VSWIR) views for regions of the world that contain giant kelp populations. Spectral variability is explored by assessing how changes in the physiological condition of giant kelp canopy are exhibited in the reflectance and transmittance of kelp fronds. We compare chlorophyll a to carbon ratios (Chl:C) of kelp fronds collected off the coast of California to laboratory and airborne measurements of hyperspectral reflectance in order to develop metrics of kelp physiological condition. The seasonal cycle dominates giant kelp canopy biomass temporal variability. However, the strength and timing of this cycle varies in both space and time. Our projections of cloud-free HyspIRI coverage indicate that the sensor will be able to capture at least 1 cloud free view each season for nearly all of the global giant kelp habitats, thereby illustrating that HyspIRI will resolve the dominant seasonal cycles in giant kelp biomass. A novel spectral index developed here from field observations explained 76% of the variance in Chl:C and was applied to hyperspectral aircraft observations. These results demonstrate that the spatial, temporal, and spectral coverage provided by HyspIRI has the potential to provide new insights into the ecology and biophysiology of giant kelp.

J	Jo, YH; Sha, J; Kwon, JI; Jun, K; Park, J				Jo, Young-Heon; Sha, Jin; Kwon, Jae-Il; Jun, Kicheon; Park, Jinku			Mapping bathymetry based on waterlines observed from low altitude Helikite remote sensing platform	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												Mapping shoreline changes along coastal regions is critically important in monitoring continuously rising sea surface heights due to climate change and frequent severe storms. Thus, it is especially important if the region has very high tidal ranges over very gentle tidal flats, which is a very vulnerable region. Although the various remote sensing platforms can be used to map shoreline changes, the spatial and temporal resolutions are not enough to obtain it for a short time. Accordingly, in this study we introduce the newly developed low altitude Helikite remote sensing platform to achieve much better resolutions of shorelines and a bathymetry. The Helikite stands for Helium balloon and Kite, which is a kind of aerial platform that uses the advantages of both a Helium balloon and a kite. Field experiments were conducted in the Jaebu Island, off the coast of the west Korean Peninsula in January 29, 2011. In order to extract shorelines from the consecutive images taken by the low altitude Helikite remote sensing platform, active contours without edges (ACWE) is used. Edges or boundaries exist primarily on places between one type of objective and the other. Since the hydrodynamic pressure has an effect everywhere, the locations of the waterlines can be the isobath lines. We could map several waterlines, which would enable us to complete a local bathymetry map ranges from 35 to 60 cm depth. The error resulting from applying ACWE algorithm to the imagery to determine the waterline is approximately less than 1 m. Therefore, it is very unique way to obtain such high resolutions of bathymetry with high accuracy for the regions of extremely high tidal ranges for a short time.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				SEP	2015	34	9					110	116		10.1007/s13131-015-0730-8								WOS:000360819600013						
J	Jones, R				Jones, Rebekah			Quantifying Extreme Weather Event Impacts on the Northern Gulf Coast Using Landsat Imagery	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Recent high-profile hurricanes have demonstrated the destructiveness of extreme events on coastal landscapes to the world. Barrier islands across the planet are disappearing, exposing vulnerable coastal cities to the damage caused by extreme events. Growing resolve among scientists regarding climate change's connection to tropical cyclones heightens the concern around intensifying extremes and landscape dynamics. This study uses more than 600 Landsat images to examine the role of extreme events on barrier island morphology on three of the Mississippi-Alabama barrier islands from 1972 to 2013. Each island, West Ship Island (WSI), East Ship Island (ESI), and Petit Bois Island (PBI), was measured for area in hectares 14 times per year on average with higher temporal resolution before and after hurricanes, allowing for a high-resolution statistical history of surface area change and the quantification of the impact of extreme weather events. The results reveal that extreme events, specifically hurricanes, mid-latitude cyclones, and thunderstorms, shape the islands more than gradual erosion and accretion processes across all islands. Thunderstorms, winter cyclones, and tropical cyclones each affect the island in different ways, eroding from different areas upon impact. Catastrophic events caused 52-59% of all land area change on the islands during the study period. Hurricanes caused 27-37% of all change across the islands, thunderstorms 11-13%, and mid-latitude cyclones 11-14%. Each of the islands lost at least one-quarter of its 1972-73 areas: WSI 25%, ESI 39%, and PBI 38%. WSI and ESI are both in post-Katrina (2005) regrowth periods, whereas PBI continues to experience net erosion.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SEP	2015	31	5					1229	1240		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-14-00065.1								WOS:000360936200019

In this paper, the combination of Landsat images and shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM) surface model data is shown to provide a solid base to assess gross elevational trends in wide beach-ridge systems. The tilt of a strand plain is a useful first indication to assess possible scenarios of long-term relative sea-level development at new field sites. We identified morphological landscape units for a large and complex coastal lagoon system in NE Patagonia (Argentina) on the basis of a series of Landsat satellite images. A good correlation (R-2 - 0.92) was found for the comparison of high-resolution GPS data with the extracted corresponding SRTM elevations of a 3.8-km-long transect across a wide strand plain. This suggests that the surface model is able to reproduce changes in average elevation between distal and proximal beach-ridge sets at a relatively high accuracy. The SRTM data set is a source of freely available data to approach elevation trends in prograded beach-ridge systems in Quaternary coastal environments. The combination of SRTM data with Landsat images presents a useful tool and source of information for the preparation of fieldwork and detailed surveys as well as for the formulation of working hypotheses in poorly described areas.

However, it is more difficult to determine environmental changes in the vicinity of tidal flats and coastal areas that are a considerable distance from the project. To identify any unexpected environmental impacts of the construction of Saemangeum Dyke in the area, we examined morphological changes identified by satellite-based observations through a field survey on Gomso Bay tidal flats (15 km from Saemangeum Dyke), and changes in the suspended sediment distribution identified by satellite-based observations through a hydrodynamic analysis in the Saemangeum and Gomso coastal area. We argue that hydrodynamic changes due to conventional coastal engineering can affect the sedimentation pattern in the vicinity of tidal flats. We suggest that the environmental impact assessment conducted before a conventional coastal engineering project should include a larger area than is currently considered. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we (1) review the current status of the diversity and distribution of coastal ecosystems in BCS, (2) assess the composition and coverage of these ecosystems in PNAs, and (3) identify coastal ecosystems of special interest for conservation. The combination of spatial analysis techniques was carried out using LandSat TM images and GIS processing, considering ecoregions and ecosystems in the coastal zone, as well as through the application of an ecosystem diversity index. In the BCS coastal zone, 11 ecosystems were identified: scrub, coastal water body, riparian, bare soil, halophyte, beach, salt flat, mangrove, salt marsh, coral reef, and seagrass. The ecosystem diversity in BCS results from the coastal features that differentiate the Pacific and the Gulf coasts. PNAs include 17 % of coastal ecosystems. Bahia Magdalena (Pacific) and Bahia Concepcin (Gulf of California), which are key for conservation (including mangroves and seagrasses), should be considered either for classification as PNAs or for inclusion in coastal management programs. The combination of remote sensing and GIS with biogeographic and ecosystemic approaches in our study enabled to determine ecosystem diversity and set coastal conservation priorities in Baja California Sur, Mexico. Specifically, coastal ecosystems that are not currently included within PNAs and which should be considered as conservation priorities were identified.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				AUG	2015	19	4					609	619		10.1007/s11852-015-0411-y								WOS:000362017900015						
J	Wang, H; Xu, XG; Zhu, GR				Wang, Hui; Xu, Xuegong; Zhu, Gaoru			Landscape Changes and a Salt Production Sustainable Approach in the State of Salt Pan Area Decreasing on the Coast of Tianjin, China	SUSTAINABILITY												Landsat images from 1979, 1988, 1999, 2008, and 2013 were used to analyze the landscape area change of salt pans lying on the coast of Tianjin. While initially (1979-1988), the area of Tianjin's salt pan increased, later (1988-2013) it declined dramatically. In the first phase (1979-1988) of the studied period the primary roll-in landscape of the salt pan wasbarren land with an area of 60.0 km(2). By 1988, the area of Tianjin's salt pan rose to 457.8 km(2). The main roll-out landscape of the salt pan during 1988-2013 was urban, barren land, village/town, harbor, and road whose area amounted to 69.8, 35.9, 27.3, 25.5 and 18.4 km(2) respectively. The roll-out barren land will be transformed to construction land ultimately. By 2013, the total loss reached 167.3 km(2), which was 36.5% of the salt pan area of Tianjin in 1988. With the development of coastal economy, the salterns with a lower economic value were transformed to and replaced by land use types with a higher economic value. This trend would influence the production of sea salt and the development of sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate industries. Seawater desalination provides an opportunity for the restoration and compensation of salt production capacity. Based on the theory of circular economy and industrial symbiosis, in this article an industrial symbiosis model for sea salt production and sea water desalination is explored: mariculture-power plant cooling-seawater desalination-Artemia culture-bromide extraction-sea salt production-salt chemical industry. Through the application of this process sustainable development of the sea salt production in Tianjin could be achieved.																	2071-1050					AUG	2015	7	8					10078	10097		10.3390/su70810078								WOS:000361600400020

According to differences in Landsat drought indices for plant water stress and vegetation green cover (NDWI and NDVI, respectively), the geographic areas within the study region that were most severely impacted by the 2013 drought were the inland Carmel Valley in northern Monterey County and the coastal zones around San Simeon Point and Cambria in northern San Luis Obispo County. An expanded area of severe vegetation moisture stress, generally indicated by relative-differenced NDWI values of > 400, was detected by May 2014 in both of these same geographic areas. For more detailed examination of drought impacts, the entire study region was separated into the 3 predominant vegetation types (grasslands, shrublands, and forests) to examine changes in Landsat NDWI and NDVI in the context of differing plant community responses to severe drought. Results confirmed that higher overall drought stress in 2013 and 2014 was detected in grasslands, compared to shrublands and forests, in both years at all elevations and slopes > 200 m and > 5%, respectively.																	1527-0904	1944-8341				AUG	2015	75	2					129	145		10.3398/064.075.0202								WOS:000360978700001

With the eutrophication of water bodies, cyanobacterial blooms and their toxins are becoming increasingly prevalent in France, especially in the Brittany region. Cyanobacteria are monitored at only a few recreational sites, preventing an estimation of exposure of the human population. By contrast, phosphorus, a limiting nutrient for cyanobacterial growth and thus considered a good proxy for cyanobacteria exposure, is monitored in many but not all surface water bodies. Our goal was to develop a geographic exposure indicator that could be used in epidemiological research. We considered the total phosphorus (TP) concentration (mg/L) of samples collected between October 2007 and September 2012 at 179 monitoring stations distributed throughout the Brittany region. Using readily available spatial data, we computed environmental descriptors at the watershed level with a Geographic Information System. Then, these descriptors were introduced into a backward stepwise linear regression model to predict the median TP concentration in unmonitored surface water bodies. TP concentrations in surface water follow an increasing gradient from West to East and inland to coast. The empirical concentration model included five predictor variables with a fair coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.51). The specific total runoff and the watershed slope correlated negatively with the TP concentrations (p = 0.01 and p < 10(-9), respectively), whereas positive associations were found for the proportion of built-up area, the upstream presence of sewage treatment plants, and the algae volume as indicated by the Landsat red/green reflectance ratio (p < 0.01, p < 10(-6) and p < 0.01, respectively). Complementing the monitoring networks, this geographical modeling can help estimate TP concentrations at the watershed level, delivering a proxy for cyanobacteria exposure that can be used along with other risk factors in further ALS epidemiologic case-control studies.

J	Feng, YJ; Liu, Y; Liu, D				Feng, Yongjiu; Liu, Yan; Liu, Dan			Shoreline mapping with cellular automata and the shoreline progradation analysis in Shanghai, China from 1979 to 2008	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												This paper presents a cellular automata (CA) algorithm to extract shorelines from remote sensing images by analysing the edge directional information of the images. Using this algorithm, the tide-coordinated shorelines along the entire coast in Shanghai Municipality of China were extracted and analysed using the multi-temporal Landsat TM images from 1979 to 2008. The shorelines of four sub-regions, including the mainland and three islands (Changxing, Hengsha and Chongming) were analysed along with six areas experiencing drastic shoreline changes. The results show a total progradation of 551.7 km(2) along the coastal area of Shanghai over the past 30 years, due to both long-term sediment deposition and short-term land reclamation. Furthermore, both horizontal and vertical displacements along the shorelines were identified. Fractal analyses between the length of the shorelines and the spatial resolution of the images achieved goodness-of-fit (R-2) values above 0.6 for the shorelines of the entire Shanghai as well as for each of the four subregions, indicating that the relationship between the length of the shorelines and the spatial resolution of the images accord with the power laws. The fractal dimension values indicate that the shorelines of both Changxing and Chongming Islands were getting regular. The paper also demonstrates that the CA-based shoreline extractor can detect shoreline information of both artificial and muddy coasts from remote sensing images. The shoreline extraction and change analysis tool is valuable not only for shoreline mapping but also for comprehensive coastal management.

The method relies on image processing techniques using the IDRISI software, and the Digital Shoreline Analysis System, a free extension for ArcGIS software, which provides a set of tools permitting transects-based calculation of shoreline displacement. First, the Landsat images were radiometrically and geometrically corrected. Second, band ratioing, reclassification, raster to vector conversion, and smoothing techniques are applied successively to detect and extract the multi-temporal shoreline data. Third, these data are overlaid and the changes are calculated using the end points and linear regression methods. The results indicate significant shoreline changes ranging from 8.6 to -42.6 m/year, while some parts remained unchanged. The estimated shoreline change rates are comparable with those obtained through in situ measurements and from the analysis of multi-date aerial photos and toposheets. The main causes of erosion in particular are related to the natural shifting of the Medjerda River course and mouth, damming of Medjerda and its tributaries, construction of Ghar El Melh port, and the destruction of the small bordering dunes in addition to the wave-induced longshore currents, relative sea level rise due mainly to accelerated coastal subsidence, and sand mining.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				JUN	2015	8	6					4239	4255		10.1007/s12517-014-1472-1								WOS:000355336800069

Morphometric analysis of the River Thamirabarani sub-basin in Kanyakumari District, South west coast of Tamil Nadu, India, using remote sensing and GIS	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The quantitative analysis of the drainage morphometric system is vital to understand the hydrological and environmental interaction and its processes of an area. The present study deals with quantitative characteristics of morphometry of steep slope and short length sub-basin of R. Thamirabarani in Kanyakumari District, Tamilnadu, India, using geospatial technology. In this study, the digital elevation model data product (ASTER DEM), Landsat ETM+ image and Survey of India topographical map were used to delineate slope, relief and drainage system structures such as drainage pattern, stream order, stream network and stream length of the sub-basin using ArcGIS 9.3 software. The morphometric analysis deals with hydrologic processes such as stream frequency, bifurcation ratio, circulatory ratio and length of overland flow of the sub-basin area and their influences on the local morphologic landforms. The quantitative measurement of these characteristics is used to explore the basin's contribution to the hydrological cycle and the shape, size and formation of the local landscapes in the region. Moreover, the hypsometric analysis and denudation rate were estimated for understanding the quantitative geomorphological characteristics of the sub-basin. The relationship of the morphometric parameters reveals that the drainage network is strongly controlled by geological and geomorphological structures of the area. The geometry of streams exhibits dendritic drainage pattern associated with coarse drainage texture in primary order of streams present on hilly terrain surface and semi-dendritic pattern in higher stream order flow on less elevated surface with gentle slope. The drainage density of the study area ranges from 0.1 to 1.89 km/km(2), and the maximum density value was found along the higher stream order. The mean bifurcation ratio of this area is 4.21 and the high ratio was measured between the third and fourth order of stream segments. The morphometry of this area is depicted by the length of the stream segment, drainage pattern and stream flow direction, which are influenced by relief, steep slope and local geological structure. Furthermore, the sub-basin is found to be strongly elongated in shape with a length of 42.78 km, and the circularity ratio of this area is measured as 0.33 and elongation ratio as 0.57. The textural dissection of the landforms shows low drainage density in the high elevated hilly terrain in the north and high level in the plain areas in the southern part. The values of the circulatory ratio, length of overland flow and elongation ratio are relatively close to one another and the relationship among them shows their influences on the process of surface runoff and sediment deposition along the estuary landforms in the study area. Moreover, it is observed that the hypsometric curve of this study area is characterized by convex-up shape in nature and represents the youth stage (inequilibrium) of landscapes. Consequently, the hypsometric integral value 0.49 reflects the distribution of a major volume of the landmass (435.32 km(2)) at relatively low elevations (< 180 m). The morphometric parameters-induced denudation rate of this study area is 65.14 t/km(2)/year and indicates the occurrence of a wide range of denudation intensities throughout the sub-basin, which is relatively proportional to the suspended sediment yield that is transported in the suspension per unit area. Based on the realistic output, it is proved that remote sensing and GIS are effective tools for morphometric studies of the drainage basin.

J	Armitage, AR; Highfield, WE; Brody, SD; Louchouarn, P				Armitage, Anna R.; Highfield, Wesley E.; Brody, Samuel D.; Louchouarn, Patrick			The Contribution of Mangrove Expansion to Salt Marsh Loss on the Texas Gulf Coast	PLOS ONE												Landscape-level shifts in plant species distribution and abundance can fundamentally change the ecology of an ecosystem. Such shifts are occurring within mangrove-marsh ecotones, where over the last few decades, relatively mild winters have led to mangrove expansion into areas previously occupied by salt marsh plants. On the Texas (USA) coast of the western Gulf of Mexico, most cases of mangrove expansion have been documented within specific bays or watersheds. Based on this body of relatively small-scale work and broader global patterns of mangrove expansion, we hypothesized that there has been a recent regional-level displacement of salt marshes by mangroves. We classified Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper images using artificial neural networks to quantify black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) expansion and salt marsh (Spartina alterniflora and other grass and forb species) loss over 20 years across the entire Texas coast. Between 1990 and 2010, mangrove area grew by 16.1 km(2), a 74% increase. Concurrently, salt marsh area decreased by 77.8 km(2), a 24% net loss. Only 6% of that loss was attributable to mangrove expansion; most salt marsh was lost due to conversion to tidal flats or water, likely a result of relative sea level rise. Our research confirmed that mangroves are expanding and, in some instances, displacing salt marshes at certain locations. However, this shift is not widespread when analyzed at a larger, regional level. Rather, local, relative sea level rise was indirectly implicated as another important driver causing regional-level salt marsh loss. Climate change is expected to accelerate both sea level rise and mangrove expansion; these mechanisms are likely to interact synergistically and contribute to salt marsh loss.																	1932-6203					MAY 6	2015	10	5							UNSP e0125404	10.1371/journal.pone.0125404								WOS:000354049700066	25946132

Temporal evolution of patterns and processes related to subsidence of the coastal area surrounding the Bevan River mouth (Northern Adriatic) - Italy	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Subsidence is a widespread phenomenon in the Emilia-Romagna, particularly important along the littoral because the coastal system consists of sandy beaches and coastal wetlands, particularly in the area of the Delta Po Plain. The coasts are affected by a marked natural subsidence, because of tectonic processes and recent sediments consolidation. Since the second half of the last century, the subsidence in coastal area has increased significantly due to intense human activity, namely gas extraction and groundwater exploitation. The work presented in this paper aimed at investigating the temporal evolution of patterns and processes on a stretch of coast located between Lido di Dante and Lido di Classe, including the mouth of the Bevano river near Ravenna (Italy), using remotely sensed datasets. An innovative integration of remote sensing and monitoring method (Permanent Scatter Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar PSInSAR, Small BAeline Subset - SBAS and Empirical Orthogonal Function - EOF analysis of 20 years of Landsat) has been used to study the temporal evolution of subsidence and its correlation with natural and anthropogenic causes. Results show an increase of the subsidence rates obtained for the last decade: the amount of subsidence due only to natural causes is typically a few millimetres per year, while the man-induced subsidence reaches values of several millimetres per years. Marshlands reclamation, groundwater pumping for agricultural and industrial purposes and methane extraction from gas fields near the coastline are the principal anthropogenic causes. Subsidence in combination with sea level rise will get worse inundation risk from the rivers and widens the coastal areas affected by storm surges and tidal inundation. This makes subsidence an insidious threat having significant cumulative effects on flood risk or the integrity of water defenses and infrastructure. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Control of Late Holocene Geo-processes on the sustainable development plans of the Tineh Plain, NW Sinai coast, Egypt	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												The Tineh Plain NW Sinai coast has been the subjected of several studies related to its stratigraphy, geoarchaeology, and sustainable development. Recently, the name of the Tineh Plain has emerged following the government of Egypt's decision to establish a new economic project to develop the Suez Canal Sector (Suez Canal Corridor Mega Project). Landsat and SPOT satellite images acquired for years 1984, 2000, 2006, 2008 and 2010 to detect temporal changes coupled with field relations, verification, sampling, analyzing and photographing were conducted. Change detection of LU/LC show six classes; the beach, the wetland (El-Mallaha lagoon), Sabkhas or salt marshes, urban, agriculture, and fish breeding farms. In 1984, the beach (4.2 km(2)), El-Mallaha lagoon (26.4 km(2)), sabkhas or salt marches (236.7 km(2)) were reduced due to expansion of agriculture (120.3 km(2)), fish breeding farms (35.7 km(2)) and controlled by sediment characteristic (salinity and grain size). Accordingly, fish farms grow northward of the Tineh Plain while reclamation and cultivation extends southward. Such activities may threaten the archaeological sits at Tell El-Farama (The City of Pelusium). Three geomorphic units detected, these are the beach, the strand plain, and the deltaic plain. The beach is flat with concavo (accreted) - convex (eroded) shoreline. The strand plain made of accreted beach ridges of very low bundles, set at slight mutual angles, which sometimes truncate one another. The deltaic plain surface composed of intercalations of sand and mud of shoreface, mouth bar, and distributary channel fill. The accreted ridges representing four paleoshorelines related to Late Holocene and dated back to 400-500BP, 1100-1200BP, 1400-1500BP, and 1700-1900BP, those record the Late Holocene history (sea level, floods, and tectonics) of the Tineh Plain. The study area is waiting a plan of sustainable development, it represents phase "A" East Port Said of the Suez Canal Corridor Mega Project. This study raise the alarm of constructing heavy industries and other logistics related to shipping on the fragile environments of the Tineh Plain. This is in fact due to active tectonism, and sediment characteristics. The activities related to agriculture, fish breeding, and salts and food industries are recommended in the framework of sustainable development. It is important to include the Suez Canal Corridor Project a plan to save the ruins of fortifications of Tineh Plain. These are not only Egyptian heritage but also a world one record the history from the Persian invasions of Egypt about 6(th) or 7(th) Century B.C., through the Byzantines in 859-860, the Greeks in 954-955, the Arabic Conquest, and the Crusaders in the 12(th) Century. A cooperation and support from the international organization such as UNESCO should be conducted.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				APR	2015	19	2					141	156		10.1007/s11852-015-0377-9								WOS:000356537700004

In this study, satellite data were used to identify the method for detecting seagrass beds in turbid bay waters and describing temporal changes over the past 24 years. Moreover, we found the cause of seagrass die-off phenomenon by observing the long-term satellite images and evaluating the impact of the typhoon on seagrass beds. All seagrass spectra from different sensors (Landsat TM/ETM+, Aster, Spot-4, and Kompsat-2) have low reflectance in green and high in NIR regions, whereas unvegetated seawater has the opposite spectrum features. A training area in the green band and Mahalanobis Distance Classification algorithm was adopted for classification and mapping of seagrass beds. The error matrix using the in situ reference data for Kompsat-2 image classification was 72.9% accurate. The average area of seagrass beds was 4.6 km(2) from May 1990 to January 2012, and it was consistently >4.0 km(2). A die-off of seagrass beds was observed in September 2012 after Typhoon Bolaven, Tembin, and Sanba consecutively passed the study site. When Typhoon Sanba passed the study site, it had sustained maximum wind speed (147.6 km h(-1)) during low tide, unlike the other typhoons. We found that the water column buffer did not have any effect on resistance of seagrass bed to disturbance, which led to greater damage. Additionally, the three sequential typhoons that passed through during the short time probably produced a cumulative effect. These results allow an understanding of past changes, and reveal the sudden and influential changes in seagrass distribution. As seagrass removal might have negative effect on other associated communities, comprehensive monitoring is required to ensure that disturbed seagrass habitats is recovered naturally.

The dramatic retreatment was observed during the last century. It is basically due to the construction of Aswan High Dam in 1964, which reduced the flow and sediment discharges. In this paper, four Landsat images (two Thematic Mapper and two Enhanced Thematic Mapper) covering the period from 1984 to 2014 were used. These Landsat images were radio-metrically and geometrically corrected, and then, multi-temporal post-classification analysis was performed to detect land cover changes, extracting shoreline positions to estimate shoreline change rates of the Nile delta coast around Rosetta Promontory. This method provides a viable means for examining long-term shoreline changes. Four categories, including seawater, developed (agriculture and urban), sabkhas (salt-flat), and undeveloped areas, were selected to evaluate their temporal changes by comparing the four selected images. Supervised classification technique was used with support vector machine algorithm to detect temporal changes. The overall accuracy assessment of this method ranged from 97% to 100%. In addition, the shoreline was extracted by applying two different techniques. The first method is based on a histogram threshold of Band 5, and the other uses the combination of histogram threshold of Band 5 and two band ratios (Band 2/Band 4 and Band 2/Band 5). For land cover change detection from 1984 to 2014, it was found that the developed area that increased by 9% although the land in the study area has been contracted by 1.6% due to coastal erosion. The shoreline retreat rate has decreased more than 70% from 1984 to 2014. Nevertheless, it still suffers from significant erosion with a maximum rate of 37 m/year. In comparison to ground survey and different remote sensing techniques, the established trend of shoreline change extracted using histogram threshold was found to be closely consistent with these studies rather than combining band ratio with histogram threshold.

J	Disperati, L; Virdis, SGP				Disperati, Leonardo; Virdis, Salvatore Gonario Pasquale			Assessment of land-use and land-cover changes from 1965 to 2014 in Tam Giang-Cau Hai Lagoon, central Vietnam	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												This study integrates the use of multi-source and multi-resolution remote sensing, topographic and field-based datasets to quantify land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes along a coastal stretch of Thua Thien Hue Province (central Vietnam). The LULC change analysis involves the Tam Giang-Cau Hai lagoon, the largest lagoon system in Southeast Asia, which is running nearly 70 km along the coast and having about 22,000 ha of water surface. The LULC change analysis was performed by computer-aided visual interpretation for 5 years (1965, 1989, 2000, 2006 and 2014) using satellite imagery from LANDSAT MSS, TM, ETM and 8, ASTER and SPOTS. National topographic maps were also used for the 1965 and 2000 years. To adequately represent the LULC features and peculiarities of central Vietnam coastal areas, an adapted CORINE Land Cover nomenclature was used where new 3rd and 4th level classes were adopted. Due to their intrinsic relative high spatial and radiometric resolution, SPOTS images from 2006 were assumed as a reference for interpretation keys and first delineation. Changes were mapped by editing those vectors representing features which underwent LULC change prior or after 2006. Spatial and temporal changes were analyzed by post-classification approach and validated by ground truth information. High detail object-based classification was finally performed to infer the capability of medium spatial resolution imagery for extracting cadastral scale pond maps. The accuracy of classification was checked by a polygon by polygon comparison with an existing aquaculture facility inventory. Five LULC maps were obtained by applying a legend of 21 classes including two newly defined: "Aquaculture ponds" and "Mangrove forest". The overall classification accuracy of the LULC map is 85% while the KHAT statistics 0.81 for the year 2006. Accuracy of the object-based aquaculture facilities classification is 84% or better for the SPOTS imagery and 47.9% for the ASTER imagery. The study provides a synoptic LULC representation for the largest lagoon system of Southeast Asia and delivers quantitative estimates of main changes occurred during the last 50 years. Moreover, it reveals the adaptability of the CORINE Land Cover method outside European environment. Finally, SPOTS provides good results to map aquaculture features at cadastral scale, even if in some circumstances (e.g. tidal areas), the integration with higher spatial resolution multispectral sensors should be envisaged.

J	Ghosh, MK; Kumar, L; Roy, C				Ghosh, Manoj Kumer; Kumar, Lalit; Roy, Chandan			Monitoring the coastline change of Hatiya Island in Bangladesh using remote sensing techniques	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												A large percentage of the world's population is concentrated along the coastal zones. These environmentally sensitive areas are under intense pressure from natural processes such as erosion, accretion and natural disasters as well as anthropogenic processes such as urban growth, resource development and pollution. These threats have made the coastal zone a priority for coastline monitoring programs and sustainable coastal management. This research utilizes integrated techniques of remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) to monitor coastline changes from 1989 to 2010 at Hatiya Island, Bangladesh. In this study, satellite images from Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) were used to quantify the spatio-temporal changes that took place in the coastal zone of Hatiya Island during the specified period. The modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) algorithm was applied to TM (1989 and 2010) and ETM (2000) images to discriminate the land-water interface and the on-screen digitizing approach was used over the MNDWI images of 1989, 2000 and 2010 for coastline extraction. Afterwards, the extent of changes in the coastline was estimated through overlaying the digitized maps of Hatiya Island of all three years. Coastline positions were highlighted to infer the erosion/accretion sectors along the coast, and the coastline changes were calculated. The results showed that erosion was severe in the northern and western parts of the island, whereas the southern and eastern parts of the island gained land through sedimentation. Over the study period (1989-2010), this offshore island witnessed the erosion of 6476 hectares. In contrast it experienced an accretion of 9916 hectares. These erosion and accretion processes played an active role in the changes of coastline during the study period. (C) 2014 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).

The salt marshes in the Liao River Delta of China, dominated by Suaeda heteroptera, experienced a dramatic loss in the 1990s and then recovered in the 2000s. This study investigates these changes of salt marsh using a time series of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images acquired in 1988, 1995, 2000, 2004, 2007, and 2009. The classification tree method was used on these TM images to extract S. heteroptera, and an interactive self-organizing data analysis algorithm was used to determine other land cover types. The conversions between salt marsh and other land cover types were described with conversion matrices. The classification results show that, during 1998-2004, salt marsh decreased dramatically at an average rate of 662.68 ha/y. However, during the period 2004-2009, salt marsh recovered gradually at a rate of 115.51 ha/y. The conversion matrix indicates that, from 1988 to 2004, a large area of former salt marsh was directly replaced by man-made landscape types, such as reed field (5111 ha), aquaculture pond (2655 ha), reservoir (1720 ha), and paddy field (729 ha). In contrast, the result for the period from 2004 to 2009 shows that salt marshes were recovered by the conversion of some areas of former barren beaches and river back to salt marsh. Driving forces analysis suggests that salt marsh dynamics were mainly caused by human activities, with the secondary drivers being climatic warming and dry conditions.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				MAR	2015	31	2					371	377		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-13-00056.1								WOS:000350575300014

Therefore, monitoring and forecasting of land-cover changes are important components for sustainable utilization, conservation, and development of these areas. This research has been conducted on Igneada, a legally protected area on the northwest coast of Turkey, which is famous for its unique, mangrove forests. The main focus of this study was to apply a land use and cover model that could quantitatively and graphically present the changes and its impacts on Igneada landscapes in the future. In this study, a Markov chain-based, stochastic Markov model and cellular automata Markov model were used. These models were calibrated using a time series of developed areas derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery between 1990 and 2010 that also projected future growth to 2030. The results showed that CA Markov yielded reliable information better than St. Markov model. The findings displayed constant but overall slight increase of settlement and forest cover, and slight decrease of agricultural lands. However, even the slightest unsustainable change can put a significant pressure on the sensitive ecosystems of Igneada. Therefore, the management of the protected area should not only focus on the landscape composition but also pay attention to landscape configuration.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				MAR	2015	187	3							59	10.1007/s10661-015-4322-z								WOS:000349434900004	25647805

One of the most important water quality parameters that can be assessed in coastal waters and river estuaries using remote sensing techniques is suspended sediment concentration (SSC). It regulates primary production and has substantial influence on the migration of pollutants, temperature, and marine life. In this study, Moderate-Resolution Imagine Spectrometry (MODIS) images were used to retrieve the SSC along the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. MODIS of 250 m resolution data were utilized because they have the highest spatial resolution of all the MODIS bands. In situ data were gathered with multiple campaigns with fast motor boats, while the MODIS sensor was passing over the study area. The goal of this article is to apply artificial neural networks (ANN) to retrieve SSC from satellite remote sensing imagery. ANN function as an intelligent structure to model a variety of nonlinear relationships because iteration-based inversion methods need long computation times for common usage. Using a validation data set and a testing data set, the network could be validated. The learning process was more efficient which resulted in a shorter learning time. The validation data set played a vital role as a stopping criterion during the training procedure to overcome the overtraining problem. A robust relationship between MODIS bands 1 and 2 and in situ data was established based on a three-layer ANN with six neurons in the hidden layer. Root mean squared error and R-2 values for this model were 0.853 and 0.969 mg/L, respectively, for all data. Results of this study reveal that the SSC in the Caspian Sea gradually decreases from west to east.

It is an important indicator to reveal the condition of forest systems and has a significant importance for ecosystem models as a main input. The aim of this study is to estimate the percent tree cover of various forest stands in a Mediterranean environment based on an empirical relationship between tree coverage and remotely sensed data in Goksu Watershed located at the Eastern Mediterranean coast of Turkey. A regression tree algorithm was used to simulate spatial fractions of Pinus nigra, Cedrus libani, Pinus brutia, Juniperus excelsa and Quercus cerris using multi-temporal LANDSAT TM/ETM data as predictor variables and land cover information. Two scenes of high resolution GeoEye-1 images were employed for training and testing the model. The predictor variables were incorporated in addition to biophysical variables estimated from the LANDSAT TM/ETMdata. Additionally, normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) was incorporated to LANDSAT TM/ETM band settings as a biophysical variable. Stepwise linear regression (SLR) was applied for selecting the relevant bands to employ in regression tree process. SLR-selected variables produced accurate results in the model with a high correlation coefficient of 0.80. The output values ranged from 0 to 100 %. The different tree species were mapped in 30 m resolution in respect to elevation. Percent tree cover map as a final output was derived using LANDSAT TM/ETM image over Goksu Watershed and the biophysical variables. The results were tested using high spatial resolution GeoEye-1 images. Thus, the combination of the RT algorithm and higher resolution data for percent tree cover mapping were tested and examined in a complex Mediterranean environment.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				FEB	2015	187	2							4	10.1007/s10661-014-4151-5								WOS:000349012200004	25604062

Remote sensing technology becomes an important approach of monitoring changes in the coastline by virtue of its high efficiency, wide range and low cost. Taking the Beidaihe coast as an example, the coastline extraction of SAR and Landsat TM images is extracted based on the geometrical active contour model. This method through setting the initial contour, regards the movement of contour curve as synthesize of force, and minimizes the energy function. It makes the initial contour approximate to the real object boundary. The result shows that the method can effectively extract the continuous and complete coastline from different kinds of remote sensing images.																			978-1-4799-1717-4				2015							362	366										WOS:000380441000064

Bathymetry data is used to generate navigational charts, seafloor profile, biological oceanography, beach erosion, sea level rise, etc. A number of methods are available for determining ocean bathymetry, using either active sensor such as sonar, lidar or passive multispectral imagery such as Ikonos, WorldView and Landsat. Determining the bathymetry using sonar and LiDAR is very expensive, while Ikonos and Worldview are commercially available multispectral satellite platforms whereas Landsat satellite imagery provides a free and publicly available data. Therefore, the present study makes an attempt to determine the bathymetry mapping of the southwest coast of India (13 degrees 0' 0 '' N and 74 degrees 50' 0 '' E) by applying the ratio transform algorithm on the blue and green bands of Landsat 8 satellite imagery. The statistical indices such as R-2, RMSE and MAE are computed between the algorithm derived value and the hydrographic chart sounding value. The result shows a good correlation between the algorithm derived value and hydrographic chart sounding value. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Estimation of long and short term shoreline changes along Andhra Pradesh coast using Remote Sensing and GIS techniques	8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ASIAN AND PACIFIC COASTS (APAC 2015)	Procedia Engineering				8th International Conference on Asian and Pacific Coasts (APAC 2015)	SEP 07-10, 2015	Chennai, INDIA	IIT Madras, APAC Council, COES, JSCE, KSCOE				Identifying shoreline changes and its variability is a fundamental task for various coastal studies undertaken by coastal scientists, engineers and coastal managers. ICMAM-PD has implemented a national project for monitoring the shoreline changes for entire Indian coast using satellite imageries to maintain a long-term database in GIS environment. In this paper an attempt has been made to implement a "shoreline proxy" for monitoring the shoreline changes along Andhra Pradesh coast for last 22 years (1990-2012). Multi-resolution satellite data such as Landsat TM, Landsat ETM+, IRS-P5 (Cartosat-1) and IRS-P6 (LISS-III & LISS-IV) were used to assess the short and long-term shoreline changes. The Standard Operating Protocols were followed for image rectification, shoreline extraction and the map accuracy as per NNRMS standard. The changes were classified as stable, erosion (low, medium and high) and accretion (low, medium and high). 974 km long Andhra coast was divided into 89 segments identical to Survey of India toposheets of 1: 25000 scale. The analysis revealed that 275 km long shoreline was under erosion, 417 km has shown accretion and 153 km coastline is under stable condition. Region like Korakupalaiyam, Pallikuppam, Toppalappalaiyam, Virrasettitannippandal, Vatturupallipalem (above the Upputeru River), Ramulapatisangam, Binginipalle, Rayaduruvu, Peddaboyanapalem, Ullapalem, Uppada etc are identified as high erosion prone areas. However, the regions like Bangarapalem, Yerraipetta, Pedhatheenarla, Kothachodupallipetta, Konapapapetta, and northern Kakinada were seen with low to moderate erosion. Pattapupalem, Pallepalem, Kesavapalem, Gundamala regions were noticed with moderate accretion. Southern coast i.e. Nellore to Sriharikotta is mostly stable or accreting nature. Further in northern parts, Ichchapuram to Beemunipatanam coast does not depict any significant change as it is covered with sand dunes and sandy beach. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The Kujukuri Plain, Chiba Prefecture, Japan, is located nearby the Tokyo metropolitan area and it faces to the Pacific Ocean. In the Kujukuri Plain, widespread occurrence of land subsidence has been caused by exploitation of groundwater, extraction of natural gas dissolved in brine, and natural consolidation of the Holocene and landfill deposits. The locations of land subsidence include areas near the coast, and it may increase the flood hazard potential. Hence, it is very important to evaluate flood hazard potential by taking into account the temporal change of land elevation caused by land subsidence, and to prepare hazard maps for protecting the surface environment and for developing an appropriate land-use plan. In this study, flood hazard assessments at three different times, i.e., 1970, 2004, and 2013 are implemented by using a flood hazard model based on Multicriteria Decision Analysis with Geographical Information System techniques. The model incorporates six factors: elevation, depression area, river system, ratio of impermeable area, detention ponds, and precipitation. Main data sources used are 10m resolution topography data, airborne laser scanning data, leveling data, Landsat-TM data, two 1 V 30 000 scale river watershed maps, and precipitation data from observation stations around the study area and Radar data. The hazard assessment maps for each time are obtained by using an algorithm that combines factors with weighted linear combinations. The assignment of the weight/rank values and their analysis are realized by the application of the Analytic Hierarchy Process method. This study is a preliminary work to investigate flood hazards on the Kujukuri Plain. A flood model will be developed to simulate more detailed change of the flood hazard influenced by land subsidence.																	2199-899X						2015	372						157	161		10.5194/piahs-372-157-2015								WOS:000380550200029

The high tide water levels were extracted as coastline approximations and the coastal types were made by manual interpretation based on Google earth high resolution images in this study. The results indicated that the coast changes mainly happened at the northern and eastern parts of the island. The artificial coast came up to 46.4 km with an increment about 8.8 km due to sea reclamation while the mudflat coast decreased about 18.1 km and faded away from 1999 to 2006. Then there was another increase of artificial coast due to returning ponds back to sea, and the sand coast also increased due to sand supply project from 2006 to 2013. Thus the artificial coast increased to 48.0 km and the sand coast increased from 10.1 km to 16.9 km. The total coastline decreased from 66.4 km to 57.0 km first but then increased back to 65.5 km during the whole period while the island area had a persistent growth from 128.5 km(2) to 140.0 km(2). The coastlines moved northward and seaward with less curves due to local constructions except the parts returning ponds back to sea. The rapid social and economic development raised great demand of land use as well as the environmental quality, which made sea reclamation and returning ponds back to sea the main causes of coast changes of Xiamen Island.																			978-1-4799-7749-9				2015							197	201										WOS:000380447800039						
J	Ayanlade, A; Jegede, OO				Ayanlade, Ayansina; Jegede, O. O.			Evaluation of the intensity of the daytime surface urban heat island: how can remote sensing help?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND DATA FUSION												This study aimed at using remote sensing methodology to assess the daytime surface urban heat island (SUHI) in Lagos metropolis. Several studies have examined the SUHI, using point data from meteorological stations. However, it has been shown in the literature recently that it is practically impossible to accurately value the intensity of SUHI from ground meteorological measurement due to heterogeneity and complexity of surface temperature over land. Therefore a time series of Landsat data, from 1984 to 2012, were used in the present study to assess spatial and temporal variability in the contribution of source and sink landscape to daytime SUHI in Lagos. This study uses remote sensing methods because Lagos has a strong heterogeneity of land surface characteristics; with several drainage, vegetation, built-up and soil between the coast and mainland, thus the land surface temperature (LST) changes rapidly in space and time. The results from this study show differences in the contribution of source and sink landscape to SUHI. The main findings from the results show that source landscape contributes positively to the intensity of SUHI in Lagos metropolis. The results show a general increase in mean LST during the periods of study from 1984 to 2012. The north-west (NW) zone of Lagos has highest LST compared to other zones. In 1984, the mean LST of NW zone was 300.53 K, but increased to 301.85 K in 2000 and 302.85 K in 2012. Although contributions from the landscapes differ by zones and time, much more intensified LST was noted in the NW zone of the city. The study find out that change in landcover has been the most important driver of intensified SUHI in Lagos metropolis. NW zone recorded the highest increased in built-up area throughout the years: 320.32 km(2) in 1984, 535.28 km(2) in 2000 and 630.70 km(2) in 2012. This study demonstrates therefore that it is possible to assess spatial distribution and long-term temporal evolution of the LST in urban area, using remote sensing data. Also the results shows that remote sensing methods offer possibility for measuring LST over complete spatially averaged rather than point values. The results from this study further our understanding that not only the SUHI is frequent to cities in developed countries, but the effects are also obvious in several urban settlements in tropical countries.

J	Torbick, N; Corbiere, M				Torbick, Nathan; Corbiere, Megan			Mapping urban sprawl and impervious surfaces in the northeast United States for the past four decades	GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING												Mapping urban expansion and impervious surfaces (IS) has become a useful tool for supporting watershed assessments. The lack of large-area time-series maps created the need to develop an approach and products that can easily be scaled. In this research application, 81 Landsat 1, 2, and 5 scenes for the epochs of 1975, 1985, and 1996 were used to map urban land use/land cover across New England, USA. A Classification And Regression Tree (CART) using random forest classified the landscape into a scheme matching the 2011 National Land Cover Database scheme, which was then aggregated to urban versus nonurban land cover. Regression models between Tasseled Cap brightness and greenness indices and IS values were developed. The CART and IS models were applied to modern imagery and backcast to selected archived imagery to generate maps of urban and IS across New England for the past four decades. The aggregated urban versus nonurban maps had an overall accuracy of 95% and the IS model had an R-2 of 0.89. Multiscale spatiotemporal analyses show the highest urban expansion in watersheds along the coasts in southeastern New England and along highway corridors. Imperviousness intensity increase of urban existing in 1975 was highest for the coastal northeast between 1975 and 2011. The products will be used to support lake risk management and help identify potential stressors to lake health in the northeast.																	1548-1603	1943-7226					2015	52	6					746	764		10.1080/15481603.2015.1076561								WOS:000369953700006

A DISPARITY BETWEEN EROSIONAL HAZARD AND ACCRETION OF THE SUNDARBANS WITH ITS ADJACENT EAST COAST, BANGLADESH: A REMOTE SENSING AND GIS APPROACH	EARTH RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMOTE SENSING/GIS APPLICATIONS VI	Proceedings of SPIE				15th SPIE Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications VI	SEP 22-24, 2015	Toulouse, FRANCE	SPIE				The Sundarbans, UNESCO affiliated world heritage site and world largest mangrove forest covering with (similar to 10000) km(2) along the coastal areas of Bangladesh and India. Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries due to sea level rise caused by global warming. In the present situation world mangrove forest are declining at alarming rate. The extensions of this mangrove forest continuously changing with the nature of Bay of Bengal coast. This paper presents the contrast result of erosional hazard and accretion of Sundarbans with its adjacent east coast of Bangladesh. This study based on images of Landsat MSS, Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) from Landsat 8. Landsat images from 1980 to 2014 were analyzed. The result shows the net erosion rate of Sundarbans is higher than its adjacent east coast. The study area has been divided into two phases - Phase I and Phase II. Phase I represents only Sundarbans and Phase II represents adjacent east coast. These two phases has equal longitudinal distance. Many small channels and river supply water and sediment into the Sundarbans. The adjacent east coast of Sundarbans lies on the Meghana estuary that experienced with huge amount of sediment flow. The Sundarbans has been facing erosional stage with a rate of net erosion about 3 km(2)y(-1) whereas the adjacent east coast facing an accretional stage with rate of accretion about 1 km(2)y(-1). The highest erosion rate of Phase I (Sundarbans) was 10.61 km(2)y(-1) and highest erosion of Phase II adjacent east coast was 18-km(2)y(-1) in the period of 1989-1999. The highest accretion rate in the Sundarbans was 6.48 km(2)y(-1) in the period of 1999-2006 and in the Phase II, accretion rate was 16.43 km(2)y(-1) in the period of 1980-1989. The lowest erosion rate was 3 km(2)y(-1) in Phase I and 2.11 km(2)y(-1) in Phase II in the period of 1999-2006. The reworking area in phase I is about 37 km(2) and phase II is about 51 Km(2). So, water is highly active in adjacent east coast than Sundarbans. Though the mean sea level is increasing at a same rate in two different phases but the accretion and erosion rates are not same. From this study, it is established that Sundarbans has lost 113.31 km(2) of its land in the 34 years of study period whereas; adjacent east coast has gain about 35 km(2) lands. The rate of water discharges and sediment supply are not same in two different phases. It plays a vital role in erosion and accretion process. Therefore, Sundarbans are declining at frightening rate than its adjacent east coast.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-854-5				2015	9644								96441G	10.1117/12.2196386								WOS:000367470500029

Four elevation zones between 0 to 2500 m were defined and spatial patterns of NPP in those elevation zones were assessed to understand the impacts of topographyon local spatial patterns of productivity. The model results are incoorporated with available topographic information in watershed level. The Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) model approach was used to estimate annual and monthly NPP. This model uses a light-use efficiency (LUE) factor, which is the efficiency of conversion of light energy into dry materials by plant, together with remotely sensed, climate (to express the effects of air temperature and water stress), soil and biotic data and ground measurements. Thus, a comprehensive spatial and temporal data set including temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, soil texture, percent tree cover, land cover type, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were used in modelling process. Percent tree cover was predicted using multi-temporal LANDSAT images by aggregating tree cover estimates made from high resolution Geo-EYE imagery in a regression tree algorithm. The results indicated several interesting trends between NPP and regional climate gradients. NPP was correlated strongly with solar radiation and precipitation during the growing season suggesting that water limitation as important variable controlling regional patterns of productivity.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2015	24	7					2264	2274										WOS:000363071700001						
J	Tang, JM				Tang, Junmei			Dynamic linkages between vegetation phenology and seasonal changes in water quality in the Choptank watershed, USA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												One of the greatest challenges in water-quality management is to understand the many complex interactions between landscape structure and nutrient transport. This study analysed the relationship between the inter-annual vegetation phenologies and seasonal change of water quality in the Choptank Basin, a typical agricultural tributary of the Chesapeake Bay (along the east coast of USA), using blended images from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. Cross-Correlogram Spectral Matching (CCSM) was applied to explain the correlation between seasonal nitrate discharge and phenologies of different crop types as well as forest. Nitrate discharges from forest-dominated watersheds are reduced as the forest greens up with an increasing percentage above the predefined enhanced vegetation index (EVI) threshold values. The crop-dominant watersheds have higher correlations than the forest-dominant watersheds between seasonal nitrate discharge and vegetation phenologies. The correlations between seasonal water quality and vegetation phenology in forest-dominant watershed have less variance than those of crop-dominant watersheds. The highest correlations were found between EVI and water quality at one or two months 'later', e.g. between the 'earlier' green-up and the 'later' nutrient discharge. This work could be applied to guide farmland planning to effectively control the non-point source pollution.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2015	36	12					3041	3057		10.1080/01431161.2015.1055603								WOS:000357295800002

The coastal zone is an area with immense geological, geomorphological and ecological interest. Monitoring and mitigation of shoreline erosion along populated coastal areas is an important task and remains a difficult goal to achieve. The coast of Karnataka state extends from Talapadi in south to Sadashivgad in north covering a distance of about 280 km. In this study, an attempt has been made to investigate the shoreline transformation along the Karnataka coast. Fair weather satellite images of LANDSAT from 1991 to 2014 with an interval of eight years were used to delineate the shoreline. A Linear Regression Rate-of-change (LRR) and an End Point Rate (EPR) statistic was carried out using Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) computer software of United States Geological Survey (USGS). Highest EPR of about 15.96 m (1991-2014) was noticed in the Ankola taluk, whereas highest LRR was about 15.5 m in Karwar, both indicating accretion. Highest erosion was noticed in Honnavar with an LRR of 19.59 m respectively and EPR of 19.95 m. (C) 2015 The Authors.

However, the rates and causes of loss and restoration remain largely unknown. This study aims to respond to this concern by analyzing the dynamics of mangrove forests and surrounding land covers in Guangxi Province, China. We analyzed Landsat images on a decadal scale between 1973 and 2010 using an object-oriented classification method. Temporal analysis results indicated that the areal extent of mangrove forests showed the following changes: a sharp decrease from 5305 ha in 1973 to 2306 ha in 1981; a remarkable increase from 2306 ha in 1981 to 5937 ha in 2000; and a slight degradation from 5937 ha in 2000 to 5759 ha in 2010. Reclamation and natural factors resulted in the loss of mangrove forests. By comparison, protection and reforestation efforts contributed to mangrove forest restoration. During the past 40 years, mangrove forests in Guangxi were fragmented. In contrast to the movement of other mangrove forests in the world, mangroves in the coasts of Guangxi were moved seaward because the rates of change in relative sea level were exceeded by the rates of change in the elevation of sedimentation in mangrove mudflats. Simultaneously, man-made land cover prevented landward migration. These results provide valuable information for better understanding mangrove forest dynamics in developing countries. These results can also be used as guidelines in the creation and implementation of reasonable mangrove forest management policies.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				JAN	2015	8	1					311	323		10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2333527								WOS:000349550400030

Ecological recovery in an Arctic delta following widespread saline incursion	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Arctic ecosystems are vulnerable to the combined effects of climate change and a range of other anthropogenic perturbations. Predicting the cumulative impact of these stressors requires an improved understanding of the factors affecting ecological resilience. In September of 1999, a severe storm surge in the Mackenzie Delta flooded alluvial surfaces up to 30 km inland from the coast with saline waters, driving environmental impacts unprecedented in the last millennium. In this study we combined field monitoring of permanent sampling plots with an analysis of the Landsat archive (1986-2011) to explore the factors affecting the recovery of ecosystems to this disturbance. Soil salinization following the 1999 storm caused the abrupt dieback of more than 30 000 ha of tundra vegetation. Vegetation cover and soil chemistry show that recovery is occurring, but the rate and spatial extent are strongly dependent on vegetation type, with graminoid- and upright shrub-dominated areas showing recovery after a decade, but dwarf shrub tundra exhibiting little to no recovery over this period. Our analyses suggest that recovery from salinization has been strongly influenced by vegetation type and the frequency of freshwater flooding following the storm. With increased ocean storm activity, rising sea levels, and reduced sea ice cover, Arctic coastal ecosystems will be more likely to experience similar disturbances in the future, highlighting the importance of combining field sampling with regional-scale remote sensing in efforts to detect, understand, and anticipate environmental change.																	1051-0761	1939-5582				JAN	2015	25	1					172	185		10.1890/14-0239.1								WOS:000348667900015	26255366

The long-term coastal erosion and accretion rates have been calculated for the periods between 1999 and 2011, and the subsequent short-term changes were performed during 1999-2000, 2005-2006, and 2010-2011. Thus, the long-term coastal changes indicate that the net erosion rate is higher on the coasts of Kanyakumari, Kovalam, Manavalakurichi, Mandaikadu, and Thengapattinam; the values are 0.118, 0.105, 0.127, 0.133, and 0.017 m(2), respectively. Meanwhile, the annual erosion rate of these areas is 10,000, 9,000, 11,000, and 1000 m(2)/year. The coastal zones Ganapathipuram and Enayamputhandurai have experienced accretion; the net accretion rate is 0.271 and 0.081 m(2), respectively. Coastal beaches, beach ridges, and marine terraces are predominantly disturbed by the hydrodynamic processes including wave action, littoral current, and intervention of littoral drift by the artificial coastal structures like groins, revetments, and seawalls. Moreover, the study area has been demarcated with site-specific erosion and accretion zones based on the frequent seaward or landward coastline fluctuation through geospatial technique.

J	Lay, T				Lay, Thorne			The surge of great earthquakes from 2004 to 2014	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												During the decade from mid-2004 to mid-2014 18 great (M-w >= 8.0) earthquakes occurred globally (similar to 1.8 per year), compared to 71 from 1900 to mid-2004 (similar to 0.68 per year), yielding a short-term rate increase of 265%. Six events had M-w >= 8.5, larger than any prior event since the 1965 Rat Islands earthquake. The December 26, 2004 M-w 9.2 Sumatra earthquake had the longest recorded rupture length of 1300+ km and a rupture duration exceeding 450 s. The largest recorded strike-slip earthquake (M-w 8.7) occurred in the Indo-Australian plate on April 11, 2012. The largest recorded deep focus earthquake (M-w 8.3) occurred under the Sea of Okhotsk on May 24, 2013. While this overall surge of activity has not been demonstrated to be causally linked, regional spatio-temporal clustering is clearly evident for great events along the Sumatra, Kuril and Tonga subduction zones, and longer-range interactions have been established for global seismicity and seismic tremor at lower magnitudes following some of the events. This recent decade of intense great earthquake activity coincided with vastly expanded global networks of seismometers, GPS stations, tsunami gauges, and new satellite imaging capabilities such as InSAR and LandSAT interferometry and gravity measurements by GRACE and GOCE, enabling unprecedented analyses of precursory, co-seismic and post-seismic processes around the subduction zone environments where most of the events occurred. Individual events such as the March 11. 2011, Tohoku, Japan M-w 9.0 earthquake produced more ground motion and tsunami recordings than available for all great earthquakes of the last century collectively. Joint inversion and modeling of the diverse data sets exploit complementary sensitivity of the signals to different aspects of the earthquake processes. Major advances have been achieved in quantifying frictional locking and strain accumulation prior to some great events and in relating it to co-seismic slip heterogeneity. Many surprising aspects of these well-quantified great earthquakes have been manifested, associated with their rupture dimensions, tectonic location, compound faulting, triggering interactions, slow slip and foreshock migration precursors, aftershock complexity, and depth-varying seismic radiation characteristics. Regions with potential for near-future great ruptures include mature seismic gaps along the Mentawai Islands and northern Chile, as well as western North America and the Himalayan front, so more great earthquake activity can certainly be anticipated.

Using the unique spectral signature of guano to identify unknown seabird colonies	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Despite the threats faced by seabirds in both terrestrial and marine habitats, even basic knowledge of the locations of colonies, population sizes and trends is lacking for many remote areas of the world. Recent studies have shown that the guano of Adelie penguins can be identified from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) imagery and used to map colonies on coasts around continental Antarctica. Our study highlights a new technique based on the unique spectral signature of guano that can be used to discriminate seabird colonies from background geology and vegetation in a wider range of natural environments, including the vegetated and zoologically-diverse region of the Antarctic Peninsula; moreover, the method was effective for all densely colonial, surface-nesting seabirds. Using Landsat ETM imagery, we correctly identified all known seabird colonies of over 50 pairs in the area of Marguerite Bay. Almost all other areas with a similar spectral signature that were outside known breeding areas were single pixels that were readily distinguishable from genuine colonies. If these were excluded, only 4.1% of pixels appeared to represent unknown breeding or roosting sites, and warrant further investigation. The spatial extent of the guano provided a general guide to the number of individuals present, but further work would be required to determine the accuracy of this method for estimating population size. Spectral profiles of guano collected by satellite and hand-held spectrometers were compared with available data in spectral libraries and did not match with any known geological profile. There may also be potential for discriminating colonies of different species that differ in phenology and show seasonal changes in diet by the carefully-timed acquisition of suitable satellite imagery. We conclude that the remotely-sensed guano signature is a good indicator of the location of seabird breeding or roosting sites, with potentially wide application to other areas of the world.

CLIMATE AND LANDUSE CHANGE IMPACTS ON SUB-SEA LEVEL RICE FARMING IN A TROPICAL DELTAIC WETLAND	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 36TH IAHR WORLD CONGRESS: DELTAS OF THE FUTURE AND WHAT HAPPENS UPSTREAM					36th IAHR World Congress	JUN 28-JUL 03, 2015	Delft, NETHERLANDS	Int Assoc Hydro Environm Engn & Res, Boskalis, Van Oord, UNESCO IHE, Delft Univ Technol, Deltares, Minist Infrastructure & Environm, Rijkswaterstaat, Royal HaskoningDHV, ARCADIS, WItteveen Bos, AANDERAA, Prince Sultan Bin Abulaziz Int Prize Water				Sub-sea level paddy farming system practiced 2-3 meters below sea level in the fertile Kuttanad delta situated in the west coast of peninsular India is a unique and globally important agricultural heritage system. This vast tropical estuarine complex is drained by five Western Ghat rivers and is also part of the largest Ramsar site in India. The present study investigates the historic trends in landuse and climate on agricultural production from this unique wetland paddy system over the past 48 years (1966-2014). A supervised classification of Landsat images revealed the drastic changes to landuse in the delta over the past four decades. Two distinct phases of land reclamation are identified: reclamation of land from the natural wetland estuaries for paddy cultivation as well as the more recent paddy land conversions into uplands. The statistical trend analysis of climate variables of temperature and precipitation on paddy yield for the time period in the region revealed weak and insignificant impacts of warming climate on agricultural production from this wetland system. It is observed that in the near term, anthropogenic land use changes have stronger significant impacts on the delta than the impacts of climate change. Such a historical assessment of observed data on climate and landuse is critical for devising sustainable strategies and adaptive mechanisms for the conservation of this valuable agricultural system.																			978-90-824846-0-1				2015							6488	6495										WOS:000398996206072

Before 1912 the islands had a diverse terrestrial fauna. By 1952 several species were locally extinct. Between 1996 and 2011 rodents and cats were eradicated, and 5 mammal and 2 bird species were translocated to the islands. Monitoring of the broader terrestrial ecosystem over time has been limited. We used 20 dry-season Landsat images from 1988 to 2013 and estimation of green fraction cover in nadir photographs taken at 27 sites within the Montebello islands and six sites on Thevenard Island to assess change in vegetation density over time. Analysis of data averaged across the 26-year period suggests that 719 ha out of 2169 ha have increased in vegetation cover by up to 32%, 955 ha have remained stable and 0.6 ha have declined in vegetation cover. Over 492 ha (22%) had no vegetation cover at any time during the period analysed. Chronological clustering analysis identified two breakpoints in the average vegetation cover data occurring in 1997 and 2003, near the beginning and end of the rodent eradication activities. On many islands vegetation cover was declining prior to 1996 but increased after rodents were eradicated from the islands. Data for North West and Trimouille islands were analysed independently because of the potential confounding effect of native fauna being introduced to these islands. Mala (Lagorchestes hirsutus) and Shark Bay mice (Pseudomys fieldi) both appear to suppress native plant recruitment but not to the same degree as introduced rodents. Future research should assess whether the increase in vegetation cover on the Montebello islands is due to an increase in native or introduced plants.																	1932-6203					DEC 1	2014	9	12							e114095	10.1371/journal.pone.0114095								WOS:000347114900117	25436454

Visualization	REMOTE SENSING												Satellite remote sensing is a promising technology for monitoring natural and anthropogenic changes occurring in remote, northern environments. It offers the potential to scale-up ground-based, local environmental monitoring efforts to document disturbance types, and characterize their extents and frequencies at regional scales. Here we present a simple, but effective means of visually assessing landscape disturbances in northern environments using trend analysis of Landsat satellite image stacks. Linear trends of the Tasseled Cap brightness, greenness, and wetness indices, when composited into an RGB image, effectively distinguish diverse landscape changes based on additive color logic. Using a variety of reference datasets within Northwest Territories, Canada, we show that the trend composites are effective for identifying wildfire regeneration, tundra greening, fluvial dynamics, thermokarst processes including lake surface area changes and retrogressive thaw slumps, and the footprint of resource development operations and municipal development. Interpretation of the trend composites is aided by a color wheel legend and contextual information related to the size, shape, and location of change features. A companion paper in this issue (Olthof and Fraser) focuses on quantitative methods for classifying these changes.

Shoreline Response to Rapid 20th Century Sea-Level Change along the Iranian Caspian Coast	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The Caspian Sea, the largest lake in the world, is characterized by rapid sea-level changes. This Provides a real physical model of coastal response to rapid sea-level change in a period of just a few years, which might take a millennium along oceanic coasts. Between 1929 and 1995, the Caspian sea level experienced the last cycle, with a range of +/- 3 m. This caused disastrous effects along the coast and destroyed many buildings, roads, farms, and other human property. During the preceding 48 years of sea-level fall, a large area of the sea bottom emerged, which was then used for the development of residential zones. That area had to be abandoned when sea level rose by almost 3 m in a period of 18 years. With the use of LANDSAT data, we calculated total shoreline shifts in 22 littoral cells, each cell containing three transects over a 3-km distance. Both landward and seaward shifts occur during rapid sea-level rise between 1977 and 2001.				goorabi, Abolghasem/F-6820-2017	goorabi, Abolghasem/0000-0002-2787-8687; Kroonenberg, Salomon/0000-0001-7240-8425												0749-0208	1551-5036				NOV	2014	30	6					1243	1250		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12-00173.1								WOS:000344828400013						
J	Kaiser, MF				Kaiser, Mona Fouad			Disturbance of Hydrodynamic Regime in the Mediterranean Coastal Zone of Egypt	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Engineering structures induce variations in the physical parameters of incident waves approaching coastlines, affecting the rate of longshore sediment transport and the patterns of shoreline change. Landsat Thematic Mapper images acquired from 1990 to 2005 and field measurements were utilized to perform mathematical modeling along Mediterranean coastal zones in Egypt. The K-1 transport coefficient values used to calibrate the models ranged from 0.05 to 0.9. To accommodate changes in the physical conditions, a second calibration was required. The Ki transport coefficient values determined by the second calibration ranged from 0.1 to 0.7. These results indicate that the hydrodynamic regime along the Nile Delta coastal zones during 1995-2000 (verification) and 2000-2005 (second calibration) was disturbed by the effect of engineering works. Therefore, the calibration parameters used in simulations before 1995 are not appropriate for use after 1995. These findings demonstrate how the physical parameters of waves and currents are disturbed after some protective structures are modified.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				NOV	2014	30	6					1260	1267		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12-00247.1								WOS:000344828400015

Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Gyres in Oriented Lakes on the Arctic Coastal Plain of Northern Alaska Based on Remotely Sensed Images	REMOTE SENSING												The formation of oriented thermokarst lakes on the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska has been the subject of debate for more than half a century. The striking elongation of the lakes perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction has led to the development of a preferred wind-generated gyre hypothesis, while other hypotheses include a combination of sun angle, topographic aspect, and/or antecedent conditions. A spatio-temporal analysis of oriented thermokarst lake gyres with recent (Landsat 8) and historical (Landsat 4, 5, 7 and ASTER) satellite imagery of the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska indicates that wind-generated gyres are both frequent and regionally extensive. Gyres are most common in lakes located near the Arctic coast after several days of sustained winds from a single direction, typically the northeast, and decrease in number landward with decreasing wind energy. This analysis indicates that the conditions necessary for the Carson and Hussey (1962) wind-generated gyre for oriented thermokarst lake formation are common temporally and regionally and correspond spatially with the geographic distribution of oriented lakes on the Arctic Coastal Plain. Given an increase in the ice-free season for lakes as well as strengthening of the wind regime, the frequency and distribution of lake gyres may increase. This increase has implications for changes in northern high latitude aquatic ecosystems, particularly if wind-generated gyres promote permafrost degradation and thermokarst lake expansion.

Examining Change Detection Approaches for Tropical Mangrove Monitoring	PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING												This study evaluated the effectiveness of different band combinations and classifiers (unsupervised, supervised, object-oriented nearest neighbor, and object-oriented decision rule) for quantifying mangrove forest change using multitemporal Landsat data. A discriminant analysis using spectra of different vegetation types determined that bands 2 (0.52 to 0.6 mu m), 5 (1.55 to 1.75 mu m), and 7(2.08 to 2.35 mu m) were the most effective bands for differentiating mangrove forests from surrounding land cover types. A ranking of thirty-six change maps, produced by comparing the classification accuracy of twelve change detection approaches, was used. The object-based Nearest Neighbor classifier produced the highest mean overall accuracy (84 percent) regardless of band combinations. The automated decision rule-based approach (mean overall accuracy of 88 percent) as well as a composite of bands 2, 5, and 7 used with the unsupervised classifier and the same composite or all band difference with the object-oriented Nearest Neighbor classifier were the most effective approaches.																	0099-1112	2374-8079				OCT	2014	80	10					983	993		10.14358/PERS.80.10.983								WOS:000342551800013

Field measurements recorded the dramatic biomass decrease from 2010 to 2011 and a biomass recovery in 2012 dominated by a decrease of live biomass, and the loss of marsh as part of the dieback event. Based on an established relationship, the near-infrared/red vegetation index (VI) and site-specific measurements delineated a contiguous expanse of marsh dieback encompassing 6649.9 ha of 18,2923 ha of S. alterniflora marshes within the study region. PoISAR data were transformed to variables used in biophysical mapping, and of this variable suite, the cross-polarization HV (horizontal send and vertical receive) backscatter was the best single indicator of marsh dieback and recovery. HV backscatter exhibited substantial and significant changes over the dieback and recovery period, tracked measured biomass changes, and significantly correlated with the live/dead biomass ratio. Within the context of regional trends, both HV and VI indicators started higher in pre-dieback marshes and exhibited substantially and statistically higher variability from year to year than that exhibited in the non-dieback marshes. That distinct difference allowed the capturing of the S. altemiflora marsh dieback and recovery; however, these changes were incorporated in a regional trend exhibiting similar but more subtle biomass composition changes.

Shoreline change rates (SCR) and shoreline change areas (SCA) were retrieved using the statistical approach and zonal change detection method, respectively. Results showed that during 1979-2010 a large portion (over 59.8 %) of shoreline are dominated by a retreating process with an average rate of -2.01 m/year, while other parts of shoreline exhibited a seaward advancing trend due to intense land reclamation activities.

The Lake Manzala of Egypt: an ambiguous future	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The Lake Manzala of Egypt has a relatively short history and its future, however, is uncertain. The lake which was the biggest coastal wetland along the Mediterranean Coast is moving toward its disappearance by two opposite forces, one of them is the shrinking of the water body by siltation of sediments coming from agricultural lands and the abundance of weeds and swamp vegetation as well as the drying practices for agriculture, whereas the other force incorporates the removal of the coastal sand bar separating the lake from the Mediterranean Sea by erosion, which should eventually lead to the conversion of the lake into a coastal embayment instead of being a closed coastal lagoon. The study provided a spatiotemporal change analysis of the lake using remotely sensed data.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				SEP	2014	72	6					1801	1809		10.1007/s12665-014-3088-x								WOS:000341083800004						
J	Pickens, BA; King, SL				Pickens, Bradley A.; King, Sammy L.			Linking multi-temporal satellite imagery to coastal wetland dynamics and bird distribution	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Ecosystems are characterized by dynamic ecological processes, such as flooding and fires, but spatial models are often limited to a single measurement in time. The characterization of direct, fine-scale processes affecting animals is potentially valuable for management applications, but these are difficult to quantify over broad extents. Direct predictors are also expected to improve transferability of models beyond the area of study. Here, we investigated the ability of non-static and multi-temporal habitat characteristics to predict marsh bird distributions, while testing model generality and transferability between two coastal habitats. Distribution models were developed for king rail (Rallus elegans), common gallinule (Gallinula galeata), least bittern (Ixobrychus exilis), and purple gallinule (Porphyrio martinica) in fresh and intermediate marsh types in the northern Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Texas, USA. For model development, repeated point count surveys of marsh birds were conducted from 2009 to 2011. Landsat satellite imagery was used to quantify both annual conditions and cumulative, multi-temporal habitat characteristics. We used multivariate adaptive regression splines to quantify bird-habitat relationships for fresh, intermediate, and combined marsh habitats. Multi-temporal habitat characteristics ranked as more important than single-date characteristics, as temporary water was most influential in six of eight models. Predictive power was greater for marsh type-specific models compared to general models and model transferability was poor. Birds in fresh marsh selected for annual habitat characterizations, while birds in intermediate marsh selected for cumulative wetness and heterogeneity. Our findings emphasize that dynamic ecological processes can affect species distribution and species-habitat relationships may differ with dominant landscape characteristics. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Pu, RL; Bell, S; Meyer, C				Pu, Ruiliang; Bell, Susan; Meyer, Cynthia			Mapping and assessing seagrass bed changes in Central Florida's west coast using multitemporal Landsat TM imagery	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Some seagrass meadows in coastal shallow waters have displayed large scale changes in seagrass spatial extent and hurricanes and/or tropical storms have been suggested as factors responsible for reduction in coverage. Taking advantage of the incidence of three tropical storms passing near a study site along the central west Florida coast within a two-month period in 2004, we evaluated whether satellite remote sensing techniques (Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery) are useful for assessing dynamics of seagrass (=submerged aquatic vegetation: SAV) cover/abundance in response to these multiple disturbances. We also examined whether an image preprocessing procedure, which included water column correction, applied to the Landsat TM images could further improve the classification and mapping of detailed SAV coverage. We compared a historical set of Landsat TM images, acquired in Fall 2003 and Fall and late Summer 2005, which were processed to classify %SAV cover into five classes using a maximum likelihood classifier. Importantly, our experimental results demonstrated that the application of the image preprocessing procedures led to an overall accuracy 2-14% improvement in SAV classification due to water column correction compared to that currently reported in the literature when similar Landsat TM data are utilized. Based upon the classification results mapped from the TM images and as well as a similar classification of SAV interpreted from aerial photographs collected before and after the passage of these same storms, SAV coverage over the study areas was found to increase about 6% (integrating SAV losses and gains) by 2005/2006 in comparison to cover levels present prior to the repeated storm activity. We conclude that heavy rains during 2004 along with physical disturbance from gale force winds from the tropical storms/hurricanes did not produce any SAV bed loss at the study site that was sustained for more than one year after multiple storm passage.

Shibly; Takewaka, Satoshi			Analyses on phenological and morphological variations of mangrove forests along the southwest coast of Bangladesh	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												Drastic changes in river discharge and salinity levels are threatening the phenology and morphology of the coastal mangrove forests of the Sundarbans of Bangladesh. We have used AVHRR GIMMS (1985-2006) and MODIS (2005-2010) satellite Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data to identify the temporal variation of the phenology of the mangroves. Linear interpolation and Fourier-based adjustment were applied to remove noise from the NDVI time series. Then linear regression analysis on a single area (8 km ae center dot 8 km) and a composite of 36 areas for three NDVI statistics the annual minimum, annual average, and annual maximum were performed--over the time periods 1985-1990, 1990-2000, 2000-2006 and 2005-2010 to identify possible functional changes in NDVI time series around the Sundarbans. Furthermore, we used fourteen LANDSAT images spanning the period 1989-2010 to estimate the spatiotemporal rate of shoreline changes over the three time periods 1989-2000, 2000-2006, and 2006-2010. A decreasing trend in the annual minimum NDVI was observed in most of the areas of the Sundarbans for the period 1990-2000. During the years 2000-2006, the trends of the three NDVI statistics became significantly positive, indicating an improvement of the mangrove phenology. In the period 2005-2010, a decreasing trend in all the NDVI variables was again dominant. The coast underwent rapid erosion from 1989-2000 and 2006-2010. However, the rate substantially declined between 2000 and 2006, when accretion was dominant. The advent of the upstream Farakka barrage caused a significant reduction in the Ganges-Gorai River discharge and increased the salinity in and around the Sundarbans. Our study concludes that this may be responsible for the degradation of mangrove phenology and accelerated erosion in the earlier and recent periods. In the interim, 2000-2006, improved river discharge and salinity levels due to the Ganges water sharing agreement (1996) and dredging of the Gorai River bed (1998-1999) enhanced the mangrove phenology and helped the coast to gain land.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				AUG	2014	18	4					339	357		10.1007/s11852-014-0321-4								WOS:000340375400003

Karasu town of the city of Sakarya in Turkey which is a touristic region on the Black Sea coast has been experienced a drastic coastal erosion. In recent years, this erosion reached the threatening dimensions for the structures in the settlement. According to the temporal analyses of Landsat satellite images, the maximum erosion on the coastline was detected 100 m between 1987-2013. The results of the study show that the harbour construct on the Karasu coast has the major impact on this event. The secondary factor is that the amount of the sediment carried by the Sakarya River was decreased in time due to different reasons. To prevent the coastal erosion, a series of offshore breakwaters were planned after the failed application of groins on the coastline. In this study, temporal changes of the coastline are investigated by the Landsat satellite data and land surveys, possible reasons of the erosion are discussed and the solutions are proposed regarding the coastal structures.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				AUG	2014	18	4					399	414		10.1007/s11852-014-0325-0								WOS:000340375400007

Delineation of Coastal Marsh Types Along the Central Texas Coast	WETLANDS												Tidally influenced wetlands along the Texas coast provide important habitat for wintering waterfowl and myriad other fish and wildlife species. Because habitat values may differ among marsh salinity zones (e.g., waterfowl food resources and use are greatest in fresh and intermediate marsh), the spatial distribution of marsh types is important for understanding the capacity of coastal landscapes to support waterfowl and other wildlife populations and informing coastal restoration priorities. Additionally, documenting spatial patterns of coastal marsh types is necessary for projecting future landscape change and examining impacts of environmental processes (e.g., tropical storms, sea level rise). We used a helicopter-based vegetation survey and remotely sensed imagery to delineate marsh types along the central Texas coast into four categories: fresh, intermediate, brackish, and saline. We recorded vegetation composition at 342 sample points and combined these data with Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery to perform a supervised classification of marsh types throughout our 122,995 ha survey area. Our initial coarse classification delineating coastal marsh from other habitat types was 92 % accurate. Intermediate, brackish, and saline marsh each comprised about 30 % of the coastal marsh in our study area. Freshwater marsh comprised < 1 % and may have been underrepresented within the coastal zone due to placement of the inland boundary of our study area. Our final classification of marsh types was 77.2 % accurate which will provide a framework for further delineation efforts. We offer several considerations for future coastal marsh delineation efforts along the Texas coast.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				AUG	2014	34	4					653	660		10.1007/s13157-014-0531-4								WOS:000340097600003

It is located in the northeast portion of the province of Cordoba. The maximum water level is the topic of this work, which is defined using the combined effect of the historical maximum water level measured on the coast and the maximum storm elevation (considering both wind and waves) estimated for recurrences of 25, 50 and 100 years. The analysis of the series of water levels made it possible to determine the historical maximum level measured in the lagoon. This value was recorded in 2003 as a height of 71.9 meters above sea level (masl). The maximum storm level is defined by both the action of the wind and waves generated by the storm. Specific software and empirical formulas were used to obtain these estimates. To propagate the waves on the beach profile, the bathymetry of the lagoon was rebuilt using remote sensing techniques. To this end, terrain elevation data were used from space surveys derived from radar and from thematic maps based on Landsat images with the digital extraction of water contours. The results indicate that the maximum flood that could occur in Laguna Mar Chiquita, on the southern coast of the system, is 73.5 masl with a recurrence of 100 years. It is important to conduct this analysis for systems with large fluctuations in water levels, such as the one presented here.																	0187-8336	2007-2422				JUL-AUG	2014	5	4					119	133										WOS:000344438300007						
J	Wang, CY; Zhang, J; Song, PJ				Wang Changying; Zhang Jie; Song Pingjian			An intelligent coastline interpretation of several types of seacoasts from TM/ETM plus images based on rules	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												A coastline is defined as the average spring tide line. Different types of seacoast, such as sandy, silty, and biological coast, have different indicators of interpretation. It is very difficult to develop a universal method for interpreting all shorelines. Therefore, the sandy, the silty, and the biological coast are regarded as research objects, and with data mining technology, found the rules of interpretation of those three types of coastlines. Then, an intelligent coastline interpretation method based on rules was proposed. Firstly, the rules for extracting the waterline in Landsat TM/ETM+ (Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) imagery were discovered. Then, through analyzing the features of sandy, silty and biological coast, the indicators of interpreting different types of shoreline were determined. According to the indicators, the waterline could be corrected to the real coastline. In order to verify the validity of the proposed algorithms, three Landsat TM/ETM+ imageries were selected for case studies. The experimental results showed that the proposed methods could interpret the coastlines of sandy, silty, and biological coasts with high precision and without human intervention, which exceeded three pixels.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				JUL	2014	33	7					89	96		10.1007/s13131-014-0482-x								WOS:000338098400011

An adaptive approach to monitor the Shoreline changes in ICZM framework: A case study of Chennai coast	INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES					5th Indian National Conference on Harbour and Ocean Engineering (INCHOE)	FEB 05-07, 2014	CSIR NIO, Goa, INDIA		CSIR NIO			Shoreline change study was carried out for 25 km long stretch of Chennai coast. Landsat TM (1990), Landsat ETM+ (2000), CARTOSAT-1 (2006), Resourcesat-1 (2008) and Resourcesat-2 (2012, 2013) satellite images were used as input dataset. Field survey was also carried out using Arc-Pad GPS instrument for 2011. Three methods i.e. End Point Rate, Linear regression Rate and Weighted Linear Regression were employed to calculate shoreline change rate for 1990-2013. While, EPR method is used to calculate the short-term analysis for 1990-1998 and 1999-2006. Study area was divided into four distinct zones. Totally 412 transects were generated with 50 m spacing and the length of each transects was 200 m. From the long term analysis, the high erosion was noticed on the northern side of the Thiruvottiyur region with a rate of more than 5 m/yr. Royapuram fishing harbour is noticed with an erosion rate of 4m/yr during the period of (1990-2012). 2 to 4 m/yr accretion was seen all along the marina beach. Whereas, south of marina beach, the places like Foreshore estate, Elliot beach and Thiruvanmiyur regions shows low erosion rate. From the analysis it clearly shows that the northern portion of the Chennai port is eroding and the southern portion of the port is accreting. Combined use of satellite imagery and statistical methods proves to be a reliable method for shoreline change analysis. Of all the statistical methods, WLR statistical method is found to be more reliable as it takes uncertainties and quality of datasets into account to calculate the rates of shoreline change.																	0379-5136	0975-1033				JUL	2014	43	7					1266	1271										WOS:000209743200024

Historical satellite imageries from Landsat ETM+ are used to estimate the positions of the shoreline along this stretch of the coast, for various years. A finite-difference based numerical model was also setup for the selected coastal stretch to estimate the shoreline changes. The coastlines extracted from the first few satellite imageries are used to calibrate the numerical model, where as the rest are used to validate the numerical model. Based on the numerical model, attempt is also made to predict the fate of the coastline in the near future. An average erosion rate of about 4 m/year is estimated along the South Gujarat coastline. It is also observed in the predicted coastlines from 2018 to 2033 the average erosion ranges from 32.55 m in 2018 to 61.79 min 2033. The details of the data, numerical model and analysis are presented in this paper.																	0379-5136	0975-1033				JUL	2014	43	7					1281	1285										WOS:000209743200026

J	Hua, LZ; Tang, LN; Cui, SH; Yin, K				Hua, Lizhong; Tang, Lina; Cui, Shenghui; Yin, Kai			Simulating Urban Growth Using the SLEUTH Model in a Coastal Peri-Urban District in China	SUSTAINABILITY												China's southeast coastal areas have witnessed rapid growth in the last two decades, owing mostly to their economic and social attractions. In this paper, we chose Jimei, a coastal peri-urban district of Xiamen city on the southeast coast of China, as a study area to explore the district's growth dynamics, to predict future sprawl during the next decade and to provide a basis for urban planning. The SLEUTH urban growth model was calibrated against historical data derived from a series of Landsat TM 5 satellite images taken between 1992 and 2007. A Lee-Sallee value of 0.48 was calculated for the district, which is a satisfactory result compared with related studies. Five coefficients of urban growth, diffusion, spread, breed, slope resistance and road gravity had values of 25, 68, 86, 24 and 23, respectively, in 2007. The growth coefficients (i.e., urban character) can capture urban growth characteristics in Jimei district. The urban DNA revealed that, over the study period, urban growth in the district was dominated both by urbanization through establishment of new urban centers, and by expansion outward from existing urban centers. In contrast to interior cities, in which expansions are dramatically shaped by actual road patterns, urban expansion in the district was likely constrained by the nearby coastline. Future urban growth patterns were predicted to 2020 assuming three different development scenarios. The first scenario simulated a continuation of historical urban growth without changing current conditions. The second scenario projected managed growth in which urban growth is limited by a layer with areas excluded from urbanization, which is the future development plan for Jimei district and Xiamen city. The third scenario depicted a growth with maximum protection in which growth was allowed to continue, similar to the second scenario, but with lower diffusion and spread coefficients applied to the growth pattern. The third scenario demonstrated that valuable land could be saved, which is the most desirable outcome for Jimei urban development. The study showed that SLEUTH can be an extremely useful tool for coastal city managers to explore the likely outcomes of their city development plans.

Shoreline changes in response to sea level rise along Digha Coast, Eastern India: an analytical approach of remote sensing, GIS and statistical techniques	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												Shoreline is one of the rapidly changing linear features of the coastal zone which is dynamic in nature. The issue of shoreline changes due to sea level rise over the next century has increasingly become a major social, economic and environmental concern to a large number of countries along the coast, where it poses a serious problem to the environment and human settlements. As a consequence, some coastal scientists have advocated analyzing and predicting coastal changes on a more local scale. The present study demonstrates the potential of remote sensing, geospatial and statistical techniques for monitoring the shoreline changes and sea level rise along Digha coast, the eastern India. In the present study, multi-resolution and multi temporal satellite images of Landsat have been utilized to demarcate shoreline positions during 1972, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010. The statistical techniques, linear regression, end-point rate and regression coefficient (R-2) have been used to find out the shoreline change rates and sea level change during the periods of 1972-2010. Monthly and annual mean sea level data for three nearby station viz., Haldia, Paradip and Gangra from 1972 to 2006 have been used to this study. Finally, an attempt has been made to find out interactive relationship between the sea level rise and shoreline change of the study area. The results of the present study show that combined use of satellite imagery, sea level data and statistical methods can be a reliable method in correlating shoreline changes with sea level rise.

Shoreline extraction is based on an algorithm previously proposed by the authors that enables a positioning accuracy of 5 m root mean square error (RMSE). The impact of six storms registered over a period of seven months (between November 2001 and May 2002) and the beach recovery processes until December 2002 across a 100 km segment of the Gulf of Valencia on the Spanish Mediterranean coast were analysed by comparing 12 shoreline positions. The multiple shoreline positions obtained from Landsat images provide very useful information for describing the impact of storms and the recovery process across large segments of microtidal coast. This enables the identification of differences not only in the magnitude of change produced by a particular event but also in the cumulative effect associated with several storm events, and in the study of how the beach recovery process takes place. The results show a high level of spatial variability. Beaches with steep slopes experienced fewer changes than shallow slopes. The existence of well developed foredunes in some areas minimised the reduction in the beach width after the storms. Coastal orientation was another important factor in explaining storm impact and the recovery process. This factor affects not only the way the waves interact with the beaches but also the sediment longshore transport: beach regeneration is slower when the transport of sediments is limited by artificial infrastructures (groins, jetties, ports) or natural sediment traps (headlands). The main limitations of using the proposed methodology to obtain the shoreline position from Landsat images are related to: (i) the precision in the shoreline detection; (ii) the nature of the indicator obtained, that is, the water/land interface; and (iii) the registration instant defined by the image acquisition time. However, the high frequency of the data acquisition and the possibility to cover large coastal areas bring a new perspective that enriches other methods and tools used by coastal scientists.

J	Sekovski, I; Stecchi, F; Mancini, F; Del Rio, L				Sekovski, Ivan; Stecchi, Francesco; Mancini, Francesco; Del Rio, Laura			Image classification methods applied to shoreline extraction on very high-resolution multispectral imagery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Comprehension of vulnerability to coastal erosion in dynamic coastal environments strongly depends on accurate and frequent detection of shoreline position. The monitoring of such environments could benefit from the semi-automatic shoreline delineation method, especially in terms of time, cost, and labour-intensiveness. This article explores the potential of using a semi-automatic approach in delineating a proxy-based shoreline by processing high-resolution multispectral WorldView-2 satellite imagery. We studied the potential and differences of basic and easily accessible standard classification methods for shoreline detection. In particular we explored the use of high spatial and spectral resolution satellite imagery for shoreline extraction. The case study was carried out on a 40km coastal stretch facing the Northern Adriatic Sea (Italy) and belonging to the Municipality of Ravenna. In this area a frequent monitoring of shoreline position is required because of the extreme vulnerability to erosion phenomena that have resulted in a general trend of coastal retreat over recent decades. The wet/dry shorelines were delineated between the classes of wet and dry sand, resulting from different supervised (Parallelepiped, Gaussian Maximum Likelihood, Minimum-Distance-to-Means, and Mahalanobis distance) image classification techniques and the unsupervised Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA). In order to assign reliability to outcomes, the extrapolated shorelines were compared to reference shorelines visually identified by an expert, by assessing the average mean distance between them. In addition, the correlation between offset rates and different types of coast was investigated to examine the influence of specific coastal features on shoreline extraction capability. The results highlighted a high level of compatibility. The average median distance between reference shorelines and those resulting from the classification methods was less than 5.6m (Maximum likelihood), whereas a valuable distance of just 2.2m was detected from ISODATA and Mahalanobis. Heterogeneous coastal stretches exhibited a larger offset between extracted and reference shorelines than the homogeneous ones. To finally evaluate the coastal evolution of the area, results from Mahalanobis classification were compared to a shoreline derived from airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) data. The fine spatial resolution provided by both methodologies allowed a detailed Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) comparison, detecting an erosive trend within a wide portion of the study area.

Impacts of wave energy and littoral currents on shoreline erosion/accretion along the south-west coast of Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu using DSAS and geospatial technology	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The present study investigates the impact of wave energy and littoral current on shorelines along the south-west coast of Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu, India. The multi-temporal Landsat TM, ETM+ images acquired from 1999 to 2011 were used to demarcate the rate of shoreline shift using GIS-based Digital Shoreline Analysis System. The statistical analysis such as net shoreline movement and end point rate were determined from the multi-temporal shoreline layers. Moreover, the wave energy and seasonal littoral current velocity were calculated for each coastal zone using mathematical equations. The results reveal that the coastal zones, which include Kanyakumari, Kovalam, Manavalakurichi and Thengapattinam coasts, consisting of maximum wave energy along with high velocity of littoral current, have faced continuous erosion processes. The estimated wave energy along these zones ranges from 6.5 to 8.5 kJ/km(2) and the observed current velocity varies from 0.22 to 0.32 m/s during south-west and north-east monsoons. The cumulative effect of these coastal processes in the study area leads to severe erosion that is estimated as 300.63, 69.92, 54.12 and 66.11 m, respectively. However, the coastal zones, namely Rajakkamangalam, Ganapathipuram, Muttam and Colachel, have experienced sediment deposits due to current movement during the north-east monsoon. However, the trend changes during the south-west monsoon as a result of sediment drift through backwash. The spatial variation of shoreline and its impact on wave energy and the littoral current have been mapped using the geo-spatial technology. This study envisages the impact of coastal processes on site-specific shorelines. Hence, the study will be effective for sustainable coastal zone management.

J	Li, X; Zhou, YX; Zhang, LP; Kuang, RY				Li, Xing; Zhou, Yunxuan; Zhang, Lianpeng; Kuang, Runyuan			Shoreline change of Chongming Dongtan and response to river sediment load: A remote sensing assessment	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Chongming Dongtan, located in the center of the Yangtze estuary, is a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance and National Nature Reserve. The dramatic decrease in river sediment load has attracted considerable scientific interest to this area, but few studies have paid attention to the shoreline dynamics. This study uses Landsat images spanning from 1987 to 2010 and an orthogonal transect method, which was previously developed by the authors, to model the spatial and temporal characteristics of shoreline change and explore its relationship to reduced river sediment load by use of regression analysis on three different spatial scales. Results show a general decrease in the average rates of shoreline change throughout the entire study period. The maximum average shoreline change rate of +115.5 m/year occurred in the 1987-1990 interval and the minimum rate of +20.4 m/year occurred from 2006 to 2008. Based on average rates of shoreline change, the coast of Dongtan was divided into three segments: the erosion segment, eastern accretion segment, and northern accretion segment. The temporal pattern of the northern accretion segment is almost completely opposite to that of the eastern accretion segment. The strongest-correlation transects are located on the northern side of the eastern tip of Dongtan and the next strongest transects are located on the south side. Other transects have a very low correlation. Transect 19 near the easternmost tip of Dongtan has a near zero correlation (r(2) = 0.0045) but has the fastest accretion rate, and in general an increase in the shoreline change rate. The average rate of shoreline change and the net accretion area in Dongtan as a whole are significantly associated with sediment discharge at Datong Station (r(2) = 0.69 and 0.75, respectively). This implies that shoreline accretion in Dongtan will probably slow down gradually, if the river sediment load continues to decrease in the future. The shoreline change rates achieved using our approach are consistent with previous studies, but the relationship with the river sediment load is different from results in a previous study on intertidal wetland based on bathymetric maps. The results and methods may be helpful in coastal management and understanding the evolution of the entire delta from the perspective of shoreline change. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This study has been conducted on Pichavaram forest, south east coast of India, famous for its unique mangrove bio-diversity. The main objectives of this study were focused on monitoring land cover changes particularly for the mangrove forest in the Pichavaram area using multi-temporal Landsat images captured in the 1991, 2000, and 2009. The land use/land cover (LULC) estimation was done by a unique hybrid classification approach consisting of unsupervised and support vector machine (SVM)-based supervised classification. Once the vegetation and non-vegetation classes were separated, training site-based classification technology i.e., SVM-based supervised classification technique was used. The agricultural area, forest/plantation, degraded mangrove and mangrove forest layers were separated from the vegetation layer. Mud flat, sand/beach, swamp, sea water/sea, aquaculture pond, and fallow land were separated from non-vegetation layer. Water logged areas were delineated from the area initially considered under swamp and sea water-drowned areas. In this study, the object-based post-classification comparison method was employed for detecting changes. In order to evaluate the performance, an accuracy assessment was carried out using the randomly stratified sampling method, assuring distribution in a rational pattern so that a specific number of observations were assigned to each category on the classified image. The Kappa accuracy of SVM classified image was highest (94.53 %) for the 2000 image and about 94.14 and 89.45 % for the 2009 and 1991 images, respectively. The results indicated that the increased anthropogenic activities in Pichavaram have caused an irreversible loss of forest vegetation. These findings can be used both as a strategic planning tool to address the broad-scale mangrove ecosystem conservation projects and also as a tactical guide to help managers in designing effective restoration measures.

Poleward expansion of mangroves is a threshold response to decreased frequency of extreme cold events	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Regional warming associated with climate change is linked with altered range and abundance of species and ecosystems worldwide. However, the ecological impacts of changes in the frequency of extreme events have not been as well documented, especially for coastal and marine environments. We used 28 y of satellite imagery to demonstrate that the area of mangrove forests has doubled at the northern end of their historic range on the east coast of Florida. This expansion is associated with a reduction in the frequency of "extreme" cold events (days colder than -4 degrees C), but uncorrelated with changes in mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, and land use. Our analyses provide evidence for a threshold response, with declining frequency of severe cold winter events allowing for poleward expansion of mangroves. Future warming may result in increases in mangrove cover beyond current latitudinal limits of mangrove forests, thereby altering the structure and function of these important coastal ecosystems.

Tidal flat reflectance is sensitive to conditions that constantly change and cause variation of interstitial water contents along with exposure time, remnant water, etc. It is difficult to retrieve sediment grain size from optical reflectance alone without correcting the tidal condition effects. In this study, the tidal flat surface reflectance model according to grain size is proposed by two-step PCA transformation to remove tidal effects. The proposed method showed a potential to classify sediment by grain size regardless of exposure time and tidal conditions. We applied the method to nine scenes of LANDSAT TM images acquired between 1988 and 2009. The preliminary results well demonstrated that the proposed approach is effective to monitor changes of grain size distribution at a large scale independent of tidal conditions. However, this method has a limitation particularly over the vegetated areas and sand shoals mainly because of strong reflection in the NIR channels compared with other areas. For the validation, this study requires further field survey to obtain more in-situ data.

In this paper we use a case study to show how we monitor the Portuguese coast, between the period 2000 to 2014, using free available multi-temporal Landsat imagery (ETM+ and OLI sensors). First, all the multispectral images are panshaperned to meet the 15 meters spatial resolution of the panchromatic images. Second, using the Modification of Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and kmeans clustering method we extract the raster shoreline for each image acquisition time. Third, each raster shoreline is smoothed and vectorized using a penalized least square method. Fourth, using an image composed by five synthetic bands and an unsupervised classification method we extract the primary sand dunes. Finally, the visual comparison of the thematic primary sand dunes maps shows that an effective monitoring system can be implemented easily using free available remote sensing imagery data and open source software (QGIS and Orfeo toolbox).

Detecting biogenic pollution in Rybinsk Reservoir from satellite data and contact measurements	REMOTE SENSING OF THE OCEAN, SEA ICE, COASTAL WATERS, AND LARGE WATER REGIONS 2014	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Remote Sensing of the Ocean, Sea Ice, Coastal Waters, and Large Water Regions	SEP 24-25, 2014	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS	SPIE				The problem of excessive algae bloom in Volga River and adjacent reservoirs has long been acknowledged. Massive algae bloom causes serious economic damage and represents a threat to water inhabitants as well as man's life and health. From ecological point of view, cyanobacteria are the most dangerous algae type. The detection of areas most affected by algae bloom using remote sensing instruments was performed on the basis of data obtained from the following sensors: TM Landsat-5; ETM+ Landsat-7; OLI Landsat-8; Envisat MERIS and ASAR. Landsat data were used to compile color composites and select bands, the combination of which provides the best detection results. Visible satellite data were found to better manifest eutrophication zones with predomination of cyanobacteria. Envisat MERIS was used to compile suspended matter concentration charts providing rough estimates of algae content. Envisat ASAR data were compared with quasi-simultaneous visible range data. In-situ measurements of algae properties in Rybinsk Reservoir have been performed for many years by researchers of the I.D. Papanin Inland Water Biology Institute located on its coast. They regularly perform cruises to collect water samples and determine phytoplankton content. Joint analysis of Landsat-7/8 and contact data resulted in good correlation of both bloom areas of diatoms, which predominated in June 2013, and those of cyanobacteria, the lifecycle peak of which was recorded in late August - early September.

Multi-Temporal Satellite Imagery for Urban Expansion Assessment at Sharjah City/UAE	7TH IGRSM INTERNATIONAL REMOTE SENSING & GIS CONFERENCE AND EXHIBITION	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science				7th IGRSM International Remote Sensing and GIS Conference and Exhibition	APR 21-23, 2014	Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA	Institut Geospatial & Remote Sensing Malaysia, Univ Putra Malaysia, Sci & Technol Res Inst Defence, ANGKASA, Univ Malaya, UTAR, MARIM, Univ Teknologe Mara, NAHRIM, Univ Teknologe Petronas				Change detection is the process of identifying differences in land cover over time. As human and natural forces continue to alter the landscape, it is important to develop monitoring methods to assess and quantify these changes. Recent advances in satellite imagery, in terms of improved spatial and temporal resolutions, are allowing for efficient identification of change patterns and the prediction of areas of growth. Sharjah is the third largest and most populous city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It is located along the northern coast of the Persian Gulf on the Arabian Peninsula. After the discovery of oil and its export in the last four decades at UAE, it has experienced very rapid growth in industry, economy and population. The main purpose of this study is to detect urban development in Sharjah city by detecting and registering linear features in multi-temporal Landsat images. This paper used linear features for image registration that were chosen since they can be reliably extracted from imagery with significantly different geometric and radiometric properties. Derived edges from the registered images are used as the basis for change detection. Image registration and pixel-pixel subtraction has been implement using multi-temporal Landsat images for Sharjah City. Straight-line segments have been used for accurate co-registration as well as main element for a reliable change detection procedure. Results illustrate that highest range of growth that represented by linear features (building and roads) have been accrued during 1976 - 1987 and stand for 36.24 % of the total urban features inside Sharjah city. Moreover, result shows that since 1976 to 2010, the cumulative urban expansion inside Sharjah city is 71.9 %.																	1755-1307						2014	20								012010	10.1088/1755-1315/20/1/012010								WOS:000346761600010

The rubber trees are dominantly distributed in the Negeri Sembilan and Kedah on the west coast side of Peninsular Malaysia. This study is aimed to analyse the spatial distribution and biomass of rubber trees in Peninsular Malaysia with special emphasis in Negeri Sembilan State. Geospatial data from remote sensors are used to tackle the time and labour consuming problem due to the large spatial coverage and the need of continuous temporal data. Remote sensing imagery used in this study is a Landsat 5 TM. The image from optical sensor was used to sense the rubber trees and further classified rubber tree by different age.																	1755-1307						2014	18								012135	10.1088/1755-1315/18/1/012135								WOS:000345268900135

Shoreline Change and Coastal Vulnerability Characterization with Landsat Imagery: A Case Study in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland	SCOTTISH GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL												Observation of cause-effect patterns of change in coastal environments provides insights into vulnerable areas and supports prediction and adaptation to flooding and erosion. Historic and periodic (6-8 year intervals) imagery from the Landsat archive is used to investigate transformations in the Atlantic coast of two Scottish islands over the period 1989-2011. Supervised classification of spectrally normalized images followed by change detection and spatial analysis reveals the patterns of change and the location of the most dynamic coastal areas. Quantitative measures of recent shifts and movement rates of relevant coastal lines, such as the lower limit of land-based vegetation, are assessed with the Digital Shoreline Analysis System. While very low rates are indicated for horizontal changes in the position of the lower limit of land-based vegetation (0.3 m y(-1)), specific areas have been subjected to high rates of coastal progradation as well as erosion (e. g. 2.5 m y(-1) at Stilligarry). Information derived from satellite data supports the characterization of geomorphologically dynamic coasts at regional scales. With a rich and open access archive of imagery, a commitment to continuity, and compatibility with the Earth observation missions of other space programs, the Landsat mission offers useful and otherwise unavailable data for monitoring of coastal areas.

The study area is Pascagoula City on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, USA. Results showed that inclusion of shaded ISA as the response variable improved the model performance by reducing average error (AE) from 10.17 to 9.36%. Modelling with model-based atmospherically corrected imagery as predictors further reduced AE to 9.27%. The regression tree model using summer imagery as predictors (summer model) finally improved AE to 8.56%, compared with 9.28%, 9.50%, and 8.80% when using early spring, late spring, and autumn images as predictors, respectively; therefore the summer model was considered the optimal model. It was further applied to other seasonal images (i.e. early spring, late spring, and autumn images, as predictors) and the AE was 9.93%, 10.09%, and 9.12%, respectively, showing low seasonal sensitivity within this region. The findings in our study improved the modelling accuracy and expanded the scope of its future application in ISA estimation.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2014	35	10					3722	3740		10.1080/01431161.2014.915594								WOS:000337621700001

Understanding the sensitivity of these data is important since these phenomena are projected to increase as climate changes. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat data were used to study the observed patterns of forest disturbance at different spatial scales in temperate forest (US Gulf Coast) produced by tropical cyclones Charley (2004), Katrina (2005), Rita (2005), and Gustav (2008), and in tropical rainforests (Australia) produced by cyclone Yasi (2011). The severity of forest disturbance was quantified by applying spectral mixture analysis to the MODIS and Landsat coverages. Field studies were used to verify and compare the results. At the local scale Landsat data was sensitive to forest disturbance both within and between forest types. Higher tree mortality was observed in tropical rainforests than in temperate forests. This observation may be explained by forest type characteristics such as stem density, forest adaptation, and depth of root systems. At the species level, Landsat showed a gradient of forest resilience to tropical cyclone winds that agreed with observational field studies. At the landscape scale, the observed topographic effects on disturbance patterns were well represented by the MODIS data. Positive covariance was observed between surface orientation and slope on the severity of disturbance. Greater levels of disturbance were observed on windward surfaces with steeper slopes. Finally, at the regional scale, MODIS reproduced the pattern of forest damage associated with cyclone winds. The highest level of forest disturbance was observed on the right side of the cyclone track in the northern hemisphere (US Gulf Coast forest ecosystems) and on the left side in the southern hemisphere (Australian rainforest). At the regional scale, forest disturbance was positively associated with the decrease of wind speeds in an inland direction. Tropical cyclone surface winds explained 20% of forest disturbance, although characteristics of cumulative processes could cause this to be underestimated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

DYNAMIC LAND USE AND COASTLINE CHANGES IN ACTIVE ESTUARINE REGIONS - A STUDY OF SUNDARBAN DELTA	ISPRS TECHNICAL COMMISSION VIII SYMPOSIUM	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				ISPRS Technical Commission VIII Symposium	DEC 09-12, 2014	Hyderabad, INDIA	ISPRS Tech Commiss, Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Indian Soc Remote Sensing, Indian Soc Geomat				Alteration of natural environment in the wake of global warming is one of the most serious issues, which is being discussed across the world. Over the last 100 years, global sea level rose by 1.0-2.5 mm/y. Present estimates of future sea-level rise induced by climate change range from 28 to 98 cm for the year 2100. It has been estimated that a 1-m rise in sea-level could displace nearly 7 million people from their homes in India. The climate change and associated sea level rise is proclaimed to be a serious threat especially to the low lying coastal areas. Thus, study of long term effects on an estuarine region not only gives opportunity for identifying the vulnerable areas but also gives a clue to the periods where the sea level rise was significant and verifies climate change impact on sea level rise. Multi-temporal remote sensing data and GIS tools are often used to study the pattern of erosion/accretion in an area and to predict the future coast lines. The present study has been carried out in the Indian Sundarbans area. Major land cover/land use classes has been delineated and change analysis of the land cover/land use feature was performed using multi-temporal satellite images (Landsat MSS, TM, ETM+) from 1973 to 2010. Multivariate GIS based analysis was carried out to depict vulnerability and its trend, spatially. Digital Shoreline change analysis also was attempted for two islands, namely, Ghoramara and Sagar Islands using the past 40 years of satellite data and validated with 2012 Resourcesat-2 LISS III data.																	2194-9034						2014	40-8						133	139		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-8-133-2014								WOS:000368425300020

The near-infrared (band 4) data of Landsat 7 ETM+ are firstly applied to distinguish ocean and land, and then the thermal infrared (band 6) data are used to estimate SST. The algorithm of SST on north Taiwan is established in this study by the contrast between the in-situ SST data of the two nuclear power plants and the thermal infrared data of Landsat 7 ETM+. The standard deviation of SST retrieved through this algorithm is estimated to be 3.1 degrees C, but the mean difference is near 0. According to the retrieved SST from the satellite data, the warm-plume (>4 degrees C than offshore SST) discharge of Chinshan nuclear power plant reaches 540-1080m far from its discharge port, but for Kuosheng Nuclear Power Plant, the farthest of the warm-plume discharge from the discharge port is 390-900m. The retrieved SST gradually gets cooler by diffusion from the discharge port to the offshore. Apparently, the Landsat 7 ETM+ can be applied to measure the special variance of SST. The result also shows the area of significant thermal plume (>4 degrees C than offshore SST) are about 0.01-1.3km(2) and 0.09-8.53km(2) for the Chinshan and Kuosheng nuclear plants respectively. Moreover, the significant thermal plume area is affected by tides. During the flood tide, the warm-plume discharge gets close to the coast, and it will make the significant thermal plume area increase. Besides, the second significant thermal plume (>2 degrees C than offshore SST) is also increased during the ebb tide because the thermal plume may be taken away and diluted from the discharged port. However, due to different topographies, the area of thermal plume of the Kuosheng is broader than that of Chinshan nuclear power plant																	0197-7385		978-1-4799-3646-5				2014																		WOS:000412588000262

The Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) methodology, a transformation of Tasseled-Cap data space, was applied to detected changes in perennial coastal shrubland, woodland, and forest cover from 1999 to 2009. Results showed several principal points of interest, within which extensive contiguous areas of similar LEDAPS vegetation change (either disturbed or restored) were detected. Regrowth areas were delineated as burned forest areas in the Point Reyes National Seashore (PRNS) from the 1995 Vision Fire. LEDAPS-detected disturbance patterns on Inverness Ridge, PRNS in areas observed with dieback of tanoak and bay laurel trees was consistent with defoliation by sudden oak death (Phytophthora ramorum). LEDAPS regrowth pixels were detected over much of the predominantly grassland/herbaceous cover of the Olema Valley ranchland near PRNS. Extensive restoration of perennial vegetation cover on Crissy Field, Baker Beach and Lobos Creek dunes in San Francisco was identified. Based on these examples, the LEDAPS methodology will be capable of fulfilling much of the need for continual, low-cost monitoring of emerging changes to coastal ecosystems.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				DEC	2013	17	4					697	707		10.1007/s11852-013-0255-2								WOS:000327499400001

Regrowth of evergreen shrub and tree cover was prevalent along the several long stretches of the coast highway (CA Route 1) between the cities of Half Moon Bay and Santa Cruz. A number of state parks areas showed measurable vegetation restoration as well. The most prominent loss of perennial coastal vegetation over decade was in the Pescadero Marsh area, where the continued presence of levees has historically reduced flood conveyance capacity into and through the marshlands.

A recently developed method for detecting inundated areas based on integrated remotely sensed data (i.e., Radarsat-1, aerial imagery, LiDAR, Landsat 7 ETM+) was applied to assess the performance of the tidal model. The analysis demonstrates the applicability of the method and its agreement with traditional performance assessment techniques such as harmonic resynthesis and water level time series analysis. Based on the flooded/non-flooded coastal areas estimated by the integrated remotely sensed data, the model is able to adequately reproduce the extent of inundation within four sample areas from the coast along the Florida panhandle, correctly identifying areas as wet or dry over 85% of the time. Comparisons of the tidal model inundation to synoptic (point-in-time) inundation areas generated from the remotely sensed data generally agree with the results of the traditional performance assessment techniques. Moreover, this approach is able to illustrate the spatial distribution of model inundation accuracy allowing for targeted refinement of model parameters.																	2072-4292					NOV	2013	5	11					5662	5679		10.3390/rs5115662								WOS:000328626900014						
J	Choi, M; Han, S				Choi, Minha; Han, Seungjae			Remote sensing imageries for land cover and water quality dynamics on the west coast of Korea	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												As human activities influence land cover changes, the environment on human life such as water quality, has been impacted. In particular, huge constructions or reclamation projects are responsible for dramatic land cover changes. The Saemangeum area in South Korea has been one of the largest reclamation projects to progress nearly in two decades. In this study, Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus images were used to classify land cover types in the Saemangeum area. A change detection method was utilized to determine the impacts of the reclamation project. While wetland, grassland, and urban areas were increased, forest, water, and agricultural areas were decreased during the reclamation progress. Water quality analysis related to the land cover changes was conducted to determine the influence of reclamation construction on the environment. Chemical oxygen demand and suspended sediment variability were significantly impacted by the sea current changes after the dyke construction. On the contrary, water temperature and dissolved oxygen were affected by the seasonal influences rather than the reclamation construction. Total nitrogen and total phosphorus were influenced by the fertilizers and pesticides as a result of agricultural activity. The trends of suspended sediment from Landsat images were similar with those from the ground observation sites and also impacted by the dyke construction.																	0167-6369					NOV	2013	185	11					9111	9124		10.1007/s10661-013-3240-1								WOS:000325116500027	23685982

In this context we present a methodology for effective monitoring and mapping of Posidonia oceanica (PO) meadows in turbid waters using remote sensing techniques tested by means of LAI (Leaf Area Index) point sea truth measurements. Preliminary results using Daedalus airborne sensor are reported referring to the PO meadows at Civitavecchia site (central Tyrrhenian sea) where vessel traffic due to presence of important harbors and huge power plant represent strong impact factors. This coastal area, 100 km far from Rome (Central Italy), is characterized also by significant hydrodynamic variations and other anthropogenic factors that affect the health of seagrass meadows with frequent turbidity and suspended sediments in the water column. During 2011-2012 years point measurements of several parameters related to PO meadows phenology were acquired on various stations distributed along 20 km of coast between the Civitavecchia and S. Marinella sites. The Daedalus airborne sensor multispectral data were preprocessed with the support of satellite (MERIS) derived water quality parameters to obtain here improved thematic maps of the local PO distribution. Their thematic accuracy was then evaluated as agreement (R-2) with the point sea truth measurements and regressive modeling using an on purpose developd method.

In this study, several estimators were compared as SAE techniques for 12 counties in the northern Oregon Coast range. The estimators that were compared consisted of three indirect estimators, multiple linear regression (MLR), gradient nearest neighbor imputation (GNN), and most similar neighbor imputation (MSN), and five composite estimators based on MLR, MSN, and GNN with county-level direct estimates. Forest attributes of interest were density (trees/ha), basal area (m2/ha), cubic volume (m3/ha), quadratic mean diameter (cm), and average height of 100 largest trees per ha. The sample consisted of 680 annual Forest Inventory Analysis plots, a spatially balanced sample across all conditions and ownerships. The auxiliary data consisted of 16 Landsat variables, a land cover classification, tree cover, and elevation. Overall, the composite estimators were superior when both precision and bias of estimation were considered.																	0015-749X	1938-3738				OCT	2013	59	5					536	548		10.5849/forsci.12-073								WOS:000326258300004

Change and fragmentation trends of Zhanjiang mangrove forests in southern China using multi-temporal Landsat imagery (1977-2010)	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Mangrove forests, which are found in saline coastal environments around the tropical and subtropical latitudes, are among the most productive terrestrial ecosystems in the world and provide valuable ecological and societal goods and services. The objective of this work was to characterize the spatio-temporal changes in mangrove distribution and fragmentation patterns in the Zhanjiang National Mangrove Forest Nature Reserve, Guangdong province of Southern China, from 1977 through 2010. In addition, a major goal was to assess the socio-economic drivers contributing to the chronic changes taking place within and around the mangrove reserve. Land use and land cover data sets were generated for the reserve for multiple years via unsupervised classification using Landsat time series images. Mangrove fragmentation patterns were then assessed with a fragmentation model. Results revealed that the mangrove spatial extent decreased sharply during the period from 1977 to 1991 due to deforestation caused by diverse development programs, particularly shrimp farming. Afterwards, there was a continuous increase in mangrove extent from 1991 to 2010 due to afforestation and conservation efforts. The mangrove fragmentation trends depicted by the fragmentation model had a high degree of correlation with the observed areal changes. Additionally, the recorded dynamics of the local biodiversity (mainly birds) were consistent with the mangrove ecosystem fragmentation trends over time, and different fragmentation components, including interior, perforated and edge, had distinct impacts on the local mangrove-dependent biodiversity. The most effective way to protect and expand the current mangroves include the following: (1) establishment of mangrove natural reserves, (2) forceful implementation of regulations, (3) establishment of educational programs related to mangrove management, (4) deepening international exchanges and cooperation and (5) increasing the transparency of the project implementation process. Together such management measures will lead towards responsible and sustainable utilization of the mangrove ecosystems. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Due to the complexity in this type of coast, it is difficult to extract the coastline with traditional automated mapping approaches. In this paper, we present an automated methodobject-based region growing integrating edge detection (OBRGIE) for the extraction of this type of coastline. In this method, a new object feature named OMI (object merging index) is proposed to separate land and sea. The OBRGIE method was applied to Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) (pixel size 30m) and Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT-5) (pixel size 10 m) images of two coastal segments with lengths of 272.7 km and 35.5 km respectively, and the accuracy of the extracted coastlines was assessed in comparison with the manually delineated coastlines. The mean and RMSE (root mean square error) are 16.0 m and 16.4 m respectively for the TM images, and 8.0 m and 8.6 m, respectively, for the SPOT-5 images, indicating that the proposed method derives coastlines with pixel accuracy. The OBRGIE method is also found to be robust to the segmentation scale parameter, and the OMI feature is much more effective than the spectral attribute in separating land and sea in aquaculture coasts. This method may provide an inexpensive means of fast coastline mapping from remotely sensed imagery with relatively fine-to-moderate spatial resolution in coastal sectors with intense human interference.																	2072-4292					SEP	2013	5	9					4470	4487		10.3390/rs5094470								WOS:000328613300015

Bathymetric Modeling from Satellite Imagery via Single Band Algorithm (SBA) and Principal Components Analysis (PCA) in Southern Caspian Sea	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Remotely sensed imagery is proving to be a useful tool to estimate water depths in coastal zones. Bathymetric algorithms attempt to isolate water attenuation and hence depth from other factors by using different combinations of spectral bands. In this research, images of absolute bathymetry using two different but related methods in a region in the southern Caspian Sea coasts has been produced. The first method used a Single Band Algorithm (SBA) and assumed a constant water attenuation coefficient throughout the blue band. The second method used Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to adjust for varying water attenuation coefficients without additional ground truth data. PCA method (r=-0.672394) appears to match our control points slightly better than single band algorithm (r=-0.645404). It is clear that both methods can be used as rough estimates of bathymetry for many coastal zone studies in the southern Caspian Sea such as near shore fisheries, coastal erosion, water quality, recreation siting and so forth. The presented methodology can be considered as the first step toward mapping bathymetry in the southern Caspian Sea. Further research must investigate the determination of the nonlinear optimization techniques as well as the assessment of these models' performance in the study area.

J	Pu, RL; Bell, S				Pu, Ruiliang; Bell, Susan			A protocol for improving mapping and assessing of seagrass abundance along the West Central Coast of Florida using Landsat TM and EO-1 ALI/Hyperion images	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Seagrass habitats are characteristic features of shallow waters worldwide and provide a variety of ecosystem functions. Remote sensing techniques can help collect spatial and temporal information about seagrass resources. In this study, we evaluate a protocol that utilizes image optimization algorithms followed by atmospheric and sunglint corrections to the three satellite sensors [Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) Advanced Land Imager (ALI) and Hyperion (HYP)] and a fuzzy synthetic evaluation technique to map and assess seagrass abundance in Pinellas County, FL, USA. After image preprocessed with image optimization algorithms and atmospheric and sunglint correction approaches, the three sensors' data were used to classify the submerged aquatic vegetation cover (%SAV cover) into 5 classes with a maximum likelihood classifier. Based on three biological metrics [%SAV, leaf area index (LA!), and Biomass] measured from the field, nine multiple regression models were developed for estimating the three biometrics with spectral variables derived from the three sensors' data. Then, five membership maps were created with the three biometrics along with two environmental factors (water depth and distance-to-shoreline). Finally, seagrass abundance maps were produced by using a fuzzy synthetic evaluation technique and five membership maps. The experimental results indicate that the HYP sensor produced the best results of the 5-class classification of %SAV cover (overall accuracy = 87% and Kappa = 0.83 vs. 82% and 0.77 by ALI and 79% and 0.73 by TM) and better multiple regression models for estimating the three biometrics (R-2 = 0.66, 0.62 and 0.61 for %SAV, LAI and Biomass vs. 0.62, 0.61 and 0.55 by ALI and 0.58, 0.56 and 0.52 by TM) for creating seagrass abundance maps along with two environmental factors. Combined our results demonstrate that the image optimization algorithms and the fuzzy synthetic evaluation technique were effective in mapping detailed seagrass habitats and assessing seagrass abundance with the 30-m resolution data collected by the three sensors.

Rates of shoreline change along the coast of Bangladesh	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												Bangladesh, at the confluence of the sediment-laden Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers, supports an enormous and rapidly growing population (> 140 million in 2011), across low-lying alluvial and delta plains that have accumulated over the past few thousand years. It has been identified as one of the most vulnerable places in the world to the impacts of climate change and sea-level rise. Although abundant sediment supply has resulted in accretion on some parts of the coast of Bangladesh, others are experiencing rapid erosion. We report a systematic assessment of rates of shoreline change over a 20-year period from 1989 to 2009, using Landsat satellite images with pixel resolution of 30 m on the ground. A Band ratio approach, using Band-5 divided by Band-2, discriminated the water line on images that were largely cloud-free, adequately registered, and at comparable tidal stages. Rates of shoreline change were calculated for > 16,000 transects generated at 50 m intervals along the entire mainland coastline (> 1,100 km) and major islands, using the End Point Rate (EPR) method in the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) extension in ArcGISA (R). Erosion characterises most of the seaward margin of the Sundarbans in western Bangladesh. Retreat rates of up to 20 m/yr are typical, with little evidence that local devastation of the mangrove fringe by Cyclone Sidr in November 2007 had resulted in uncharacteristic long-term rates of retreat where it made landfall. Erosion exceeded accretion in the Barguna Patuakhali coastal zone, most of which eroded at up to 20 m/yr, but with truncation of the southern tip of the Patharghata Upazila at up to 100 m/yr. In Bhola, erosion at rates of up to 120 m/yr were observed along much of the coast, but in the Noakhali Feni coastal zone, similar rates of erosion were balanced by rapid accretion of the main promontory by more than 600 m/yr. Rates of change were more subdued in the Chittagong and Cox's Bazar coastal zones of southeast Bangladesh. Islands in the Meghna estuary were especially dynamic; Hatiya Island accreted along some of its shoreline by 50 km(2) between 1989 and 2009, but lost 65 km(2) through erosion elsewhere, resulting in the island moving south. Similar trends were observed on adjacent islands. The overall area changed relatively little across the entire coastline over the 20-year period with accretion of up to 315 km(2), countered by erosion of about 307 km(2).

Assessment of Coastal Erosion Vulnerability around Midnapur-Balasore Coast, Eastern India using Integrated Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Digha coastal region in the northeastern part of the Bay of Bengal is potentially vulnerable to erosional hazard. The present study assessed the coastal erosion vulnerability along this 65 km long coastal stretch located between Rasulpur (Midnapur) and Subarnarekha (Balasore) estuarine complex, which had been subjected to anthropogenic intervention. Multi-resolution Landsat satellite imagery were used for shoreline change study from 1972 to 2010. During this period, accretion was recorded updrift of artificial structures, viz, seawall, groin, pylons and jetties; while, extensive erosion was recorded in downdrift areas of these structures. Assessment was subsequently divided into four categories ranging from "high erosion" to "accretion". Data from several sources were compiled to map landuse and human activities in the coastal zone. This map was divided into four categories, ranging from "very high capital" to "no capital" landuse. Population density map of the surrounding coastal villages was generated using census data, and divided into four categories ranging from "high density area" to "very low density area". Subsequently, coastal erosion vulnerability was assessed by combining coastal retreat with landuse type and population density in this study area using simple vector algebraic technique. Zones of vulnerability of different magnitude (viz., very high, high, moderate, and low) have been identified. Furthermore, calculation of "imminent collapse zone (ICZ)" shows that maximum values are around artificial structures and anthropogenic activities. The coastal erosion vulnerability map prepared from this study can be used for proper planning and management of this coastal region.																	0255-660X					SEP	2013	41	3					675	686		10.1007/s12524-012-0251-2								WOS:000324249800019

Tectonically, Ras Banas peninsula is considered as a part of Pre-Miocene continental slope. Their sedimentary successions account the sedimentation history from Middle Miocene up to Holocene which in part documents the deformational impacts that accompanied the Red Sea rifling. The Ras Banas sedimentary succession exhibits frequent unconformities and conspicuous lithologic variations comprising mixed siliciclastics/carbonate facies, evaporites, open marine and organic build up limestone as well as coral reefs, continental sandy gravels and beach sands. The carbonate succession at the area documents the highstand status of the Red Sea water from Middle Miocene to Pleistocene in accord to the global sea-level fluctuations. The chemical data of the studied rock units substantiates the field and petrographical results. On silica- lime- magnesia diagram, the syn-rifting mixed siliciclastics/carbonates are scattered between the quartz and dolomite reference points. The post-rifting carbonates are mainly pure dolostone, limestone and sandy limestone. Norm calculations indicate that the evaporites are mainly gypsum and anhydrite with substantial normative dolomite. The tectono-sedimentary evolution of Ras Banas sedimentary sequence in relation to Red Sea rifling phases and sea level fluctuations is discussed. New mapping was undertaken for the Ras Banas Peninsula using remote sensing and GIS techniques including band ratioing, principle component analysis and false color composition. Based on mineralogical data, special interest has been paid to the diagnostic spectral features that discriminate between evaporites and carbonates on one hand and between dolomite and calcite on the other.

Land-cover change in the conterminous United States from 1973 to 2000	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS												Land-cover change in the conterminous United States was quantified by interpreting change from satellite imagery for a sample stratified by 84 ecoregions. Gross and net changes between 11 land-cover classes were estimated for 5 dates of Landsat imagery (1973, 1980, 1986, 1992, and 2000). An estimated 673,000 km(2)(8.6%) of the United States' land area experienced a change in land cover at least one time during the study period. Forest cover experienced the largest net decline of any class with 97,000 km(2) lost between 1973 and 2000. The large decline in forest cover was prominent in the two regions with the highest percent of overall change, the Marine West Coast Forests (24.5% of the region experienced a change in at least one time period) and the Eastern Temperate Forests (11.4% of the region with at least one change). Agriculture declined by approximately 90,000 km(2) with the largest annual net loss of 12,000 km(2) yr(-1) occurring between 1986 and 1992. Developed area increased by 33% and with the rate of conversion to developed accelerating rate over time. The time interval with the highest annual rate of change of 47,000 km(2) yr(-1) (0.6% per year) was 1986-1992. This national synthesis documents a spatially and temporally dynamic era of land change between 1973 and 2000. These results quantify land change based on a nationally consistent monitoring protocol and contribute fundamental estimates critical to developing understanding of the causes and consequences of land change in the conterminous United States.

The large number of people who live close to the coast and rely directly on marine resources for food and income paradoxically increases the value of, but also the threats to, these ecosystems. A key strategy of the Coral Triangle Initiative is to protect shallow coastal ecosystems through the design and implementation of resilient networks of marine protected areas (MPAs). This strategy requires accurate spatial data on the distribution and extent of coastal habitats (coral reef, seagrass and mangrove) at scales which match conservation planning decisions. In the Coral Triangle, seagrass distribution maps are not readily available at ecoregional scales. The Lesser Sunda ecoregion, extending from Bali, Indonesia to Timor-Leste, is one of 11 ecoregions of the Coral Triangle and a high priority for conservation and sustainable management of marine resources. To support the design of a resilient MPA network for the Lesser Sunda ecoregion, a seagrass distribution map was generated based on Landsat imagery, literature review and groundtruth data. Seagrass beds were estimated to cover an area of 273 km(2) at an overall accuracy of 78%. Use of the seagrass distribution map in the MPA design improved the habitat representation and connectivity - key criteria for resilient MPA design. The final MPA design included 80 km(2) of seagrass beds, with more than half the beds adjacent to coral reefs and mangroves. This study demonstrates the effective use of Landsat imagery and remote sensing techniques to derive ecoregional scale seagrass maps supporting MPA network design. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This study presents an approach to analysis of waterline movement based on the beach slope, estimated from two effective images with Landsat images data. Two images acquired at different stages of the tide were processed to delineate accurately the position of the waterline. Then waterlines were assigned heights using elevations predicted by a two-dimensional non-linear tidal assimilation model. Beach slope can be calculated piecewise using the heighted shorelines based on the equiangular triangle theory. The positions of the national tidal height datum coastline can be obtained by the beach slope calculation method to accurately monitor the changing of coastline. A change in the coastline of the southwest tidal flat of the Yellow River delta, from Tianshuigou to the Xiaoqing River mouth, was detected by combining field measurements of profiles and bathymetric data. The root mean squared error (RMSE) of the calculated slope of the intertidal zone was one order of magnitude less than the measured slope. The minimum error of self-consistency check is 0.2%. The RMSE between the coastlines estimated by the proposed method and those surveyed data varies from 53.98 m to 217.72 m. It is shown that this method is more suitable for the two years and over the time scales of shoreline change monitoring. To assess erosion/accretion patterns in the tidal flat, and the controlling factors, the volume of the beach was investigated as a possible indicator. The accepted coastline position and changes in the beach volume were used to monitor the changing pattern of accretion and erosion along the coast southwest of the recent Yellow River mouth.

No one data set has been able to capture the full forest disturbance and land use record through time, so in this study, we combined multiple lines of evidence to examine trends, for six US regions, in forest area affected by harvest, fire, wind, insects, and forest conversion to urban/surburban use. We built an integrated geodatabase for the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) with data spanning the nation and decades, from remote sensing observations of forest canopy dynamics, geospatial data sets on disturbance and conversion, and statistical inventories, to evaluate relationships between canopy change observations and casual processes at multiple scales. Results show the variability of major change processes through regions across decades. Harvest affected more forest area than any other major change processes in the North East, North Central, Southeast, and South central regions. In the Pacific Coast and Intermountain West, more forest area was affected by harvest than forest fires. Canopy change rates at regional scales confounded the trends of individual forest change processes, showing the importance of landscape scale data. Local spikes in observed canopy change rates were attributed to wind and fire events, as well as volatile harvest regimes. This study improves the geographic model of forest change processes by updating regional trends for major disturbance and conversion processes and combining data on the dynamics of fire, wind, insects, harvest, and conversion into one integrated geodatabase for the CONUS.

Species distribution modelling for the people: unclassified landsat TM imagery predicts bird occurrence at fine resolutions	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim Assessing the influence of land cover in species distribution modelling is limited by the availability of fine-resolution land-cover data appropriate for most species responses. Remote-sensing technology offers great potential for predicting species distributions at large scales, but the cost and required expertise are prohibitive for many applications. We test the usefulness of freely available raw remote-sensing reflectance data in predicting species distributions of 40 commonly occurring bird species in western Oregon. Location Central Coast Range, Cascade and Klamath Mountains Oregon, USA. Methods Information on bird observations was collected from 4598 fixed-radius point counts. Reflectance data were obtained using 30-m resolution Landsat imagery summarized at scales of 150, 500, 1000 and 2000m. We used boosted regression tree (BRT) models to analyse relationships between distributions of birds and reflectance values and evaluated prediction performance of the models using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values. Results Prediction success of models using all reflectance values was high (mean AUC=0.79 +/- 0.10 SD). Further, model performance using individual reflectance bands exceeded those that used only Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The relative influence of band 4 predictors was highest, indicating the importance of variables associated with vegetation biomass and photosynthetic activity. Across spatial scales, the average influence of predictors at the 2000m scale was greatest. Main Conclusions We demonstrate that unclassified remote-sensing imagery can be used to produce species distribution models with high prediction success. Our study is the first to identify general patterns in the usefulness of spectral reflectances for species distribution modelling of multiple species. We conclude that raw Landsat Thematic Mapper data will be particularly useful in species distribution models when high-resolution predictions are required, including habitat change detection studies, identification of fine-scale biodiversity hotspots and reserve design.																	1366-9516					JUL	2013	19	7					855	866		10.1111/ddi.12093								WOS:000320327500019

Erosion and Accretion Index for Kuwaiti Coast	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Assessment of long term erosion and accretion rate of the coastal area is essential for selection of different types of coastal structures. For example, it is not advisable to develop housing infrastructure on the coast, which is historically eroding. Similarly it is not preferable to select an accreting site for the construction of a port in order to avoid annual maintenance dredging after construction of the port. Kuwait is a coastal country and hence it is essential to understand the long term coastal morphological changes of the coast and identify the historically accreting or eroding or stable coast over a period of many years, say 10 to 15 years. The coastline evolution of Kuwait is investigated using Landsat remote sensing images (30 m resolution) from 1989 to 2003, IRS-P5 images (2.5 m resolution) obtained for the year 2006-07 and 2003 aerial photos (0.38 m resolution). A total of 130 grids, each at a spacing of 1 nautical mile is used. The extent of accretion/erosion for 17 years (from 1989 to 2006) for the mainland coastline of Kuwait is assessed. The average shoreline change/year is calculated. Erosion and accretion index for each location is assigned based on the average annual erosion and accretion. From this study, it is found that annual erosion of more than 25 m does not exist in Kuwait. 1.54% of the coast has experienced annual erosion of 10 to 25 m and 0.77% of the coast has experienced 0 to 10 m annual erosion. 3.85% of the coast is stable. 43.85% of the coast has annual accretion of 0 to 10 in, 11.54% has annual accretion of 10 to 25 m and 38.46% has annual accretion of greater than 25 m. The complete details of this study are presented in this paper. The results will be useful for integrated management of Kuwaiti coast.																	1735-6865					SUM	2013	7	3					779	784										WOS:000319952600016

These fragile ecosystems are in need for conservation. The coastal state of Bahia hosts the most extensive and richest area of coral reefs in the South Atlantic Ocean. Assessment, planning and management of coral reef ecosystems are particularly challenging tasks. This work shows how the creation of a GIS improves the process of management, monitoring and conservation of the Bahian reef environments The initial data input started by the vectorization of 1) bathymetric data from the Bureau of Hydrography and Navigation (DHN), 2) shoreline and mangrove areas from Landsat 7 ETM + images, 3) near surface reefs from Quickbird images, and 4) coastal and marine protected areas of federal, state and local administrations. Geological, physical, biological and social information was then included in order to create a suitable marine GIS for conservation aims. The data includes information on sediment granulometry and transport patterns, rocky substrate outcrops, sea surface temperature, wave direction, rain precipitation, major contributing river discharge, artisanal fishery, benthic cover and bleaching data. ReefBahia GIS has provided essential information for a better understanding of coral reefs of the state of Bahia geological and ecological characteristics such as mapping, representation, connectivity and biodiversity of coral reefs, geological facies, Quaternary sedimentation, numeric modeling of wave refraction and monitoring of bleaching events.

Localisation and temporal variability of groundwater discharge into the Dead Sea using thermal satellite data	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The semi-arid region of the Dead Sea heavily relies on groundwater resources. This dependence is exacerbated by both population growth and agricultural activities and demands a sustainable groundwater management. Yet, information on groundwater discharge as one main component for a sustainable management varies significantly in this area. Moreover, discharge locations, volume and temporal variability are still only partly known. A multi-temporal thermal satellite approach is applied to localise and semi-quantitatively assess groundwater discharge along the entire coastline. The authors use 100 Landsat ETM + band 6.2 data, spanning the years between 2000 and 2011. In the first instance, raw data are transformed to sea surface temperature (SST). To account for groundwater intermittency and to provide a seasonally independent data set a dagger T (maximum SST range) per-pixel within biennial periods is calculated subsequently. Groundwater affected areas (GAA) are characterised by a dagger T < 8.5 A degrees C. Unaffected areas exhibit values > 10 A degrees C. This allows the exact identification of 37 discharge locations (clusters) along the entire Dead Sea coast, which spatially correspond to available in situ discharge observations. Tracking the GAA extents as a direct indicator of groundwater discharge volume over time reveals (1) a temporal variability correspondence between GAA extents and recharge amounts, (2) the reported rigid ratios of discharge volumes between different spring areas not to be valid for all years considering the total discharge, (3) a certain variability in discharge locations as a consequence of the Dead Sea level drop, and finally (4) the assumed flushing effect of old Dead Sea brines from the sedimentary body to have occurred at least during the two series of 2000-2001 and 2010-2011.

The relationship of spatial-temporal changes in fringe mangrove extent and adjacent land-use: Case study of Kien Giang coast, Vietnam	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Fringe mangroves are recognised as a highly valuable resource due to their provision of multiple ecosystem services. However, accelerating human-pressures on mangrove forests are resulting in the loss of key mangrove ecosystem services. In this paper, we assessed spatial-temporal changes in the extent and width of fringe mangroves, and changes in adjacent land use. The study focused on the Kien Giang Province, Vietnam, for the period 1989-2009. The total mangrove extent was estimated at seven points in tithe using four Landsat TM images (1989, 1992, 2003, and 2006) and three SPOT images (1995, 2003 and 2009). Supervised classification was conducted for image classification and mapping changes using a Maximum Livelihood Classifier approach. Changes in mangrove width were calculated for 2003 and 2009 using the Digital Shoreline Analysis Application. An assessment of the four Landsat TM images showed a significant decrease in mangrove extent for the periods 1989-1992 (-2.7% yr(-1)) and 2003-2006 (-2.1% yr(-1)), while a significant increase in mangrove extent was observed during 1992-2003 (0.7% yr(-1)). SPOT images were used to classify shoreline land cover into four types, namely mangroves; shrimp farms; built-up areas; and bare and wet ground areas. The total loss of fringe mangrove extent was significantly correlated with the increase in extent of other land covers, especially shrimp farms and bare and wet ground, during the period of 2003-2009. The overall accuracy assessment of the classification using 2003 and 2009 SPOT 5 images was 90.1% and 90.5% respectively. The overall accuracy assessment of the 2003 Landsat image was 92.1%. This accuracy in classification of mangroves and non-mangroves showed that use of Landsat images was adequate for assessing spatial-temporal mangrove dynamics when higher spatial resolution satellite images were limited. The results highlight the dynamic nature of fringe mangrove communities in the region, and provide data useful for informing shoreline mangrove rehabilitation, conservation efforts, and national monitoring programs for estimating mangrove values of carbon sequestration and shoreline protection functions in Vietnam.

J	Abdullah, HM; Mahboob, MG; Banu, MR; Seker, DZ				Abdullah, Hasan Muhammad; Mahboob, M. Golam; Banu, Mehmuna R.; Seker, Dursun Zafer			Monitoring the drastic growth of ship breaking yards in Sitakunda: a threat to the coastal environment of Bangladesh	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The vast coastal and marine resources that occur along the southern edge of Bangladesh make it one of the most productive areas of the world. However, due to growing anthropogenic impacts, this area is under considerable environmental pressure from both physical and chemical stress factors. Ship breaking, or the dismantling and demolition of out-of-service ocean-going vessels, has become increasingly common in many coastal areas. To investigate the extent of ship breaking activities in Bangladesh along the Sitakunda coast, various spatial and non-spatial data were obtained, including remote sensing imagery, statistical records and published reports. Impacts to coastal and marine life were documented. Available data show that ship breaking activities cause significant physical disturbance and release toxic materials into the environment, resulting in adverse effects to numerous marine taxonomic groups such as fish, mammals, birds, reptiles, plants, phytoplankton, zooplankton and benthic invertebrates. Landsat imagery illustrates that the negatively impacted coastal area has grown 308.7 % from 367 ha in 1989 to 1,133 ha in 2010. Physicochemical and biological properties of coastal soil and water indicate substantially elevated pollution that poses a risk of local, regional and even global contamination through sea water and atmospheric transport. While damage to the coastal environment of Bangladesh is a recognized hazard that must be addressed, the economic benefits of ship breaking through job creation and fulfilling the domestic demand for recycled steel must be considered. Rather than an outright ban on beach breaking of ships, the enterprise must be recognized as a true and influential industry that should be held responsible for developing an economically viable and environmentally proactive growth strategy. Evolution of the industry toward a sustainable system can be aided through reasonable and enforceable legislative and judicial action that takes a balanced approach, but does not diminish the value of coastal conservation.

Radiometric normalization for change detection in peatlands: a modified temporal invariant cluster approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Radiometric normalization is a vital stage in any change detection study due to the complex interactions of radiance and irradiance between the Earth's surface and atmosphere. Compensation for variables such as sun's angle, surface profile, atmospheric conditions, and sensor calibration coefficients are essential in achieving a radiometrically stable data base of multi-temporal, multi-spectral imagery for a change detection study. In this study, five Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images taken over the east coast of Ireland in 2001 were geometrically corrected and topographically normalized for further processing and analysis. Assessment of various vegetation indices showed that the enhanced vegetation index 2 (EVI2) gave the highest accuracy in identifying the various vegetation types and habitats in the Wicklow Mountains National Park. The initial analysis of radiometric normalization with temporal invariant clusters (TICs) gave poor results due to the spectral heterogeneity of urban pixels within each image. A revised TIC subset normalized method was developed using regional growth parameters in urban environments to limit the spatial and spectral extent of pixels used in the TIC scene normalization process. Correlation analysis between the TIC-subset-normalized ETM+ data and Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) absolute corrected data produced coefficient of determination (R-2) values between 0.88 and 0.98. Such results demonstrated the robustness of the TIC subset normalization procedure when correcting for atmospheric variability between images while maintaining spectral integrity. Statistical analysis on master slave and TIC-subset-normalized slave data using cumulative distribution curves derived from image histograms showed an 86.93% reduction in the maximum difference between master and slave data due to the TIC subset normalization process. This procedure of radiometric normalization is suitable in landscapes with a low density of spectrally stable targets.

Land Loss Due to Recent Hurricanes in Coastal Louisiana, USA	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The aim of this study is to improve estimates of wetland land loss in two study regions of coastal Louisiana, U.S.A., due to the extreme storms that impacted the region between 2004 and 2009. The estimates are based on change-detection-mapping analysis that incorporates pre and postlandfall (Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Gustav, and Ike) fractional-water classifications using a combination of high-resolution (<5 m) QuickBird, IKONOS, and GeoEye-1, and medium-resolution (30 m) Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite imagery. This process was applied in two study areas: the Hackberry area located in the southwestern part of chenier plain that was impacted by Hurricanes Rita (September 24, 2005) and Ike (September 13, 2008), and the Delacroix area located in the eastern delta plain that was impacted by Hurricanes Katrina (August 29, 2005) and Gustav (September 1, 2008). In both areas, effects of the hurricanes include enlargement of existing bodies of open water and erosion of fringing marsh areas. Surge-removed marsh was easily identified in stable marshes but was difficult to identify in degraded or flooded marshes. Persistent land loss in the Hackberry area due to Hurricane Rita was approximately 5.8% and increased by an additional 7.9% due to Hurricane Ike, although this additional area may yet recover. About 80% of the Hackberry study area remained unchanged since 2003. In the Delacroix area, persistent land loss due to Hurricane Katrina measured approximately 4.9% of the study area, while Hurricane Gustav caused minimal impact of 0.6% land loss by November 2009. Continued recovery in this area may further erase Hurricane Gustav's impact in the absence of new storm events.																	0749-0208					SPR	2013					63		97	109		10.2112/SI63-009.1								WOS:000321077600009						
J	Alphan, H				Alphan, Hakan			Bi-Temporal Analysis of Landscape Changes in the Easternmost Mediterranean Deltas Using Binary and Classified Change Information	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The aim of this study is (1) to quantify landscape changes in the easternmost Mediterranean deltas using bi-temporal binary change detection approach and (2) to analyze relationships between conservation/management designations and various categories of change that indicate type, degree and severity of human impact. For this purpose, image differencing and ratioing were applied to Landsat TM images of 1984 and 2006. A total of 136 candidate change images including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and principal component analysis (PCA) difference images were tested to understand performance of bi-temporal pre-classification analysis procedures in the Mediterranean delta ecosystems. Results showed that visible image algebra provided high accuracies than did NDVI and PCA differencing. On the other hand, Band 5 differencing had one of the lowest change detection performances. Seven superclasses of change were identified using from/to change categories between the earlier and later dates. These classes were used to understand spatial character of anthropogenic impacts in the study area and derive qualitative and quantitative change information within and outside of the conservation/management areas. Change analysis indicated that natural site and wildlife reserve designations fell short of protecting sand dunes from agricultural expansion in the west. East of the study area, however, was exposed to least human impact owing to the fact that nature conservation status kept human interference at a minimum. Implications of these changes were discussed and solutions were proposed to deal with management problems leading to environmental change.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				MAR	2013	51	3					541	554		10.1007/s00267-012-0001-9								WOS:000315416900023	23307139

Classifying inundation limits in SE coast of India: application of GIS	NATURAL HAZARDS												A study on the possible inundation limit in SE coast of India was carried out using various physical, geological and satellite imageries. The coastal inundation hazard map was prepared for this particular region as it was affected by many cyclones, flooding, storm surge and tsunami waves during the last six decades. The results were generated using various satellite data (IRS-P6 LISS3; LANDSAT ETM; LANDSAT-5 ETM; LANDSAT MSS) and digital elevation models (ASTER GLOBAL DEM), and a coastal vulnerability index was generated for the entire coastal stretch of Nagapattinam region in SE coast of India. The coastal area which will be submerged totally due to a 1-5 m rise in water level due to any major natural disaster (tsunami or cyclone) indicates that 56-320 km(2) will be submerged in this particular region. The results suggest that nearly 7 towns and 69 villages with 667,477 people will be affected and indicate that proper planning needs to be done for future development.																	0921-030X					FEB	2013	65	3					2401	2409		10.1007/s11069-012-0427-7								WOS:000313008500066

Detection of Coral Distribution Change in Recent Decades with Satellite Remote Sensing	2013 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING (CISP), VOLS 1-3					6th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing (CISP)	DEC 16-18, 2013	Hangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE, Hangzhou Normal Univ, EMB				Coral reef is a very important ecosystem in Sanya Bay and it has been studied for years only with in situ observations. However, these in situ observations generally have point information and lack the spatial resolution. Recently in order to make clear coral reef spatial distribution and variation in Sanya Bay, Hainan, satellite data of Landsat, QuickBird, CBERS (China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite program) and historical in situ observation data are used to retrieve and validate the information of coral reef. Based on the retrieved information, coral reef coverage and variation were studied in the paper. Satellite remote sensing results showed that area of coral reef distribution along coast of Dongmao (east) Islands and Ximao (west) islands in Sanya Bay reduced greatly in recent years, which coincides with variation trends of in situ observation data in the whole Sanya Bay. While analyzing the reason for coral reduction it was found that coral distribution in Sanya Bay conversely correlated with anthropic activities, such as digging coral reef for making lime and land use change. These activities change the water quality and sediment type which lead to the change in coral distribution.																			978-1-4799-2763-0				2013							830	834										WOS:000341115000155

Case study of the Eastern coast of Ghana	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					12th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)	APR 09-12, 2013	Plymouth Univ, Sch Marine Sci & Engn, Coastal Proc Res Grp, Plymouth, ENGLAND		Plymouth Univ, Sch Marine Sci & Engn, Coastal Proc Res Grp			Shoreline change analysis provides important information upon which most coastal zone management and intervention policies rely. Such information is however mostly scarce for large and inaccessible shorelines largely due to expensive field work. This study investigated the potential of medium resolution satellite imagery for mapping shoreline positions and for estimating historic rate of change. Both manual and semi-automatic shoreline extraction methods for multi-spectral satellite imageries were explored. Five shoreline positions were extracted for 1986, 1991, 2001, 2007 and 2011 covering a medium term of 25 years period. Rates of change statistics were calculated using the End Point Rate and Weighted Linear Regression methods. Approximately 283 transects were cast at simple right angles along the entire coast at 200m interval. Uncertainties were quantified for the shorelines ranging from +/- 4.1m to +/- 5.5m. The results show that the Keta shoreline is a highly dynamic feature with average rate of erosion estimated to be about 2m/year +/- 0.44m. Individual rates along some transect reach as high as 16m/year near the estuary and on the east of the Keta Sea Defence site. The study confirms earlier rates of erosion calculated for the area and also reveals the influence of the Keta Sea Defence Project on erosion along the eastern coast of Ghana. The research shows that shoreline change can be estimated using medium resolution satellite imagery.

The Ganghwa-do tidal flat, which is an open type, the Geunso-bay tidal flat, which is a semi-closed bay, and the Hwang-do tidal flat in Cheonsu Bay have different benthic environments, formed by different surface sedimentary facies and topographic features. These benthic environments in each tidal flat are influenced mainly by the tidal channel network. In other words, knowledge of the tidal channel distribution pattern is a key for understanding the geophysical and surface-sedimentary facies. From a quantitative estimate of the tidal channel distribution pattern, it is possible to estimate the surface sedimentary facies and topographical features. In this study, we standardized the surface sedimentary facies and topography by developing a tidal flat index in terms of the tidal channel distribution pattern. To extract tidal channel data in the study area, we used remotely sensed data, such as those from the Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite-2 (KOMPSAT-2), Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and aerial photographs. In addition, we generated a digital elevation model (DEM) using the waterline method to standardize the topographic features. Surface sedimentary facies maps were generated based on field data using an interpolation method. From these data, we calculated the tidal channel index by a fractal method. We also analyzed the spatial correlation of the tidal channel index with surface sedimentary facies and topography, respectively, using a GIS tool. Low values of the tidal channel index, which indicated a simple pattern of tidal channel distribution, were identified at areas having low elevation and coarse-grained sediments. By contrast, high values of the tidal channel index, which indicated a dendritic pattern of tidal channel distribution, were identified at areas having high elevation and fine-grained sediments.

The characteristics of estuaries are difficult to determine accurately because they are different in terms of their biological, chemical and physical. Because of their natural characteristics such as sheltered, shallow and calm, humans have benefited the estuaries as their source of food, transportation and development sites especially to the inland areas located far from the coast. However, the industrial activities have affected the areas by changing on the natural balance in the estuarine and pollution due to industrialization. In order to observe any changes in the area and to detect the pollution, remote sensing technology has been proven to be effective for observation of water bodies especially for total suspended solids (TSS). In this study, Landsat TM satellite image on 14 December 2009 was used to demonstrate the feasibility of TSS distribution mapping map in the lower Merbok estuary. In order to map the TSS distribution, a multiple regression algorithm was built using multi-band data for retrieval of the water constituent and the data were combined for multi-date regression analysis. In this study, the best R and RMS values were 0.96 and 18.68 mg/l. The coefficients obtained from the regression analysis were then used to map the suspended sediments. From the map analysis, assisted with the river discharge and tidal data, it was observed that the primary controlling factor to the TSS distributions in the area is the river discharge. The second predominant factor is tidal cycles. The presence of tidal cycles tends to increase or decrease the advections of the plume water.																	2165-4301		978-1-4673-5233-8				2013							341	344										WOS:000333962400071

It uses topographical base maps, Landsat ETM+ imagery, field survey, and ancillary data to assess and map the various geomorphic units and ecosystem degradation in the study area. Identification of various coastal landforms was carried out using image interpretation elements, especially the tonal and shape differentiation. Some geomorphic units identified include islands, lagoons, peninsulas, coastal plains and beaches, pools and mud coastline. Recent morphological dynamics catalysed by sea-level rise have led to the decrease of some coastal landform units. Sand mining, urbanization, wetland reclamation, and industrialization were identified as causing perturbation of the ecosystem. For sustainable development of the fragile morphological systems of the study area, anthropogenic activities resulting in biodiversity loss and landform alterations should be controlled, while oil exploration activities around the mud coast should adopt best practices.																	0144-7815		978-1-907161-36-0				2013	358						116	123										WOS:000324149000013

Dynamics in mangroves assessed by high-resolution and multi-temporal satellite data: a case study in Zhanjiang Mangrove National Nature Reserve (ZMNNR), P. R. China	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Mangrove forests are declining across the globe, mainly because of human intervention, and therefore require an evaluation of their past and present status (e. g. areal extent, species-level distribution, etc.) to implement better conservation and management strategies. In this paper, mangrove cover dynamics at Gaoqiao (P. R. China) were assessed through time using 1967, 2000 and 2009 satellite imagery (sensors Corona KH-4B, Landsat ETM+, GeoEye-1 respectively). Firstly, multi-temporal analysis of satellite data was undertaken, and secondly biotic and abiotic differences were analysed between the different mangrove stands, assessed through a supervised classification of a high-resolution satellite image. A major decline in mangrove cover (-36 %) was observed between 1967 and 2009 due to rice cultivation and aquaculture practices. Moreover, dike construction has prevented mangroves from expanding landward. Although a small increase of mangrove area was observed between 2000 and 2009 (+24 %), the ratio mangrove / aquaculture kept decreasing due to increased aquaculture at the expense of rice cultivation in the vicinity. From the land-use/cover map based on ground-truth data (5 x 5 m plot-based tree measurements) (August-September, 2009) as well as spectral reflectance values (obtained from pansharpened GeoEye-1), both Bruguiera gymnorrhiza and small Aegiceras corniculatum are distinguishable at 73-100% accuracy, whereas tall A. corniculatum was correctly classified at only 53% due to its mixed vegetation stands with B. gymnorrhiza (overall classification accuracy: 85 %). In the case of sediments, sand proportion was significantly different between the three mangrove classes. Overall, the advantage of very high resolution satellite images like GeoEye-1 (0.5 m) for mangrove spatial heterogeneity assessment and/or species-level discrimination was well demonstrated, along with the complexity to provide a precise classification for non-dominant species (e. g. Kandelia obovata) at Gaoqiao. Despite limitations such as geometric distortion and single panchromatic band, the 42 yr old Corona declassified images are invaluable for land-use/cover change detections when compared to recent satellite data sets.

However, this industry is not exempt of accidents such as oil spills. Satellite remote sensing is a useful tool in delineating polluted areas due to its characteristic to cover large areas. This paper proposes a methodology combining information from both optical (Landsat) and radar (Envisat-ASAR) images to delineate polluted soils by hydrocarbons in the coast of Paraiso, Tabasco, Mexico. Landsat images identified polluted areas over the beach (bare soil); nevertheless, they did not reach the soil under vegetation conditions. In contrast, radar images did not indentify polluted areas in the beach mainly because of the extreme dry conditions in the soil. But, in vegetated areas, the radar penetrated the vegetation cover and identified the polluted soils. Both optical and radar information showed complementarities to delineate polluted areas under heterogeneous conditions.

COASTAL EROSION MAPPING THROUGH INTERGRATION OF SAR AND LANDSAT TM IMAGERY	2013 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS)	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS				IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 21-26, 2013	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA	IEEE, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Geoscience & Remote Sensing Soc				It is important to monitor long-term coastal erosion in countries such as Australia given the majority of our population live in coastal regions. However, ground-based surveys are labour-intensive and involve significant cost when large spatial areas need to monitored. This paper presents a complementary, cost-effective approach for mapping the eroded shoreline, through integrating Landsat multispectral (MS) imagery data and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery data. This integration method overcomes the problem of data shortage associated with using a single data source. Moreover, it can extract the instant land-water interface at sub-pixel resolution. Because the extracted land-water boundaries are dynamic, a tidal model has to be applied to define the high water line. Wavelet transform and linear spectral unmixing are the two major algorithms used for extracting the land-water interface. Several inundated areas are identified at the selected study area along the coast of East Gippsland Basin, Victoria, Australia. Naturally occurring erosion is believed to be the major factor for these inundated areas. Theoretically the extracted shorelines for defining erosion can reach 1m - 2m resolution approximately.

Submesoscale eddies near the Kuril Straits: Asymmetric generation of clockwise and counterclockwise eddies by barotropic tidal flow	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												High spatial resolution thermal infrared (TIR) images derived by the LANDSAT Thematic Mapper (TM) sensors show the presence of numerous small-scale eddies near the Kuril Islands. As the diameters of these eddies range from around 2 to 30 km (i.e., submesoscale), they are much smaller than the eddies previously reported in this region (several tens to some hundreds of kilometers in diameter). Our simulations suggest that small-scale eddies similar to those observed in the satellite data are generated by diurnal barotropic tides. The eddy generation is well defined from Etorofu/Friza to the Onnekotan Straits, and it is caused by the effects of coastal boundaries and the stretching of water columns, which lead to eddy growth even after eddies have left the coast. We find that the counterclockwise eddies are generally larger in number and size and stronger in vorticity and surface height than the clockwise eddies in both the gradient and cyclostrophic wind balance regimes. The possible causes of such asymmetry are (1) the effect of planetary-vorticity tube stretching, which can be significant even when the final relative vorticity becomes much greater than planetary vorticity and (2) asymmetric advection by the rotating tidal flow, which advects counterclockwise eddies offshore but clockwise eddies onshore. These eddies induce strong stirring with a maximum apparent diffusivity of 10(8) cm(2) s(-1). The numbers, properties, and mixing effects of eddies vary greatly with the spring-neap cycle.

J	Pu, RL; Bell, S; Meyer, C; Baggett, L; Zhao, YC				Pu, Ruiliang; Bell, Susan; Meyer, Cynthia; Baggett, Lesley; Zhao, Yongchao			Mapping and assessing seagrass along the western coast of Florida using Landsat TM and EO-1 ALI/Hyperion imagery	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Seagrass habitats provide a variety of ecosystem functions thus monitoring of seagrass habitat is a priority of coastal management. Remote sensing techniques can provide spatial and temporal information about seagrass habitats. Given the availability and accessibility of Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and the advanced nature of Earth Observing-1 Advanced Land Imager (ALI) and Hyperion (HYP), we compared the capability of the three 30 m resolution satellite sensors and tested regression models based on two seagrass metrics [percent cover of submerged aquatic vegetation (%SAV) and leaf area index (LAI)] for mapping and assessing seagrass habitats within a shallow coastal area along the central western coast of FL, USA. We also evaluated a water depth correction approach to create water depth-invariant bands calculated from the three sensors' data. Then a maximum likelihood classifier was used to classify the %SAV cover into two classification schemes (3-class and 5-class). Based upon the two seagrass metrics measured in the field, six multiple regression models were developed and %SAV and LAI were estimated with spectral variables derived from the three sensors to assess the seagrass habitats in mapped units. Our results indicate that the HYP sensor produced the best seagrass cover maps in the two classification schemes: 3-class [overall accuracy (OA) = 95.9%] and 5-class (OA = 78.4%) and the best % SAV and LAI estimation models [R-2 = 0.78 and 0.59, and cross-validation (CV) = 18.1% and 1.40 for %SAV and LAI, respectively] for assessing seagrass habitats. These results are likely due to the many narrow bands in the visible spectral range and rich subtle spectral information available in the HYP hyperspectral data. ALI outperformed TM (OA = 94.6% vs. 92.5% for the 3-class scheme, and OA = 77.8% vs. 66.0% for the 5-class scheme) for mapping %SAV likely due to its higher radiometric resolution. Our findings also demonstrate that the water depth correction approach was effective in mapping the detailed seagrass habitats with the data from the three sensors. The protocol developed and utilized here represents a new contribution to the existing set of tools used by researchers for documenting the amount of seagrass and which can guide future studies.

Human Impacts on Geological and Cultural Heritage in the Coastal Zone West of Alexandria to Al-Alamein, Egypt	GEOHERITAGE												A combination of remote sensing and field surveying is used to detect changes within the coastal zone west of Alexandria towards Al-Alamein. The satellite images used are Landsat Thematic Mapper and SPOT images acquired in 1984, 2003 and 2007. The results show considerable changes due to human impacts. The research reveals that seven land cover features (seawater, salt marshes, sabkha, agricultural land, road, bare land and urban land) can be identified in the Landsat data sets. The unplanned urban and agricultural growth that was detected from 1984 to 2007 has been by 309.3 and 445.4 km(2), respectively, in the vicinity of coastal areas rich in natural beauty, geological interests and cultural heritage. Most of the coastal ridge, which records Holocene shorelines and yields Neolithic pottery and bones, has been obliterated due to the increased construction of tourism and recreational facilities. Such a case was also observed for the Abu Sir ridge, where the remains of Graeco-Roman villages (e. g. Taposiris Magna) are bordered with resorts. Recently, the Bahig drain which cuts the Gebel Maryut ridge has been partially damaged. The drain cut is unique because it demonstrates outcrops of the Last Interglacial highstand (Oxygen Isotope Stage 5e). During this stage the sea level reached more than 8 m above the present level. The construction of the Marina Resort to the east has caused the accelerated erosion of the shoreline and the removal of Holocene platforms and evidence of sea-level highstands. The relevance of this northwestern coast as a geological and cultural heritage resource site is proposed.																	1867-2477	1867-2485				DEC	2012	4	4					263	274		10.1007/s12371-012-0066-0								WOS:000324991500003

Long-Time Shoreline Monitoring of the Vellar Estuarine Complex, Southeast Coast of India: Using Multispectral Satellite Data	JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCE												The present study was carried out to track the path of Vellar estuary over a period of 38 years (1970-2008) and also to detect the impact of tsunami on estuarine complex of the Vellar estuary. Visual interpretation techniques were employed by using multispectral data of Landsat TM (1991) and IRS-P6 LISS III (2004, 2006, and 2008) to delineate shoreline changes in the Vellar estuarine complex. Results clearly revealed the changes that occurred along the estuarine path over the period, and severe erosion was noticed in the seaward side of the MGR Thittu and accretion, along the estuarine mouth. It is also visible that there is clear river path shift in the river course. Although the sandbar formation was seen with only little morphologic modification up to 2004, the Indian Ocean tsunami that struck this coast (26 December, 2004) distorted the sandbar of the Vellar estuarine mouth; however, the 2006 satellite images confirmed that the sandbar was formed again to its original structure as that of before the tsunami.

NDVI as an indicator for changes in water availability to woody vegetation	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Barrier islands shrub thickets, the dominant woody community of many Atlantic coast barrier islands, are very sensitive to changes in the freshwater lens and thus, constitute a strong indicator of summer drought. NDVI was computed from airborne images and multispectral images on Hog Island (VA, USA) to evaluate summer growing season changes in woody communities for better predictions of climate change effects. Patterns of NDVI were compared year to year and monthly relative to precipitation and water table depth at the appropriate temporal scale. The highest absolute values of NDVI as well as the larger surface covered by woody vegetation (NDVI > 0.5) occurred in the wet year (2004) with a bimodal distribution of NDVI values (around 0.65 and 0.9) while both dry years (2007 and 2008) showed similar values in maximum, mean and standard deviation and unimodal distributions (around 0.75) of NDVI values. Positive linear adjustments were obtained between maximum (r(2) > 0.9) and mean NDVI (r(2) > 0,87) and the accumulated rainfall in the hydrological year and the mean water table depth from the last rainfall event till the date of the image acquisition. The spatial variations revealed that water table depth behaved different in wet and dry years. In dry years there was a remarkable increase in mean and maximum values linearly related to water table depth. The highest slope of the adjustment in 2007 indicated a sharp response of vegetation in the driest year. Monthly series of NDVI showed the major role of lack of precipitation through July and August in 2007 with missing classes of NDVI above 0.8 and unimodal distributions in mid-late summer. Best linear fits (r(2) close to 1) were obtained with rainfall at different temporal scales: accumulated rainfall in the hydrological year 2004 and accumulated rainfall in the last month previous to the date of 2007 image. Thus, in dry years productivity is closely related to water available from recent past as opposed to over the year for wet years. Good fits (r(2) values higher than 0.88) were obtained between monthly decrease in water table depth and NDVI variables just in the dry year. These results demonstrate the important feedback between woody vegetation response to changes in the freshwater lens using empirical data and could apply to other systems with strong directional gradients in resources.

The coast of the Parana State is part of the core area of the "Serra do Mar" corridor and where actions for biodiversity conservation must be planned. In this study we aimed at characterizing the landscape structure in the APA-Guaraquecaba, the largest protected area in this region, in order to assist environmental policies of this region. Based on a supervised classification of a mosaic of LANDSAT-5-TM satellite images (from March 2009), we developed a map (1:75,000 scale) with seven classes of land use and land cover and analyzed the relative quantities of forests and modified areas in slopes and lowlands. The APA-Guaraquecaba is comprised mainly by the Dense Ombrophilous Forest (68.6% of total area) and secondary forests (9.1%), indicating a forested landscape matrix; anthropogenic and bare soil areas (0.8%) and the Pasture/Grasslands class (4.2%) were less representative. Slopes were less fragmented and more preserved (96.3% of Dense Ombrophilous Forest and secondary forest) than lowlands (71.3%), suggesting that restoration initiatives in the lowlands must be stimulated in this region. We concluded that most of the region sustains well-conserved ecosystems, highlighting the importance of Parana northern coast for the biodiversity maintenance of the Atlantic Forest.

J	Huang, HJ; Liu, YX; Qiu, ZF				Huang Haijun; Liu Yanxia; Qiu Zhongfeng			Morphodynamic evolution of the Xiaoqing River mouth: a Huanghe River-derived mixed energy estuary	CHINESE JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY												In an estuary, tidal, wave and other marine powers interact with the coast in different ways and affect estuary morphology as well as its evolution. In the Huanghe (Yellow) River estuaries and nearby delta, there are many small sediment-affected estuaries with a unique morphology, such as the Xiaoqing River estuary. In this study, we investigated the special evolution and genetic mechanism of the Xiaoqing River estuary by analyzing graphic and image data with a numerical simulation method. The results show that NE and NE-E tide waves are the main driving force for sandbar formation. Sediment shoals have originated from huge amounts of sediment from the Huanghe River, with consequent deposition at the Xiaoqing River mouth. The lateral suspended sediments beyond the river mouth move landward. Siltation takes place on the northern shoreline near the river mouth whereas erosion occurs in the south. The deposits come mainly from scouring of the shallow seabed on the northern side of the estuary. Storm surges speed up deposition in the estuary. Development of the sediment shoals has occurred in two steps involving the processes of growth and further southward extension. Although the southward shift increases the river curvature and length, the general eastward orientation of the estuary is unlikely to change. Processes on the adjacent shorelines do not affect the development of the sediment shoals. The study presents a morphodynamic evolutionary model for the Xiaoqing River estuary, with a long-term series cycle, within which a relatively short cycle occurs.

Spatial Dynamics and Zoning of Coastal Land-Use Change along Bohai Bay, China, during 1979-2008	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Research on land-use dynamics in coastal zones is important to environmental protection and regional sustainable development. The area involved in this study is the coastal zone of Bohai Bay, a new pole of economic growth in China. Landsat images from 1979, 1989, 1999, and 2008 are used to create land-use maps with seven first-class and 18 second-class types. A comprehensive approach, including a multidimensional transition matrix, land-use dynamic degree, and dynamic zoning based on an artificial neural network, is applied to investigate the evolution and spatial differentiation of land-use dynamics. Widespread changes in land use have occurred in the study area and accelerated between 1979 and 2008. Settlement and transportation land (i.e., land use for transportation) increased rapidly, while cultivated land and unused land suffered a noteworthy loss. These results reveal two key socioeconomic processes: urbanization and land reclamation from the sea. In this study, 20 primary land-use dynamics are calculated, and the study area is divided into 12 zones. According to the zoning map, there are three noteworthy transitions: unused land to saltwater body (primarily near the shore); unused land to transportation land (centered in the Tianjin New Port and Caofeidian Port); and cultivated land to settlement (mainly occurring in the northern and western parts of the study area). Urbanization, industrialization, land reclamation from the sea, port development, policies, and the structural adjustment of the primary industry all play a vital role in the land-use changes. Such changes should receive more attention from local authorities, who are expected to take immediate action to mitigate the impacts on the environment and implement land-use planning to achieve regionally sustainable development.																	0749-0208					SEP	2012	28	5					1186	1196		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-11-00139.1								WOS:000308774400019						
J	Deroin, JP; Wade, S; Dia, A				Deroin, Jean-Paul; Wade, Souleye; Dia, Abdoulaye			Impacts of breaching on a bar-built estuary, example of the Senegal River new mouth monitored with satellite imagery from 2003 to 2010	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR GEOMORPHOLOGIE												This paper presents the results of a survey of an estuary in Senegal since a human-induced breach was opened in a bar at the mouth of the embayment in October 2003 to reduce the effect of a major flood event. The evolution of the new mouth's width has been analysed using a Landsat time series of 94 scenes, covering the period 2003-2010. This series is complemented by recent high resolution Alos-PRISM data, and very high resolution Ikonos data. The survey indicates a rapid opening of the new mouth in the first days after the breaching (270 m wide after 10 days) and during the first three years (about 1,900 m wide in September 2006). Then, a strong shortening of the mouth appears (689 m wide in April 2007). The next evolution shows a relatively regular widening of the mouth with limited shortening events during high-water periods (autumn 2007, 2008, and 2009). In May 2010, the mouth was 2,400 m wide and then slightly decreased to 2,145 m wide on September 15, 2010. The general trend is the opening of the mouth with an average of about 300 m per year since the breaching. The effect of the high flow period (August to November) seems to shorten the mouth width but with various amplitudes, 1,210 m in 2006, only 215 m in 2008. During this period the northern sandbar is more or less north-south oriented. In contrast, during the dry season when the littoral drift dominates, the mouth width generally increases except in 2007. The main part of the widening is due to the erosion of the southern part of the mouth (about 2,300 m). The northern part is barely affected because it is regularly fed with sand transported by the littoral drift. The erosion of the southern part results in a NNE-SSW oriented coastline showing also the important effect of the littoral drift. The most recent observations show that the evolution of the mouth will probably change in the near future. The opening of the new mouth in 2010 has been stopped for the first time since the breaching. New changes are now visible such as the natural breaching of Babagueye Island formed in February 2010 in front of the new mouth. All these major changes also induced large-scale ecological and human effects. The direct impact of the new breach on flood mitigation remains unknown. If Saint-Louis City seems less subject to recurrent river flooding by overflow, flooding by stagnation of water from precipitation remains worrying.																	0372-8854					SEP	2012	56	3					351	370		10.1127/0372-8854/2012/0072								WOS:000308282500005						
J	Paillou, P; Tooth, S; Lopez, S				Paillou, Philippe; Tooth, Stephen; Lopez, Sylvia			The Kufrah paleodrainage system in Libya: A past connection to the Mediterranean Sea?	COMPTES RENDUS GEOSCIENCE												Paillou et al. (2009) mapped a 900 km-long paleodrainage system in eastern Libya, the Kufrah River, that could have linked the southern Kufrah Basin to the Mediterranean coast through the Sirt Basin, possibly as long ago as the Middle Miocene. We study here the potential connection between the terminal part of the Kufrah River and the Mediterranean Sea through the Wadi Sahabi paleochannel, which may have constituted the northern extension of the lower Kufrah River paleodrainage system. New analysis of SRTM-derived topography combined with Synthetic Aperture Radar images from the Japanese PALSAR orbital sensor allowed the mapping of seven main paleochannels located west of the Kufrah River, each of which is likely to have formed a tributary that supplied water and sediment to the main paleodrainage system. The northernmost four paleochannels probably originated from the Al Haruj relief, a Pliocene alkaline basaltic intracontinental volcanic field, and potentially connected to the Wadi Sahabi paleochannel. The remaining three paleochannels are in the more southerly location of the Sarir Calanscio, North-East of the Tibesti mountains, and barely present a topographic signature in SRTM data. They end in the dunes of the Calanscio Sand Sea, forming alluvial fans. The most southern paleochannel, known as Wadi Behar Belama, was previously mapped by Pachur (1996) using LANDSAT-TM images, and was interpreted by Osborne et al. (2008) as representing part of an uninterrupted sediment pathway from the Tibesti mountains to the Mediterranean Sea. Processing of SRTM topographic data revealed local depressions which allow to connect the seven paleochannels and possibly the terminal alluvial fan of the Kufrah River to the Wadi Sahabi paleochannel, through a 400 km-long, south-north oriented, paleocorridor. These new findings support our previous hypothesis that proposed a connection between the lower Kufrah River in the region of the Sarir Dalmah and the Wadi Sahabi paleochannel, which connected to the Mediterranean Sea. Including the newly mapped paleochannels, the Kufrah River paleowatershed, at its maximum extent, would have covered more than 400,000 km(2), representing close to a quarter of the surface area of Libya.

Mapping results were checked and refined by the same analyst with the same set of criteria. The results show during the last 20 years urban areas in China have increased exponentially more than 2 times. The greatest area of urbanization changed from Northeastern provinces in 1990s to the Southeast coast of China in Jiangsu, Guangdong, Shandong, and Zhejiang in 2010s. Urban areas are mostly converted from croplands in China. Approximately 17750 km(2) croplands were converted into urban lands. Furthermore, the conversion from 2000 to 2010 doubled that from 1990 to 2000. During the 20 years, the most urbanized provinces are Jiangsu, Guangdong, Shandong and Zhejiang. We also analyzed built-up areas, gross domestic production (GDP) and population of 147 cities with a population of greater than 500000 in 2009. The result shows coastal cities and resource-based cities are with high economic efficiency per unit of built-up areas, resource-based cities have the highest population density, and the economic efficiency of most coastal provinces are lower than central provinces and Guangdong. The newly created urban expansion dataset is useful in many fields including trend analysis of urbanization in China; simulation of urban development dynamics; analysis of the relationship among urbanization, population growth and migration; studies of carbon emissions and climate change; adaptation of climate change; as well as land use and urban planning and management.

The TSS results obtained were compared to in situ collected TSS data. The analysis of the satellite image data set revealed that each river system exhibits a distinct turbidity plume dispersal pattern. The behavior, dimension and degree of turbidity of the Sao Francisco River plume have been greatly altered by the construction of a cascade of hydroelectric dam reservoirs in its hydrological basin. The plume has lost its typical unimodal seasonal pattern of material dispersion and its turbidity has decreased due to the regulation of river flow by the dams and TSS retainance by the reservoirs. In contrast, the Doce and Paraiba do Sul river plumes are still subject to seasonal pulsations and show more turbid conditions than the SF plume, as dams are less numerous, set in the middle river sections and the natural river flow has been maintained. The Caravelas Coastal System river plume is restricted to near shore shallow waters dominated by resuspension processes. During austral spring and summer when NE-E winds prevail, all plumes generally disperse southward. Short-term northward reversals may occur in winter with the passage of atmospheric cold fronts. The Sao Francisco and Doce river plumes tend to disperse obliquely to the coast and transport materials further offshore, while the Caravelas and Paraiba do Sul plumes tend to disperse mainly parallel to the coast, enhancing TSS retention nearshore.

J	Ustaoglu, B				Ustaoglu, Beyza			Spatiotemporal analysis of land cover change patterns in western part of the Sakarya River Delta and its surroundings in Turkey	ENERGY EDUCATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PART A-ENERGY SCIENCE AND RESEARCH												In this study, land cover change is investigated using remote sensing and GIS-based integrated analysis in western part of the Sakarya river delta and its surroundings. The study area is located on the northwest of Turkey. It was formed on the Black Sea coast by the sediments carried by the Sakarya river. Land cover change depending on many natural and human factors. Land cover in the Sakarya river delta has a composition of different geomorphological units. The research area is involved in Euxine province of Euro-Siberian phytogeographical region. However this region is the most important area with its wetland vegetation (Acarlar Longoz). In recent years, change has been observed in the natural land cover because of the land degradation and deforestation in the region. Landsat TM, IRS and SPOT-5 satellite images are used as data between 2001-2010 period to determine this change. These images which have different spectral and spatial resolution are analyzed by using images processing techniques in ERDAS Imagine (c) 10.0 and ArcGIS (c) 10.0 software. Images are classified into three main classes and three subclasses land cover types; according to the CORINE (Coordination of Information on the Environment) Land Cover Nomenclature, Level 1-2-3 Classification. Furthermore, the image analysis results are confirmed by the field research. As a result it is found that, significant changes has been occurred on the natural land cover between the years 2001-2010 in the Sakarya river delta and its surroundings.																	1308-772X					JUL	2012	29	2					721	730										WOS:000304512900003

The United States developed the National Coastal Wetlands Inventory (NCWI) to provide information on the spatial extent of the coastal wetlands. However, the NCWI has become outdated and needs to be updated for the purpose of natural resource management. Monitoring invasive species is also essential because they threaten wetland health. The overall objective of this research is to develop accurate and replicable tools for monitoring coastal wetlands in a time- and cost-effiicent manner. An integrated approach using the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI), multi-temporal Landsat satellite imagery, Soil Survey Georgraphic Database (SSURGO), National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), Light Detection and Ranging (lidar), and Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) data will be used to map wetlands. NWI, Landsat, SSURGO, and NHD data can effectively identify most wetlands, but they sometimes miss vegetated wetlands. Lidar and radar data will be incorporated to reduce these omission errors and improve the overall classification accuracy of wetland delineations. Maximum likelihood, a decision tree analysis, or object-based classification will be applied to the various combinations of data. The least expensive method of wetland delineation with the highest accuracy will be determined and proposed for national implementation. Mixture-tuned mathced filtering on hyperspectral data will be used to map common reed (Phragmites australis, Cav.) an invasive species on the U.S. East Coast. Results of this research will provide remote sensing strategies for updating coastal wetlands inventories every 5 to 10 years with improved classification accuracy. These strategies are more efficient than the traditional approaches of aerial image interpretation and field surveys. The wetlands inventory data from this research will provide the information needed by natural resource managers to protect and conserved wetlands.				chen, zhu/K-5923-2013													0099-1112					JUN	2012	78	6					537	547										WOS:000304791200009						
J	Han, H; Lee, H				Han, Hyangsun; Lee, Hoonyol			Inter-satellite atmospheric and radiometric correction for the retrieval of Landsat sea surface temperature by using Terra MODIS data	GEOSCIENCES JOURNAL												Thermal infrared images of Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-7 ETM+ sensors have been unrivalled sources of high resolution thermal remote sensing (120 m for TM and 60 m for ETM+) for more than two decades. As the sensors have only one thermal channel, however, the correction of atmospheric effect has been virtually limited, degrading the accuracy of sea surface temperature (SST) measurement. Launched in 1999, MODIS sensor onboard Terra satellite is equipped with two thermal channels that can provide accurate atmospheric correction at 1 km resolution. In this paper we propose an inter-satellite calibration method to correct the radiometric and atmospheric effect of Landsat brightness temperature by using the atmospherically corrected Terra MODIS SST which lags Landsat pass by 30 minutes only. Comparison of the corrected Landsat SST with in situ SST near the coast of South Korea showed a significant improvement in root mean square error from 2.31 degrees C before the correction to 0.96 degrees C after the correction. Errors from spatial and temporal inhomogeneities over 1 km X 1 km window could be masked out by identifying negative correction term and applying a root mean square deviation criterion between Landsat and MODIS SSTs. We expect that Landsat SST product obtained after the launch of Terra can be atmospherically corrected by using the method proposed in this paper while maintaining the merit of high-resolution Landsat thermal infrared imagery.

J	Wilson, J; Rocha, C				Wilson, Jean; Rocha, Carlos			Regional scale assessment of Submarine Groundwater Discharge in Ireland combining medium resolution satellite imagery and geochemical tracing techniques	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												This paper sets the foundation for the use of freely available Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM +) thermal infrared (TIR) imagery in a regional scale assessment of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) to coastal waters. A comprehensive, tiered, three-step approach is proposed as the most effective and affordable means to determine the spatial extent and scale of SGD from coastal aquifers to the coastal margin. As the preliminary step, Sea Surface Temperature (SST) values derived from Landsat ETM + TIR are used to successfully detect plumes of colder water eventually associated with SGD in close proximity to the shoreline. Subsequently, potential sites of SGD are linked to geological features on land acting as possible sources, by combining within a Geographical Information System (GIS), mapped temperature anomalies with ancillary on-shore spatial datasets describing bedrock geology including aquifer fault lines. Finally, nearshore surveys mapping the activity of Rn-222 (radon) and salinity are carried out to verify the presence of SGD and provide a qualitative assessment of fresh groundwater inputs to the coastal zone. Practical application of the complete approach in the context of coastal zone management is illustrated through a case-study of the Republic of Ireland. As part of this study, over 30 previously unidentified links between aquifers on land and the sea are shown along the Irish coast, hence illustrating the tight coupling between coastal waters and groundwater inputs at an unprecedented spatial scale. The study demonstrates the potential of the combined applications of remote sensing methods and geochemical tracing techniques for a cost-effective regional-scale assessment of groundwater discharge to coastal waters.

J	Irtem, E; Sacin, Y				Irtem, Emel; Sacin, Yener			Investigation of Lagoon lakes in Kocacay delta by using remote sensing method	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Coasts are areas that are under the influence of the interaction of the air, water and land and attract attention with the abundance of their natural resources and therefore are subjected to excessive usage. This excessive usage may disturb the sensitive balance of the coast ecosystem. In this study, the changes in Arapciftligi, Poyraz, Dalyan lakes area found in Kocacay delta located in the south coast of Marmara sea was evaluated between the periods of 2000 to 2007 with remote sensing method. These lakes, located on the shores, have a very sensitive naturally dynamic balance and very importance in terms of natural surroundings and the coastal zones management plan. It must be known the change of the lakes mentioned above area according to years. Research and applications have demonstrated the advantages of remote sensing and geographic information system techiques on river,delta, lake, lagoon lake, sensitivite areas in a lakeshore, coastal erosion etc. monitoring and management. In the study, we benefited from Erdas and Intergraph-Geomedia 6.1 image processing and GIS, and also from AutoCAD 2007 and NetCAD 4.0 computer-aided design (CAD) software. For 2000, 2001, 2005 and 2007 years (4 number) Landsat-5 TM satellite images belonging to the region were used. As a result of the study, Arapciftligi, Dalyan and Poyraz lake areas, number of islets that are seen in the lakes were given in respect to years. Arapciftligi lake shrank 29.5% in size in the years 2000 and 2007. The fact that the lake continued to get smaller in size even in periods of high precipitation may be due to the sediment flowing from the agricultural fields established close to the lake area. Dalyan and Poyraz lakes lost 60% in terms of their surface area in the years 2000 and 2007. In 2000-2001 periods, Dalyan and Poyraz lakes increased in size by 3.2%. The reason for this could be the excessive precipitation and the fact that the seawater from Marmara sea seeps into the lake. Protection of the natural balance of the lagoons can be possible by using a monitoring programme to be set in connection with a healthy, systematic and manageable data system.																	0254-8704					APR	2012	33	2		S	SI		487	492										WOS:000300857400025	23424854					
J	Silva, TS; Tagliani, PRA				Silva, T. S.; Tagliani, P. R. A.			Environmental planning in the medium littoral of the Rio Grande do Sul coastal plain - Southern Brazil: Elements for coastal management	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												The Medium Littoral of the Rio Grande do Sul coastal plain comprises about 2.5 million inhabitants living in the 17 municipalities along the Patos Lagoon coast. The Patos Lagoon is the largest lagoon in Brazil and the second largest in South America, with an area of about 10,000 km(2). It is connected to the Atlantic Ocean through a narrow canal and sustains artisanal fisheries, familiar agriculture and Indian activities in the vicinity, as well as high technology agriculture and industry. The National Coastal Management Plan founded the Brazilian coastal management policy, which explicitly depends on spatial tools. Thus, the present work aims to understand the spatial structure and dynamics of the medium littoral of Rio Grande do Sul State to support coastal management. An important basis for policy was developed analyzing the land use and cover changes occurred in the last decades and their historical, political, and socioeconomic context. We propose an environmental zoning scheme and build a prediction model of land change. The environmental zoning specifies three management classes - preservation, conservation, and development - covering 23.3%, 9.7% and 67.0% of the area, respectively. The land change prediction model points the areas most likely susceptible to change. These should be priority areas for planning. The results we present have been used in environmental regulation instruments at municipal level. This paper also discusses the potential to further integrate our results with other mechanisms and scales of coastal management. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This research combined satellite and ground data to quantify the impact of the oil and dispersant on the salt marshes in terms of their photosynthetic capacity and physiological status over a large spatial scale. Two of the most important marsh biophysical characteristics, including distribution of canopy chlorophyll content and above ground green biomass, were monitored across the southeastern LA coast during the salt marsh growing season (May-October) of 2009 (pre-spill) and 2010 (post-spill) in order to compare and isolate the spill impacted areas. The initial assessment showed that there was a significant post-spill increase in areas with reduced biomass and canopy chlorophyll (>400 km(2)) during the 2010 growing season compared to 50-65 km(2) during the 2009 growing season. Phenological analysis of the post oil-spill data revealed a significant decrease in the magnitude of biomass and canopy chlorophyll during the peak of the 2010 growing season. June was consistently found to be the worst month in terms of salt marsh health across LA over the 2010 phenological cycle followed by the initial signs of recovery along the fringing marsh areas proximal to the shoreline that were first impacted by oil. Interior marsh patches exhibited persistent signs of stress towards the end of the growing season. Extensive reduction in photosynthetic activity was observed during the peak of the growing season, particularly in Plaquemines Parish and St. Bernard Parish. The products generated through this study successfully delineate the critical hotspots of marsh stress so that prioritization of areas needing immediate restoration can be performed.

Assessment of Ecological integrity in a landscape context using the Miankale peninsula of Northern Iran	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Identification of rapid degradation of ecological resources requires effective environmental monitoring including ecological integrity assessment Our first aim is to analyze ecological integrity in a landscape context while developing a method to assess integrity in spite of a dearth of historical data. We used a Spatial-Temporal Reference Framework for land cover maps for assessing ecological integrity change, emphasizing changes in patch types and configuration. Land cover is used as a surrogate for habitat. Habitat condition is the main point of this research in assessing ecological integrity. Our second aim is to recognize, through a case study of the above, the ecological integrity of the Miankale peninsula of Miankale Biosphere Reserve on Iran's Caspian Sea coast in the east latitude of 53 degrees,24 degrees '50 degrees and north altitude of 36 degrees,56 degrees,45 degrees Land cover data were obtained from Landsat TM5 of 1985 and compared with current condition images from Landsat TM5 of 2010. Landscape metrics show that Minakale's natural semi-dense shrub lands are fragmented; with the number of patches increasing and average patch area decreasing. This implies a fall in habitat available to its dependent bird species. In conclusion, considering birds' habitat and its aggregation as a measure of integrity, landscape metrics show ecological integrity of Miankale has decreased and signals of habitat loss hate appeared in study area. More detailed analysis in ecosystem scale is suggested as the complementary research to find the best indicator for assessing the integrity of the ecosystem.																	1735-6865					SPR	2012	6	2					443	450										WOS:000301516600010

Spit Dynamics along the Central West Coast of India: Implications for Coastal Zone Management	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												HEGDE, V.S.; NAYAK, SR.; SHALINI, G.; KRISHNAPRASAD, P.A.; RAJAWAT, A.S.; GIRISH, K.H., and TEJASWINI, B., 2012. Spit dynamics along the central west coast of India: Implications for coastal zone management. Journal of Coastal Research, 28(2), 505-510. West Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Spit growth is observed across many rivers of the central west coast of India. Studies on the seasonal dynamics of the spits of the central west coast of India on the basis of the multidate satellite images LISS III, landsat (TM) data, panchromatic camera (PAN) data etc. in a geographic information system (GIS) environment using ERDAS imagine 9.0 version followed by field-check and wave data analysis have been discussed in this paper. All types of spits such as paired spits, winglike spits, single spits, etc. are observed along the coast of Karnataka, central west coast of India. Spit growth is responsible not only for shifting of the river mouths, but also for rapid changes in estuarine morphology and in turn on the sedimentation process. It is observed that river mouths with a spit across them have a submerged bar in front of them, whereas rivers devoid of spits are also devoid of submerged bars in front of them. This spatial association of spit and submerged bar is believed to have a genetic relationship. Along the coast many perpendicular faults and uplifts have been observed. Rate of spit growth, along with their direction and inland drainage pattern, suggest a role of sea-level changes and tectonic control in addition to alongshore currents. Rapid spit growth is observed near the inferred tectonic axis. Seasonal dynamics and modification in the spit configuration are related to alongshore drift as well as the wave refraction around the mouth of the rivers.																	0749-0208					MAR	2012	28	2					505	510		10.2112/11A-00016.1								WOS:000301328700019

Identification of hot spots and well managed areas of Pichavaram mangrove using Landsat TM and Resourcesat-1 LISS IV: an example of coastal resource conservation along Tamil Nadu Coast, India	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												The present work is a multi-temporal satellite based study on the spatial dynamic of an important coastal habitat, the Pichavaram mangrove ecosystem, over a period of 15 years. The Pichavaram mangrove forest near Chidambaram, South India is the second largest mangrove forest in the world. Unsupervised classification, the Iterative Self Organising Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA), has been used to classify the mangrove cover into the open and dense classes. The status of the classes has been monitored using Landsat TM of 1991, 2001, and Resourcesat-1 LISS IV of 2006 satellite data. The study demonstrated that by classifying mangrove ecosystem into just the 3 classes using remote sensing data and by studying their temporal variations, it is possible to get a reasonably accurate picture of the extent and condition of the mangrove ecosystem. The total area of the Pichavaram mangrove showed a net increase of 2.51 km(2) within a span of 15 years (1991 to 2006). The hot spots that are at a risk of being degraded, and on the other hand, the mangrove areas that are well managed are identified using Geographical Information System (GIS) tools for the restoration and conservation measures.																	1400-0350					MAR	2012	16	1					1	12		10.1007/s11852-011-0162-3								WOS:000300888500001						
J	Min, JE; Ryu, JH; Lee, S; Son, S				Min, Jee-Eun; Ryu, Joo-Hyung; Lee, Seok; Son, SeungHyun			Monitoring of suspended sediment variation using Landsat and MODIS in the Saemangeum coastal area of Korea	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Suspended sediment concentration (SS) is an important indicator of marine environmental changes due to natural causes such as tides, tidal currents, and river discharges, as well as human activities such as construction in coastal regions. In the Saemangeum area on the west coast of Korea, construction of a huge tidal dyke for land reclamation has strongly influenced the coastal environment. This study used remotely sensed data to analyze the SS changes in coastal waters caused by the dyke construction. Landsat and MODIS satellite images were used for the spatial analysis of finer patterns and for the detailed temporal analysis, respectively. Forty Landsat scenes and 105 monthly composite MODIS images observed during 1985-2010 were employed, and four field campaigns (from 2005 to 2006) were performed to verify the image-derived SS. The results of the satellite data analyses showed that the seawater was clear before the dyke construction, with SS values lower than 20 g/m(3). These values increased continuously as the dyke construction progressed. The maximum SS values appeared just before completion of the fourth dyke. Values decreased to below 5 g/m(3) after dyke construction. These changes indicated tidal current modification. Some eddies and plumes were observed in the images generated from Landsat data. Landsat and MODIS can reveal that coastal water turbidity was greatly reduced after completion of the construction. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Coastline is one of the most important linear features on the Earth's surface showing a dynamic nature. The coast and its environmental management need information on coastline and its changes. Regarding to the sea level changes in the recent century, the coastline changes issue has introduced more consideration of social, economical and environmental aspects at Tonekabon coastal area, and has created some problem for the environment and residential areas. In this study, the common approaches for determination of coastline changes through Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques and also Satellite Images has been applied on Tonekabon coastline. The TM, ETM and ETM+ landsat satellite images in 1984, 2000 and 2010 were selected, and their geometric and radiometric error correction were done at pre-processing stage. At image processing stage, Band #5 being the best band of detecting water from land, and contrast enhancement, Thresholding and edge detecting filter as the best separation approaches were applied. Outputs in the form of raster layers, showed a zigzag-like coastline from 1984 to 2000 and 2010. Afterwards, raster data were converted into vector, and position changes of coastline for 41 points with an equal space of 1000 m were measured. Results showed an average displacement of 75.2 m toward coast during 1984 and 2000. The average change, during 2000 and 2010, was determined 32.9 m. In these years, most of the study area has encountered a retrograde water level and expansion of land and only in a few places small values of rising in sea level has been observed. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the applied methods in extraction of coastline and its change measurement, field measurement was also taken that Building destruction by sea waves, sinking several buildings under water, protecting of buildings against sea expansion and so on, are some witness for the methodology accuracy of this study in the coastline changes issue at Tonekabon City.

The first complete inventory of the local glaciers and ice caps on Greenland	CRYOSPHERE												Glacier inventories provide essential baseline information for the determination of water resources, glacier-specific changes in area and volume, climate change impacts as well as past, potential and future contribution of glaciers to sea-level rise. Although Greenland is heavily glacierised and thus highly relevant for all of the above points, a complete inventory of its glaciers was not available so far. Here we present the results and details of a new and complete inventory that has been compiled from more than 70 Landsat scenes (mostly acquired between 1999 and 2002) using semi-automated glacier mapping techniques. A digital elevation model (DEM) was used to derive drainage divides from watershed analysis and topographic attributes for each glacier entity. To serve the needs of different user communities, we assigned to each glacier one of three connectivity levels with the ice sheet (CL0, CL1, CL2; i.e. no, weak, and strong connection) to clearly, but still flexibly, distinguish the local glaciers and ice caps (GIC) from the ice sheet and its outlet glaciers. In total, we mapped similar to 20 300 glaciers larger than 0.05 km(2) (of which similar to 900 are marine terminating), covering an area of 130 076 +/- 4032 km(2), or 89 720 +/- 2781 km(2) without the CL2 GIC. The latter value is about 50% higher than the mean value of more recent previous estimates. Glaciers smaller than 0.5 km(2) contribute only 1.5% to the total area but more than 50% (11 000) to the total number. In contrast, the 25 largest GIC (> 500 km(2)) contribute 28% to the total area, but only 0.1% to the total number. The mean elevation of the GIC is 1700m in the eastern sector and around 1000m otherwise. The median elevation increases with distance from the coast, but has only a weak dependence on mean glacier aspect.

The present study is conducted on the 142 km-long coastline of Puri district, India. It aims to analyze the change in coastline due to erosion/accretion and provide best estimate of future shoreline positions based on past shorelines. A simple mathematical model, End Point Rate (EPR), has been used to calculate the rate of change of shoreline and its future positions, based on empirical observations. The erosional/accretional scenario has also been analysed by delineating the shoreline from Landsat imageries of 1972, 2001 and 2010. It is found that the northern part of Puri, in the vicinity of Kushabhadra estuary and Chandrabhaga beach undergo high rates of erosion. Based on the delineated shoreline, the short term (2015) and long term (2025) shoreline positions have been predicted.

J	Grise, MM; Biondi, D				Grise, Mayssa Mascarenhas; Biondi, Daniela			THE LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE ANALYSIS OF NATINAL PARK OF SUPERAGUI, PARANA STATE AND THE BUFFER'S ZONE	CIENCIA FLORESTAL												The National Park of Superagui is located on the north coast of Parana state. It is the largest continuous area of the Atlantic Forest remaining in the country and this biome is among the most threatened ones in the world. This area covers the north coast of the state and includes several conservation units of different categories, and the Environmental Protection Area of Guaraquecaba, is the largest one. The objective of this study was to analyze the landscape structure (matrix and patches) of the National Park of Superagui, and its buffer zone. The classification of land cover and the definition of the attributes of the area and perimeter were made using a digital image Landsat 5 TM. According to the landscape structure analysis, it was observed that the Park matrix is formed by native vegetation interrupted by the presence of patches. Approximately 7% of the studied area is composed by fragments, which belong to class of changed vegetation, exposed soil, urban areas, sand and water; mostly have less than one hectare and have a regular shape. The Park buffer zone is not fully incorporated within the limits of Environmental Protection Area of Guaraquecaba, where marine areas form a great portion. It follows that landscape structure analysis, through its structural components matrix and patches, is an efficient subsidy to verify the park land cover functionality and its buffer zone.																	0103-9954					JAN-MAR	2012	22	1					23	33										WOS:000305146000003

Although frequently criticized and despite many alternatives, due to its simplicity and intuitive manner, post-classification change detection still remains one of the most applied techniques. Many studies in the field of change detection analysis acknowledge, for instance, the impact of misregistration, inconsistencies in classification schemes or differences in methods for image interpretation. However, there are additional, rarely studied influences that can cause large errors in change detection results, including integrating multi-resolution data, the adjacency effect and the minimum mapping units (MMUs) that are applied to the classification before change detection. This study demonstrates these effects for the complex land cover of the Alvarado mangrove area at the Mexican Gulf Coast, employing 10 m Systeme Pour l'Observation de la Terre 5 (SPOT-5) high geometric resolution (HRG)-based and 57 m Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) classifications. As a baseline, the proportion of the fine spatial resolution classes within the coarse spatial resolution cells were derived, from which proportional change matrices were computed. The analysis employs difference measures to compare change matrices and proportional maps. The impact of various tested resampling functions was negligible if coarse resolution data were refined. For coarsening fine spatial resolution data, change matrix comparison was comparatively small but yielded differences of approximately 20% in spatially explicit measures. Incorrect positional alignment indicated differences of up to 5% in the change matrix for a misregistration of 100 m and even higher spatially explicit differences (28%). The discrepancies due to the adjacency effect were rather low. MMUs of 25 ha resulted in differences of up to 36% in the change matrix. The magnitude of the discrepancies of all studied effects depends on the class diversity in the map, and some can also be related to the difference in spatial resolution.																	0143-1161						2012	33	20					6426	6445		10.1080/01431161.2012.688148								WOS:000304593100008

A time series (1941-1987) of empirical advance and retreat data from the coast of Guyana was used. Coastlines were also extracted from 1987, 1990 and 1992 Landsat TM images, and 1999, 2002, 2004 and 2006 Landsat ETM+ images. The historical data were used to calculate advance and retreat (AOR) rates and sediment volume changes. Distinct periods of advance and retreat matched corresponding periods of sediment gains and losses. The Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) was used to predict rates of coastline change. Graphical plots of DSAS results identified spatial and temporal phase shifts of the coastline. Recurring episodes of accretion and erosion could be associated with the presence or absence of mudbanks along the coast.					ahmad, sajid/0000-0003-0122-472X												0149-0419	1521-060X					2012	35	1					1	15		10.1080/01490419.2011.637851								WOS:000304472400001						
J	Wang, JL; Yang, XJ				Wang, Jialing; Yang, Xiaojun			A Hierarchical Approach to Forest Landscape Pattern Characterization	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Landscape spatial patterns have increasingly been considered to be essential for environmental planning and resources management. In this study, we proposed a hierarchical approach for landscape classification and evaluation by characterizing landscape spatial patterns across different hierarchical levels. The case study site is the Red Hills region of northern Florida and southwestern Georgia, well known for its biodiversity, historic resources, and scenic beauty. We used one Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper image to extract land-use/-cover information. Then, we employed principal-component analysis to help identify key class-level landscape metrics for forests at different hierarchical levels, namely, open pine, upland pine, and forest as a whole. We found that the key class-level landscape metrics varied across different hierarchical levels. Compared with forest as a whole, open pine forest is much more fragmented. The landscape metric, such as CONTIG_MN, which measures whether pine patches are contiguous or not, is more important to characterize the spatial pattern of pine forest than to forest as a whole. This suggests that different metric sets should be used to characterize landscape patterns at different hierarchical levels. We further used these key metrics, along with the total class area, to classify and evaluate subwatersheds through cluster analysis. This study demonstrates a promising approach that can be used to integrate spatial patterns and processes for hierarchical forest landscape planning and management.																	0364-152X					JAN	2012	49	1					64	81		10.1007/s00267-011-9762-9								WOS:000301299800006	21984047

Monitoring temporal changes of the surface water area of the Burullus and Manzala lagoons using automatic techniques applied to a Landsat satellite data series of the Nile Delta coast	MEDITERRANEAN MARINE SCIENCE												This study introduces the automated shoreline techniques used to monitor the temporal change of the surface water area of the Burullus and Manzala lagoons. In this study, a series of Landsat image data are acquired at intermittent intervals between 1972 and 2006 for the Burullus lagoon and between 1972 and 2007 for the Manzala lagoon. All Landsat images were radiometrically calibrated and converted to reflectance values. The reflectance values of each date were atmospherically corrected using the 6S model. The automated shoreline technique was checked against field observations using GPS over the four seasons for each lagoon during reconnaissance for the shoreline boundary. The accuracy of the extracted shoreline boundary for each lagoon was validated by calculating the area of a large aquaculture farm in the study area from satellite imagery and the available topographic maps. The resulting accuracy of this technique was approximately 97.5%. From the spatial temporal analysis of the satellite data, the results indicate that the rate change of the aquatic surface area is -7.3 km(2)/yr and -2.7 km(2)/yr for the Manzala and Burullus lagoons, respectively, during the approximately 35-year study period. The changes detected in this study indicate that over this time period, the surface water area of the Manzala and Burullus lagoons has decreased by 62.6% and 61.9, respectively, compared with their original size.																	1108-393X					DEC	2011	12	2					462	478		10.12681/mms.45								WOS:000299017200013

Such information is unavailable for Louisiana at sufficient spatial and thematic detail. We prepared mangrove forest distribution maps of Louisiana (prior to the oil spill) at 1 m and 30 m spatial resolution using aerial photographs and Landsat satellite data, respectively. Image classification was performed using a decision-tree classification approach. We also prepared land-cover change pairs for 1983, 1984, and every 2 y from 1984 to 2010 depicting "ecosystem shifts" (e.g., expansion, retraction, and disappearance). This new spatiotemporal information could be used to assess short-term and long-term impacts of the oil spill on mangroves. Finally, we propose an operational methodology based on remote sensing (Landsat, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer [ASTER], hyperspectral, light detection and ranging [LIDAR], aerial photographs, and field inventory data) to monitor the existing and emerging mangrove areas and their disturbance and regrowth patterns. Several parameters such as spatial distribution, ecosystem shifts, species composition, and tree height/biomass could be measured to assess the impact of the oil spill and mangrove recovery and restoration. Future research priorities will be to quantify the impacts and recovery of mangroves considering multiple stressors and perturbations, including oil spill, winter freeze, sea-level rise, land subsidence, and land-use/land-cover change for the entire Gulf Coast.																	0749-0208					NOV	2011	27	6					1059	1064		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-11-00028.1								WOS:000297278300005						
J	Pattanaik, C; Prasad, SN				Pattanaik, Chiranjibi; Prasad, S. Narendra			Assessment of aquaculture impact on mangroves of Mahanadi delta (Orissa), East coast of India using remote sensing and GIS	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Aquaculture is one of the fastest growing food industries. However, the rapid growth of aquaculture worldwide has resulted in growing concerns about its impact on important ecosystems. The expansion of aquaculture farms in the coastal areas has led to conversion of mangroves, more rapidly. To assess the impact of aquaculture on mangroves, the present study has been undertaken in Mahanadi delta of Orissa, East coast of India which is famous for its distinctive mangrove ecosystem. It has undergone tremendous changes due to the development of aquaculture and agriculture activities during last two decades. For this, satellite data of different time periods (Landsat MSS of 1973, Landsat TM of 1990 and IRS P6 LISS III of 2006) were used. It was found that the delta was occupied by dense mangrove (12.6%), open mangrove (3.3%), aquaculture (12.9%) and agriculture (30.9%) in 2006. A loss of 2606 ha mangrove area and an increase of 3657 ha aquaculture area was observed from 1973 to 2006 clearly depicts the augment of aquaculture industry. It is suggested that, regular monitoring of the mangroves and effective implementation of coastal management laws be strictly undertaken to prevent the further loss mangroves in Mahanadi delta.

J	Alphan, H				Alphan, Hakan			Comparing the utility of image algebra operations for characterizing landscape changes: The case of the Mediterranean coast	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The aim of this study is to compare various image algebra procedures for their efficiency in locating and identifying different types of landscape changes on the margin of a Mediterranean coastal plain, Cukurova, Turkey. Image differencing and ratioing were applied to the reflective bands of Landsat TM datasets acquired in 1984 and 2006. Normalized Difference Vegetation index (NDVI) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) differencing were also applied. The resulting images were tested for their capacity to detect nine change phenomena, which were a priori defined in a three-level classification scheme. These change phenomena included agricultural encroachment, sand dune afforestation, coastline changes and removal/expansion of reed beds. The percentage overall accuracies of different algebra products for each phenomenon were calculated and compared. The results showed that some of the changes such as sand dune afforestation and reed bed expansion were detected with accuracies varying between 85 and 97% by the majority of the algebra operations, while some other changes such as logging could only be detected by mid-infrared (MIR) ratioing. For optimizing change detection in similar coastal landscapes, underlying causes of these changes were discussed and the guidelines for selecting band and algebra operations were provided.

The wetlands along this coast are important stopover sites during bird migration between wintering and breeding sites. The use of remote sensing methods for mapping bird migration habitats and for temporal monitoring of changes in these habitats was investigated. The Amvrakikos Gulf, a coastal wetland complex along the west coast of Greece, was selected as the study area. Landsat TM and ETM+images and ASTER VNIR images were used to perform a post-classification change detection over a time period of 15 years (1989-2004). In order to assess the spatial quality of existing wetland patches, spatial metrics (such as patch area, distance between the patches, and proximity) were calculated. To study changes in the degree of fragmentation of the stopover area, a binary patch structure was used in which the focal patches were embedded in a neutral matrix. The results showed that Landsat and ASTER VNIR satellite images can be used to trace small wetlands of approximately 0.5 ha minimum. These data sources are suitable for monitoring changes in wetlands, in particular marshes and mudflats, which are important habitats for migratory waterbirds. In the 15-year period that has been studied there was an estimated 32% decrease in marsh and mudflat area. Among this decrease, 25% went to water surface and 7% to vegetation in the months of August and September. Within the same period of time, a higher degree of fragmentation of the potential bird migration habitat has also been recorded. For this purpose, the remote sensing approach used in this study where change detection is performed on freely available Landsat and ASTER satellite images could be an interesting tool for policy makers and managers, as they allow easy recognition and monitoring of changes in wetlands and therefore contribute to an evaluation of the efficiency of protection and management schemes applied by countries for their wetlands.

As part of the Coastal Zone Management strategy, regular monitoring of shoreline changes plays an important role. Growing population in coastal zones creates extra pressure on shores which leads to the creation of new land filling areas (accretion). Moreover, a recently completed highway construction caused a catastrophic impact on coastal areas of the southern part of the Black Sea and needs to be taken into account. The main purpose of this article is to determine the pattern of shoreline changes along the Turkish coast of the Black Sea. Remote sensing is used to identify and evaluate hot spots of shoreline changes. A developed algorithm automatically extracts the coast line position by processing satellite images covering the period of 1987 to 2001. The maximum and minimum shoreline changes in terms of erosion and accretion were 118 to 53 and 95 to 635 m, respectively. More significant changes have been determined in the eastern part than the western part of the Black Sea. The locations with higher changes were mainly accretion regions along the study area. It can be concluded that coastal movements mainly caused by humans induced impacts at the coasts of the Black Sea. Coastal accretion is significant at the most part of the Turkish Black Sea coast and might be related to a recently constructed international highway.

J	Zhang, Y				Zhang, Yang			Coastal environmental monitoring using remotely sensed data and GIS techniques in the Modern Yellow River delta, China	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												On the basis of remote sensing and GIS techniques, the Landsat data obtained in 1987, 1996, and 2008 were used to examine coastline changes in the Modern Yellow River (MYR) delta in China. The coastal land lost and gained illustrations were derived, the rates of coastal change were estimated, and the coastal parts that experienced severe changes were identified. The results revealed that the accretion rates in the MYR delta coast has been decelerating while the accretion effect remained. Taken the artificial coast from the south of ShenXianGou (SXG) to Gudong Oil Field (GOF) as the landmark, the coast in the south of the landmark showed an accretion pattern, while the coast in the west of the landmark showed an erosion pattern. Wherein, the coast from Chao River Estuary (CRE) to Zhuang 106 (Z106) showed an erosion pattern with the transition from erosion to accretion and the accelerated rates from east to west. The coast from Z106 to the south border of GOF also showed erosion pattern but significant differences existed among the internal coastal parts. The coast from the south border of GOF to XiaoDao River Estuary (XDRE) showed a pattern from rapid accretion to dynamic balance of accretion/erosion, and the trend towards erosion. The coast from XDRE to XiaoQing River Estuary (XQRE) showed slow accretion pattern.

This process has produced an intense debate on the economic benefits but also about the extent and intensity of the impact of this activity on the coastal ecosystems, particularly the effects of pond construction on mangrove areas and other coastal wetlands. For the Northern coast of Sinaloa (Northwest Mexico), a region where shrimp culture is actively practiced and reproduces most of the shrimp controlled production model in Mexico, a land cover change-detection analysis, with Landsat images, outputs that 75% of the shrimp farming in this region has been built on saltmarshes while less than 1% was constructed on mangrove areas. Through the estimation of landscape metrics for different scenarios (with and without shrimp culture infrastructure), we find that in addition to direct removal of saltmarshes, shrimp aquaculture has significantly modified the spatial patterns of coastal wetlands, retreating wetland borders and fragmenting their patches. These last impacts are mainly related with the development of the linear infrastructure associated with shrimp culture (drainage channels and roads), rather than the construction of the ponds. Present findings and other from similar studies done in Northwest Mexico; allow us to estimate that 60% of shrimp farming in Mexico impacted directly on saltmarshes, contrasting with the 3% of shrimp farms built on mangroves.

J	Reinfelds, I				Reinfelds, Ivars			Monitoring and Assessment of Surface Water Abstractions for Pasture Irrigation from Landsat Imagery: Bega-Bemboka River, NSW, Australia	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Irrigation of pasture forms the greatest single use of irrigation water in Australia yet there has been little monitoring of its spatial extent and water demands across southeast Australian coastal catchments where irrigated dairy farming forms an important rural livelihood. This paper provides an analysis of spatio-temporal patterns in the extent of irrigated pasture in the Bega-Bemboka catchment on the south coast of New South Wales from Landsat imagery, and establishes quantile regression relationships between metered monthly irrigation abstraction volumes, evaporation and rainfall. Over the metering period (2000-2007), annual water usage averages 4.8 ML ha (-aEuro parts per thousand 1) year (-aEuro parts per thousand 1), with January being the month of highest demand with an annualised usage of 10.4 ML ha (-aEuro parts per thousand 1) year (-aEuro parts per thousand 1). Analysis of Landsat imagery indicates that the spatial extent of irrigated pasture across the catchment has increased from 1266 ha in 1983 to 1842 ha by 2002, together with amalgamation of smaller holdings along less reliable streams into larger parcels along the trunk stream. Quantile regressions to estimate monthly mean and maximum abstraction volumes from monthly evaporation and rainfall data indicate that abstraction volumes are more closely correlated with evaporation. When combined with Landsat analyses of the spatial extent of irrigated areas, such relationships enable estimation of catchment-scale hydrological effects of irrigation abstractions that in turn can help guide regional-scale assessments of the ecological effects and sustainability of spatially and temporally changing irrigation abstraction volumes.																	0920-4741					JUL	2011	25	9					2319	2334		10.1007/s11269-011-9810-5								WOS:000292558200014

Impact of North Gas Field development on landuse/landcover changes at Al Khore, North Qatar, using remote sensing and GIS	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Four dates of satellite images are utilized to monitor landuse/landcover changes at Al Khore municipality following discovering of the North Gas Field at the Northeast coast of the state of Qatar. Ras Laffan Port has been designed and purpose built primarily as the export facility for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) derived from the processing of gas landed from the North Field Gas Reservoir situated 67 km NNE of the Port. Remote sensing data includes, MSS 1977, Landsat Thematic Mapper 1988 and 2000 and IRSS 2008. The rapid increase in population over the last three decades is attributed to the strong performance of the economy. At Al Khore, number of population increases from 31,547, 4.2% of total population in year 2004 to 50,917, 6.1% of total population in year 2006. Production Capacity of Ras Gas from the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) increases from 6.6 million tons in year 1999 to 35.7 million tons in year 2012. Change detection is processed to assess the impact of Ras Laffan harbour on coastal changes. The most appropriate band combination, band ratios and images classifications were specified to enhance land cover in each image data. ArcGIS.9.3 is used to analyse, map and assess the current urban and regional planning. The results indicate that Al Khore master plan comes in response to rapid development of the state of Qatar, the most suitable regional plan should be suggested for sustainable development.

J	De la Barrera, F; Reyes-Paecke, S; Meza, L				De la Barrera, Francisco; Reyes-Paecke, Sonia; Meza, Luis			Landscape analysis for rapid ecological assessment of relocation alternatives for a devastated city	REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL												After the eruption of the Chaiten Volcano (Chile) and the destruction of the neighboring Chaiten city, some alternative sites were evaluated for the relocation of administrative facilities and housing for the displaced. Three towns (Fandango, Santa Barbara and Bahia Pumalin) were evaluated by means of a multi-criteria analysis, including the impact that a new urban development would have on local biodiversity. This impact was evaluated through a landscape analysis. The landscape attributes studied were (1) composition and representation of each ecosystem type, (2) connectivity, and (3) environmental value, based on a classification of the prevailing ecosystems and their respective stages of succession, defined as a function of ecosystem heterogeneity and maturity. Landscape metrics were calculated from LANDSAT 5 satellite imagery (November 17(th), 2008) with ArcView (R) 3.2 (ESRI) and Fragstats, including the surface cover of each ecosystem type, the number of patches and the cohesion index (CI). Environmental value was determined qualitatively in situ. Santa Barbara was selected by authorities as the best place for New Chaiten City. Over 70% of this is area is covered by forest, achieving a high degree of forest connectivity (CI > 99.0) and shrubs (CI > 94.0), with an advanced stage of succession, a high level of heterogeneity (species and strata) and a high level of inland environmental value. On the coast, Santa Barbara has anthropic influence, but maintains an advanced state of succession, a high level of heterogeneity, and a medium-high degree of environmental value. Regarding the future urban development at this location, the recommendations were: maintenance of riverside integrity and the continuity of forests in Santa Barbara. The proposed methodology proved to be: (1) useful for biodiversity assessment, despite the lack of information at species level, (2) easily replicable, due to the use of standard categories (ecosystem types) and easier access to satellite images, and (3) able to integrate environmental criteria at early stages of decision making in land use and urban planning processes				Reyes-Paecke, Sonia/E-3746-2015	Reyes-Paecke, Sonia/0000-0001-5888-1507; de la Barrera, Francisco/0000-0002-6854-3197												0716-078X					JUN	2011	84	2					181	194		10.4067/S0716-078X2011000200004								WOS:000293674900004

Considering the success of this project, the Commission has financed another more ambitious project in which 11 countries and 23 research and educational institutions have been involved. The project was called Participatory multi-Level EO-assisted tools for Irrigation water management and Agricultural Decision-Support, (PLEIADeS), and Mexico was one of the beneficiaries. This project was established during the period from 2006 to 2009, in the State of Sonora, in northern Mexico,, and the main objective, among several others, was to support the producers of the irrigation districts in this state, in order to improve the use of water in land irrigation. Related to this project, some of the technologies developed in Europe were tested and adapted in three Irrigation Districts, the Hermosillo Coast, the Mayo River and the Yaqui River. Using information from several water users from these districts, the methodologies have been tested and adapted to evaluate the development of the wheat crop using images from satellites Landsat 5 and 7. In this study, some functions have been obtained, correlating vegetation indices and evapotranspiration to crop yield, which make it possible to evaluate the effect of water applied to soil and input management. Also the System of Participatory Information Decision Support and Expert knowledge for River basin management (SPIDER), was adapted for the use of water users. The results of this study show the possibility of developing methodologies to transfer information to the water users which can be useful to improve soil, water and input management to get better crop yields.

J	Heumann, BW				Heumann, Benjamin W.			Satellite remote sensing of mangrove forests: Recent advances and future opportunities	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Mangroves are salt tolerant woody plants that form highly productive intertidal ecosystems in tropical and subtropical regions. Despite the established importance of mangroves to the coastal environment, including fisheries, deforestation continues to be a major threat due to pressures for wood and forest products, land conversion to aquaculture, and coastal urban development. Over the past 15 years, remote sensing has played a crucial role in mapping and understanding changes in the areal extent and spatial pattern of mangrove forests related to natural disasters and anthropogenic forces. This paper reviews recent advancements in remote-sensed data and techniques and describes future opportunities for integration or fusion of these data and techniques for large-scale monitoring in mangroves as a consequence of anthropogenic and climatic forces. While traditional pixel-based classification of Landsat, SPOT, and ASTER imagery has been widely applied for mapping mangrove forest, more recent types of imagery such as very high resolution (VHR), Polarmetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR), hyperspectral, and LiDAR systems and the development of techniques such as Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA), spatial image analysis (e.g. image texture), Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR), and machine-learning algorithms have demonstrated the potential for reliable and detailed characterization of mangrove forests including species, leaf area, canopy height, and stand biomass. Future opportunities include the application of existing sensors such as the hyperspectral HYPERION, the application of existing methods from terrestrial forest remote sensing, investigation of new sensors such as ALOS PRISM and PALSAR, and overcoming challenges to the global monitoring of mangrove forests such as wide-scale data availability, robust and consistent methods, and capacity-building with scientists and organizations in developing countries.																	0309-1333	1477-0296				FEB	2011	35	1					87	108		10.1177/0309133310385371								WOS:000287779900005

Mangrove Forests Submitted to Depositional Processes and Salinity Variation Investigated using satellite images and vegetation structure surveys. Journal of Coastal Research, SI 64 (Proceedings of the 11th International Coastal Symposium), 344 - 348. Szczecin, Poland, ISSN 0749-0208. The current paper examines the growth and spatio-temporal variation of mangrove forests in response to depositional processes and different salinity conditions. Data from mangrove vegetation structure collected at permanent plots and satellite images were used. In the northern sector important environmental changes occurred due to an artificial channel producing modifications in salinity. The southern sector is considered the best conserved mangrove area along the coast of Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Landsat TM5 images from 1997 and 2010 were processed using Geographical Information Systems. Supervised classifications complemented by visual interpretations and ground truth were used to map mangrove areas in both periods. In each permanent plot, all plants were identified and tree diameter, height, and incidence of associated species were recorded. Mean height, basal area dominance, and stem density were also assessed. In the southern sector of the study area, digital image analysis revealed shoreline progradation and mangrove establishment. These sites have demonstrated both vegetation growth and extension. In the northern sector, the satellite image analysis revealed an increase of depositional areas. An important number of associated freshwater plants were observed, inhibiting the establishment of mangrove seedlings or growth of saplings. Despite the high sedimentation rate, which enables mangrove colonization, the low salinity exerts indirect negative influence on mangrove development, considering that it creates good conditions to macrophytes reproduction. Coastal planning requires that the spatial differences be recognized as unique sub-systems due to the hydrodynamic complexity. Both on-the-ground monitoring of the vegetation structure and space-borne remote sensing are important tools to support coastal zone management.

Wave-formed mud bars: their morphodynamics and role in opportunistic mangrove colonization. Journal of Coastal Research, SI 64 (Proceedings of the 11th International Coastal Symposium), 384 - 387. Szczecin, Poland, ISSN 0749-0208 Bars are coastal bedforms that have been widely described from sandy and gravelly beach, tidal inlet and estuarine-channel environments. The bars described in this paper are muddy wave-formed features associated with the massive mud banks that migrate alongshore from the mouth of the Amazon to the mouth of the Orinoco in South America. These bars are generally short-lived features that are rapidly reworked and pushed shoreward by waves impinging on the mud banks. Accreted bars become exposed to drying and evaporative processes which favour surface cracking. Such mud cracks play an important role in the rapid and extensive colonisation of the bank by mangroves as these mud cracks act as mechanical traps for mangrove propagules (Avicennia germinans). At this stage, bars constitute the primary substrate for offshore pioneer opportunistic mangrove formation. Multi-temporal satellite images (SPOT and Landsat ETM images) and wave data from the ERA 40 model generated by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and from a NOAA buoy indicate a rising trend in mud bar frequency since the early 2000s, in response to wave intensification. In these conditions of increased wave forcing, offshore fluid mud deposits are massively mobilized shoreward and reworked into new mud bars. This morphological forcing of the mud bank topography by enhanced wave activity has, in turn, an important impact on the mangrove ecosystem. Although mangroves are generally susceptible to erosion by higher-energy waves, the abundance of bars favours active mud-bank colonization.																	0749-0208						2011			1		64		384	387										WOS:000302824900079

Short-term prediction of the evolution of mangrove surface areas: The example of the mud banks of Kourou and Sinnamary, French Guiana.	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					11th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)	MAY 09-13, 2011	Szczecin, POLAND	Univ Szczecin, Inst Marine & Coastal Sci, Coastal Educ & Res Fdn, Univ Szczecinski (US), Cztowiek Nauka Srodowisko (CNS), ZMGM, Reg Dyrekcja Ochrony Srodowiska, Esri, Springer, Lotos, GA2 Syst, World Sci, Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht, Nfosigm, Urzad Marszalkowski Wojewodztwa Zachodniopomorskiego, Wojewodzki Fundusz Ochrony Srodowiska I Gospodarki Wodnej W Gdansku				The aim of this study is to predict the short-term evolution of the surface areas of mangroves colonizing the mud banks of French Guiana from the comparative analysis of a series of satellite images. Two banks have been thus monitored: those of Kourou and Sinnamary. Sediment concentration values, grain sizes and topographic data were obtained for the Kourou bank, enabling the definition of the threshold elevation for mangrove colonization and analysis of colonization patterns over the mud bank. Digital elevation models were constructed from SPOT and Landsat7 images and shoreline detection carried out for the two study sites by extracting the mud-water interface at different tidal levels. The images were also used to examine the evolution of the mangrove areas and their expansion rates. The threshold of potential colonization has been estimated from field measurements carried out on the Kourou bank at about 2.45 m. The results confirm this threshold and highlight its relevance for predicting large-scale colonization by A. germinans. By confronting the geographic limits of the threshold defined from the digital elevation models and mangrove surface area, it comes out that within 3 years over 90% of the intertidal mud bank with an elevation higher than that of the threshold is covered by a dense cover of mangroves. It is thus possible to predict the short-term evolution of mangrove surface areas but the rates of colonization of the mud bank vary considerably as a function of available intertidal area. The results highlight divergent rates of mangrove area expansion between the two banks although certain similar points were remarked. This entails difficulties in predicting both the long-term mangrove expansion areas and rates. Uncertainty is exacerbated by the numerous climatic, geomorphic, oceanic and biological factors that need to be considered when analyzing the colonization process.																	0749-0208						2011			1		64		388	392										WOS:000302824900080

The coastal land lost and gained illustrations were derived from the extracted coastlines, the rates of coastal change were estimated, and the coastal parts that experienced the biggest changes were identified. The results illustrated that the erosion rates of the AYR Delta coast decreased during 1978-2000 while the erosion effect remained strong. The spatial-temporal changing patterns of the northern, central and southern coastal parts in the study area were characterised by slow erosion, erosion and dynamic balance of erosion/accretion.																	0957-4352	1741-5101					2011	45	4					327	341										WOS:000292422900003

Monitoring brackishwater aquaculture development using multi-spectral satellite data and GIS - a case study near Pichavaram mangroves south-east coast of India	INDIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES												Satellite data of Landsat TM, IRS 1B LISS II, IRS 1C LISS III and IRS 1D LISS III were used to monitor aquaculture development and its spatial distribution in Cuddalore District, south-east coast of India. Analysis of satellite images using image processing software ERDAS Imagine 9.0 and Geographic Information System (GIS) software Arc GIS 9.0 indicated that the area under aquaculture was 6.91 ha in 1987, gradually increasing to 67.71 ha in 1994, and reaching a maximum of 380.19 ha in 1998. There was a little shrimp culture development (6.14 ha) from 1998 to 2005 because of risk of White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV), epizootics and constraints related to social and environmental concerns raised against shrimp farming. Shrimp farms initially started in the marsh areas close to creeks and then moved inland towards agricultural and fallow lands. Farms developed in clusters along the creeks without affecting mangrove reserve forests between 1988 and 2005 and about 177.02 ha agriculture land including 234.25 ha fallow lands were converted for aquaculture farming. Shrimp culture was abandoned in 109.47 ha and 15.13 ha of agricultural land previously converted to aquaculture farms, was reconverted for agriculture. The present study shows that remote sensing data and GIS are useful tools in assessing and monitoring the development of aquaculture for larger areas and suggests that national level planning using multi-spectral satellite data can be used to assess the existing land use and the potential for sustainable use of coastal resources.																	0970-6011					JAN-MAR	2011	58	1					85	90										WOS:000290290100014

The problem is not only limited to the north-western part of the basin but also can be traced along the southern coast. Recreational use of coastal waters is generally limited by strong turbidity gradients. Total Suspended Matter (TSM) is a major water component affecting water clarity, and one of the most important matters in determining the optical characteristics of water. The aim of this study is to develop a simple statistical algorithm for operational mapping of TSM in coastal waters of the Anatolian coast. Retrieved algorithm revealed 67% (R(2)) overall accuracy in estimating total TSM concentration. TSM distribution of major Anatolian rivers was thematically mapped. It is found that the TSM concentration is ranging between 2-25 g/m(3) for the study area based on model calculations. Even though the results are encouraging, the proposed algorithm should be used with caution for other parts of the basin, due to the spatial and temporal limitations. It should be stressed that a fully general analytical algorithm is an urgent need for monitoring purposes of coastal waters of the Black Sea basin.																	1018-4619						2011	20	1A					262	269										WOS:000288302900013

A three-unit-based approach in coastal-change studies using Landsat images	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												An understanding of a dynamic coast requires long-term investigation of changes taking place along its shoreline. Multi-date satellite images can be used to highlight long-term coastal behaviour. In the present study, a new methodology has been suggested, by proposing initial selection of three basic coastal units, namely, 'land', 'wetland' and 'water'. These three coastal units have been used for identification of five different 'change units', namely, 'land replaced by water', 'land replaced by wetland', 'wetland replaced by water', 'land accretion' and 'wetland accretion'. Based on this proposed approach, a case study has been carried out along the coastal area covering parts of West Bengal and Orissa states of eastern India using Landsat images. The derived coastal changes demarcated using satellite images have been verified by field checks. Further, these changes have been used to study three important coastal issues: sediment budget, coastal morphodynamics and hazard-zonation mapping. This study shows that consideration of three basic coastal units is an appropriate choice for studying long-term coastal changes using multi-date satellite data.																	0143-1161						2011	32	1					209	229		10.1080/01431160903439965								WOS:000287022500013						
J	Laris, P				Laris, Paul			Humanizing Savanna Biogeography: Linking Human Practices with Ecological Patterns in a Frequently Burned Savanna of Southern Mali	ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS												The savanna biome is defined by the codominance of grasses and trees, the precise ratio of which is a function of numerous variables, both natural and anthropogenic. Fire is a critical determinant of the tree-to-grass ratio because it can suppress tree establishment and growth. Despite the fact that nearly all fires have human causes, most savanna fire ecology models are based solely on ecological variables and fail to integrate human land and fire use patterns. To understand how human burning practices, land cover patterns, and fire regimes are linked I combined the results of an image-based burn scar analysis and land cover maps generated from a Landsat database covering thirty years with interview and survey results. I documented the spatially explicit fire regime for an area of Sudan savanna in southern Mali and linked it to human practices and land cover patterns. The study concludes that burning creates a seasonal mosaic in which some patches regularly burn early and others late, whereas some areas rarely if ever burn. Ecologists attribute mosaic fire regimes to natural factors such as plant succession, but this research demonstrates that the regime is a function of the combined effects of edaphic conditions, vegetation patterns, land use, and widespread burning practices. The anthropogenic burning regime documented here differs from the one based on ecological theory in that its spatiotemporal pattern is relatively consistent from year to year. The findings demonstrate the need to "humanize" savanna models by breaking nature-society dichotomies and synthesizing natural and social science explanations.																	0004-5608						2011	101	5					1067	1088		10.1080/00045608.2011.560063								WOS:000299282400006

Woody vegetative cover dynamics in response to recent climate change on an Atlantic coast barrier island: a remote sensing approach	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL												Considering impacts of predicted increases in sea-level, storms, and alterations in precipitation patterns on geomorphological and associated ecological processes, woody vegetation dynamics may serve as sentinels to climate change on barrier islands. We examined island-scale conversion of land (i.e. sand to grassland to woody cover) while relating the importance of climate variables on rate of woody expansion. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) was used to evaluate potential distribution of woody species based on distance to shoreline and elevation. Using Landsat TM imagery, we monitored changes in island size and vegetation classes (1984-2010). These comparisons revealed conversion of grassland to woody cover (285% increase) was closely linked to air temperature, precipitation and atmospheric [CO2]. LiDAR data indicated that woody species have not expanded completely into the potential range. Our results suggest that woody species are responsive to climate change, thus serving as sentinels on Virginia barrier islands.																	1010-6049						2011	26	8			SI		595	612		10.1080/10106049.2011.621031								WOS:000208631900002						
J	Yu, K; Hu, CM; Muller-Karger, FE; Lu, DM; Soto, I				Yu, Kun; Hu, Chuanmin; Muller-Karger, Frank E.; Lu, Dianmei; Soto, Inia			Shoreline changes in west-central Florida between 1987 and 2008 from Landsat observations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Shoreline changes caused by sediment erosion and accretion have important consequences for coastal ecosystems and coastal communities. Assessing such changes over long stretches of coastline, such as along the west-central Florida coast, represents a challenge to coastal zone managers. In this study, we used nine Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images from the west-central Florida coast (adjacent to Tampa Bay, FL) to study historical shoreline changes from 1987 to 2008. Specifically, we sought to evaluate the change of shorelines during the cold (1987-1998) and warm (1998-2008) phases of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). The cloud-free images selected for this study were collected during the periods when maximum tidal excursions were less than 9 cm from mean sea level, assuring minimal interference from tidal influence. The images revealed that the southern section of the Tampa Bay inlet showed a mean shoreline accretion rate of 1.30 m year(-1) and a cumulative mean shoreline change of 27.29 m over the past 21 years. The northern section of the Tampa Bay inlet showed a mean accretion rate of 0.34 m year(-1), with a cumulative mean shoreline change of 7.06 m during the past 21 years. Both sections experienced beach nourishment conducted by local communities which, while irregular, were effective in reducing beach erosion. The dynamics of opposing shores in the various inlets in the barrier islands of the study region varied substantially, with many showing accretion in the channel on one side but erosion on the other side.				hu, chuanmin/J-5021-2012	Soto, Inia/0000-0001-7974-857X												0143-1161	1366-5901					2011	32	23					8299	8313		10.1080/01431161.2010.535045								WOS:000298374200022

Investigation of heavy-mineral deposits using multispectral satellite data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Mineral deposit mapping is essential for sustainable and eco-friendly exploitation of natural resources. The south Tamil Nadu coast of India is rich in minerals. Currently the beach sands are extracted for export entirely in raw form without any value addition. Due to unsustainable sand mining, there are negative environment impacts, which lead to various coastal hazards such as erosion, salinization and sea-water intrusion. In order to initiate the focus on mapping of mineral deposits along this area, standardized hyperspectral analysis has been carried out using Landsat satellite data and Environment for Visualising Images (ENVI) software. The selected endmembers are identified by comparing the spectral signatures with predefined spectral plots from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) spectral library. Finally the endmembers are mapped with ENVI's spectral angle mapper (SAM). The minerals which show significant variation in reflectance at different spectral bands can be effectively mapped by using multispectral data. Ground verifications performed to assess the accuracy of classification were mostly in agreement with the obtained results. This study has opened up new areas for inland heavy mineral exploitation and leads to eco-friendly exploitation of natural resources along the study area. It also illustrates the high potential of multispectral satellite data for exploration and mapping of mineral resources.																	0143-1161						2011	32	23					8641	8655		10.1080/01431161.2010.545448								WOS:000298374200040

Assessing hurricane-induced tree mortality in U.S. Gulf Coast forest ecosystems	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Tropical cyclones disturb forest ecosystems and have the potential to alter forest structure and species composition as well as ecosystem functions including rates of nutrient cycling and biomass accumulation. Quantifying these forest disturbances is necessary to evaluate the extent and severity of damage for estimating biomass loss, developing regional carbon budgets, and making management decisions following hurricanes. In this study, we quantified forest disturbance (downed and dead and snapped trees) produced by hurricanes using a relationship between field-measured tree mortality and Landsat data that can be broadly applied to Gulf Coast forest ecosystems impacted by hurricanes. Field-measured tree mortality data was collected in Gulf Coast forests at 60 inventory plots established to monitor forest disturbance produced by hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which hit the region in 2005, and Hurricane Gustav, which hit the region in 2008. Large-scale disturbance estimates were obtained by regressing Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data that in turn were associated with Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data from the U. S. Forest Service. The use of the general relationship produced a biomass loss from dead trees of 43.9 +/- 8.4 Tg C for Hurricane Katrina and 37.9 +/- 6.4 Tg C for Hurricane Rita, which are near the upper limit of the expected values reported in our previous studies across a number of different forest types. Our results provide an important contribution for reliable assessments of large-scale disturbance produced by hurricanes in forest ecosystems. Improving our ability to accurately assess the impacts of hurricanes on forests and on terrestrial carbon cycles is particularly important given that climate projections suggest that hurricane intensity is likely to increase.

J	Kurt, S; Karaburun, A; Demirci, A				Kurt, Sumeyra; Karaburun, Ahmet; Demirci, Ali			Coastline changes in Istanbul between 1987 and 2007	SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND ESSAYS												The coastal region of Istanbul has experienced significant coastline changes over the last few decades owing to a rapid increase in industrialization and urbanization. This study was aimed at detecting coastline changes in the coastal region of Istanbul between 1987 and 2007 using remotely sensed data. Two Landsat images acquired in 1987 and 2007 with 30 m resolution were classified with the maximum likelihood supervised classification method. The study area was classified into six land cover classes comprising urban areas, agricultural areas, forest, bare soil, brush/grassland, and lakes/ponds. The study provided an in-depth analysis of the coastal changes in the study area and revealed that the coastlines of Istanbul had expanded by 32 km between 1987 and 2007. From the findings of the study, it can be concluded that the largest variations in the position of the coastline over time occurred on the Marmara Sea coast in the south of Istanbul. Consequently a sustainable coastal management plan should be prepared and put in action in order to preserve the coastal regions.																	1992-2248					OCT 4	2010	5	19					3009	3017										WOS:000284279800020						
J	Li, XJ; Damen, MCJ				Li, Xuejie; Damen, Michiel C. J.			Coastline change detection with satellite remote sensing for environmental management of the Pearl River Estuary, China	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												The Pearl River delta area in Guangdong Province has one of the highest economic development rates of China. Rapid industrialization and urbanization has resulted in extensive changes in land use, including the construction of harbours and embankments. The lack of sustainable coastal zone management has caused severe environmental problems, such as land subsidence, intrusion of sea water, siltation of river channels and coastal erosion. For the analysis of the changes of the coastlines, multi-temporal Landsat images and a SPOT scene have been used, in combination with topographical and nautical data. From the change analysis, it can be concluded that the largest variations in the position of the coastline over time occurred in the Nansha Development Zone, situated in the Northern part of Lingdingyang bay. Sedimentation and land reclamation was responsible for the growth of the islands in the period 1960 to 2000, which however decreased slightly in the years after. Various large changes occurred also in the East of the bay along the coast of Shekou peninsula, caused by extensive harbour construction and growth of polder systems. Based on the research of the coastline change in recent decades, suspended sediment plume distribution and its sedimentation, it is suggested that the western part of the waterway in the estuary may not be suitable for large number of construction for harbours, due to the sedimentation and fill up. One of the most important impacts of the coastline changes in the Pearl River Estuary is the narrowing down and extension of river channel which results in more floods in the upper part of the river.

J	Kuleli, T				Kuleli, Tuncay			Quantitative analysis of shoreline changes at the Mediterranean Coast in Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												This research is focused on the coastline evolution monitoring and its potential change estimation by remote sensing techniques using multi-temporal Landsat images at the southeast coasts of the Mediterranean Sea in Turkey. The study area includes the coastal zone located in the Cukurova Delta coasts. The Cukurova Delta has accreted toward the Mediterranean Sea as a result of sediment discharge and transport from Seyhan and Ceyhan rivers. These processes have caused the morphological changes (accretion or erosion) of coastline along some parts of the southeast coasts of the Mediterranean Sea. In this study, coastline changes were researched by using radiometrically and geometrically corrected multi-temporal and multi-spectral data from Landsat Multispectral Scanner dated 1972, Thematic Mapper dated 1987, and Enhanced Thematic Mapper dated 2002. In the image processing steps, mosaicing, subset, Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique classification, band ratioing (B5/B2), edge detection, and overlay techniques were used to carry out coastline extraction and the Digital Shoreline Analysis System was used to calculate rate of coastline changes. As a result of the analysis, in some parts of the research area, remarkable coastline changes (more than 2,900 m withdrawal and -aEuro parts per thousand 24.50 m/year erosion) were observed for a 30-year period.

North American Ice Sheet build-up during the last glacial cycle, 115-21 kyr	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The last glacial maximum (LGM) outline and subsequent retreat pattern (21-7 kyr) of North American ice sheets are reasonably well established. However, the evolution of the ice sheets during their build-up phase towards the LGM between 115 and 21 kyr has remained elusive, making it difficult to verify numerical ice sheet models for this important time interval. In this paper we outline the pre-LGM ice sheet evolution of the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets by using glacial geological and geomorphological records to make a first-order reconstruction of ice sheet extent and flow pattern. We mapped the entire area covered by the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets in Landsat MSS images and approximately 40% of this area in higher resolution Landsat ETM+ images. Mapping in aerial photographs added further detail primarily in Quebec-Labrador, the Cordilleran region, and on Baffin Island. Our analysis includes the recognition of approximately 500 relative-age relationships from crosscutting lineations. Together with previously published striae and till fabric data, these are used as the basis for relative-age assignments of regional flow patterns. For the reconstruction of the most probable ice sheet evolution sequence we employ a stepwise inversion scheme with a clearly defined strategy for delineating coherent landforms swarms (reflecting flow direction and configuration), and linking these to previously published constraints on relative and absolute chronology. Our results reveal that ice-dispersal centres in Keewatin and Quebec were dynamically independent for most of pre-LGM time and that a massive Quebec dispersal centre, rivalling the LGM in extent, existed at times when the SW sector of the ice sheet had not yet developed. The oldest flow system in eastern Quebec-Labrador (Atlantic swarm had an ice divide closer to the Labrador coast than later configurations). A northern Keewatin-Central Arctic Ice Sheet existed prior to the LGM, but is poorly chronologically constrained. There is also evidence for older and more easterly Cordilleran Ice Sheet divide locations than those that prevailed during the Late Wisconsinan. In terms of ice sheet build-up dynamics, it appears that "residual" ice caps after warming phases may have played an important role. In particular, the location and size of remnant ice masses at the end of major interstadials, i.e. OIS 5c and 5a, must have been critical for subsequent build-up patterns, because such remnant "uplands" may have fostered much more rapid ice sheet growth than what would have occurred on a fully deglaciated terrain. The ice-sheet configuration during stadials would also be governed largely by the additional topography that such "residual" ice constitutes because of inherent mass balance-topography feedbacks.

Forecasting sites of future coastal marsh loss using topographical relationships and logistic regression	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The last two assessments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predict that rates of sea level rise will begin to accelerate by c. 2030-2040 CE. Considering that many marsh systems are already under threat from existing sea level trends, a dramatic upswing in rate only a few decades away poses critical questions about what the future may hold for these marshes (and those yet to manifest sea level impacts) requires coast-wide assessments. Extrapolations of detailed historical trends traditionally have provided the least equivocal way of providing such information, but the necessary data required for this approach are often lacking. In this paper, we describe how logistic regression analysis applied to spatial data on marsh loss and degradation-in this case derived from a validated Landsat-based marsh condition model-and its relation to such readily determined parameters as distance from shorelines or tidal creeks can be used to predict where future marsh losses may occur, even in those systems not presently affected. As such, it affords more targeted information for planning than can be had from general submergence versus accretion/elevation change models (e.g., SLAMM) that are limited by the paucity of vertical accretion data. The results also reinforce the concept that marsh adjustment to sea level rise can be broadly deduced at the landscape level, which in some respects is independent of marsh type and is responsive to tidal frame and coastal profile.																	0923-4861					AUG	2010	18	4					449	461		10.1007/s11273-010-9178-y								WOS:000280074900004						
J	Schomacker, A				Schomacker, Anders			Expansion of ice-marginal lakes at the Vatnajokull ice cap, Iceland, from 1999 to 2009	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Outlet glaciers from the Vatnajokull ice cap in Iceland, Europe's largest ice cap, have been retreating since the end of the Little Ice Age, only interrupted by short intervals of advances. The net mass balance has been negative since 1995, and ice-marginal lakes in front of the outlets have been expanding since then. The switch from land-based glacier termini to lake-terminating glaciers is an eye-catching environmental change. The heat capacity of the ice-marginal lakes and the change into calving glacier fronts accelerates ice loss from Vatnajokull. Landsat 7ETM+ satellite imagery from 1999 to 2009 reveals high resolution snapshots of the lake development during the last decade. Ice-marginal lakes are growing at many outlet glaciers draining the southern sector of Vatnajokull this is most pronounced at the large Breioamerkurjokull glacier, where the Jokulsarlon lake expanded from 15 km(2) in 2000 to more than 21 km(2) in 2009. The lakes act as traps for sediment that was earlier transported across outwash plains toward the Atlantic coast. Hence, the glacier retreat and sediment trapping enhance coastline retreat and river incision in the outwash plains. Similar changes, although at a much larger scale, occurred in many past glaciated regions during the last glacial termination. Thus, the lakes in front of Vatnajokull provide important modern analogues for processes that likely impacted global climate in the past. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results show that: (1) The wetland resources are widely distributed and diverse, with a proximal distribution to present urban construction lands spatially. (2) From 2005 to 2020, the urban construction lands will expand vastly and rapidly, and will take over large areas of wetlands that are mostly the ponds and the aquiculture water areas in the reclamation areas of Hangzhou Bay south coast. Moreover, this change will be spatially uneven obviously, e.g., the most serious recessions of the wetlands are concentrated in Ningbo city, Hangzhou city and Cixi city. (3) Overall, the potential risk to wetlands is very high, and will keep increasing with the trend of urbanization. (4) The quantity and spatial pattern of the planning urban construction land have substantial impacts on the wetland loss. Therefore, some policies and regulations are suggested to coordinate the relationship between urban economic development and wetland resource protection such as adjusting the construction land planning, compensating for wetland occupation as well as constructing wetland parks.																	1009-637X					JUN	2010	20	3					406	416		10.1007/s11442-010-0406-4								WOS:000276461000007						
J	Li, J; Gao, S; Wang, YP				Li Jing; Gao Shu; Wang Yaping			Invading cord grass vegetation changes analyzed from Landsat-TM imageries: a case study from the Wanggang area, Jiangsu coast, eastern China	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												Cord grass colonization on the Jiangsu coast, eastern China, modifies the native salt marshes in terms of ecosystem structure. The Landsat TM images from 1992 to 2003 were analyzed to identify salt-marsh vegetation distribution patterns and their changes over this coastal region, in order to evaluate the effects of the spreading of the artificially introduced halophyte Spartina. Supervised classification was performed using Bands 3, 4 and 5 in conjunction with in situ training samples, to derive the distribution pattern of the vegetation in the study area. Further, in order to identify the intertidal areas with different tidal elevations, a data treatment procedure was designed to combine regional water level data using harmonic analysis with the waterlines on the TM images extracted by density slice. The results show that: (1) the Spartina alterniflora area has been expanding towards the sea rapidly since it was introduced, especially at initial stages; (2) in the upper part of the inter-tidal zone, the local marsh plant Suaeda salsa and the exotic species Spartina anglica were present only near the sea dyke, occupying only a small part of the entire salt marsh, and the area of these two species has been reduced by land reclamation; (3) there has been a trend for Spartina alterniflora to become the dominant species in the salt marshes in the study area; and (4) the elevation of Spartina alterniflora's seaward fringe was close to mean high water on neaps, and its landward boundary was slightly higher than mean high water. The salt marsh environment of the study area has been modified rapidly by the Spartina vegetation for the last 12 years.

Application of the Object-Oriented Technique to monitor Coastline Changes- Case Study: Caspian Sea	DISASTER ADVANCES												Coastal zone monitoring is an important task in national development and environmental protection, in which, drawing out of shorelines is necessary as a fundamental research. This technique of measurement helps in the accuracy of monitoring the coastline changes. In this case, Caspian sea is taken as the case study due to its unique characteristic. Its dynamic coastlines features pose considerable hazards to human use and development. Rapid reliable techniques are required to monitor and update coastline maps of these areas to explore rates of environmental retreats. Similar method can be applied to measure other coastal zone. In the current study, various semi-automated methods like NDWI, NDSI and Tasseled Cap have been applied accordingly and the results were integrated with some object-oriented classification methods. Landsat MSS, TM and ETM imageries of the past three decades were consequently processed by an object-oriented approach performed with an eCognition software package. By comparing three classified maps of the south Caspian Sea coasts (Babolsar Port to Feridonkenar) in 1977, 1984 and 2002 with a unique region growing image segmentation technique (multi-resolution segmentation), areas of rapid change were progressively identified. The revealed models demonstrate several yearly fluctuations and considerable periodical changes on the study area coastlines particularly during the last decode observed by TOPEX/Jason satellites. These great variations have occurred as the result of 2.6 meters increase in seawater height from 1984 to 1995. This has successively caused coastal lands to diminish about 185 km(2) mainly on the Babolsar Port, changing landcover and landuse types by depletion of significant agricultural and residential areas. Implementations of such significant changes signify that the majority of local biotic and a biotic components, all over the surrounding areas, would be in crucial threat in the near future.

Environmental Monitoring of Bombetoka Bay and the Betsiboka Estuary, Madagascar, Using Multi-temporal Satellite Data	JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCE												The causes and consequences of soil erosion in Madagascar have been the focus of recent environmental debates. The Betsiboka, Madagascar's largest river stretching 600 km from the high central plateau to the northwest coast on the Mozambique Channel, is a major conduit for transporting lateritic soils and sediments derived from the highlands of Central Madagascar to the sea. These entrained lateritic sediments color the river a blood-red hue, as if the life of the island is being drained away. In this study, Landsat visible and near infrared spectral bands are used to map the underwater sediments especially under the sea and in the interface between seawater and freshwater. Band color composites, single bands and band ratios are used to improve the detection of underwater sediments including sand bars and delta lobes. We show the evolution of the bay, coastline, delta, and change detection results derived from Landsat satellite images recorded in 1973, 1989, 1999, 2000 and 2003, respectively. Results indicate that sedimentary transport and suspension in Bombetoka Bay has significantly changed during the past 30 years, with a dramatic increase in the amount of sediment moved by the river, and deposited in the estuary and in offshore delta lobes. These changes have adversely affected agriculture, fisheries, and transportation for one of Madagascar's largest ports. The changes are attributed to increased erosion following large-scale deforestation, bush fires, and overgrazing in the river basin.

R. China	CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER												The spectral characteristics of mangroves on the Beihai Coast of Guangxi, P. R. China are acquired on the basis of spectral data from field measurements. Following this, the 3-layer reverse-conversing neural networks (NN) classification technology is used to analyze the Landsat TM5 image obtained on January 8, 2003. It is detailed enough to facilitate the introduction of the algorithm principle and trains project of the neural network. Neural network algorithms have characteristics including large-scale data handling and distributing information storage. This research firstly analyzes the necessity and complexity of this translation system, and then introduces the strong points of the neural network. Processing mangrove landscape characteristics by using neural network is an important innovation, with great theoretical and practical significance. This kind of neural network can greatly improve the classification accuracy. The spatial resolution of Landsat TM5 is high enough to facilitate the research, and the false color composite from 3-, 4-, and 5-bands has a clear boundary and provides a significant quantity of information and effective images. On the basis of a field survey, the exported layers are defined as mangrove, vegetation, bare land, wetlands and shrimp pool. TM satellite images are applied to false color composites by using 3-, 4-, and 5-bands, and then a supervised classification model is used to classify the image. The processing method of hyper-spectrum remote sensing allows the spectral characteristics of the mangrove to be determined, and integrates the result with the NN classification for the false color composite by using 3-, 4-, and 5-bands. The network model consists of three layers, i.e., the input layer, the hidden layer, and the output layer. The input layer number of classification is defined as 3, and the hidden layers are defined as 5 according to the function operation. The control threshold is 0.9. The training ratio is 0.2. The maximum permit error is 0.08. The classification precision reaches 86.86%. This is higher than the precision of maximal parallel classification (50.79%) and the spectrum angle classification (75.39%). The results include the uniformity ratio (1.7789), the assembly ratio (0.6854), the dominance ratio ( - 1.5850), and the fragmentation ratio (0.0325).

Evolution of the tidal depositional system during the past 20 years in the Liaohe River was studied on the basis of 50 boreholes drilling and 30 km shallow stratigraphic exploration from 2002 to 2005. The main tidal depositional body of the modern Liaohe River delta is located in the Shuangtaizihe Estuary. The stratum within the depth of 10 m includes tidal bank facies, tidal channel facies and neritic facies with paleo-delta facies underlying them. The sediments of tidal bank facies are mainly composed of sand and silt with siltation load and suspended load of about 50% respectively in proportion. The sediment of tidal channel facies and neritic facies is composed of clayey silt and silty clay which belongs to suspended load. The study area was a small bay between the old Daliaohe River, the old Dalinghe River and the Raoyanghe River complex delta since the Holocene to 1896. Many tidal banks formed and expanded rapidly after the Shuangtaizihe River was excavated by labor in 1896. The runoff and sediment discharge have decreased since the construction of brake at the Shuangtaizihe River in 1958. The Shuangtaizihe Estuary is in the state of deposition as a whole whose tidal bank is increasing and expanding southward, westward and northward. The maximum expansion speed is 87 to 683 m/a and the mean depositional rate is 0.189 m/a. Erosion occurred in some part of tidal bank with average erosional rate of 0.122 m/a. The tidal channel was filled up with sediment at a migration speed of 48-200 m/a. Geomorphologic changes have happened under the combined influences of runoff, ocean dynamics and human activities. The main source of sediment changes from river sediment to sediment driven by tidal current and longshore current.

J	Bolch, T; Menounos, B; Wheate, R				Bolch, Tobias; Menounos, Brian; Wheate, Roger			Landsat-based inventory of glaciers in western Canada, 1985-2005	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												We report on a glacier inventory for the Canadian Cordillera south of 60 degrees N, across the two western provinces of British Columbia and Alberta, containing similar to 30.000 km(2) of glacierized terrain. Our semi-automated method extracted glacier extents from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes for 2005 and 2000 using a band ratio (TM3/TM5). We compared these extents with glacier cover for the mid-1980s from high-altitude, aerial photography for British Columbia and from Landsat TM imagery for Alberta. A 25 m digital elevation model (DEM) helped to identify debris-covered ice and to split the glaciers into their respective drainage basins. The estimated mapping errors are 3-4% and arise primarily from seasonal snow cover. Glaciers in British Columbia and Alberta respectively lost - 10.8 +/- 3.8% and - 25.4% +/- 4.1% of their area over the period 1985-2005. The region-wide annual shrinkage rate of - 0.55% a(-1) is comparable to rates reported for other mountain ranges in the late twentieth century. Least glacierized mountain ranges with smaller glaciers lost the largest fraction of ice cover: the highest relative ice loss in British Columbia (-24.0 +/- 4.6%) occurred in the northern Interior Ranges, while glaciers in the northern Coast Mountains declined least (- 7.7 +/- 3.4%).

J	Wang, ZY; Gao, S; Huang, HJ				Wang Zhenyan; Gao Shu; Huang Haijun			Spatial variations of tidal water level and their impact on the exposure patterns of tidal land on the central Jiangsu coast	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												The exposed area of intertidal zone varies with tidal water level changes. If intercomparisons of satellite images are adopted as a method to determine geomorphological changes of the intertidal zone in response to accretion or erosion processes, then the effect of water level variations must be evaluated. In this study, two Landsat TM images overpassing the central Jiangsu coastal waters on 2 January and 7 March 2002, respectively, were treated by the changing detection analysis using Image Differencing and Post-classification Comparison. The simultaneous tide level data from four tide gauge stations along the coast were used for displaying the spatial variations of water levels and determining the elevations of waterlines. The results show that the spatial variations of water levels are highly significant in the central Jiangsu coastal waters. The huge differences of tidal land exposure patterns between the two imaging times are related mainly to the spatial variations of tidal water levels, which are controlled by the differences in tidal phases for different imaging times and the spatial variations of water level over the study area at each imaging time. Under complex tidal conditions, e.g., those of the central Jiangsu coastal waters, the tide-surge model should be used to eliminate effectively the effects of water level variations on remote sensing interpretation of geomorphological changes in the intertidal zone.																	0253-505X					JAN	2010	29	1					79	87		10.1007/s13131-010-0010-6								WOS:000275535100010

This method is implemented in the region of Dimbokro-Bongouanou (Ivory Coast). In a first step, the methodological approach consists of spatial analysis of the regional lineaments likely to be related to the fracturing of the basement by means of combined analysis of radar (Radarsat) and optical (Landsat) images, and then validating these lineaments with the mean geological data. In the second step, analysis is proposed that enables the role of these lineaments in groundwater circulation to be identified. This consists of determining the correlation between the major lineament traces and the location of boreholes. The yield of boreholes is analysed as a function of their distance from the nearest lineament, which shows that borehole yield decreases proportionally with the distance between the lineament and high-yield boreholes (discharge greater than 5 m(3)/h). No correlation between distance to the lineament and low-yield boreholes (discharge less than 5 m(3)/h) is noticed. The negative correlation between the productivity of high-yield boreholes and the distance to the closest lineament																	0262-6667						2010	55	5					805	820		10.1080/02626667.2010.489749								WOS:000280448700011

J	Bui, E; Henderson, B; Viergever, K				Bui, Elisabeth; Henderson, Brent; Viergever, Karin			Using knowledge discovery with data mining from the Australian Soil Resource Information System database to inform soil carbon mapping in Australia	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												We present a piecewise linear decision tree model for predicting percent of soil organic C (SOC) in the agricultural zones of Australia generated using a machine learning approach. The inputs for the model are a national database of soil data, national digital surfaces of climate, elevation, and terrain variables, Landsat multispectral scanner data, lithology, land use, and soil maps. The model and resulting map are evaluated, and insights into biogeological surficial processes are discussed. The decision tree splits the overall data set into more homogenous subsets, thus in this case, it identifies areas where SOC responds closely to climatic and other environmental variables. The spatial pattern of SOC corresponds well to maps of estimated primary productivity and bioclimatic zones. Topsoil organic C levels are highest in the high rainfall, temperate regions of Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia, along the coast of New South Wales and in the wet tropics of Queensland; and lowest in arid and semiarid inland regions. While this pattern broadly follows continental vegetation, soil moisture, and temperature patterns, it is governed by a spatially variable hierarchy of different climatic and other variables across bioregions of Australia. At the continental scale, soil moisture level, rather than temperature, seems most important in controlling SOC.

Forest fragmentation, structure, and age characteristics as a legacy of forest management	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The combination of forest inventory and satellite-derived landscape composition and structure provides otherwise unavailable information on regional forest conditions and enables investigation of the cumulative effects of forest management over time. Forest pattern results from a range of both natural and anthropogenic factors. This study characterizes the forest pattern of Vancouver Island, British Columbia (>32,000 km(2)) at the watershed scale, using new national datasets of Canadian forest composition and fragmentation, and relating these to forest inventory-derived age structure. Vancouver Island is extensively forested, possessing highly valuable and productive forests, and is managed to meet a range of stakeholder interests. Forest fragmentation metrics were derived from a satellite-derived, 25-m spatial resolution land cover map (i.e., grain) to represent patterns within 1 km analysis units (i.e., extent) for the entire forested area of Canada. We summarized forest fragmentation island-wide and compared trends between forest-dominated (>85% forest) and less-forested (<85% forest) watersheds. We also explored these patterns with partial canonical correspondence analyses to determine the independent and shared relationships of landscape composition, forest fragmentation, and spatial variables with forest age structure. Less-forested watersheds are more fragmented than forest-dominated watersheds, as indicated by more (5.6 versus 2.7 per km(2)) and smaller (36 versus 63 ha) forest patches, and a greater edge density (82 versus 55 m/ha). Of the 1283 watersheds examined, 91 % were forest-dominated; island-wide trends are thus similar to those of the forest-dominated watersheds Forest age is related to landscape composition and forest fragmentation, which collectively explain 27% and 53% of the age structure of all and less-forested watersheds, respectively. In both sets of watersheds, young forest stands (1-120 years) are associated with broadleaf forests, agreeing with successional expectations, and patchy forest distributions For all watersheds, old growth forest stands (>240 years) are associated with dense coniferous forest, but also with early successional communities, smaller patch sizes, and greater edge densities, indicating fragmentation of these forests and reflecting strategies for managing old growth on the landscape. In contrast, watersheds with an abundance of mature forest (121-240 years) are compositionally similar to watersheds with old growth, but are much less fragmented Our results indicate that although old growth forest stands on Vancouver island have been retained, they are not typically found within a continuous forest matrix. Medium spatial resolution Earth observation products are now available for the entire forested area of Canada, providing valuable insight into spatial and temporal forest dynamics (i.e., succession, harvesting).

Detecting temporal shoreline changes and erosion/accretion rates, using remote sensing, and their associated sediment characteristics along the coast of North Sinai, Egypt	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												The variation during 15 years in the shoreline along the North Sinai coast has been determined by analysing TM and ETM true colour Landsat images from 1986 to 2001. The analyses identified erosion and accretion patterns along the coast. The shoreline has advanced west of El Bardawil inlet1, El Bardawil inlet2, and El Arish Harbour, where the wave-induced littoral transport has been halted by jetty construction and beach growth rates are 20,681, 69,855 and 20,160 m(2)/year, respectively. On the downdrift side of the constructed jetties to the east, the shoreline is retreating and beaches erode at rates of -71,710, -69,968, and -11,760 m(2)/year, respectively. Sedimentological analyses of beach sediment samples have indicated selective transport of heavy minerals according to their densities and grain sizes. A general correspondence has been found between variation in grain size, sorting and heavy-mineral content of beach sand and the patterns of shoreline changes.																	0943-0105					OCT	2009	58	7					1419	1427		10.1007/s00254-008-1644-y								WOS:000270302100005

Evaluating the condition of a mangrove forest of the Mexican Pacific based on an estimated leaf area index mapping approach	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Given the alarming global rates of mangrove forest loss it is important that resource managers have access to updated information regarding both the extent and condition of their mangrove forests. Mexican mangroves in particular have been identified as experiencing an exceptional high annual rate of loss. However, conflicting studies, using remote sensing techniques, of the current state of many of these forests may be hindering all efforts to conserve and manage what remains. Focusing on one such system, the Teacapan-Agua Brava-Las Haciendas estuarine-mangrove complex of the Mexican Pacific, an attempt was made to develop a rapid method of mapping the current condition of the mangroves based on estimated LAI. Specifically, using an AccuPAR LP-80 Ceptometer, 300 indirect in situ LAI measurements were taken at various sites within the black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) dominated forests of the northern section of this system. From this sample, 225 measurements were then used to develop linear regression models based on their relationship with corresponding values derived from QuickBird very high resolution optical satellite data. Specifically, regression analyses of the in situ LAI with both the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the simple ration (SR) vegetation index revealed significant positive relationships [LAI versus NDVI (R (2) = 0.63); LAI versus SR (R (2) = 0.68)]. Moreover, using the remaining sample, further examination of standard errors and of an F test of the residual variances indicated little difference between the two models. Based on the NDVI model, a map of estimated mangrove LAI was then created. Excluding the dead mangrove areas (i.e. LAI = 0), which represented 40% of the total 30.4 km(2) of mangrove area identified in the scene, a mean estimated LAI value of 2.71 was recorded. By grouping the healthy fringe mangrove with the healthy riverine mangrove and by grouping the dwarf mangrove together with the poor condition mangrove, mean estimated LAI values of 4.66 and 2.39 were calculated, respectively. Given that the former healthy group only represents 8% of the total mangrove area examined, it is concluded that this mangrove system, considered one of the most important of the Pacific coast of the Americas, is currently experiencing a considerable state of degradation. Furthermore, based on the results of this investigation it is suggested that this approach could provide resource managers and scientists alike with a very rapid and effective method for monitoring the state of remaining mangrove forests of the Mexican Pacific and, possibly, other areas of the tropics.

Land Use Dynamics in a Marine Protected Area System in Lower Andaman Coast of Thailand, 1990-2005	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												This study has depicted a scenario on assessing spatial and temporal land use/cover changes in and adjacent to marine protected areas (MPA) in a study site in Thailand. The measurement of landscape stability and its implications for protection and conservation of coastal resources are emphasized in this study. The methods employed include interpretation and analysis of satellite images, aerial photographs, and geographic information system (GIS) data. Image analysis and GIS techniques have been used extensively, and a site-specific geospatial database was developed accordingly. Initial temporal changes inside and outside protected areas are captured from visual interpretation of three time series satellite images, where an increase of aquaculture ponds and abandoned areas is clearly visible. The output changes derived from the image differencing techniques demonstrated considerable changes in the whole study area as well as inside the protected area boundary during 1976 to 1990. Compared to the earlier time (1976-1990) the changes during 1990 to 2005 are found to be less extensive. Although the existing marine protected areas were declared earlier than the 1990s, the changes are still found inside the protected area boundary during 1990-2005. The result shows significant increases in agriculture areas, including aquaculture development, which are, however, less inside the protected areas than the buffer areas. While mangrove areas have noticeable negative changes, an increase in Malalueca forest areas is interesting. In the discussion, a quantitative comparison of legislative boundary and buffer effects on protecting land use and land cover is illustrated. In light of existing ecological context and socioeconomic activities, observations are made on agents of change and resource use conflicts.																	0749-0208					SEP	2009	25	5					1082	1095		10.2112/08-1058.1								WOS:000270369500002

Despite the ecological, environmental, and economic importance of mangroves, they are declining at an alarming rate worldwide, mostly as a result of human activities. 2. Along the eastern African coast, Mozambique has the largest mangrove area. Fishing and farming are the main economic activities in the area, and people harvest mangrove vegetation for tannins, fuel wood, traditional medicine, boat-building, carpentry, and crafting. 3. Landsat 5 TM imagery was used to map the distribution of trans-boundary mangrove areas along the Mtwara-Quirimbas Complex. Results for 1995 and 2005 are presented for the entire coastline and in more detail for the Ruvuma estuary, Quiterajo, Ibo/Quirimba islands, and Pemba Bay. Results were validated with a ground-truthing excursion in 2006, showing an overall thematic accuracy of 73%. 4. Total estimated area of mangrove was 357 km(2) in 1995 and 368 km(2) in 2005, with the small net gain of 3% corresponding to a total gain of 32 km(2) and a total loss of 21 km(2) over this decade. 5. Results suggest that although Landsat TM imagery can be effective in mapping mangrove distribution, caution must be used in inferring its ecological condition.

Natural and anthropogenic influences in the northeastern coast of the Nile delta, Egypt	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												Landsat enhanced thematic mapper imagery (ETM) of 2002 and aerial photography of 1955, combined with published charts and field observations were used to interpret coastal changes in the zone between Kitchener drain and Damietta spit in the northeastern Nile delta, previously recognized as a vulnerable zone to the effects of any sea level rise resulting from global warming. The interpretation resulted in recognition of several changes in nine identified geomorphological land types: beach and coastal flat, coastal dunes, agricultural deltaic land, sabkhas, fish farms, Manzala lagoon, saltpans, marshes and urban centers. Reclamation of vast areas of the coastal dunes and of Manzala lagoon added about 420 kmA(2) to the agricultural deltaic land. About 48 kmA(2) of backshore flats, marshes, salt pans and Manzala lagoon have been converted to productive fish farms. The main urban centers have expanded; nearly 12.1 km(2) have been added to their areas, and new urban centers (Damietta harbor and the New Damietta city) with total area reach of similar to 35.3 km(2) have been constructed at the expense of vast areas of Manzala lagoon, coastal dunes, and backshore flats. As a consequence of human activities, the size of Manzala lagoon has been reduced to more than 65%. Shoreline changes have been determined from beach profile survey (1990-2000), and comparison of 1955 aerial photographs and ETM satellite image of 2002 reveal alongshore patterns of erosion versus accretion. The short-term rate of shoreline retreat (1990-2000) has increased in the downdrift side of Damietta harbor (a parts per thousand integral 14 m/year), whereas areas of accretion exist within the embayment of Gamasa and in the shadow of Ras El Bar detached breakwaters system, with a maximum shoreline advance of similar to 15 m/year. A sandy spit, 12 km long, has developed southeast of Damietta promontory. These erosion/accretion patterns denote the natural processes of wave-induced longshore currents and sediment transport, in addition, the impact of man-made coastal protection structures.																	0943-0105					JUN	2009	57	7					1593	1602		10.1007/s00254-008-1434-6								WOS:000266140100012

A combinated approach to investigate the biochemistry and hydrography of a shallow bay in the South Adriatic Sea: the Gulf of Manfredonia (Italy)	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The main goal of this study is to understand the hydrological and biochemical set up and processes of a marine coastal area located in the western side of the south Adriatic sea (the gulf of Manfredonia) by the use of both satellite images and in situ investigations A water sampling in the gulf of Manfredonia was performed at 18 fixed stations in June 2003; physico-chemical and biological parameters (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and fluorescence) were measured along the water column and water samples were collected to analyse dissolved nutrients (ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate and silicate), total nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), chlorophyll a and total suspended solids. Surface spatial distributions of field collected data were examined to characterize biochemical and hydrographic conditions of the Gulf of Manfredonia and these results were related with the remote sensing analysis data. Remote sensed data (obtained by Landsat 7 TM and Modis Terra) were processed to obtain maps of chlorophyll a, temperature and optical characteristics of the gulf; these maps were compared to in situ data. From physico-chemical measurements no stratification was observed in the water column except for the south-eastern area. High concentrations of silicate and ammonia were observed in the northern zone of the gulf, while nitrate, phosphate, chlorophyll a and total suspended solids distributions showed higher values in the central coastal zone. These results were confirmed by remote sensing analysis; Modis elaboration showed a distribution with higher concentrations of chlorophyll a near the coast and Landsat images highlighted the extension of the surrounding agricultural areas crossed by the two main rivers which discharge into the gulf. The integration between field data with the remote sensing analysis showed to be a valid support in coastal zone management.

J	Wood, N				Wood, Nathan			Tsunami exposure estimation with land-cover data: Oregon and the Cascadia subduction zone	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												A Cascadia subduction-zone earthquake has the potential to generate tsunami waves which would impact more than 1000 km of coastline on the west coast of the United States and Canada. Although the predictable extent of tsunami inundation is similar for low-lying land throughout the region, human use of tsunami-prone land varies, creating variations in community exposure and potential impacts. To better understand such variations, land-cover information derived from midresolution remotely-sensed imagery (e.g., 30-m-resolution Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery) was coupled with tsunami-hazard information to describe tsunami-prone land along the Oregon coast. Land-cover data suggest that 95% of the tsunami-prone land in Oregon is undeveloped and is primarily wetlands and unconsolidated shores. Based on Spearman rank correlation coefficients (r(s)), correlative relationships are strong and statistically significant (p < 0.05) between city-level estimates of the amount of land-cover pixels classified as developed (impervious cover greater than 20%) and the amount of various societal assets, including residential and employee populations, homes, businesses, and tax-parcel values. Community exposure to tsunami hazards, described here by the amount and relative percentage of developed land in tsunami-prone areas, varies considerably among the 26 communities of the study area, and these variations relate to city size. Correlative relationships are strong and significant (p < 0.05) for community exposure rankings based on land-cover data and those based on aggregated socioeconomic data. In the absence of socioeconomic data or community-based knowledge, the integration of hazards information and land-cover information derived from midresolution remotely-sensed imagery to estimate community exposure may be a useful first step in understanding variations in community vulnerability to regional hazards.

This study carried out in parts of the coast of southwestern Nigeria utilized topographic base maps and two-time Landsat TM imageries to assess the trend in land cover changes and ecosystems degradation for the three time periods 1965, 1986 and 2001. Remote sensing, geographic information systems and landscape pattern analysis were employed for data processing and analysis. The focus of the analysis was on land cover change, land degradation, and changes in landscape pattern resulting from interplay of natural and anthropogenic drivers. The results show increased trend in human-induced land cover change with concomitant severe negative impacts on ecosystems and livelihoods. About 98,000ha (30% of the area) was seriously degraded as at 2001. About 33,000ha (10%) was under permanent saline water inundation with about 21 communities already dislocated. Loss of fragile ecosystems including marshland (from 7.7% in 1965 to 1% in 2001) and mangrove (from 14.6% in 1965 to 3.1% in 2001) was intense, while over 300 ponds/small lakes which are important for the local fishing economy have disappeared. About eighteen communities were also dislocated by erosion in a section around the southeastern parts of the coastline. Landscape metrics generated, suggested increased ecosystems perturbation and landscape fragmentation. The paper also discussed the implications of these rapid changes for ecosystems stability, food security and sustainable rural livelihoods in the area.																	0141-6707					MAR	2009	47						30	38		10.1111/j.1365-2028.2008.01047.x								WOS:000263035500006

Morphology and modern sedimentary deposits of the macrotidal Marapanim Estuary (Amazon, Brazil)	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The northern Brazilian coast, east of the Amazon River is characterized by several macrotidal estuarine systems that harbor large mangrove areas with approximately 7600 km(2). The Marapanim Estuary is influenced by macrotidal regime with moderate waves influence. Morphologic units were investigated by using remote sensing images (i.e., Landsat-7 ETM+, RADARSAT-1 Wide and SRTM) integrated with bathymetric data. The modern sedimentary deposits were analyzed from 67 cores collected by Vibracore and Rammkersonde systems. Analysis of morphology and surface sedimentary deposits of the Marapanim River reveal they are strongly influenced by the interaction of tidal, wave and fluvial currents. Based on these processes it was possible to recognize three distinct longitudinal facies zonation that revels the geological filling of a macrotidal estuary. The estuary mouth contain fine to medium marine sands strongly influenced by waves and tides, responsible for macrotidal sandy beaches and estuarine channel development, which are characterized by wave-ripple bedding and longitudinal cross-bedding sands. The estuary funnel is mainly influenced by tides that form wide tidal mudflats, colonized by mangroves, along the estuarine margin, with parallel laminations, lenticular bedding, root fragments and organic matter lenses. The upstream estuary contains coarse sand to gravel of fluvial origin. Massive mud with organic matter lenses, marks and roots fragments occur in the floodplain accumulates during seasonal flooding providing a slowly aggrading in the alluvial plain. This morphologic and depositional pattern show easily a tripartite zonation of a macrotidal estuary, that are in the final stage of filling. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Multi-Sensor Data Fusion for Geomorphological and Environmental Sensitivity Index Mapping in the Amazonian Mangrove Coast, Brazil	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					10th International Coastal Symposium (ICS 2009)	APR 13-18, 2009	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	Coastal Educ Res Fdn, Ctr Estud Geograf Planeament Reg, Univ Nova Lisbon, Fac Cienc Soc Humanas				This research emphasizes the potential of space-borne optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for coastal geomorphological and environmental sensitivity index (ESI) mapping for oil spill in the macrotidal Amazon Region. Optical (Landsat-5 TM) and SAR (RADARSAT-1 Wide 1) imageries were evaluated regarding geomorphological information content. Particular interest was placed on the Selective Principal Component-SAR (SPC-SAR) product, an alternative scheme for the fusion of TM bands with Wide Mode data through the combination of Principal Component and Intensity-Hue-Saturation Transforms. TM images have contributed to enhance vegetation and sedimentary environments based on the optical response, while Wide Mode data has allowed enhancing differences between inundation frequency and distinct moisture content. Results of this investigation have revealed significant geomorphological information with 12 units mapped in the study area. The lowest ESI was assigned to cliffs (ESI 1) and the highest was marsh and mangroves, respectively (ESI 10A, 10C). The SPC-SAR product represents a powerful toot for geomorphological mapping, providing relevant information about geobotany, emerge and submerge coastal geomorphology. An annual monitoring of both natural and human-induced changes would provide information for the construction of multi-temporal ESI maps to oil spills in different seasons and tidal cycles in the Amazon coastal zone.

Ecological Impacts of Hurricane Ivan on the Gulf Coast of Alabama: A Remote Sensing Study	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					10th International Coastal Symposium (ICS 2009)	APR 13-18, 2009	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	Coastal Educ Res Fdn, Ctr Estud Geograf Planeament Reg, Univ Nova Lisbon, Fac Cienc Soc Humanas				Hurricane Ivan made landfall near Gulf Shores, Alabama, as a category 3 storm in 2004, causing a storm surge of > 3.0 m and massive tree mortality in the forest around the Shelby Lakes in Gulf State Park. We documented the ecological impacts of Hurricane Ivan by means of remote sensing techniques using Landsat 5 images, coupled with a ground survey of tree mortality and damage patterns. NDVI-based land cover classifications of pre- and post-Ivan images reveal that 44% of the forest in the study area was killed or heavily damaged by the storm. Ground survey data suggest that the belt delineated as dead or highly damaged vegetation is characterized by low elevations (< 3 m) and high tree mortality (50-100% dead trees); whereas forested areas occurring on higher grounds (> 3 m elevation) suffered lower (< 50%) tree mortality. The damage pattern strongly suggests that saltwater intrusion and storm surge flooding, rather than wind damage, was the main cause for massive tree mortality around the Shelby Lakes. Results from this study are useful for interpreting the proxy records and informing ongoing paleotempestological investigations in coastal Alabama.

A new glacier inventory for the Svartisen region, Norway, from Landsat ETM plus data: challenges and change assessment	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Glaciers are widely recognized as key indicators of climate change, and their meltwater plays an important role in hydropower production in Norway. Since the last glacier inventory was compiled in northern Norway in the 1970s, marked fluctuations in glacier length and mass balance have been reported for individual glaciers, and the current overall glacier state is thus not well known. Within the framework of the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) initiative, we have created a new inventory for 489 glaciers in the Svartisen region, northern Norway, using a Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite scene from 7 September 1999 and automated multispectral glacier mapping (thresholded band ratios). In addition, visual inspection and correction of the generated glacier outlines has been applied. Adverse snow conditions and uncertain drainage divides made glacier mapping challenging in some regions of the study site. Glacier outlines from 1968, as digitized from a topographic map, were used for a quantitative change assessment for a selection of 300 glaciers. The overall area change of this sample from 1968 to 1999 was close to zero, but with a strongly increasing scatter towards smaller glaciers, large area gains (> 50%) for small glaciers (< 1 km(2)), and an unexpected stronger relative area loss towards the wetter coast. The overall size changes are small (< 1%) for the three largest ice masses in the study region (Vestisen, Ostisen and Blamannsisen).																	0022-1430						2009	55	192					607	618		10.3189/002214309789471003								WOS:000270415200003

German; Lefsky, Michael			The Relative Impact of Harvest and Fire upon Landscape-Level Dynamics of Older Forests: Lessons from the Northwest Forest Plan	ECOSYSTEMS												Interest in preserving older forests at the landscape level has increased in many regions, including the Pacific Northwest of the United States. The Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) of 1994 initiated a significant reduction in the harvesting of older forests on federal land. We used historical satellite imagery to assess the effect of this reduction in relation to: past harvest rates, management of non-federal forests, and the growing role of fire. Harvest rates in non-federal large-diameter forests (LDF) either decreased or remained stable at relatively high rates following the NWFP, meaning that harvest reductions on federal forests, which cover half of the region, resulted in a significant regional drop in the loss of LDF to harvest. However, increased losses of LDF to fire outweighed reductions in LDF harvest across large areas of the region. Elevated fire levels in the western United States have been correlated to changing climatic conditions, and if recent fire patterns persist, preservation of older forests in dry ecosystems will depend upon practical and coordinated fire management across the landscape.

J	Reis, S; Yilmaz, HM				Reis, Selcuk; Yilmaz, Haci Murat			Temporal monitoring of water level changes in Seyfe Lake using remote sensing	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The Earth's water resources are endangered by inconsiderate use, pollution and lack of conservation measures. Temporal monitoring is necessary for the conservation and usage planning of water resources, and to make informed decisions. Seyfe Lake and its environs in Turkey is one of, the most important water basins in the world because it is a node on bird migration paths between Europe, Asia and Africa. for this reason, the International Council of Bird Preservation (ICBP) has registered 27 of the bird species living, at Seyfe Lake on the conservation list. In this work, the temporal changes in the water surface area of Seyfe Lake and its environs, which are important for ecological, historical and tourism reasons, are investigated. The change of water surface in the lake is examined over a 26 year period using satellite images taken between 1975 and 2001. Landsat images from years 1975, 1987 and 2001 are used. The change is tracked from the images using an unsupervised classification method. A decrease of slightly more than 33% was observed in the water surface area this 26 year period. The temporal change indicated by the images was compared with the related meteorological data between 1975 and 2001. Over this time period, climate conditions (rainfall, temperature and evaporation) in the study area have been changed by approximately 21%. These changes could have affected the Lake surface area, but also could external human interference around the Lake. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Wang, FG; Xu, YJ				Wang, Fugui; Xu, Y. Jun			Development and application of a remote sensing-based salinity prediction model for a large estuarine lake in the US Gulf of Mexico coast	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Salinity in estuaries is highly variable due to river discharge, tidal motion, and winds. Information on the spatial and temporal changes in salinity can provide important ecological indications, but accurate monitoring of the space-time variability for a large estuary is often costly and time-consuming. This study applied remote sensing techniques to develop a salinity prediction model for Lake Pontchartrain, a large estuarine take located in the Northern Gulf of Mexico, USA. "Ground truth" salinity was measured along two transects across the take and near the shoreline. Water-leaving reflectance from the measurement locations was extracted from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images preprocessed through "banding" noise reduction and radiometrical correction approaches. Ordinary least square and ridge regression methods were performed to identify model parameters and to determine relationships between salinity and reflectance. Salinity in the take on eight dates was predicted with the developed model. Difference in salinity level and patterns, and impacts of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on salinity were assessed with ANOVA and Fuzzy Similarity methods. The results showed that the mode achieved a high power in prediction of the take salinity (R-2 = 0.89 and RMSE of validation = 0.27). Reflectance from TM bands 1, 2, and 4 was positively correlated to salinity levels and explained 1.9%, 20.3%, and 10.2% variance in salinity levels. Reflectance from bands 3 and 5 was negatively correlated to salinity and explained 34.1% and 31.2% variance. Under normal circumstances without the impacts of hurricanes, the take salinity presented two patterns with average salinity level of 5.5 ppt. After Katrina's landfall, the average was significantly increased by 1.1 ppt and the spatial patterns were altered. The pattern on 30 August 2005 was the most dissimilar one as compared to the two normal patterns, and then followed by the patterns on 9 and 25 October, and 7 September 2005. This study demonstrated that satellite remote sensing techniques can be applied to monitor salinity in coastal environments, and that freshwater discharge not only affects salinity levels and patterns under normal conditions but also is crucial for the return of salinity patterns to normal conditions after hurricane disturbance.

In this study we aimed at quantifying the effects of vegetation cover and topography on surface roughness over a stabilizing dune field on the southern coast of Israel. Forty-six wind measurements were made at various distances from the coastline, ranging from 10 to 2800 m, and z(0). values were calculated from the wind measurements; based on the ratio between the wind gust and the average wind speed. We estimated vegetation cover using the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) from Landsat satellite images for the upwind sector at various lengths, ranging from 15 to 400 m, and based on digital elevation models and differential GPS field measurements we calculated the topographic variable of the relative heights of the stations. z(0) values were positively correlated with the winter SAVI values (r = 0.87 at an upwind length of 200 m) and negatively correlated with the relative height (r = -0.68 at an upwind length of 200-400 in for the inland dune stations). Using these variables we were able to create a map of estimated z(0) values having an accuracy of over 64%. Such maps provide a better understanding of the spatial variability in both wind speed and sand movement over coastal dune areas. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study was combined with detailed sedimentologic analysis of continuous cores, which provided a record of depositional settings developed in this area through the Holocene. The results revealed well-preserved, meandering to anastomosed drainage networks of wide palaeochannels that were superimposed by a narrower palaeochannel system. In both cases, the sedimentary record consists of sands, heterolithic deposits and muds, locally rich in plant debris. The strata are organized into fining upward successions that reach approximately 18 m thick in the wide channels and 4 m thick in the narrow channels. Sedimentary features suggestive of a coastal location for the wider palaeochannels and reworking of sediments by tidal currents include the prevalence of well to moderately sorted, rounded to sub-rounded, fine- to medium-grained sands displaying foreset packages separated by mud couplets, suggestive of tidal cycles. The data presented herein point to a rise in relative sea level reaching the Lake Arari area during the early to late/mid Holocene. This event was followed by a relative sea level drop. Tectonics seem to have contributed to an overall lowering in relative sea level in the study area since the mid-Holocene, which does not follow the same pattern recorded in other areas along the northern Brazilian coast.

The data were geometrically rectified to a standard geographical grid and brightness values were converted to reflectance through radiometric correction. Sea-truth data, collected in the field within 6 hours before/after the time of the satellite overpass, were used to derive empirical algorithms for chlorophyll-a concentration, Secchi disk depth and turbidity. Then, maps of the distribution of the selected water quality parameters were generated for the entire area of interest, and compared with analogous results obtained from SeaWiFS data. The maps indicate that the Tripoli coastal area is exposed to moderate cutrophic conditions, along most of its shoreline (in particular along the northern stretch), in correspondence with fluvial and wastewater runoff sources. The Landsat 7 ETM+ data proved useful for the intended application, and will be used to start a national database on water quality in the Lebanese coastal environment.

On extracting the waterlines, we considered the tidal flat environments, such as tidal conditions, remnant surface water, suspended sediment, and exposure time. Ground levelling was carried out along one line in 1991, and two lines in 2000. From the extracted waterlines and ground levelling data, we succeeded in generating intertidal DEMs with an accuracy of 10.9 cm r.m.s. overall, and 7.3 cm r.m.s. in the lower tidal flats. The morphologic changes estimated by subtracting the two DEMs showed an erosion rate of -9.0 cm over 9 yr that corresponds to an annual mean morphologic change budget of -309,865 m(3)/yr. Overall, the Gomso tidal flats can be defined as an erosion-dominant environment. The changes with respect to the sedimentary facies were also evaluated as: (a) the sandy silt flat had a sedimentation rate of -3.4 cm over 9 yr that corresponds to an annual mean budget of -52,552 m(3)/yr; (b) the silty sand flat had a sedimentation rate of - 14.3 cm over 9 yr that corresponds to a mean erosion of - 197,927 m(3)/yr; and (c) the sand flat had a sedimentation rate of - 11.8 cm over 9 yr that corresponds to a mean change of -58,808 m(3)/yr. The results comply with the general rules of sedimentology. We also investigated the chenier migration, which is the most dynamic geomorphologic change in the tidal flats. Chenier is usually composed by sand and shell as a result of coastal progradation in sand, and it is dominantly fed by sediments transported by long-shore currents. The chenier was found to have migrated about 148 m landward over 6 yr. The results demonstrate that satellite remote sensing is an efficient and effective tool for a long-term morphologic change estimation in tidal flats. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Lajeunesse, P				Lajeunesse, Patrick			Early Holocene deglaciation of the eastern coast of Hudson Bay	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The final stage of deglaciation of Hudson Bay was a major Holocene catastrophic event marked by the drainage of Lake Agassiz/Ojibway at similar to 8.47 ka cal BP and the rapid collapse of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Previous work undertaken in the Nastapoka River area (eastern Hudson Bay) demonstrated that during the relative sea level highstand that shortly followed the drainage of the lake, the western margin of the Quebec-Labrador ice sector rapidly retreated eastward to reach a stillstand position in a coastal hill range. In this study, an analysis of Landsat 7TM images has allowed a mapping of large-scale glacial landforms (outwash deposits, eskers, flutings, and De Geer and Rogen moraines) between Kuujjuaraapik (SE Hudson Bay) and Puvirnituq (NE Hudson Bay). The key results from this mapping are: i) ice-contact outwash deposits mapped along the entire arc-shaped coastline of the eastern Hudson Bay outline a major ice stillstand phase in the coastal bills that extended at least from Kuujjuaraapik to Inukjuak. The presence of these bills allowed a stabilisation of the ice margin that led to the accumulation of thick and extensive ice-contact submarine fans. ii) The position of these deposits on the down ice side (west) of large sets of flutings indicates an important phase of sediment delivery by a rapid ice flow phase toward a marine-based ice margin. iii) A second system of outwash deposits observed farther inland indicates a subsequent phase of stabilisation of the ice margin during its retreat toward central Quebec-Labrador.

Landscape-scale extent, height, biomass, and carbon estimation of Mozambique's mangrove forests with Landsat ETM+ and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission elevation data	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Mangroves are salt tolerant plants that grow within the intertidal zone along tropical and subtropical coasts. They are important barriers for mitigating coastal disturbances, provide habitat for over 1300 animal species and are one of the most productive ecosystems. Mozambique's mangroves extend along 2700 km and cover one of the largest areas in Africa. The purpose of this study was to determine the countrywide mean tree height spatial distribution and biomass of Mozambique's mangrove forests using Landsat ETM+ and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data. The SRTM data were calibrated using the Landsat derived land-cover map and height calibration equations. Stand-specific canopy height-biomass allometric equations developed from field measurements and published height-biomass equations were used to calculate aboveground biomass of the mangrove forests on a landscape scale. The results showed that mangrove forests covered a total of 2909 km 2 in Mozambique, a 27% smaller area than previously estimated. The SRTM calibration indicated that average tree heights changed with geographical settings. Even though the coast of Mozambique spans across 16 degrees latitude, we did not find a relationship between latitude and biomass. These results confirm that geological setting has a greater influence than latitude alone on mangrove production. The total mangrove dry aboveground biomass in Mozambique was 23.6 million tons and the total carbon was 11.8 million tons.

J	Staben, GW; Evans, KG				Staben, Grant W.; Evans, Kenneth G.			Estimates of tree canopy loss as a result of Cyclone Monica, in the Magela Creek catchment northern Australia	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Severe tropical Cyclone Monica impacted the coast of northern Australia in April 2006 with estimated maximum wind gusts of 360 km h(-1). It rapidly moved inland losing intensity and passed over the town of Jabiru as a category 2 system, with maximum wind gusts recorded at 135 km h(-1). The cyclone had a significant impact on the landscapes within the Alligator Rivers Region and significant windthrow of trees occurred. This paper describes the level of impact that category 2 level winds had on tree canopy loss 10 days after cyclone and then again 1 year later. Recovery was assessed using multispectral satellite imagery in sub-catchments of the Magela Creek catchments. A non-linear relationship was fitted between a modified vegetation index (derived from Landsat TM5 satellite data) and percentage tree canopy cover (measured from very high resolution QuickBird satellite data). The results of the non-linear relationship, used to estimate percentage canopy cover, indicate that 10 days after cyclone, there was significant disturbance to tree canopy. However, data 1 year after cyclone show that recovery of canopy across the studied catchments varied between 8% and 19% of the percentage canopy cover that remained after the initial impact of the cyclone. Further analysis in the three sub-catchments using Geographical Information System showed that proportionally, riparian zones and inundated areas in each of the sub-catchments suffered greater loss of tree canopy cover compared with upland areas.

J	Kelly, JP; Stralberg, D; Etienne, K; McCaustland, M				Kelly, John P.; Stralberg, Diana; Etienne, Katie; McCaustland, Mark			Landscape influence on the quality of heron and egret colony sites	WETLANDS												We evaluated landscape associations related to heron and egret colony site selection and the productivity of successful great blue heron (Ardea herodias) and great egret (Ardea alba) nests. The study was based on annual observations (1991-2005) at 45 colony sites known to be active within 10 km of historic tidal marshes of northern San Francisco Bay. The analyses focused on a priori models analyzed within 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 km of colony sites, using the areal extents of several NOAA land cover types (Landsat images, 2000-2002), number of wetland patches, and total wetland edge as predictor variables. A comparison of landscape characteristics surrounding colony sites with those surrounding randomly selected, unoccupied sites revealed the primary importance of estuarine emergent wetland and open water within 1 km of colony sites. Increased productivity in successful great blue heron nests was associated with more estuarine emergent wetland, open water, and low-intensity development, and less grassland, but was not differentially related to the extent of habitat available within any particular distance from colony sites. The productivity in successful great egret nests was associated with variation in habitat extent at larger spatial scales, especially within 10 km of heronies, with nests producing more young at sites surrounded by more estuarine emergent wetland and low-intensity development, less open water and palustrine emergent wetland, and more patches of wetland habitat. To estimate landscape foraging patterns, we used aircraft to track the flights of great egrets departing from heronries and used the observed flight distances, colony sizes, and the regional distribution of wetland habitat to model regional foraging densities. Results Suggested that increasing the extent of wetland feeding areas for herons and egrets might improve reproductive performance in colony sites up to 10 km away, increase foraging by herons and egrets in created or restored wetlands within 3-10 km of sites, and enhance nest abundance at colony sites within 1 km of restoration sites. Regional maps based on the distribution of colony-sites and predictions of landscape influences on colony site selection, nest productivity, and foraging dispersion, suggested areas potentially suitable for colonization.

Estimating stand structural details using nearest neighbor analyses to link ground data, forest cover maps, and Landsat imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Forest information over a landscape is often represented as a spatial mosaic of polygons, separated by differences in species composition, height, age, crown closure, productivity, and other variables. These polygons are commonly delineated on medium-scale photography (e.g., 1: 15,000) by a photo-interpreter familiar with the inventory area, and displayed and stored in a Geographic Information System (GIS) layer as a forest cover map. Forest cover maps are used for multiple purposes including timber and habitat supply analyses, and carbon inventories, at a regional or management unit level, and for parks planning, operational planning, and selection of stands for many purposes at a local level. Attribute data for each polygon commonly include the variables used to delineate the polygon, and other variables that can be measured or estimated using these medium-scale photographs. Additional measures that can only be obtained via expensive ground measures or possibly on high resolution photographs (e.g., volume per unit area, biomass components per unit area, tree-list of species and diameters) are available only for a sample of polygons, or may have been gathered independently using a sample survey over the land area. Improved linkages over a variety of data sources may help to support landscape level analyses. This study presents an approach to combine information from a systematic (grid) ground survey, forest cover (polygon) data, and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery using variable-space nearest neighbor methods to 3 estimate (i) mean ground-measured attributes for each polygon, in particular, volume per ha (M-3/ha), stems per ha, and quadratic mean diameter for each polygon; and (ii) variation of these ground attributes within polygons. The approach was initially evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations with known measures of these attributes. Nearest neighbor methods were then applied to an approximate 5000 ha area (about 1000 polygons) of high productivity, mountainous forests located near the Pacific Coast of British Columbia, Canada. Based on the simulation results, the use of Landsat pixel reflectances to estimate volume per ha, average tree size (i.e., quadratic mean diameter), and stems per ha did not show great promise in improving estimates for each polygon over using forest cover data alone. However, in application, the use of remotely sensed data provided estimates of within-polygon variability. At the same time, the estimated means of these three imputed variables over the entire study area were very similar to the representative sample estimates using the ground data only. Extensions to other variables such as ranges of diameters and numbers of snags may also be possible providing useful data for habitat and forest growth analysis. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Estimating the population size of an endangered shorebird, the Madagascar plover, using a habitat suitability model	ANIMAL CONSERVATION												The Madagascar plover Charadrius thoracicus is a shorebird endemic to western Madagascar, currently classified as globally vulnerable. It is restricted to specialized wetland habitats that are increasingly threatened by humans. To inform future conservation measures for this poorly known species, we develop a predictive habitat suitability map and use this map to estimate the size of the Madagascar plover population. We integrate spatially referenced presence-only observations of Madagascar plovers with Landsat data, elevation data and measures of distance to settlements and the coast to produce a habitat suitability model using ecological niche factor analysis. Validation of this model using a receiver operating characteristic plot suggests that it is at least 84% accurate in predicting suitable sites. We then use our estimate of total area of suitable habitat above a critical suitability threshold and data on Madagascar plover density in suitable sites to estimate the total population size to derive a total population estimate of 3100 +/- 396 standard error individuals. Finally, we explore the conservation applications of our model.

Assessment of landscape changes in the Kizilirmak Delta, Turkey, using remotely sensed data and GIS	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												In this study, an integrated approach of remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) was used to investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of the Kizilirmak Delta. It is a major wetland complex on the Black Sea coast, which has a very rich biodiversity and critical habitat for globally endangered bird species, and was announced as an RAMSAR protection site in Turkey. Main objectives of this study were: (1) determination of the land use/cover changes, (2) examination of the effects of these changes on environment, and (3) assessment of the human impacts on the environment. 1987 Landsat TM and 2004 Aster images, topographic maps, field survey, and other ancillary data have been used to perform the study objectives. The obtained results delineated that the Kizilirmak Delta has been considerably changed as a result of human activities between 1987 and 2004. Analysis of satellite images and other data sources in the GIS environment introduced the changes in the delta and their impacts on the environment.

Sand dune activity in north-eastern Patagonia	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The Valdes Peninsula has the most noticeable aeolian landforms of the Patagonian drylands. The southern sector of the peninsula is affected by the advance of several fronts of active sand dunes grouped in discrete megapatches. The objectives of the study were to: (1) analyse the morphology of sand dunes, and (2) measure the migration rates and orientation of the sand dunes along a 33-year period (1969-2002). These studies used a series of field techniques in conjunction with aerial photography and satellite data, such as AVIRIS and Landsat imagery. Four main types of active sand dune forms were identified: (1) compound linear; (2) compound transverse; (3) compound dome-shaped; and (4) complex dome-shaped. Because of the windy climate, dune mobility is high; there is an eastward migration to an average speed of 9.1 +/- 2.7 m yr(-1). Despite this high rate and since observed changes in the total area of active dunes were small, active processes of vegetation encroachment are deducible. Thus, wind and effective rainfall appear as the main factors regulating the process, in short and long-term, respectively. Although the orientation and disposition of the dunefields is in agreement with the prevailing west winds, the active dunes present a variety of forms, which reflect local variations in the wind flow. The circulation is strongly influenced by the shape of the coastline and the actual existence of the dunefields is due to this friable windward coast found nowhere else in Patagonia.

J	Giri, C; Muhlhausen, J				Giri, Chandra; Muhlhausen, Joseph			Mangrove forest distributions and dynamics in Madagascar (1975-2005)	SENSORS												Mangrove forests of Madagascar are declining, albeit at a much slower rate than the global average. The forests are declining due to conversion to other land uses and forest degradation. However, accurate and reliable information on their present distribution and their rates, causes, and consequences of change have not been available. Earlier studies used remotely sensed data to map and, in some cases, to monitor mangrove forests at a local scale. Nonetheless, a comprehensive national assessment and synthesis was lacking. We interpreted time-series satellite data of 1975, 1990, 2000, and 2005 using a hybrid supervised and unsupervised classification approach. Landsat data were geometrically corrected to an accuracy of +/- one-half pixel, an accuracy necessary for change analysis. We used a postclassification change detection approach. Our results showed that Madagascar lost 7% of mangrove forests from 1975 to 2005, to a present extent of similar to 2,797 km(2). Deforestation rates and causes varied both spatially and temporally. The forests increased by 5.6% ( 212 km(2)) from 1975 to 1990, decreased by 14.3% ( 455 km(2)) from 1990 to 2000, and decreased by 2.6% ( 73 km(2)) from 2000 to 2005. Similarly, major changes occurred in Bombekota Bay, Mahajamba Bay, the coast of Ambanja, the Tsiribihina River, and Cap St Vincent. The main factors responsible for mangrove deforestation include conversion to agriculture ( 35%), logging ( 16%), conversion to aquaculture ( 3%), and urban development ( 1%).																	1424-8220					APR	2008	8	4					2104	2117		10.3390/s8042104								WOS:000256642400003	27879812

The Absence of environmental planning in the process of land use development may cause many significant negative impacts on biodiversity, ecological value, and the general environmental conditions, and therefore, reducing such negative impacts will improve land use development. The first part of this sequel of two papers, which is part of a sustainable land use development research program, aims at designing a spatial framework to improve land use planning and development in an environmental context. The research program deals with the problem of land use planning and development in an and coastal area under environmentally sensitive conditions. The study area is El-Daba'a region, located in the northwestern coast of Egypt, which can be described as a wild area. The approach used in this paper consists of studying the spatial ecological characteristics of El-Daba'a region using different spatial data including maps and Landsat remote sensing data. These data are used to create a series of superimposed informative layers managed by a geographic information system (GIS) to describe the spatial ecological characteristics of the study area. The developed GIS allows decision makers to handle large amounts of information simultaneously such as geology, geomorphology, land cover, wild life and many other different information layers. The system is designed to help decision makers to organize, relate, analyze, and visualize the ecological data and information in the study area. The developed GIS system might be used to determine the probable effects of building a nuclear power station on the ecosystem.																	1015-4442					MAR-JUN	2008	26	1-2					95	106										WOS:000260151400010						
J	Zouzias, D; Seymour, KS				Zouzias, Dimitris; Seymour, Karen St.			Consanguineous geochemistry of the Kos Plateau and Tilos D and E Pumices, Aegean Volcanic Arc, Hellas	NEUES JAHRBUCH FUR MINERALOGIE-ABHANDLUNGEN												Twenty pumice samples from the D and E ignimbrite units of Kos Plateau and Tilos Tuffs have been analyzed for major and 37 trace elements, including 14 Rare Earth elements to provide evidence for their geochemical insignia. Tilos island lies roughly 50 km from Kos and the identity of these two tuffs has been previously established in the literature on physical volcanology arguments (ALLEN 2001). Kos and Tilos tuff samples form a cluster of calcalkaline rhyolites transgressing the peraluminous-metaluminous boundary in ACNK-ANK space. Both pumices display well-defined partly overlapping trends, with D samples being more evolved than E, on variation diagrams for major elements, alkali earths (Ba, Rb, Sr), immobile (Zr, Y), compatible (V), highly incompatible (Pb, Th) and hygromagmatophile (Sb) trace elements. It has been suggested by ALLEN (2001) that the KPT has been erupted 161 Ka ago (SMITH et al. 1996) ago, from a superstructure now outlined by the remains of a similar to 16 km caldera which is mostly submarine. Pyroclastic density currents traveled either on land (PE-PIPER et al. 2005), or crossed open sea (BOHLA 1987, ALLEN 200 1) and deposited tuffs on Tilos, Kalymnos, on the coasts of Asian Minor and other islands in the area. The apron of this ash has traveled 300 km to the south and is thought to be equivalent with the W-3 submarine tephra layer (FEDERMAN & CAREY 1980, KELLER 1980, VINCI 1985). Our studies using Landsat-TM remotely sensed imagery, subaqueous distribution of hydrothermal vents and tectonic data of ring and radial faults collected on land, has indicated a caldera superstructure very similar to that proposed by ALLEN (2001) which "nests" smaller caldera-depressions (Kefalos, Zini, Yali, Perigusa-Pachia) or has them attached as "satellite" (Nisyros caldera) structures (ST. SEYMOUR et al. 2006). It has been proposed that these calderas represent the physical expression of interconnected magma chambers (ST. SEYMOUR 1996), satellites to a larger, active subvolcanic chamber underlying the area between Kos and Nisyros (PAPADOPOULOS et al. 1998, LAGIOS et al. 2005).																	0077-7757					MAR	2008	184	3					231	241		10.1127/0077-7757/2008/0093								WOS:000254777700001

Tundra lake changes from 1978 to 2001 on the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula, western Canadian Arctic	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Landsat scenes spanning 1978-2001 were used to classify thermokarst lake area and determine changes in lake coverage on the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula in northwestern Canada. Changes in total lake area between scenes were substantial, spanning a 14% increase and 11% decrease, mostly owing to changes in the area of lakes > 1.3 km(2) in area. Increases in total lake area occurred primarily between 1978-1992, and decreases between 1992-2001. Differences in total lake area between scenes from different years depend strongly on cumulative precipitation in the 12 month period preceding scene acquisition (r(2) = 0.82), and not on summer or mean annual air temperature (MAAT). Our results indicate that precipitation is the primary factor influencing the areal extent of lakes as detected by remote sensing. On the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula, persistent lake area changes (if any) such as might occur by regional warming or changes in evaporation/precipitation balance over decades, are well-masked by short-term climatological changes.																	0094-8276					FEB 5	2008	35	3							L03502	10.1029/2007GL032303								WOS:000253063400005

It mainly affects the coastal zone adjacent to areas of dense population. To detect the sources of pollution along this zone as well as to identify their characteristics, remote sensing data was used. Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite images, which have high spatial resolution, were analyzed using different types of software for discriminating polluted water in the marine environment. Different optical and digital advantages in these programs were applied to reveal anomalous features on satellite images. Subsequently, the identified features of pollution were verified in the field with bacterial analysis conducted at selected sites. Results showed 82 major, permanent sources of pollution (termed hotspots) along the Lebanese coast. More than 73% of these sources are attributed to discharges from wastewater, chemicals, and oil residues.																	1527-5922						2008	9	2-3					205	214		10.1080/15275920802122296								WOS:000257013900012

The coastal zone in this direction has considerably changed due to open mining activities since 1980. Forest areas and sand dunes have been destroyed by open mining activities performed due to lack of environmental precautions. As a result of filling of the sea with materials extracted from open mining areas, ecosystem and topographic structure were totally damaged. In this study, the coastal changes that occurred in the selected region being under the influence of human-induced activities and coastal erosion along, the West Black Sea Coast of Turkey in the vicinity of Istanbul are analyzed by using the surface profiles generated through utilizing Landsat satellite images belonging to various years, to-ether with bathymetric and Standard topographic maps of scale 1/25 000. The findings are investigated in detail for each transect, and, consequently, it has become clear that severe changes have occurred within 1984 and 2001. The sea had been filled with the excavated material from the open mining areas from 1984 till 1992, however, the trend reversed afterwards till 2001. That coastal erosion had been highly experienced, and materials filled in the sea environment had been lost.

Monitoring geomorphologic changes using Landsat TM and ETM+ data in the Hendijan River delta, southwest Iran	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Beach and delta areas are dynamic physical features with changes occurring at many spatial and temporal scales due to both general and catastrophic events. Geomorphic changes such as temporal and periodic changes in riverbeds and coasts are common events in all deltaic areas. The Hendijan river basin is located in the southwest of Iran, close to the city of the Hendijan and many villages and rural settlements. Changes in various geomorphic features, such as riverbed and shoreline migration, Sebkhas, alluvial terraces, meanders and old, dry rivers over 48 years of time, were detected and identified using Landsat TM and ETM satellite data and topographic maps. Simple bands subtraction, principal component analysis (PCA) and fuzzy logic were used to identify regions that have undergone land cover change. Results of this study show that the Hendijan River channel has migrated several times over the last 48 years. Several meanders and ox-bow lakes remain as a result of migration. The shoreline has migrated over 4km into the Persian Gulf. The resulting maps can be used in an integrated coastal zone information system as it has been proposed for the Heddijan delta.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2008	29	4					945	959		10.1080/01431160701294679								WOS:000252347000001

Detecting date palm trees health and vegetation greenness change on the eastern coast of the United Arab Emirates using SAVI	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Due to shortage of fresh water resources, the vegetation of the eastern region of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has experienced a series of declines resulting from salinization of groundwater, which is the major source of irrigation. To assess these changes, field measurements combined with Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) based Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) were analysed. TM and ETM+ images from two dates, 1987 and 2000 were acquired to enable the computation of the greenness anomalies for three sites in the eastern region, Fujairah, Kalba and Hatta. The results show an overall increase in agricultural area, associated with a severe decrease in vegetation greenness and health conditions, particularly in the Kalba study area. The SAVI values decreased with increased soil salinity, permitting the identification of salt-affected areas. This remotely sensed data offered valuable information regarding vegetation health conditions, especially when using greenness indices. However, in open canopies, like date palm trees, soil line indices, such as, SAVI are more robust, since they account for the contribution of the soil background. This research suggests, that in order for the date palm trees of this region to stay productive, considerable attention needs to be placed in managing and monitoring soil salinity conditions and progress. Potential areas of further research range from studying the effects of tree spacing and understory crops as immediate and potential solutions to maintain productivity and mitigate the salinity problem.																	0143-1161						2008	29	6					1745	1765		10.1080/01431160701395195								WOS:000253654800010

The first objective of this paper is to present high-resolution ice-surface elevation maps derived from GLAS data, using geostatistical analysis. In a regional study of Walgreen Coast and Northern Ellsworth Land, West Antarctica, differences in the representation of geographic and morphologic features in maps based on ERS-1 radar altimeter data and on GLAS data are investigated, with the result that in particular in topographically complex coastal areas and the margin of the ice sheet the improvement in precision and accuracy of the laser altimeter is significant. A second, applied objective is to map elevation changes in Pine Island Glacier, a glacier that plays a key role in the question of stability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and has been changing rapidly in recent years. Results of elevation differencing of 2003-GLAS-data and 1995-ERS-1-radar-altimeter-data DEMs (1) show that thinning rates have been increasing and (2) are applied to attribute the observed changes in Pine Island Glacier to internal processes in the glacier, related to dynamic thinning. More generally, this application serves to demonstrate that GLAS data facilitate study of cryospheric change.																	0143-1161						2008	29	19					5533	5553		10.1080/01431160802020510								WOS:000259366200006

Multitemporal assessment of the geomorphologic evolution of the Restinga of Marambaia, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The Restinga of Marambaia is an emerged sand bar located between the Sepetiba Bay and the South Atlantic Ocean, on the south-east coast of Brazil. The objective of this study was to observe the geomorphologic evolution of the coastal zone of the Restinga of Marambaia using multitemporal satellite images acquired by multisensors from 1975 to 2004. The images were digitally segmented by a region growth algorithm and submitted to an unsupervised classification procedure (ISOSEG) followed by a raster edit based on visual interpretation. The image time-series showed a general trend of decrease in the total sand bar area with values varying from 80.61km(2) in 1975 to 78.15km(2) in 2004. The total area calculation based on the 1975 and 1978 Landsat MSS data was shown to be super-estimated in relation to the Landsat TM, Landsat ETM+, and CBERS-2 CCD data. These differences can also be associated to the relatively poorer spatial resolution of the MSS data, nominally 79m, against the 20m of the CCD data and 30m of the TM and ETM+ data. For the estimates of the width in the central portion of the sand bar the variation was from 158m (1975) to 100m (2004). The formation of a spit in the northern region of the study area was visually observed. The area of the spit was estimated, with values varying from 0.82km(2) (1975) to 0.55km(2) (2004).

Statistical techniques for correlating total suspended matter concentration with seawater reflectance using multispectral satellite data	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The transport and distribution of sediments driven by mechanisms such as tides and waves, river discharges, wind stress, and turbidity currents and the sediment transport effects can be studied by remote sensing techniques. The study of total suspended matter concentration has ecological importance since it is the main carrier of various inorganic and organic processes. The main objective of this work was to evaluate the performance of different statistical methodologies in the estimation of total suspended matter concentration, in the breaking zone and in its adjacent area, using multispectral satellite images from TERRA/ASTER, SPOT/HRVIR, and Landsat/TM. These images cover a particular area of the northwest coast of Portugal. The relationship between the total suspended matter concentration and the spectral response of the seawater, in the visible and near-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, was quantified through simulations on different beaches of the study area. Seven images of TERRA/ASTER, SPOT/HRVIR, and Landsat/TM sensors were calibrated and atmospherically and geometrically corrected. Linear single-band models, linear multiple regressions, and artificial neural networks were applied to the visible and near-infrared bands of these sensors in order to estimate the total suspended matter concentration. Statistical analysis using determination coefficients and error estimation was employed, aiming to evaluate the most accurate approach in the estimation of total suspended matter concentration. The analysis of the root-mean-square error achieved by both linear and nonlinear models supports the hypothesis that the relationship between seawater reflectance and total suspended matter concentration is clearly nonlinear. Artificial neural networks have been shown to be useful in estimating the total suspended matter concentration from reflectance of visible and near-infrared bands with images of ASTER, HRVIR, and TM sensors, with better results for ASTER and HRVIR sensors. The artificial neural network approach was further applied to the seven processed images, and maps of total suspended matter concentration for all satellite images processed were produced.

The performance of satellite images in mapping aquacultures	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Monitoring human pressures is the first step in the management of natural ecosystems, as well as a method to evaluate the effectiveness of the applied conservation measures. In this context, five commercial satellite images (QuickBird bundle, SPOT-5 multispectral, Landsat 7 ETM+, RADARSAT SAR, and ENVISAT ASAR) with various spatial and spectral characteristics have been assessed for their ability to map mussel farms off a coast of northern Greece, where the intensity and uncontrolled expansion of aquacultures is a pressure to a nearby wetland of international importance. The ability to identify the mussel farms on the images from background open water and accurately map these features was tested separately for the two types of mussel farms (pole and long line) present in the study area. The influence of waves on the mussel farms' identification was also investigated. Results indicate that the optimum satellite sensor varied according to mussel farm type, and is not necessarily the one with the highest spatial resolution. Pole farms were identified in all images bearing a spatial resolution superior to 10 m, but were better located and delineated with a high-resolution QuickBird image. Long line farms, on the other hand, were indistinguishable by passive optical sensors, and could only be identified on active microwave images. In addition to this, the findings show that surface waves drastically deteriorate the identification of mussel farms on an ENVISAT image, thus influencing its usefulness for monitoring.

Narendra			Mapping, monitoring and conservation of Mahanandi wetland ecosystem, Orissa, India using remote sensing and GIS	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Mangrove forests are important component of coastal wetland ecosystems, depleting rapidly from nature due to anthropogenic pressure. The present study deals with periodic assessment and monitoring of the mangroves of Mahanadi delta, Orissa using remote sensing and Geographic Information System techniques. Satellite data of Landsat PASS for 1973, Landsat TM for 1990 and IRS P6 LISS III for 2004 were used to find out the changes that occurred in mangrove and other land cover categories during last 30 years. It was found that the delta is occupied by dense mangrove (12.6%), open mangrove (3.3%), aquaculture (12.9%) and agriculture (30.9%) in 2004. A loss of 2606 ha mangrove area and an increase of 3657 ha aquaculture area clearly depict high anthropogenic activities by local villagers. A significant increase of 726 ha plantations illustrates plantation activities taken up by the Orissa Forest Department to protect the coastal shoreline.																	0369-8211						2008	78						81	89										WOS:000262100200008

Mapping and quantifying the South African kelp resource	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Two species of kelp are exploited commercially in South Africa. Use of beach-cast Laminaria pallida is limited, although it comprises the bulk of the biomass on the northern West Coast. Ecklonia maxima dominates the southern West Coast and provides most of the material for the South African kelp industry. Harvests of E. maxima fronds for abalone feed have reached 3 000 -5 000 tonnes fresh weight (t f wt) y(-1), whereas beach-cast material of both species (about 1 000t dry wt y(-1)) is collected mainly for alginate extraction. For the first time, a South African kelp inventory has been compiled using all available data for the 900km-long West Coast (Cape Agulhas to the Orange River), although a few gaps remain. Beds of E. maxima and L. pallida reaching the surface at low spring tides were mapped using one or several methods: infrared aerial photography, digital multispectral aerial imagery, Landsat satellite imagery, and physical mapping with a hand-held GPS. The data are on a GIS database. Landsat 5 TM imagery could identify the presence of kelp beds, but only infrared aerial imagery and multispectral imaging at low spring tides accurately quantified surface areas of kelp beds. Biomass of the main kelp (E. maxima) is variable in space (between 3kg f wt m(-2) and 24kg f wt m(-2)) and time (changes of up to 50%), making estimates for management difficult. Using an average biomass value of 12kg m(-2), the total biomass of surface-reaching kelp beds on the West Coast is estimated to exceed 593 000t f wt, but extensive subsurface beds remain unquantified. Results are discussed in relation to sustainable limits to harvesting, gaps in knowledge, and the improved management of kelp resources.

The city has been undergoing rapid growth due to increasing oil revenues leading to a sustained economic growth of the country. This has further enhanced a rapid population growth of the city from both internal migration and influx of foreign workers. The population of Doha City reached 45.6% of the total population of Qatar in 2004. During the Nineties, the State of Qatar initiated a number of infrastructural projects that included a large scale dredging and reclamation activities along the coastal areas of Doha. This research aims to use Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) techniques to investigate the rapid urbanization rates and its effect on land use patterns along the costal areas of Doha, as well as to detect the changes that took place in land use types within the city administrative boundaries. Data sources for the study included satellite images (Landsat (1) MSS dated 3/9/1972; Landsat (5) TM dated 28/2/1986; and Landsat (7) ETM+ dated 22/1/2002), field visits and surveys of the coastal areas, and information from technical reports and assessments available from Governmental Departments of Doha City. Using the landsat data, a set of the matic maps were developed to present the net increase in Doha City total area due to dredging and reclamation activities along the city coastline between 1972-2002, as well as a set of maps showing various land use categories of land use types. These included: Vegetation area, Vacant area, Sabkhat, Sandy area, Shallow coastal water, and Urban built area. The output of the application of GIS techniques using 1972, 1986, and 2002 land use maps indicated that the net increase in the coastal areas of the city due to reclamation and dredging activities was 10 Km(2) during the period 1972-2002, and the changes that took place during the period 1986-2002 in the land use categories were: Vegetation (green) area decreased by about 1.6 Km(2), Vacant area by 37.36 Km(2), an indication of the rapid transfer of land in Doha. On the other hand, Sabkhat area decreased by about 5.32 Km(2), while the Urban (built) area within the established city administrative boundaries has increased by about 34.5 Km(2), The main recommendations of the study are the use of Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques in monitoring land use changes within the city administrative boundaries, as well as the reclamation and dredging activities along the coastal areas, and to use the results for future urban planning; to plan and protect the sensitive costal ecosystems during the reclamation and dredging activities; and conducting enviromental impact assessment studies for new projects and implementation of integrated coastal zone management.																	1015-4442					DEC	2007	25	4					190	198										WOS:000256160100006

Correlation analysis of water wave reflectance and local TSM concentrations in the breaking zone with remote sensing techniques	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The coastal zone is a dynamic area in which processes with different origins and scales interact. Several techniques can be used for coastal zone monitoring. Remote sensing is a powerful tool for monitoring coastal processes and oastal areas. The quality of coastal water is a very important issue, and remote sensing optical sensors can be used to quantify water quality parameters such as suspended sediments. Therefore, it is possible to estimate the total suspended matter (TSM) concentration with multispectral satellite images. To extract meaningful information, the satellite data need to be validated with in situ measurements. The main objective of this work was to quantify TSM concentrations in the breaking zone with in situ measurements. In situ validation is important for the accuracy of correlations established. A section of the northwest coast of Portugal, near Aveiro city, was chosen as a test area, and all in situ measurements were done in this area. Several in situ techniques have been used to establish a relationship between seawater reflectance and TSM concentration for the range of wavelengths from 400 to 900 nm. Empirical relationships were established for equivalent reflectance values by SPOT/HRVIR (high-resolution visible Terra/ASTER (advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer), and Landsat TM (thematic mapper) at visible and near-infrared equivalent bands and TSM concentrations. The reflectance values were used to estimate TSM concentration with the use of the relationships established by in situ measurement. The reflectance of all bands of the satellite images tested showed high correlation with TSM in the wavelengths between 500 and 900 nm. The water leaving equivalent reflectance for each sensor equivalent band in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths was calculated, and a relationship between seawater reflectance and TSM concentration was established. The model coefficients and correlation factors for identical bands on different sensors presented good similarity. The work presented shows that TSM concentration in the breaking zone can be obtained directly from simulated multispectral satellite data. However, in situ measurements are essential to calibrate the process and establish the empirical relationships between TSM concentration and water leaving reflectance. The same empirical relationships found with in situ measurements will be used to estimate the TSM concentrations directly from real satellite data to try to quantify the sedimentary balance in the study area for the period of the satellite data.

Applying the ISODATA method of unsupervised classification for Landsat-TM images, the tidal flats were identified, and the resulting areas were quantified for each image. The area of tidal flats from a topographic map published in one year differs significantly from that shown in another, which appears to be attributable to the tide levels at the time of aerial photography. During the study period, the area of tidal flats, as estimated from Landsat-TM images, increased by 4.57 km(2) per year in the study areas. The tidal flats in the inner sea of Chunsu Harbor area increased by 200 m(2) per zone, while the accumulation for a number of inner sea areas within Asan Harbor area occurred at over 50 m(2) per. zone. The results of this research may serve as the basis of an environmentally-friendly development plan for tidal flats.					​Jang, ​Taeil/0000-0002-7337-8165												0253-4126					DEC	2007	116	6					561	573		10.1007/s12040-007-0051-1								WOS:000252228700008

The Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) was used to predict annual and monthly regional NPP as modified by temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, soil texture, fractional tree cover, land cover type, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Fractional tree cover was estimated using continuous training data and multi-temporal metrics of 47 Envisat MERIS images of March 2003 to September 2005 and was derived by aggregating tree cover estimates made from highresolution IKONOS imagery to coarser Landsat ETM imagery. A regression tree algorithm was used to estimate response variables of fractional tree cover based on the multi-temporal metrics. This study showed that Envisat MERIS data yield a greater spatial detail in the quantification of NPP over a topographically complex terrain at the regional scale than those used at the global scale such as AVHRR.

Distribution and habitat use of Ross's and lesser snow geese during late brood rearing	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												We assessed spatial distribution and habitat use by Ross's and lesser snow geese (Chen rossii and C caerulescens caerulescens) during late brood rearing to begin understanding goose-habitat interactions and monitoring key habitats around a rapidly growing nesting colony located at Karrak Lake, Nunavut, Canada. We conducted aerial surveys to count geese and georeference locations, then used Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite imagery to identify habitats associated with each flock. We observed 435 and 407 flocks and 36,287 and 32,745 birds in 1994 and 1995, respectively. Birds were somewhat uniformly distributed over the 5,000-km(2) study area, with larger aggregations occurring closer to the coast, about 70 km from the colony. We assessed habitat use using Bonferroni intervals at both the flock and individual scales. At the flock level, birds avoided lichen-heath, used other terrestrial habitats as available, and selected freshwater. At the individual level, geese selected lowland habitats: wet sedge meadow, hummock graminoid tundra, and freshwater, which accounted for about 70% of the birds observed, and avoided upland habitats. Selection of lowland habitats is likely due to greater availability of food and easier predator avoidance compared to drier upland areas. Because most geese in our study used freshwater habitats, our results demonstrate that assessment of carrying capacity, at least in the central Arctic, must be expanded beyond the coastal salt marshes traditionally considered by researchers and managers as primary brood-rearing habitat for mid-continent light geese.

J	Baskent, EZ; Kadiogullari, AI				Baskent, Emin Zeki; Kadiogullari, Ali Ihsan			Spatial and temporal dynamics of land use pattern in Turkey: A case study in Inegol	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Recognition and understanding of landscape dynamics as a historical legacy of disturbances are necessary for sustainable management of forest ecosystems. This study analyzed forest dynamics and spatial-temporal changes in land use/land cover pattern in a sub-temperate like alluvial forest land with 1778 km(2) area along the Eagan Sea coast of Turkey (Inegol). This area is studied by comparing Landsat images from 1987 to 2001 and evaluated with spatial analyses of forest cover type maps from 1972, 1983, 1993 to 2004 using GIS. The study investigated temporal changes of spatial structure of forest conditions over the period using Fragstats (TM). The results showed that the forested areas increased both in between 1972 and 1993 years (3.3%) and between 1987 and 2001 years (6.7%). In terms of spatial configuration, Inegol forests are generally fragmented in the latter periods due to intensive forest utilization, illegal use, expansion of settlements and infrastructural development in the lowlands. Land use pattern significantly changed over time depending on a few factors such as unregulated management actions, social pressure and demographic movements. In conclusion, land use changes have developed in favor of forestry over time between 1972-1993 and 1987-2001. The study revealed that demographic movements have a minor effect on landscape dynamics. Both spatial and temporal changes and the factors affecting these changes should be determined for developing sustainable management of forest resources. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The data span 1955-2005 along the Beaufort Sea coast north of Teshekpuk Lake in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. Some areas have undergone as much as 0.9 kin of coastal erosion in the past 50 yr. Land loss attributed to coastal erosion more than doubled, from 0.48 km(2) yr(-1) during 1955-1985 to 1.08 km(2) yr(-1) during 1985-2005. Coastal erosion has breached thermokarst lakes, causing initial draining of the lakes followed by marine flooding. Although inland thermokarst lakes show some uniform expansion, lakes breached by coastal erosion display lake expansion several orders of magnitude greater than inland lakes.																	0091-7613					JUL	2007	35	7					583	586		10.1130/G23672A.1								WOS:000247895900002						
J	Syvitski, JPM; Saito, Y				Syvitski, James P. M.; Saito, Yoshiki			Morphodynamics of deltas under the influence of humans	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												A consistent database was established to characterize key environmental factors known to control delta morphology. The database includes the location, basin morphology, fluvial and sediment discharge to the deltas, delta morphology, ocean energy, and shelf depth reached by the sub-aqueous delta. Fifty-one deltas were selected to cover the global parameter range of rivers entering all major oceans and coastal seas. Seasonal satellite images of the deltas were processed (IKONOS, SPOT, LANDSAT, and MODIS). Predictive statistical relationships were obtained, suitable for hypothesis testing or to constrain/verify numerical models used to simulate the evolution of coastal systems. The area of a delta is best predicted from average discharge, the total sediment load feeding the delta, and the offshore accommodation space. The gradient of a delta plain, measured from the apex of the delta to the coast along the main channel, is best predicted with a ratio of sediment supply to sediment retention, sediment concentration used as a proxy of delta plain sedimentation, and mean water discharge. Widths of distributary channels form a lognormal distribution, with the cumulative width of the river mouths directly related to the maximum discharge, tidal and wave energy. The grain size of topset deposits scales with the river length. Hundreds of millions of people occupy deltas and human engineering is now a major influence on the growth and evolution of many deltas, through control of the flow path of distributary channels, and mitigation of the seasonal flood wave with concomitant change in the delivery of sediment load. More and more deltas are moving away from their pre-Anthropocene morphology, as influenced by pristine sediment supply and sediment dispersal. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

Simulations on different beaches of the study area were performed to determine a relationship between the TSM concentration and the spectral response of the seawater. Based on the in situ measurements, empirical models were established in order to relate the seawater reflectance with the TSM concentration for TERRA/ASTER, SPOT HRVIR, and Landsat/TM. Seven images of these three sensors were calibrated and atmospherically and geometrically corrected. Single-band models, multiple regression, and ANNs were applied to the visible and near-infrared (NIR) bands of these sensors in order to estimate the TSM concentration. Statistical analysis using correlation coefficients and error estimation was employed, aiming to evaluate the most accurate methodology. The chosen methodology was further applied to the seven processed images. The analysis of the root-mean-square errors achieved by both the linear and nonlinear models supports the hypothesis that the relationship between the seawater reflectance and TSM concentration is clearly nonlinear. The ANNs have been shown to be useful in estimating the TSM concentration from reflectance of visible and NIR bands of ASTER, HRVIR, and TM sensors, with better results for ASTER and HRVIR sensors. Maps of TSM concentration were produced for all satellite images processed.

J	Ekercin, S				Ekercin, Semih			Coastline change assessment at the Aegean Sea Coasts in Turkey using multitemporal Landsat imagery	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												This paper focuses mainly on the coastline movements at the northeast coasts of the Aegean Sea in Turkey. The Aegean Sea is a semiclosed sea that has unique geographical features and covers an area of 191,000 km(2) . The study area includes the coastal zone located between the southeastern part of the Meric River mouth and the Dalyan Lake coasts. The Meric Delta has accreted toward the Aegean Sea as a result of sediment discharge and transport. In contrast to this, the width of the natural land barrier between the Aegean Sea and the Dalyan Lake has decreased over the years because of coastal erosion. These processes have caused the morphological changes of coastline along some parts of the northeast coasts of the Aegean Sea. In this study, these changes were examined by using satellite data from Landsat MSS, TM, and ETM collected between 1975 and 2001. In the image processing step, registration, ISODATA classification, and temporal image ratioing techniques were used to carry out coastline change assessment. At the end of the study, significant coastline movements (in some parts more than 200 in) were detected for a 26-year period.																	0749-0208					MAY	2007	23	3					691	698		10.2112/04-0398.1								WOS:000246820900014						
J	El Banna, MM				El Banna, Mahmoud M.			Erosion and accretion rates and their associated sediment characters along Ras El Bar coast, northeast Nile Delta, Egypt	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												Beach profile data, covering the coast of Ras El Bar, northeast Nile Delta, collected during the years from 1990 to 2002 combined with landsat images for the area and sedimentological investigation have been used to identify beach and nearshore seafloor sediment changes. Along the coast of Ras El Bar, two accretion sectors and one of erosion have been recognized. The first accretion sector is located west of Damietta harbour, where the harbour jetties have halted the littoral transport, while the second one is behind a system of detached breakwaters protecting Ras El Bar resort. Both the two sectors are characterized by growing shoreline with maximum rates similar to 15 and 10 m/year, respectively. Also, they have maximum nearshore seafloor accretion rates of similar to 18 and 22 cm/year, respectively. The erosion sector is located east of Damietta port and has a maximum rate of shoreline retreat similar to 10 m/year. Erosion of its nearshore seafloor is indicated recording a maximum rate of similar to 20 cm/year. The rate of net sediment volume change in the area indicates shifting of the accretion sector (II) westward, responding to installation of the new breakwaters unit. The two accretion sectors are characterized by dominance of moderately sorted fine sands in their shore area which change seaward into less sorting very fine sands. Beach sands of the eroded sector are poorly sorted medium grain size. The dominant constituents of heavy mineral species in beach and sea-bottom sands are the characteristic assemblages of the Nile deposits. The sands of the eroded zone are relatively enriched in monazite, zircon, tourmaline, garnet, and rutile.																	0943-0105					MAR	2007	52	1					41	49		10.1007/s00254-006-0447-2								WOS:000244453600005

During the first comprehensive shorebird survey of the 674 000 ha "1002 Area" on the coastal plain, we recorded 14 species of breeding shorebirds at 197 rapidly surveyed plots during June 2002 and 2004. We also estimated detection ratios with a double counting technique, using data collected at 37 intensively studied plots located oil the North Slope of Alaska and northern Canada. We stratified the study area by major habitat types, including wetlands, moist areas, uplands, and riparian areas, using previously classified Landsat imagery. We developed population estimates with confidence limits by species, and estimated the total number of shorebirds in the study area to be 230 000 (95% CI: 104 000-363 000), which exceeds the biological criterion for classification as both a Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network Site or International Importance (100 000 birds) and a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance (20 000 birds), even when conservatively estimated. Species richness and the density of many species were highest in wetland or riparian habitats, which are Clustered along the coast.																	0010-5422					FEB	2007	109	1					1	14		10.1650/0010-5422(2007)109[1:SAADOT]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000244145800001

A supervised classification was carried out on the six reflective bands for the two images individually with the aid of ground truth data. Ground truth information collected during six field trips conducted between 1998 and 2002 and land cover map of 1987 were used to assess the accuracy of the classification results. Using ancillary data, visual interpretation and expert knowledge of the area through GIS further refined the classification results. Post-classification change detection technique was used to produce change image through cross-tabulation. Changes among different land cover classes were assessed. During the study period, a very severe land cover change has taken place as a result of agricultural and tourist development projects. These changes in land cover led to vegetation degradation and water logging in part of the study area. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Impact of new mouth opening on morphology and water quality of the Chilika Lagoon - a study based on Resourcesat-1 LISS-III and AWiFS and IRS-1D LISS-III data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The northeasterly long shore transport ( littoral drift) along the east coast of India shifts the mouth of the lagoon northeastwards. It results in lengthening of the outer channel, reduced tidal flux, fall in salinity levels, weed infestation, decline in fishery resources, and overall loss of biodiversity and productivity. The Chilika Development Authority made an artificial mouth near the village of Sipakuda, which was opened on 23 September 2000. The present study focuses on applications of Resourcesat-1 LISS-III and AWiFS data to understand the impact of the new mouth opening on the morphology and water quality of the Chilika Lagoon. Digital image processing of multi-temporal Resourcesat-1 AWiFS, LISS-III, and IRS-1D LISS-III data was carried out. Changes were shown out for pre- and post-opening of the new mouth. The results indicate that the initial cut of 80m has widened to approximately 676m and, so far, the process has not attained stability. There has been northward erosion for approximately 376m and southward erosion for approximately 143m at the new mouth. The study shows that the strong ebbing tide current from the northwest is responsible for this erosion. The old mouth has been closed completely just three years after the opening of the new mouth. There has been an overall rise in salinity levels in the Chilika Lagoon, in particular during the pre-monsoon period following the opening of the new mouth. This indicates that the tidal flux in the lagoon has increased and the associated circulation is effective in mixing the water masses. After the opening of the new mouth, weeds have reduced by a 172-km(2) area, in particular in the northeast part of the lagoon. AWiFS data is extremely useful in identifying changes in morphology and water quality under different tide conditions. Tidal conditions influence the signatures of turbidity, weed cover, shoals, and spits under development. The SWIR channel of AWiFS is found to be extremely useful for detecting aquatic vegetation. The study concludes that large transport of sediments at the new mouth opening, along with predominant erosion of the northern bank, suggests a northward migration of the new mouth in the near future.

Mapping severe damage to land cover following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami using moderate spatial resolution satellite imagery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Visual analysis of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250m before-and-after event imagery along 11 335 km of South East Asia and East Africa's coastline identified major changes to land cover along 1 220 km of coast caused by the tsunami of 26 December 2004. Over 81 000 ha of land were mapped as lost or severely damaged. High spatial resolution images (10-32 m) from the Terra satellite's Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer, Disaster Monitoring Constellation's Surrey Linear Imager and the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) provided verification. Area estimates of damaged land from MODIS were within 17% of the estimates made using high spatial resolution systems. Errors of commission and omission were estimated at 14% and 31%, respectively. The correlation between damage estimates from MODIS and high spatial resolution systems resulted in an R-2 of 0.73 at the 99.5% confidence level, with MODIS proving especially effective at mapping tsunami-damaged areas greater in size than 150 ha. Correcting the original area estimate to account for errors of omission and commission using the regression model gave a revised figure of 103 854 ha of land damaged. Land cover types could not be assigned from the MODIS pre- and post-disaster image pairs, but interpretation of pre-disaster ETM imagery for the damaged areas indicated that around 5% was previously classed as barren, 11% as urban, 14% forest and 70% rural. The study provides confirmation that moderate resolution satellite imagery can provide rapid assessments of severe damage to land resources (though not cover type), as well as confirmation of non-affected areas, over very large geographical regions in the aftermath of natural disasters such as the tsunami.

Using remote sensing to assess the protective role of coastal woody vegetation against tsunami waves	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												This paper describes how remote sensing techniques were used to study the effect of mangroves and other woody coastal vegetation as a protective measure against the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. Remote sensing made it possible to compare pre- and post-Tsunami images of large areas. A study site was selected based on medium resolution Landsat imagery and existing topographic maps. Selection criteria included substantial damages reported, presence of woody vegetated and non-vegetated shorelines, homogeneous bathymetry and good coverage of pre- and post-Tsunami satellite imagery. The Pichawaram mangrove, Tamil Nadu, India, matched these criteria. Pre- and post-Tsunami Ikonos and QuickBird images were compared through the visual interpretation of pre-Tsunami coastal vegetation and post-Tsunami damage. The results were validated in the field. The analysis showed that mangrove forests and coastal shelterbelts provided protection from the Tsunami. This was concluded from analysing the spatial distribution of damage relative to woody vegetation along the coast as well as transects detailing the amount of damage behind the coastline and the coastal woody vegetation.																	0143-1161						2007	28	13-14					3153	3169		10.1080/01431160701420597								WOS:000247469000020

Change detection at Conde municipality coastal zone, State of Bahia, Brazil - using medium resolution satellite data	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												NOGUEIRA, R.X.S. and DOMINGUEZ, J.M.L., 2007. Mapping of land cover changes at Conde municipality coastal zone, State of Bahia, Brazil, using medium resolution satellite data. Journal of Coastal Research, SI 50 (Proceedings of the 9th International Coastal Symposium), 33 - 37. Gold Coast, Australia, ISSN 0749.0208 The easier access to medium resolution natural resources satellite data has greatly popularised the use of this type of information in land cover studies and ecosystems management. This paper presents the results of a study of land cover changes in a coastal area located in eastern Brazil (Conde Municipality - State of Bahia). Using a Geographic Information System (GIS), Landsat multi-temporal data (1984, 1995 and 2003) were photo interpreted and converted to raster maps. Overlay operations (map algebra) were then used to assess and quantify land cover changes within the studied area. It was found that the documented changes were mostly related to an increase in tourism and summer resident population, directly related to the construction of the BA-099 highway, also known as Green Line (Linha Verde). In some places, ecosystem degradation arising from these recent occupation patterns could be mapped. Overall however, the ecosystems preservation status between 1984 and 2003 can be considered very good. The methodology used can be easily applied for other sites and proved to be an easy and cheap alternative for environmental institutions interested to quickly evaluate ecosystems preservation status and land use trends during the last few decades. Coastal management initiatives can be better planned and implemented using this kind of spatially geo-referenced data.

After performing georeferencing and normalization of the images, density slicing was used to extract the waterline. Comparisons of extracted waterline positions with ground-level data for eight transects and global positioning system (GPS) tracks of the island shorelines showed that NIR bands were superior to SWIR bands because of the characteristics of the coral reef coasts, including a lack of foam and suspended sediments (which can affect the NIR wavelength region, if present) and the presence of remnant water on reef flats during low tide (which can affect the SWIR wavelength region). A linear relationship was found between the estimation errors of waterline positions and the spatial resolutions of the NIR sensors. Analysis on estimation errors and image costs showed that Terra ASTER band 3 was the most cost-effective sensor for extracting waterlines with reasonable accuracy. The results serve as general guidelines for using satellite-derived data to estimate intertidal topography and detect and monitor shorelines in coral reef environments. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Eddy generation in the tidal Potomac river	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												This paper deals with eddies generated by a shear flow instability in the tidal Potomac River, Maryland-Virginia, USA. An evolution sequence of this robust phenomenon is synthesized using ASTER and Landsat visible imagery, and its growth from small-amplitude waves into mature eddies is shown. Using feature tracking between two nearly contemporaneous ASTER and Landsat images, an along-river surface velocity profile is computed. Archived velocity and density profiles, taken during accelerating ebb at locations up-river and down-river of the study area indicate the water column is relatively homogeneous up-river, but resembles a two-layer fluid down-river where estuarine stratification is present in the lower water column. Velocity variation with depth in the upper water column is relatively small, deviating at mid depth from the near-surface value by only 9-15% at both sites. We examined the horizontal stability properties of this flow by modeling it as inviscid mid barotropic, and predicted rapidly growing unstable waves with wavelengths close to the observed ones. Their proximity to the coast,;is well as the precise details of the coastline configuration, are shown to have a negligible effect in determining the observed unstable wavelengths.

Land cover change within the Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve: 1974-2001	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Estuarine water bodies provide a land to sea (freshwater to saltwater) transition zone. Protected from the full force of waves, winds, and storms by topographic features, e.g., reefs and barrier islands, estuaries provide habitats for countless numbers of plant and animal species. An estuary's wetlands, including salt marshes, naturally improve,all water quality by acting as filters. Thus, there are societal benefits to preserving estuaries. The U.S. government, in fact, passed the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, creating the National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) System. The present study documents temporal land cover change occurring during the period 1974-2001 within the Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (GBNERR)-the 24th NERR, designated in 1999. Occupying an area of 7284 hectares, it is one of the largest relatively undisturbed estuarine marsh-pine savanna habitats remaining on the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Results were obtained by applying both unsupervised classification and change detection techniques to data derived from Landsat satellite imagery acquired in 1974, 1991, and 2001, respectively. Land cover classes included open water, herbaceous wetland, forest, and barren land. For change detection analysis, change matrices were derived from postclassified pairs of successive image dates, yielding two change matrices. A map of overall cover change between 1974 and 2001 was also produced. Submersion of wetlands by water, attributed to a combination of factors, including rising sea levels, land subsidence, and historical geomorphologic changes that increased wave action and decreased sedimentation, caused a majority of the observed changes. Such a broad land cover analysis provides resource managers with information regarding the estuary's land cover types and spatial distributions, allowing for more informed decisions with regard to preserving biodiversity and planning restoration efforts.																	0749-0208					NOV	2006	22	6					1552	+		10.2112/05-0582.1								WOS:000242695100023

The bay is under pressure from conflicting uses, and there is an information need for future management plans for the area surrounding the bay. Spatial and temporal distributions of land use/land cover patterns were derived by unsupervised classification with the ISODATA algorithm. The post-classification comparison technique was applied to evaluate decadal changes in land area. The turbidity patterns of the bay were determined from sea surface reflectances, and at-satellite temperatures for the sea area were calculated. The processed images show that the water clarity conditions were affected by the adjacent coastal land uses and by river discharges. In accordance with the change-detection analysis of land-use patterns, the forested areas were decreased by 21%, whereas the increase in urban areas was determined as 105% within a decade.																	0143-1161					SEP 10	2006	27	17					3627	3643		10.1080/01431160500500326								WOS:000240953600002

Mapping changes in submerged aquatic vegetation using Landsat imagery and benthic habitat data: Coral reef ecosystem monitoring in Vieques Sound between 1985 and 2000	BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE												Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) imagery for eastern Puerto Rico, collected January of 1985 and March of 2000, was used to perform a multi-temporal classification technique to identify and quantify the dynamics of submerged aquatic vegetation (seagrass and macroalgae) in a study area located in Vieques Sound, off the east coast of Puerto Rico. This change detection was validated using benthic habitat maps of the area created from 1999 aerial photography, and then contextually edited to map different types of change occurring within the study period, including recent sedimentation, changes in seagrass patchiness, and macroalgal cover. The results show that the distribution of seagrass meadows and macroalgae were expanding more than decreasing in the study area between 1985 and 2000. Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) growth was mainly occurring in deeper waters, whereas shallower seagrass meadows along the north shore of Vieques became increasingly patchy. This analysis demonstrates that the dynamic nature of seagrass meadows and macroalgae in the Vieques Sound can be assessed accurately and efficiently by satellite imagery. The ability to map and identify changes in extent of SAV is important coral reef ecosystem monitoring and targeting of vulnerable and affected areas for more specific research and further study.																	0007-4977					SEP	2006	79	2					375	388										WOS:000241443500010

Suspended sediment transport in the coastal area of Jinhae Bay - Nakdong Estuary, Korea Strait	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Hydrodynamic measurements and analysis of suspended sediments were conducted in the coastal area to reveal the source and dispersal processes of muds accumulating in Jinhae Bay, one of the largest bays in the Korea Strait. A number of hydrographic stations in the bay were occupied in order to obtain time series of suspended sediment concentrations, currents, water level, temperature, and salinity for one or two tidal cycles. The results, measured in May through October, suggest that a slight net influx of suspended sediments into the bay occurs consistently under low-wave, microtidal conditions. They also show a passageway of suspended sediments selectively through an entrance facing the open sea. The hydrodynamic measurements, together with tidal current pattern and landsat image of the suspended plume in the Korea Strait, indicate that the mud in Jinhae Bay has been fed largely by the adjacent Nakdong River, rather than by offshore sources.

Monitoring turbid freshwater plume characteristics by means of remotely sensed data	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Remotely sensed data may provide easy access for monitoring the spatial separation and obtaining the hydrodynamic characteristics of turbid freshwater plumes created by river flow in the marine environment. Traditional methods are time consuming and require great effort to produce sufficient data. In this project, integrated research has been carried out on a river to demonstrate the utility of remote sensing (RS) technology for studying fundamental theoretical properties of turbulent mixtures. The Filyos River mouth, located on the Black Sea coast of Turkey. is the research area. Flow properties, such as the horizontal dispersion coefficient. have been calculated (using Landsat TM sensor images taken on two different dates). The effects of the plume on the morphology of neighbouring beaches are also examined. This study shows the utility of RS technology for generating quantitative data and better defining the hydraulic behaviour of a river with high turbidity.

Location South-western Atlantic saltmarshes Methods Field samples of dominant emergent plant species positioned by the global positioning system (GPS) were obtained from most coastal saltmarshes (14) between southern Brazil and northern Patagonia, Argentina. Landsat satellite images were obtained and coastal saltmarsh habitats were quantified by supervised classification, utilizing points gathered in the field. Results Three main plant species dominated the low and middle intertidal saltmarsh, Spartina alterniflora Loesel., Spartina densiflora Brong. and Sarcocornia perennis (P. Mill.) A.J. Scott. The total area of the studied coastal saltmarshes was 2133 km(2), comprising 380 km(2) of Sp. alterniflora marsh, 366 km(2) of Sp. densiflora marsh, 746 km(2) of Sar. perennis marsh and 641 km(2) of brackish marsh (dominated by Juncus acutus L., Juncus kraussii Hochst., Scirpus maritimus L., Scirpus americanus Pers. and Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin.). Cluster analysis showed three habitat types: saltmarshes dominated by (1) Sp. densiflora and brackish species,(2) Sp. alterniflora and Sar. perennis and (3) Sp.densiflora only. The analysis of abiotic variables showed significant differences between groups of habitats and coordinated gradients of the abiotic variables. The south-west Atlantic coast showed decreasing mean annual rainfall (1200 to 196 mm) and increasing mean tidal amplitude (< 0.5 to > 2.5 m) from latitude 31 degrees to 43 degrees. Main conclusions South-west Atlantic saltmarshes are globally important by virtue of their total extent. Remote sensing showed that the reversal pattern in plant distribution is not widespread. Indeed, south-west Atlantic saltmarshes are better characterized by the presence of the halophytic genera Spartina and Sarcocornia. Our results support the interpretation that south-west Atlantic saltmarshes constitute a class of temperate type (sensu Adam, 1990) with transitional characteristics between Australasian-South African saltmarshes and west Atlantic saltmarshes.

J	Chu, ZX; Sun, XG; Zhai, SK; Xu, KH				Chu, ZX; Sun, XG; Zhai, SK; Xu, KH			Changing pattern of accretion/erosion of the modem Yellow River (Huanghe) subaerial delta, China: Based on remote sensing images	MARINE GEOLOGY												The Yellow River shifted from the Diaokou course to the Qingshuigou course in 1976, and shifted again at the north bank of the Qingshuigou course in 1996. As a result, the entire modem Yellow River Delta has experienced complicated patterns of erosion and accretion. Multitemporal remote sensing data of Landsat MSS and TM from 1976 to 2000, totaling twenty scenes, were used to examine the changing pattern of accretion and erosion of the modem Yellow River subaerial delta with GIS tools. During the period 1976 to 2000, the maximum erosion occurred at the head of the last two abandoned promontories, Diaokou and Shenxiangou promontories, where the coastline retreated landward over -7 and -4.5 km, respectively, with mean net erosion rates of -0.29 and -0.19 km/a, respectively. In contrast, the maximum accretion occurred at the head of the Qingshuigou Promontory where the coastline advanced seaward over 20 km with a mean net accretion rate of 0.83 km/a. The coastline at the head of the Q(8) Promontory also advanced seaward 7 km with a mean net accretion rate of 0.29 km/a during the period 1996 to 2000. Total area of the Diaokou and Shenxiangou promontories was reduced by -141.3 km(2) with a mean net erosion rate of -6.03 km(2)/a. Total area of the Qingshuigou and Q(8) promontories increased by 384.16 and 11.88 km(2), respectively, with mean net accretion rates of 16.4 and 3.03 km(2)/a, respectively. Relative to the Diaokou, Shenxiangou and Qingshuigou promontories, the west area of the Diaokou Promontory and south area of the Qingshuigou Promontory were relatively stable, although minor erosion occurred. The general pattern of accretion and erosion of the modem Yellow River subaerial delta was divided into three stages: rapid accretion stage (1976-1984), accretion-erosion adjustment stage (1985-1995), and slow erosion stage (1996-present). The factors affecting the pattern of erosion and accretion over the Yellow River Delta, such as structural geology, the Yellow River sediment discharge, coastal processes, meteorological conditions, human activity, sea level rise and land subsidence were summarized. The cumulative area of increase over the entire subaerial delta is closely correlated with the cumulative Yellow River sediment discharge. Wave-induced longshore current is the major driving force to transport sediment from eroded areas along the last two abandoned promontories, Diaokou and Shenxiangou promontories, mostly westerly and partially easterly. Together with these coastal processes is the geographical shift of the Yellow River course associated with its discharge regime after 1976, leading to the accretion along the present Qingshuigou Promontory and then the Q(8) Promontory.

Wide area observation of the impact of the operation of Younggwang nuclear power plant 5 and 6, No. BSPI 319-00-1426-3, KORDI, Seoul, Korea]. Here the spatial and temporal characteristics of the thermal plume signature of warm water are reported from a time series (1985-2003) of space-borne, thermal infrared data from Landsat and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites. Sea surface temperature (SST) were characterized using advanced very high resolution radiometer data from the NOAA satellites. These data demonstrated the general pattern and extension of the thermal plume signature in the Younggwang coastal areas. In contrast, the analysis of SST from thematic mapper data using the Landsat-5 and 7 satellites provided enhanced information about the plume shape, dimension and direction of dispersion in these waters. The thermal plume signature was detected from 70 to 100 km to the south of the discharge during the summer monsoon and 50 to 70 km to the northwest during the winter monsoon. The mean detected plume temperature was 28 degrees C in summer and 12 degrees C in winter. The AT varied from 2 to 4 degrees C in winter and 2 degrees C in summer. These values are lower than the re-circulating water temperature (6-9 degrees C). In addition the temperature difference between tidal flats and offshore (SSTtidal flats - SSToffsore) was found to vary from 5.4 to 8.5 degrees C during the flood tides and 3.5 degrees C during the ebb tide. The data also suggest that water heated by direct solar radiation on the tidal flats during the flood tides might have been transported offshore during the ebb tide. Based on these results we suggest that there is an urgent need to protect the health of Younggwang coastal marine ecosystem from the severe thermal impact by the large quantity of warm water discharged from the Younggwang nuclear power plant.

The main objective of this paper is to evaluate and quantity Abu Dhabi coastal zone LULC changes from 1972 to 2000 using multi-temporal LANDSAT satellite data and digital change detection techniques. Supervised classification Coupled with expert Visual interpretation techniques were used to produce LULC classified images with an accuracy of 88%. Change detection process was achieved by applying post-classification comparison techniques in ENVI software. From this study it has been observed that the important coastal landuse types of Abu Dhabi coast i.e. wetlands and woody Vegetation (Mangrove, represented by a single species, Avicennia marina) have been reduced drastically in their extent due to reclamation, dredging, tipping and other anthropogenic activities along the coastal zone. However, it has been observed that there is rapid increase in the man-made plantation and managed vegetation from 1990 to 2000 due to the Abu Dhabi government initiation. This Study has given good insight into Abu Dhabi coastal zone changes during last 3 decades.				CHEN, YU/F-8600-2011	Yagoub, M.

Characterizing factors that influence their equilibrium and continuous monitoring are fundamental for effective environmental planning and management of coastal areas. In order to monitor shoreline changes, we developed a methodology based on a multisource and multitemporal approach. A database, related to the Ionian coast of Basilicata region (about 50 km), was implemented by using cartographic data (IGMI data), satellite imagery (SPOT-PX/XS, Landsat-TM, Corona) and aerial data covering the period form 1949 to 2001. In particular, airborne data (1 m spatial resolution) were acquired during a specific campaign we performed in 2000 and 2001. To obtain the best performance from the available data, we applied a data fusion procedure on visible and thermal information. Different algorithms were tested, such as band ratios and clustering for extracting the coastline. The best results from multispectral data were obtained using a threshold algorithm we devised by exploiting the green, red and NIR bands, whereas for panchromatic data we selected clustering as the more suitable method. Moreover, a GPS survey was performed to evaluate the influence of tidal effects.																	1593-5213					FEB	2006	49	1					295	304										WOS:000239220300033

Dramatic changes in the Black Sea's ecosystem and resources are due to natural and anthropogenic causes (increase in the nutrient and pollutant load of rivers input, industrial and municipal wastewater pollution along the coast, and dumping on the open sea). A scientific management system for protection, conservation and restoration must be based on reliable information on bio-geophysical and geomorphologic processes, coastal erosion, sedimentation dynamics, mapping of macrophyte fields, water quality, climatic change effects. Synergetic use of quasi-simultaneously acquired multi-sensor data may therefore allow for a better approach of change detection of coastal area. This paper is an application of multi-temporal and multi-spectral satellite remotely sensed data (Landsat MSS, TM, ETM, SAR ERS, ASTER, MODIS) over a period of time between 1975 and 2003 for North-Western Black Sea coastal zone change detection assessment. Spectral mixture analysis, supervised and unsupervised classification are used to study chosen test areas. The results can be utilized as a temporal land-use change model for a region to quantify the extent and nature of change, and aid in future prediction studies, which helps in planning environmental agencies to develop sustainable land-use practices.																	1454-4164					FEB	2006	8	1					252	256										WOS:000236107300056

The supralittoral and the mediolittoral were mapped as a function of the coastal lithology and the presumed levels of human impact (both in scale of 1:100,000). The infralittoral was mapped on the basis of spatial modelling (using neural networks as a modelling tool, data about habitats collected by fieldwork as the independent variable for training and testing the model, and the digital bathymetrical model, the distance from coast, the second spectral channel of Landsat ETM+ satellite image and the sea bottom sea temperature, salinity and current magnitude, as dependent variables). The circalittoral and the bathyal were mapped by overlapping and reinterpretation of the existing spatial databases (bathymetry and lithology) within the framework of the raster-GIS.

It is necessary to work with recent data to be able to identify the effects of urbanization on the water quality of the Terkos dam catchment area that supplies drinking water to the metropolis. RS is an important toot to monitor water quality and urban terrain. For this aim, a project has been initiated at the Technical University Remote Sensing Laboratory, under the Istanbul Water and Sewerage Administration (ISKI) sponsorship in Istanbul. The project uses SPOT-PAN, XS and IRS-1C/D PAN and satellite data of 1993 and 2000 for urban analysis and Landsat-TM and LISS-III satellite data of 1992 and 2000 for water quality. For calibration and validation, ground truth samples are collected from the experimental area. The RS data was converted into the UTM coordinate system and image enhancement and classification techniques are used. Raster data is converted to vector data to assess the study area for analyzing in GTS for the purpose of planning and decision-making on protected water basin zones. As a result of monitoring land use and water quality changes, recommendations are made for planning and management of the protected environment of the Terkos catchment C I protected area. Measuring land use change is a very important issue for controlling the future development of the basin, GIS techniques are performed and results are illustrated in established models on the four protected zones of Terkos water basin.

J	Hattestrand, C; Clark, CD				Hattestrand, Clas; Clark, Chris D.			The glacial geomorphology of Kola Peninsula and adjacent areas in Murmansk Region, Russia.	JOURNAL OF MAPS												A map of the glacial geomorphology of Kola Peninsula and adjacent areas in the Murmansk region, northwestern Russia, is presented. The primary data source for identification and classification of landforms has been Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite images, and aerial photograph interpretation and field work in selected areas. The map, at the scale 1:900,000, consists of over 20,000 landforms pertaining to the Quaternary glacial activity, considerably improving existing knowledge of this area. The landform types that have been mapped are glacial lineations, ribbed moraine, end moraines, end moraine complexes, hummocky moraine, eskers, glaciofluvial accumulations, lateral meltwater channels, large meltwater channels, very large meltwater channels, and relict shorelines. The distribution of landforms shows large variations. The central part of the peninsula lacks signs of glacial activity, apart from abundant lateral meltwater channels. In the rest of the area glacial lineations (drumlins, flutes, crag-and-tails) are the dominant landform type. The largest glacial landform system in the area is an ice marginal system running parallel to the southern and eastern coast of Kola Peninsula. This ice marginal system, the Keiva moraine complex, has in part been overrun and drumlinised by ice flow from the southwest. This indicates that this ice marginal belt was deposited before the last major ice expansion. The map presented will be used as the main source of data for a new reconstruction of glacial events in the eastern part of the Fennoscandian ice sheet area.

A segmentation algorithm was used to classify lakes and drained thaw lake basins (DTLBs) exceeding I ha in size. A total of 13,214 lakes and 6539 DTLBs were identified. Several indices were obtained from the image processing software and used for a comparative analysis of lakes and basins including object size, goodness of elliptic fit, shape complexity, shape asymmetry, and orientation of the major axis. Nonparametric statistical analyses indicate that lakes and basins share similar orientation only. Three subregions of the western Arctic Coastal Plain were identified based on landscape age, as demarcated by ancient shorelines. The surfaces become progressively older inland and include the Younger Outer Coastal Plain, the Outer Coastal Plain, and the oldest Inner Coastal Plain. Lakes and basins in all subregions have statistically similar orientation, indicating that summer wind direction has not changed appreciably over the past several thousand years. Basin orientation is less clustered than lake orientation. Lakes are highly elliptical, while basins have more complex shapes. Lake coverage (%) is fairly constant across the three subregions, while DTLB coverage decreases on older surfaces. Lake and basin size decreases on progressively older surfaces, but the number of features per unit area increases. It is uncertain if surface age is responsible for differences in regional metrics as an analysis of the Inner Coastal Plain demonstrates significant internal variation. Distance from the coast, ground ice content, surficial sediments. and local relief may also influence lake morphometry.

This study showed that links between mangrove extent and coastal fisheries production could be detected for some species at a broad regional scale (1000s of kilometres) on the east coast of Queensland, Australia. The relationships between catch-per-unit-effort for different commercially caught species in four fisheries (trawl, line, net and pot fisheries) and mangrove characteristics, estimated from Landsat images were examined using multiple regression analyses. The species were categorised into three groups based on information on their life history characteristics, namely mangrove-related species (banana prawns Penaeus merguiensis, mud crabs Scylla serrata and barramundi Lates calcarifer), estuarine species (tiger prawns Penaeus esculentus and Penaeus semisulcatus, blue swimmer crabs Portunus pelagicus and blue threadfin Eleutheronema tetradactylum) and offshore species (coral trout Plectropomus spp.). For the mangrove-related species, mangrove characteristics such as area and perimeter accounted for most of the variation in the model; for the non-mangrove estuarine species, latitude was the dominant parameter but some mangrove characteristics (e.g. mangrove perimeter) also made significant contributions to the models. In contrast, for the offshore species, latitude was the dominant variable, with no contribution from mangrove characteristics. This study also identified that finer scale spatial data for the fisheries, to enable catch information to be attributed to a particular catchment, would help to improve our understanding of relationships between mangroves and fisheries production.

This research is the first to map DTLBs on a large scale for Alaska's Arctic Coastal Plain. Thaw lakes and DTLBs were classified from seven Landsat-7 scenes using texture analysis, spectral transformations, and image segmentation. The overall classification accuracy was 97.7% with, a Kappa coefficient of 0.96. Thaw lakes had a producer accuracy of 99.1% and a user accuracy of 98.6%, while DTLBs had a producer accuracy of 93.8% and user accuracy of 98.1%. A total of 7054 km(2) of thaw lakes were mapped, accounting for 20.4% of the Arctic Coastal Plain; there were 8917 km(2) of DTLBs covering 25.7% of the study area. Continued research in the analysis of thaw lakes and DTLBs is crucial to our understanding of the global carbon cycle, atmospheric methane concentrations, heat flow and climate change.

J	Karlsen, SR; Elvebakk, A; Johansen, B				Karlsen, SR; Elvebakk, A; Johansen, B			A vegetation-based method to map climatic variation in the arctic-boreal transition area of Finnmark, north-easternmost Norway	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim To develop a new method for bioclimate mapping where the vegetation layer is the main source of climate information. Location The study area includes four subareas, all situated on the Varangerhalvoya peninsula in Finnmark, north-easternmost Norway (70-71 degrees N). The four subareas were chosen to represent most of the climatic, topographic, geomorphologic and botanic diversity along the arctic-boreal gradient in the area. The four meteorological stations in the area show a climatic gradient with mean July temperature ranging from 10.1 to 12.3 degrees C. Methods The new vegetation-based method is based on the fact that most plant species and plant communities both in the Arctic and adjacent areas have a distribution pattern limited by temperature to some extent. The vegetation is mapped using Landsat TM data and a contextual correction process in a geographic information system. The mapped vegetation units are defined as temperature indicators based on their total distribution patterns and the temperature indicator value of their high frequency and dominant species. The indicator value and degree of cover of all thermophilous vegetation units, within each 500 x 500 m study unit, are combined in a Vegetation-based Index of Thermophily, VItm. This new vegetation-based method is based on the same basic idea as a recently published floristic-based method for calculating a Floristic-based Index of Thermophily, FItm. The VItm values are tested by comparison with the FItm values, and temperature data collected in the field during two growing seasons, and the differences are interpreted ecologically. Results Twenty-one of the mapped vegetation units were defined as thermophilous and categorized in five groups of temperature indicators. The VItm values showed a strong positive linear relationship with the temperatures measured during the years 2001 and 2002, with r(2) values of 0.79 and 0.85, respectively. The VItm values show a high linear relationship (r(2) = 0.76) with the 71 study units where the FItm values were calculated. As interpreted from the relationship with temperature measurements and FItm values, the vegetation-based method seems to work at a broad range of ecological conditions, with very dry, acidic sites being the most important exception. The VItm values are related to growing degree-days of a normal year, and the four subareas are mapped, showing a diversity of 13 bioclimatic classes. The birch forest line is estimated to occur at about 980 degrees C-days. The results show climatic gradients with temperatures increasing from the cold coast towards the interior, from wind-exposed convex hills towards wind-protected valleys, and from mountain plateaux towards south-facing lowlands. The north-easternmost study site at the coast is positioned within the arctic shrub tundra zone. Main conclusions The vegetation-based method shows a strong positive correlation both with measured temperatures and the floristic-based method within a broad range of different ecological conditions. The vegetation-based method has the potential for bioclimatic mapping of large areas in a cost-effective way. The floristic-based method has higher accuracy and is more flexible than the vegetation-based method, and the two methods seem to complement each other.																	0305-0270					JUL	2005	32	7					1161	1186		10.1111/j.1365-2699.2004.01199.x								WOS:000229705900006						
J	Gardel, A; Gratiot, N				Gardel, A; Gratiot, N			A satellite image-based method for estimating rates of mud bank migration, French Guiana, South America	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The muddy Guyanas coastline in South America experiences significant short-term change involving alternations of accretion and erosion as a result of the influence of mud from the Amazon River. In French Guiana, the dynamic changes due to mud banks permanently migrating alongshore have a considerable impact on both coastal ecology and economic activities. As a result, monitoring of these mud banks constitutes an important coastal management issue. In this article, focus is placed on the development of a method for the monitoring mud bank migration rates since 1986 between the coastal cities of Cayenne and Kourou, spaced 60 km apart and using for the first time high temporal resolution satellite images rather than aerial photographs. To achieve this, 16 satellite pour l'observation de la terre (SPOT) images and one Landsat image covering the period 1986-2002 were acquired and integrated in a geographical information system (GIS). Because of tidal range variation on this mesotidal coast, mud bank characteristics cannot be objectively quantified using classical methods. Mathematical processing of the satellite imagery data, including correction for tides, was performed to obtain a set of coherent data for analysis of parts of the mud bank associated with intertidal mudflat development, from which quantification rates of mud bank migration becomes feasible. Rates of long shore migration of the mud bank recorded up to 2002 are highly variable. The intertidal part of the bank has slowed down in the past years, resulting in a cross-shore extension of the bank. This slowdown occurred following a rate of migration much higher than those reported in the literature. Seasonal events are also recorded between 2001 and 2002. The variability in rates of migration deduced from the method reported in this study corroborates a pattern reported from earlier studies in Guyana, Surinam, and French Guiana based on more traditional methods' notably aerial photographs. This variability is tentatively attributed to changes in wind intensity and to local environmental parameters, such as coastline orientation, and the occurrence river estuary outflow and bedrock headlands.				gratiot, nicolas/G-8071-2016													0749-0208					JUL	2005	21	4					720	728		10.2112/03-0100.1								WOS:000230848800009

Landsat-5 thematic mapper (TM) and RADARSAT-1 fine mode (F1) imageries were evaluated for geomorphological information content. Particular interest was placed on the selective principal component-synthetic aperture radar (SPC-SAR) product, an alternative scheme for the fusion of TM bands with fine mode data through the combination of principal component and intensity-hue-saturation transforms. TM images have contributed to the enhancement of vegetation and sedimentary environments based on the optical response. Fine mode data have allowed the enhancement of differences between coastal vegetation heights and areas showing distinct moisture content. The SPC-SAR product represents a powerful tool for coastal geomorphological mapping, providing relevant information about geobotany and emergent and submergent coastal geomorphology. The results of this investigation have revealed significant geomorphological information, with 15 units mapped for the first time in the study area. The research is an additional step aimed at routinely using orbital optical and SAR products for resources assessment and management in this fragile environment of the Amazon region.

Local ethnobotanical uses of the mangrove forest and local perceptions about the status and recent development of the mangrove forest cover are also analyzed. The results of interviews with 54 inhabitants of four fishing villages in the study area indicated that, overall, Laguncularia racemosa is the most frequently used species in this region of the Mexican Pacific coast, where it serves as firewood and a construction material, particularly for walls and fences. The next-ranked species were Avicennia germinans, which is used for tea, and Rhizophora mangle, which is used for tanning; both these species also serve medicinal purposes. There was a discrepancy between the assessment of actual changes in the mangrove cover and what people perceived them to be. These findings are discussed from a socioeconomic ( utilization) and an ecological ( functionality) point of view and in relation to the use of remote sensing as a tool. The utilization pattern is also discussed against the background of mangrove cover variation.

J	Alphan, H; Yilmaz, KT				Alphan, H; Yilmaz, KT			Monitoring environmental changes in the Mediterranean coastal landscape: The case of Cukurova, Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												This paper describes a remote sensing approach used to monitor temporal land use/cover (LULC) changes in Cukurova, an extensive coastal plain in the southeast Mediterranean coast of Turkey. The area has varied terrain ranging from low-lying alluvial deposits to rocky hills and mountains characterized by limestone outcrops. The ecological and economic importance of the area can be attributed to the existence of important coastal ecosystems (e.g., wetlands and sand dunes) and a wide range of industries located along the eastern coast. Temporal charges in the coastal landscape between 1984 and 2000 were evaluated using digital interpretation of remotely sensed satellite data, Pairwise comparison methods were used to quantify changes from 1984 to 1993 and 1993 to 2000 using multitemporal Landsat TM and ETM+ images, acquired in 1984, 1993, and 2000, respectively. Total change area was 2448 ha from 1984 to 1993 and increased more than twofold, to 6072 ha from 1993 to 2000. Change trends were determined using the information provided from individual change detection outputs of different periods. The most prominent changes were estimated to have occurred in agriculture, urban, and natural vegetation cover. Agriculture has increasingly grown over marginal areas, whereas urban development occurred at the expense of prime croplands across both time steps.																	0364-152X					MAY	2005	35	5					607	619		10.1007/s00267-004-0222-7								WOS:000229970900007	15902445

Neither data collection, nor satellite images or model simulations alone were able to explain the observed spatial patterns and transport processes. Therefore, all these methods were combined to explain the dynamical features and to systematise them according to the typical local wind pattern and time series. The aim was to develop an instrument for regional authorities which supports the interpretation of coastal water monitoring data and forms a basis for an improved monitoring strategy. Satellite data of sea surface temperature and ocean colour from the sensors NOAAAVHRR and SeaWiFS were applied for synoptic investigations in the entire region and Landsat-7-ETM + for regional studies. Model simulations were performed for the western Baltic using a 3D model MOM-3 and for the Szczecin Lagoon using 2D model FEMFLOW. For the first time, regional particularities in the coastal dynamical features and processes are derived for the main wind directions and for transitions between dominant wind situations west and east as derived from wind statistics. The simulated transport of particles released from different coastal and open sea sources indicate the affected areas during changing forcing conditions. The results support the interpretation of acquired coastal monitoring data as well as the assessment and optimisation of the monitoring programme.

A combination of supervised and unsupervised classifications was used. These showed that Renosterveld was not definitively discernible using spectral techniques. Our final map suggested that 7.9% remained, mainly untransformed, within a region defined by combining the boundaries suggested by previous researchers (Cowling and Heijnis 2001, Low and Rebelo 1996). Using a predictive envelope based upon geological, pedological, altitudinal and rainfall data we estimated that 9.4% of the original extent of Renosterveld remained within the west coast lowlands. We examined boundary effects along the base of the Western Fold Mountains, and showed how soil mixing and coarse-scale maps had the potential to result in an 18.4% overestimate of the amount of spectrally-identified West Coast Renosterveld remaining.																	0254-6299					MAR	2005	71	1					67	75		10.1016/S0254-6299(15)30151-4								WOS:000228473100008

Some outbreaks in parts of the Dagang region, in the east coast of China, have caused drastic reductions in the yield of agricultural reeds and have created a severe threat to local and regional agriculture. Currently, the monitoring system for this species depends on field observations conducted by sparsely distributed observing stations established in the 1950s. This observation network was, in the past, successfully operated to identify major locust outbreaks. However, due to the expansion of infestation areas and the increase of locust density, spatial information technology was needed to establish a satellite sensor-based monitoring system for the East Asia migratory locust plagues. This Letter outlines the preliminary experimental work conducted in 2001 for a feasibility study in establishing a sensor-based locust monitoring system. In this experiment, sample statistics of biomass and leaf area index (LAI) from the affected and non-affected areas by locusts were calculated, and the spectra of field reed samples from both areas were also evaluated together with synchronous Landsat Enhanced. Thematic Mapper (ETM+) multi-spectral data. The study showed that satellite sensors may be used operationally to monitor locust damage.

J	Wiart, P; Oppenheimer, C				Wiart, P; Oppenheimer, C			Large magnitude silicic volcanism in north Afar: The Nabro Volcanic Range and Ma'alalta volcano	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												Much of the volcanological work carried out in north Afar ( Ethiopia and Eritrea) has focused on the nature of Quaternary basaltic volcanic ranges, which have been interpreted by some as incipient oceanic ridges. However, we show here that comparable volumes of silicic magmas have been erupted in the region. In particular, the virtually undocumented Nabro Volcanic Range, which runs NNE for more than 100 km from the margin of the Danakil Depression to the Red Sea coast, has a subaerial volume of the order of 550 km(3), comparable to the volume of the much better known Erta'Ale axial volcanic range. Nabro volcano itself forms part of an enigmatic double caldera structure with a neighbouring volcano, Mallahle. The twin caldera may have formed simultaneously with the eruption of between 20 and 100 km(3) of ignimbrite, which is readily identified in Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery. This may have been the largest explosive eruption in north Afar, and is certain to have deposited a regionally distributed tephra layer which could in the future be located in distal sections as a stratigraphic marker. An integrated analysis of optical and synthetic aperture radar imagery, digital topographic data, field observations and limited geochemical measurements, permits here descriptions and first order inferences about the structure, stratigraphy and compositions of several major volcanoes of the Afar Triangle, and a reappraisal of their regional significance.

The research was part of an African region initiative to demonstrate the practical application of geographic information for sustainable development. Remotely sensed images from close to 1990 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor and 2000 Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor and geographic information system (GIS) technologies are applied to discern changes in land cover and land use along the mainland Tanzania coast. Change detection results show that urban land area has increased dramatically. Mangrove forest area declined modestly, but field verification shows severe deterioration of their conditions near urban areas. While the area of dense woodland decreased, the area of open woodland and the area of woodland interspersed with agriculture increased. This study demonstrates how geospatial information science and technologies provide critical information and tools for coastal resource managers who work at the crossroads of resource use, land-cover change, poverty alleviation, and environmental management.																	0892-0753					JAN-MAR	2005	33	1					87	99		10.1080/08920750590883132								WOS:000226205800006						
J	Alphan, H				Alphan, H			Perceptions of coastline changes in river deltas: southeast Mediterranean coast of Turkey	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION												This paper describes a methodology that relies upon digital processing of remotely sensed satellite images to detect coastline changes in Cukurova Deltas, south east Mediterranean coast of Turkey. Two winter images of Landsat MSS and ETM+, acquired in 1972 and 2002, were clustered into "water" and "non-water" classes using the ISODATA algorithm prior to pixel-based comparison of land and water areas in two dates. The results of the study showed that significant changes occurred especially around river mouths, in the form of accretion and erosion. More than half of the total erosion along the sea coast, 153 of 347 ha, was detected to have occurred at the mouth of river Seyhan. The amount of accretion in Ceyhan delta was calculated as 203 ha. Importance of landscape-level characterization and monitoring that provide a basis for more detailed research and finer change detection was also highlighted.																	0957-4352						2005	23	1					92	102		10.1504/IJEP.2005.006398								WOS:000228547100007

This region has a diversity of metasedimentary rocks, granitic intrusives, felsic to intermediate volcanic rocks, and continental and marine sedimentary deposits. The TM 742 band combination on a RGB false color composite was the most revealing for lithologic discrimination of the main Neogene volcanic, and Quaternary sedimentary units overlying the metamorphic and granitic basement. An enhanced contrast between lithologic units was produced by the selective principal component analysis using the second components for the TM band pairs 5-7, 4-7 and 2-7 on a RGB false color composite. Through the reassignment and generalization of a supervised classification, we obtained 26 lithologic classes; thirteen Cenozoic volcanic rocks and intrusives, three pre-Cretaceous metamorphic units, and ten Plio-Quaternary sedimentary classes. The latter differ among each other by the source rocks and relative age. The resulting lithologic map of the supervised classification was evaluated using the confusion matrix and Kappa index (kappa). The map obtained a 79% confidence level, and kappa = 0.733, indicating that this map meets the evaluation criteria, and allow to us to recommend this methodology for geologic studies in desert areas.

The HOD is some 100 km wide and extends at least 500 km from the continental margin, thus ranking among the regionally important dike swarms on the South Atlantic margins. Field relations and radiometric dates indicate Early Cretaceous emplacement ages for the dikes, contemporary with Etendeka Group flood basalts and with the Damaraland intrusive complexes that occur in the same area. The orientation and distribution of dikes within the HOD suggest a strong influence by Damara Belt structures within the first 100 km from the coast. Farther inland, the dikes are more discordant to the Damara Belt and finally the swarm leaves the Damara Belt entirely and crosses into the Angola craton, where dikes fan out to the north and extend for at least another 200 km. Geochemical analysis of about 100 dikes distributed throughout the HOD reveals a compositional spectrum ranging from basalt to rhyolite, with the dominant composition being tholeiitic, low-Ti basalt. The basaltic dikes show some compositional diversity, but most can be assigned to known compositional subtypes of the Etendeka Group and are thus likely to represent feeder dikes to now-eroded lava fields. The silicic dikes have compositional variations (metaluminous to peraluminous, 64-76wt% SiO(2)) matching the range found in the Early Cretaceous Damaraland intrusive complexes, and they only marginally overlap with felsic volcanic units of the Etendeka. These dikes are probably related to the silicic magma systems of the Damaraland complexes. We interpret the HOD as the failed arm of a triple junction centered at the shelf edge off Walvis Bay. Late Cretaceous magmatism in Namibia is plume-related, but we believe the triple junction did not result from domal uplift above a plume. The triple junction coincides with the intersection of three Pan-African orogenic belts: the inland Damara Belt and the coast-parallel Gariep/Dom Feliciano Belt and Kaoko/Ribeira Belt. Mesozoic opening of the South Atlantic propagated northward from the Cape, and when rifting reached the inherited Proterozoic triple junction, extension and magmatism affected all three belts initially but the Damara Belt became inactive shortly thereafter and continental separation followed the coast-parallel belts.

J	Howari, FM				Howari, FM			Investigation of hydrocarbon pollution in the vicinity of United Arab Emirates coasts using visible and near infrared remote sensing data	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Influx of hydrocarbon contaminants to the coasts of United Arab Emirates is a serious environmental problem that threaten marine habitat. This paper presented two datasets to extract information on hydrocarbon pollution in marine environment utilizing visible to near infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The datasets used were Landsat ETM+ images for Dubai and Fujirah coasts, and experimental visible to near infrared spectra of petroleum hydrocarbon in water. The experimental spectra were measured using GER 3700 spectroradiometer. The study applied image analyses techniques and radiance ratios on corrected Landsat ETM+ images in order to detect oil spills from tankers. The reported results demonstrated proper bands or channels with techniques useful for oil spill detection using images of Landsat ETM+. The study found that radiances extracted from visible and near infrared images are useful to assess the thickness of hydrocarbon spills. The study also found that areas of thicker oil are slightly brighter because they suppress the signal from the underlying seawater. The spectra of GER 3700 provide potentials for identification of possible contaminants as well as classification within a particular hydrocarbon category (e.g. aromatics). The presented techniques hold promise for rapid analysis of petroleum hydrocarbons in marine environment.																	0749-0208					FAL	2004	20	4					1089	1095		10.2112/03-0023R.1								WOS:000225276900012						
J	Babiker, M; Gudmundsson, A				Babiker, M; Gudmundsson, A			The effects of dykes and faults on groundwater flow in an arid land: the Red Sea Hills, Sudan	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												In this study the focus is on a part of the Red Sea Hills of Sudan, an area which suffers from a severe shortage of groundwater. This shortage is partly because the precipitation in this area is very small, from a maximum of only 164 mm year(-1) to a minimum of 36 mm year(-1). Partly, however, the shortage is related to the generally low permeability of the (mostly Precambrian but partly Phanerozoic) bedrock. The bedrock is, however, dissected by numerous lineaments, mostly faults and basaltic dykes, some of which transport groundwater to the surface in springs and wells. We made field studies of 107 dykes, complemented by Landsat ETM and SPOT image studies of 1419 lineaments interpreted as dykes. Additionally, we made image studies of 1707 lineaments interpreted as faults, fractures and shear zones many of which meet with the dykes at nearly right angles. Many of the dykes are of dense, low-permeability basalt and range in thickness up to 14 m and in length up to several kilometres. The dominant dyke strike is NNW, roughly parallel with the coast of the Red Sea and perpendicular to the topographic slope and the trends of many of the lineaments interpreted as faults. Using the field and image data, as well as a new digital elevation model of the study area, we propose a conceptual model to explain the relationship between faults, dykes and groundwater in the area. In this model the NNW-trending dykes, particularly the long and thick low-permeability dykes, act as barriers for much of the topography-driven groundwater flow. The groundwater collected by these dykes is transported along their margins towards the topographic depressions occupied by the (comparatively) high-permeability E-W trending fault zones. Because these fault zones trend parallel with the inferred hydraulic gradient in the area the faults also tend to collect groundwater. In terms of the model groundwater is thus driven along both dykes and faults to their near-orthogonal intersections. These intersections normally have relatively high fracture-related permeability, along which groundwater is transported towards the surface. This model thus predicts that water wells and springs would be expected at dyke - fault intersections, which is in agreement with the available data indicating that the majority of the springs occur at such intersections.

Cleveland, Alaska	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH					Fall Meeting of the American-Geophysical-Union	DEC 10-14, 2001	SAN FRANCISCO, CA	Amer Geophys Union				Satellite data were the primary source of information for the eruption of Mt. Cleveland, Alaska on 19 February, and 11 and 19 March 2001. Multiple data sets were used pre-, syn- and post-eruption to mitigate the hazard and determine an eruption chronology. The 19 February eruption was the largest of the three, resulting in a volcanic cloud that formed an arc over 1000 km long, moved to the NE across Alaska and was tracked using satellite data over more than a 50-h period. The volcanic cloud was "concurrently" detected on the GOES, AVHRR and MODIS data at various times and their respective signals compared. All three sensors detected a cloud that had a very similar shape and position but there were differences in their areal extent and internal structural detail. GOES data showed the largest volcanic cloud in terms of area, probably due to its oblique geometry. MODIS bands 31 and 32, which are comparable to GOES and AVHRR thermal infrared wavelengths, were the least effective single channels at detecting the volcanic cloud of those investigated (MODIS bands 28, 29, 31 and 32). MODIS bands 28 and 29 detected the largest volcanic clouds that could easily be distinguished from weather clouds. Of the split-window data, MODIS bands 29 minus band 32 detected the largest cloud, but the band 31 minus band 32 data showed the volcanic cloud with the most internal structural detail. The Puff tracking model accurately tracked the movement, and predicted the extent and shape of this complex cloud even into areas beyond satellite detection. Numerous thermal anomalies were also observed during the eruption on the twice-daily AVHRR data and the high spatial-resolution Landsat data. The high-resolution Radarsat data showed that the AVHRR thermal anomalies were due to lava and debris flow features and a newly formed fan along the west coast of the island. Field observations and images from a hand-held Forward Looking Infrared Radiometer (FLIR) showed that the flow features were a a lava, debris flows and a warm debris fan along the west coast. Real-time satellite data were the primary tool used to monitor the eruption, track changes and to mitigate hazards. High-resolution data, even though coverage is infrequent, were critical in helping to identify volcanic processes and to compile an eruption chronology. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ryu, JH; Na, YH; Won, JS; Doerffer, R				Ryu, JH; Na, YH; Won, JS; Doerffer, R			A critical grain size for Landsat ETM+ investigations into intertidal sediments: a case study of the Gomso tidal flats, Korea	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Remote sensing combined with a field survey is an effective method of monitoring intertidal sediments. The 0.0625 mm grain size has long been used as a critical one, and the percentage of grains larger than the critical grain size has been widely used to classify tidal flat deposits. The remote sensing community has applied this principle to interpret optical remote sensing images without a detailed understanding of the correlation between grain size and the remotely sensed data. This paper aims to establish a new critical grain size effective for Landsat enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM +) data. The influence of water content and topography on the spectral reflectance is also investigated. Tests were undertaken in the Gomso Bay tidal flats, Korea. Critical grain size tests were conducted for particles measuring 0.0625 mm, 0.125 mm, and 0.25 mm, which revealed that a critical grain size of 0.25 mm rather than 0.0625 mm was a more effective standard. Surface water and interstitial water content were considered for their influence on optical reflectance, as Landsat ETM + imaging is more responsive of the former. The 5, 7, and 4 ETM + bands responded to surface water cover with a correlation coefficient of 0.90, 0.82, and 0.63, respectively. The interstitial water content related well to grain size with correlation coefficients of -0.59 for 0.0625 mm, -0.62 for 0.125 mm, and -0.81 for 0.25 mm. A linear model was derived for the ETM + band 4 data based on a 0.25 mm critical grain size whist employing the principal component analysis method. The R-2 value obtained was 0.85. Sediments with grain sizes less than 20% of 0.25 mm, or larger grains, did not fit the model. Anomalies were interpreted as the effect of local topographic features. Employing Landsat data for intertidal sediment studies is indicated using the ETM + band 4 and a target critical grain size of 0.25 mm. Surface sediment classification based on remotely sensed data must circumspectly consider an effective critical grain size, water content, local topography, and intertidal structures.

J	Barber, DG; Hanesiak, JM				Barber, DG; Hanesiak, JM			Meteorological forcing of sea ice concentrations in the southern Beaufort Sea over the period 1979 to 2000	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Northern Hemisphere sea ice areal extent, and perhaps thickness, have shown a detectable reduction over the past several decades. This situation is particularly apparent in the southern Beaufort Sea. The region encompassing the Mackenzie Shelf, the Cape Bathurst Polynya, and the Canada Basin mobile pack ice all occur in a region referred to here as the Canadian Arctic Shelf Exchange study area ( CASES). In this paper we present results from an analysis of atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean coupling over the period 1979 to 2000 as a means of setting a physical science context for the CASES research network (operating over the period 2001-2005). Results show that the Cape Bathurst Polynya complex can be considered as a recurrent polynya; particularly the flaw leads associated with the early opening of the polynya. The Polynya appears to be a consequence of the Beaufort Sea Gyre acting like an ice bridge and a series of flaw leads creating conditions conducive to oceanic upwelling. The sea ice average areal extent has been decreasing in this region over the period 1979 to 2000. Large regional reductions are found ( 1) north of the Yukon and Alaska Coasts in the region between the Canada Basin pack ice and the landfast sea ice and ( 2) at the eastern limit of the Cape Bathurst Polynya in Amundsen Gulf. The meteorological forcing of sea ice anomalies occurs through a full range of timescales and space scales. At hemispheric scales a statistical cross-correlation analysis between weekly sea ice concentration anomalies and the Arctic Oscillation accounts for a maximum of about 25 percent of the explained variance and show a surprising spatial coherence in correlation magnitudes both within the study area and northward along the Canadian Archipelago coast. At local scales, positive and negative concentration anomaly periods can be explained through local-scale advective processes associated with regional-scale sea level pressure, 500 hPa geopotential heights, and surface temperature anomalies.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				JUN 12	2004	109	C6							C06014	10.1029/2003JC002027								WOS:000222086500001						
J	Erkkila, A; Kalliola, R				Erkkila, A; Kalliola, R			Patterns and dynamics of coastal waters in multi-temporal satellite images: support to water quality monitoring in the Archipelago Sea, Finland	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The Archipelago Sea in the northern Baltic is a coastal region with A highly dynamic water flow regime, where the need for a methodology to monitor water quality accurately is encountered. In order to contribute to the development of an appropriate strategy to meet this need, the dynamics of the surface waters in the region were analysed using data from six Landsat TM/ETM + images from the late 1990s. Single images were enhanced by principal component transformation and multi-temporal image combination was based on unsupervised classification. The visual patterns discernible in the single images as well as the classification result of the multi-temporal data were compared with the reference data from long-term water quality analyses (Secchi disk depth and chlorophyll-a). The satellite images confirmed dynamic surface flow patterns in the region, indicating gradual and abrupt gradients in water quality, flow directions and forms. These patterns suggest short-term variability in the surface water quality within the region, presenting a challenge for water monitoring. The average Secchi depths increased gradually from the mainland coast until ca. 3-5 in near the open sea. The spatial distribution of chlorophyll-a was found to be more homogeneous, ca. 2-4 mug l(-1). The importance of evaluating the location of an in situ sampling site in relation to the surrounding hydrographic realm is pronounced in regions where field sampling and other monitoring methods remain insufficient in their ability to reflect water quality patterns credibly. In such areas, accurate and cost-effective water quality monitoring and forecasting require an integrated monitoring system, consisting of space and airborne surveillance, field surveys and hydrodynamic modelling.

J	Levin, N; Ben-Dor, E; Karnieli, A				Levin, N; Ben-Dor, E; Karnieli, A			Topographic information of sand dunes as extracted from shading effects using Landsat images	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Topographic variations affect the reflectance properties of the Earth's surface and are often removed in remote sensing studies, especially when significant terrain variations exist. In this study, however, we show that shading effects assessed by Landsat can be treated as a signal that stores important topographic information, especially when the spectral characteristics of a surface are homogenous. The coastal transverse dunes of the Ashdod area, and the desert linear dunes of Nizzana. (both located in Israel), were selected to investigate the abovementioned idea. The dune heights in these areas are 10 m on average (relative to their surroundings) and have maximum slopes of 33degrees. An innovative method for extracting slope, aspect, and height data for sand dunes using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images was developed, based on the regularity and periodicity of dunes' landscapes. Using two Landsat images representing different sun zenith and azimuth angles, reflectance values of each image were converted to cos(i) values (i=incident angle between the surface normal and the solar beam radiation), applying histogram matching methods. The slope and aspect of each pixel were determined as those that give the best prediction of the observed value of cos(i). Height profiles were then extracted, using simple trigonometric relationships. The accuracies of heights and slopes along selected profile lines were to the order of 1 m and 3degrees, respectively (at a spatial resolution of 15 in). Best results were obtained when the images included one from the summer and the other from the winter, corresponding to maximum difference in solar zenith and azimuth angles. Errors in heights were attributed to surface heterogeneity (e.g., presence of biogenic soil crusts in the rainy season), geometric correction errors, cast shadows, and Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) effects. Comparison to Advanced Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) 3D information showed that the proposed method is better in representing the topographic variation of the area than the digital elevation model (DEM) produced by ASTER.

Regional case studies are presented that cover a variety of glacial systems distributed over the northern Antarctic Peninsula and provide data on glacier front variations during the period 1986-2002. The results confirm a general trend of regional glacier front recession, but a range of different glacier variations are observed throughout the study area. Areas of predominant retreat are located in the northeastern and southwestern sectors, while stationary ice fronts characterize glacial behaviour on the northwestern coast of the peninsula. In addition, a significant increase in glacier recession is identified on James Ross Island, where retreat rates doubled during the period 1988-2001 compared to the previous investigation period, 1975-88. These observations are interpreted as being direct consequences of the rapidly changing climate in the region, which differentially affects the local accumulation and ablation patterns of the glacial systems.

The land-water interface comprising of coastal zone is modified all the time by oceanic currents, waves and tidal oscillations. The sediments are brought into the creeks from the erosion prone open coast beaches as well as through small rivers and inlets, and dispersed and deposited along the coast. Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS) due to its repetitive, multi-spectral and synoptic nature provides a unique view to recognize various features on land and sea. SRS techniques can be of great help in collection of continuous wave currents, wind, tides, suspended matter, shallow water area, wetlands, mangroves, mudflats and other coastal features and coastal changes, like land accretion or erosion. Therefore, a study has been undertaken to monitor geomorphological changes along the coast of Karachi using multi-temporal Landsat MSS and TM data from 1978 to 1998. SRS data were processed using interactive digital image processing/enhancement techniques like colour enhancement, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and by Colour draping techniques and different enhanced products of the area have been prepared. The multi-temporal PC analysis results were integrated with each other and with navigational map of the area by GIS technique. The geomorphological changes occurring at the middle part of the coast of Karachi along Bundal and Buddo Islands and in Korangi-Phitti Creek area were delineated. The integrated techniques applied on multi-temporal SRS data in this study were found very useful for monitoring and mapping the land accretion and erosion processes. The analyses provided the old as well as the most recent data base of coastal environmental conditions of the study area, which may led for better understanding of coastal processes and help for planning reclamation work in this area.

J	Leigh, DS; Srivastava, P; Brook, GA				Leigh, DS; Srivastava, P; Brook, GA			Late Pleistocene braided rivers of the Atlantic Coastal Plain, USA	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Infrared Landsat imagery (band 4) clearly reveals braided river patterns on late Pleistocene terraces of unglaciated rivers in the Atlantic Coastal Plain of the southeastern United States, a region that presently exhibits meandering patterns that have existed throughout the Holocene. These Pleistocene braided patterns provide a unique global example of river responses to late Quaternary climate changes in an unglaciated humid subtropical region at 30-35degrees north latitude. Detailed morphological and chronological results are given for the Oconee-Altamaha River valley in Georgia and for the Pee Dee River valley in South Carolina, including 15 optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates and four radiocarbon dates. Correlative examples are drawn from additional small to large rivers in South- and North Carolina. OSL and radiocarbon (C-14) dates indicate distinct braiding at 17-30 ka, within oxygen isotope stage 2 (OIS 2), and braiding probably existed at least during parts of OIS 3 and possibly OIS 4 back to ca 70ka. The chronology suggests that braiding is the more common pattern for the late Quaternary in the southeastern United States. Braided terraces appear to have been graded to lower sea-levels and are onlapped by Holocene floodplain deposits up to 10-60 km from the coast. The braiding probably reflects the response of discharge and sediment yield to generally cooler and drier paleoclimates, which may have had a pronounced runoff season. Sedimentation of eolian dunes on the braid plains is coeval with braiding and supports the conclusion of dry soils and thin vegetation cover during the late Pleistocene. Our chronological data contribute to a body of literature indicating that reliable OSL age estimates can be obtained from quartz-rich bed load sand from braided rivers, based on good correlations with both radiocarbon dates from braided fluvial sediment and OSL dates from stratigraphically correlative eolian sand.

J	Evans, J; Cofaigh, CO				Evans, J; Cofaigh, CO			Supraglacial debris along the front of the Larsen-A Ice Shelf, Antarctic Peninsula	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Semi-continuous, linear accumulations of poorly-sorted debris are present on the surface of the remnant Larsen-A Ice Shelf, Antarctic Peninsula. These accumulations form a complex of debris bands extending parallel to the front of the ice shelf for several kilometres. Landsat imagery shows that the debris bands originated as lateral moraines along the Nordenskjold Coast. Almost 80% of clasts sampled from these debris accumulations have shape/roundness characteristics consistent with glacier transport in the zone of basal traction. Angular and very angular clasts account for 15% and 22% of clasts in the pebble- and cobble/boulder-sized fractions, respectively, and originated by rockfall from valley/nunatak sides, with subsequent passive glacier transportation. Lithological analysis indicates that the debris is derived locally from the Nordenskjold Coast, Cape Fairweather region and interior of the Antarctic Peninsula. Episodic melt-out and resedimentation of this debris from the front of the ice shelf would deliver pulses of coarse-grained sediment to the sea floor. Therefore, coarse-grained debris can also be released along the calving margin of small polar ice shelves fringing mountainous terrain, and could potentially be confused with sediment deposited at the grounding line of Antarctic ice-shelves. Sedimentological criteria to differentiate between these environments are proposed in this paper.

J	Harris, R				Harris, R			Remote sensing of agriculture change in Oman	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												This paper uses Landsat Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS) data from 1978 and Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) data from 2000 to assess agriculture change in two test areas of the Batinah coast of Oman. Field work was carried out in 1979 and 2001 in the Khaburah and Sohar regions to support the analysis of the Earth observation data. Unsupervised and supervised classifications are explored to produce maps of environmental change, and from these maps estimates of agriculture area are produced. While there has been substantial and clear agriculture change in the test areas, stimulated by Oman's rapid economic change since 1970, the measurement of these changes presents challenges that are common to many remote sensing investigations of arid and semi-arid regions. The paper identifies the main areas and types of agriculture change in the two test regions.

J	O'Hara, CG; King, JS; Cartwright, JH; King, RL				O'Hara, CG; King, JS; Cartwright, JH; King, RL			Multitemporal land use and land cover classification of urbanized areas within sensitive coastal environments	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												In the presented methodology, multitemporal Landsat images were used to develop enhanced information about complex assemblages of vegetation and patterns of seasonal land cover variability, thereby facilitating improved land use and land cover (LULC) classification of urbanized areas among sensitive environments along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. For Landsat-5 and Landsat-7 images acquired for leaf-off and leaf-on conditions for 1991 and 2000, exploratory spectral analyses and field studies were conducted to detect and analyze patterns of spectral variability in land cover observed in the multitemporal image data. Patterns were identified of seasonal spectral data changes associated with seasonal vegetation changes for known land cover and land use types, thus characterizing patterns of seasonal LULC thematic change for the area. Detected seasonal variability for known land use and land cover types were used to develop formal classification rules based upon a thematic-change logic table. An image subset area based on United States Geological Survey (USGS) 1 : 24,000 quadrangles was used to develop a class-learning area within which unsupervised classification results were grouped into thematic classes. Signature riles from the unsupervised classification results were applied to classify the balance of the study area. Individual images were classified for leaf-off and leaf-on conditions and thematic-change analyses were conducted. The formal class rules based on thematic-change logic were applied resulting in a classification that provided a level one accuracy exceeding 90 % and a level two accuracy exceeding 85 %.

Basins are wet depositional environments, ideally suited for the accumulation and preservation of organic material. Much of this soil organic carbon (SOC) is currently sequestered in the near-surface permafrost but, under a warming scenario, could become mobilized. The relative age of 77 basins on the Barrow Peninsula was estimated using the degree of plant community succession and verified by radiocarbon-dating material collected from the base of the organic layer in 21 basins. Using Landsat-7+ imagery of the region, a neural network classifying algorithm was developed from basin age-dependent spectra and texture. About 22% of the region is covered by 592 lakes (>1 ha), and at least 50% of the land surface is covered by 558 drained lake basins. Analysis of cores collected from basins indicates that (1) organic layer thickness and the degree of organic matter decomposition generally increases with basin age, and (2) SOC in the surface organic layer tends to increase with basin age, but the relation for the upper 100 cm of soil becomes obscured due to cryoturbation, organic matter decomposition, and processes leading to ice enrichment in the upper permafrost.																	1523-0430					AUG	2003	35	3					291	300		10.1657/1523-0430(2003)035[0291:SEAACS]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000185999300003						
J	Tobler, MW; Cochard, R; Edwards, PJ				Tobler, MW; Cochard, R; Edwards, PJ			The impact of cattle ranching on large-scale vegetation patterns in a coastal savanna in Tanzania	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. The success of large-scale cattle ranching in African savanna vegetation has often been limited by problems of bush encroachment and disease (in particular trypanosomiasis spread by tsetse flies). Mkwaja Ranch, occupying an area of 462 km(2) on the coast of Tanzania, is a recent example of a large ranching enterprise that failed within the savanna environment. It was closed in 2000 after 48 years of operation. In this paper we describe the main vegetation types of the area (excluding closed forest vegetation) and relate their patterns of distribution to the former use of the ranch for cattle. 2. The study area comprised the former ranch and parts of the adjacent Saadani Game Reserve, which had not been grazed by cattle for many years and had never been used for large-scale ranching. Following field surveys, 15 distinct types of grassland and bush vegetation were defined and a vegetation map was created using a Landsat TM satellite image. A multispectral classification using the maximum likelihood algorithm gave good results and enabled all 15 vegetation types to be distinguished on the map. 3. Two main spatial trends were detected in the vegetation. One was a large-scale decrease in the cover of bushland from the most intensively used parts of the ranch through more extensively used areas to the game reserve; this trend was attributed to differences in management history as well as to climatic and topographic factors. A second trend was a radial vegetation pattern associated with the enclosures where cattle were herded at night. High amounts of three bushland types [dominated by (i) Acacia zanzibarica , (ii) Dichrostachys cinerea , Acacia nilotica or Acacia mellifera and (iii) Terminalia spinosa ] occurred in a zone between 300 and 2500 m from the paddocks, with a peak in bush density at about 900 m (mean value for 18 paddocks). In contrast, bushland dominated by Hyphaene compressa was scarce close to the paddocks and became more abundant with distance. There was also a radial trend in the grassland communities: close to the paddocks there was short grass vegetation containing many ruderals and invasive weedy species, while the tall grassland types with species such as Hyperthelia dissoluta and Cymbopogon caesius occurred further away in the areas less affected by cattle. 4. Synthesis and applications. The intensive modern livestock ranching as practised on Mkwaja Ranch proved to be unsustainable both economically and ecologically. In the end, the biggest problem faced by the ranch managers was not controlling disease, as had originally been feared, but preventing the spread of bush on pasture land. The results of our study demonstrate just how severe the problem of bush encroachment was, especially in areas close to paddocks. An important lesson for management is that grazing patterns need to be taken into consideration when determining the sustainable stocking rate for an area. To reduce the risk of bush encroachment in grazing systems with focal points such as paddocks or watering points, stocking rates need to be lower than in systems with a more uniform grazing distribution.																	0021-8901					JUN	2003	40	3					430	444		10.1046/j.1365-2664.2003.00816.x								WOS:000183283400002

J	Hinkler, J; Orbaek, JB; Hansen, BU				Hinkler, J; Orbaek, JB; Hansen, BU			Detection of spatial, temporal, and spectral surface changes in the Ny-Alesund area 79 degrees N, Svalbard, using a low cost multispectral camera in combination with spectroradiometer measurements	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH					6th International Scientific Seminar on Changing Physical Environment	OCT 08-10, 2002	TROMSO, NORWAY					Changes in surface reflection at the arctic tundra at Ny-(A) over circle lesund, Svalbard (79degrees N) were monitored during the melting season 2002 using a low cost multispectral digital camera with spectral channels similar to channels 2, 3, and 4 of the Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite sensor. The camera was placed 474 m above sea level at the Zeppelin Mountain Research Station and was programmed to take an image automatically every day at solar noon. To achieve areal consistency in the images (which is necessary for mapping purposes) the images were geometrically rectified into multispectral digital orthophotos. In contrast to satellite images with high spatial resolution the orthophotos provide data with high spatial and high temporal resolution at low cost. The study area covers approximately 2 kin 2 and when free of snow, it mainly consists of typical high arctic tundra with patchy vegetation and bare-soil in between. The spectral information in the images was used to divide the rectified images into maps representing different surface classes (including three subclasses of snow). By combining classified image data and ground measurements of spectral surface reflectance, a methodology to produce daily maps of surface albedo was developed. The method takes into account the effect of decreasing snow-albedo with ageing snow pack, and the very rapid decrease of albedo when the snow pack is shallow (<10 cm) which is due to influence from the underlying ground. The time series of modelled albedo-maps shows that the snow melt period (when the albedo decreases from 80% to 20%) varies from less than 10 days in areas near the coast or in the Ny-(A) over circle lesund settlement till more than 70 days in areas with large snow or ice accumulations. For the entire study area the mean length of the 2002 melting period was 28.3 days with a standard deviation of 15.1 days. Finally, the duration of the snowmelt season at a location where it has been measured routinely since 1980, was calculated to 23 days, which is very close to what is the average for the last two decades.

J	Harvey, KR; Hill, GJE				Harvey, KR; Hill, GJE			Mapping the nesting habitats of saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) in Melacca Swamp and the Adelaide River wetlands, Northern Territory: an approach using remote sensing and GIS	WILDLIFE RESEARCH												The utility of integrating remotely sensed data and other spatial information in a geographical information system (GIS) to model habitat suitability for nesting by saltwater crocodiles ( Crocodylus porosus) was investigated in this study. The study areas, Melacca Swamp and the Adelaide River wetlands, are located 50 km east of Darwin, Northern Territory, and encompass areas of suitable nesting habitat for C. porosus. Melacca Swamp is a highly productive nesting area and is managed as a conservation reserve to protect its nesting habitat. Landsat TM, SPOT satellite imagery and large-scale colour aerial photography were evaluated for their utility in mapping habitats preferred for nesting by C. porosus within Melacca Swamp. Satellite imagery was capable of identifying generalised habitat classes used for nesting ( e. g. open swamp with emergent trees). However, it was only with aerial photography that habitats could be discerned ( e. g. sedges with scattered Melaleuca trees). Spatial information derived from satellite imagery and other sources was integrated in a GIS to model potentially suitable nesting habitat along the Adelaide River. This methodology effectively identified known preferred nesting areas of C. porosus on the basis of the analysis of environmental parameters (i.e. distance to water, vegetation type) that have an influence on selection of nesting habitat. The findings of this research demonstrate the utility of remote sensing and GIS for mapping nesting habitat of C. porosus at a range of scales and provide guidelines for application of the approaches used at the regional or State level.																	1035-3712						2003	30	4					365	375		10.1071/WR00008								WOS:000185267400007						
J	Ryu, JH; Won, JS; Min, KD				Ryu, JH; Won, JS; Min, KD			Waterline extraction from Landsat TM data in a tidal flat - A case study in Gomso Bay, Korea	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Waterline extraction is potentially one of the most effective satellite remote sensing tools for studying changes in tidal flat environment and coastlines. However, its application to the study of tidal flats has not been investigated in detail. The waterline in a tidal flat in Gomso Bay, Korea is characterized and evaluated using 27 sets of Landsat thematic mapper (TM) and Earth Observing System-Terra (EOS-Terra) Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Radiometer (ASTER) data. Ground truth data including grain size, soil moisture content, ground levelling, and waterline tracking have been obtained. The choice of spectral bands in terms of tidal conditions turned out to play a key role in locating the waterline. While the waterlines extracted from near-infrared (NIR), short-wavelength infrared (SWIR), and thermal infrared (TIR) data are commonly reliable on the flood tide, the discrepancies between different bands become large on the ebb tide. The bands TIR, NIR, and SWIR are, in that order, decreasingly effective in extracting the waterline while ebb tides are in progress. The effect of turbid water on NIR can be reduced by a ratioing of NIR and the visible band. The location of the waterline is also an important factor to consider; the discrepancy is largest on the middle tidal flat. Selection of the proper band for waterline extraction under various conditions is suggested. However, no single band can accommodate all aspects of the tidal flat environment. A schematic model associated with the spectral reflectance of the tidal flat is proposed in which the remnant water scattered on the surface after exposure is emphasized as an additional factor.

Interaction between Catchment Basin Management and Coastal Evolution (Southern Italy)	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The research highlights the consequence of an imbalance between "basin management scale" and "coastal management areas" and investigates the relationship between coastline erosion and natural evolution of the inland system at the short-medium timescale while taking account of local climatic changes and sea level rise. The study was undertaken in the Bradano and Basento catchment basins, on the Ionian coast of Basilicata Region (Southern Italy) through an institutional agreement between ENEA (the National Agency for New Technologies) and the Italian Ministry of Environment. In this area previous studies highlighted an important erosional coastline trend that began about 1950. No previous study has considered the role of the coastal river catchment area in this erosion. With this aim, contemporary data for coastal and inland evolution were gathered and compared, implementing existing knowledge with land use analysis in the Bradano and Basento basins using multitemporal Landsat TM Images. For the coastal zone, the analysis was carried out at a more detailed scale using different cartographic sources mainly at 1:10.000 scale spanning the past 45 years. The hydrographic network data was analysed to consider fluvial solid transport, dams, locks, and historical precipitation data series. The land use changes analysis has focused on inland features related to the desertification process, rainfall intensity and climatic changes. These features have been analysed mainly in relation to their contribution to soil erosion and subsequent sediment supply availability. Analysis of the coastline focused on changes in beaches, dunes and backshore areas.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				FAL	2002					36		81	88										WOS:000209071900010						
J	Thomas, A; Byrne, D; Weatherbee, R				Thomas, A; Byrne, D; Weatherbee, R			Coastal sea surface temperature variability from Landsat infrared data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												A time series of 23 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) band 6 thermal infrared images over the period 1986-1996 is used to quantify variability of sea surface temperature (SST) along the central coast of Maine, a morphologically complex region of bays, estuaries, and islands. An iterative regression scheme using coregistered, temporally coincident, daily composites of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Pathfinder SST data is used to scale the TM digital numbers in each scene to SST, approximating an atmospheric correction. This approach provides temporally concurrent match-ups, even for Landsat scenes more than 10 years old and over 1000 data points to most regressions. Analysis of the TM scenes by year-day delivers temporal resolution sufficient for insight into overall seasonal pattern and allows identification of recurring seasonal features within the study area. The dominant seasonal patterns is a cross-shelf SST gradient of coldest water nearshore in winter which reverses sign in summer and disappears in spring and fall. Differences in summer SST are evident between four adjacent bays, attributable to differences in residual circulation, freshwater input, and flushing. Recurrent frontal zones evident in summer are identified and compare well to available but noncoincident in situ hydrographic data. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

J	El-Asmar, HM				El-Asmar, HM			Short term coastal changes along Damietta-Port Said coast northeast of the Nile Delta, Egypt	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Landsat Thematic Mapper images (TM) covered the coastline between Damietta and Port Said, taken at intervals in 1984, 1987 and 1991, were used to detect shoreline changes. When combined with geomorphological and sedimentological data, the remote sensing data enable the classification of the coastline into five segments, based on whether erosional or depositional process domains dominate them. Although the 30m spatial resolution of the satellite TM data precludes precise calculation of rates of change, they do enable erosional and accretionary coastline segments of the Damietta Port Said coast to be recognised over these time scales. Segments 1 and 2 are erosional with an average shoreline recession of -41.4 m yr(-1), and -19.3 m yr(-1) respectively. Segment 3, Damietta spit, is an accretionary segment with an average shoreline advance of 81.4 m yr(-1). Segment 4, El-Deiba, experienced erosion in the period 1984-1987, with an average shoreline recession of -17 m yr(-1), but appears to have been stable over most of its length during the period 1987-1991, with observed declaration in the rate of shoreline recession to be -2.5 m yr(-1). Segment 5, El-Gamiel, was stable during the period 1984-1987, but due to the construction of projecting jetties around the mouth of the inlet and the subsequent interruption of the sediment transport supply, the coastline became accretionary updrift of the inlet (west) and erosional downdrift (east). Granulometric and heavy mineral analyses show significant differences between beach face sediment samples collected from the different coastline segments. The erosional segments are characterised by coarser sands and high concentrations of heavy minerals; while the accretionary segments are composed of finer sands with lower concentrations of heavy minerals. Poor coastal management strategies and the shortage of data on geomorphological processes along the coast has resulted in constructions taking place along sections of erosional coastline, requiring subsequent expensive defence measures. Moreover, these results have implication for future development on onshore facilities after the recent discovery of oil and gas reserves offshore.																	0749-0208					SUM	2002	18	3					433	441										WOS:000177756400003						
J	El-Asmar, HM				El-Asmar, HM			Holocene palaeoshorelines along the Manzala lagoon, northeast of the Nile Delta, Egypt	NEUES JAHRBUCH FUR GEOLOGIE UND PALAONTOLOGIE-MONATSHEFTE												Lithofacies analysis alongside image processing and interpretation of Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery have enabled the classification of islands in the Manzala lagoon, Nile Delta, Egypt, into two groups. The first group, found in the northern (seaward) part of the lagoon, consists of accreted sandy ridges, which have developed parallel to the present shoreline (NW-SE to NNW-SSE). They originated from spits derived from sediments delivered by the Damietta branch of the Nile, and were carried eastward by prevailing longshore currents. The second group, found in the south of the lagoon, consists of sinuous muddy ridges, which have developed normal to the present shoreline (WNW-ESE to NNE-SSW). They originated from chenier ridges, or remains of raised banks of former Nile branches. At least five palaeoshorelines were mapped from the satellite imagery using edge-finding technique and were verified during the field observations. They formed during the last 6000 years BP in close relationship to the Nile discharge and sea-level oscillations during the Holocene. An average subsidence rate of 3.5 mm yr(-1) is inferred, based on measurements and thermoluminescence dating of archaeological sites at Tennis island. This rate concurs with the results of other researches.																	0028-3630					JUN	2002		6					337	361										WOS:000176118800002

A spatially explicit characterization of clear-cut logging and wildfire is a prerequisite to understanding the causes and consequences of disturbance in this region. We analyzed stand replacement disturbance over 4.6 million forested hectares of three major provinces in western Oregon between 1972 and 1995, contrasting the relative amounts of wildfire and harvest in each province and comparing harvest statistics among the dominant land ownership categories. Clear-cut harvest and wildfire occurred over 19.9% and 0.7% of the study area, respectively. The moist Coast Range Province (CRP) was dominated by private industrial (PI) ownerships and had the greatest concentration of cutting. The relatively dry Klamath Mountains Province (KMP) and the climatically moderate Western Cascades Province (WCP) were dominated by public landowners and had lower concentrations of cutting and larger amounts of wildfire than the CRP. Rates of harvest over time generally followed similar trends across landowners; it was lowest in the early 1970s, peaked in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and then decreased to near 1970s levels by the mid-1990s. PI landowners had harvest rates that were about two and one-half times as high as public owners throughout the study period. Public and private nonindustrial (PNI) owners tended to have relatively small cutting units that remained spatially dispersed throughout the study period, whereas the PI owners had larger individual cutting units that tended toward spatial aggregation over time. Comparing the managed disturbance regimes with historical wild disturbance regimes can help us to understand the relative impact of management regimes on ecosystems.																	1432-9840					MAR	2002	5	2					122	137		10.1007/s10021-001-0060-X								WOS:000175429400002						
J	Donoghue, DNM; Mironnet, N				Donoghue, DNM; Mironnet, N			Development of an integrated geographical information system prototype for coastal habitat monitoring	COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES					Workshop on Intelligent Methods for Processing Space and Time-Related Data	1999	MAGDEBURG, GERMANY					This paper describes a prototype Integrated Geographical Information System (IGIS) developed for coastal habitat monitoring. It outlines the advantages and technical difficulties involved in combining specialist image processing functionality within the LaserScan IGIS software so that it could be used routinely by ecologists. The Coastal Habitat Information Monitoring System prototype set out to demonstrate the feasibility of using remotely sensed imagery for the routine mapping of important coastal habitats in the European Union. The prototype aims to provide an integrated software system to transform Earth Observation data into specialist map products. Normally such processing requires input from remote sensing scientists using specialist software and is not easily accessible to end-users. In principle, the methodology allows different satellite and airborne multi-spectral image data to be used to produce specialist coastal habitat maps. In this paper Landsat TM and IRS 1C LISS 3 data are evaluated and shown to be suitable for mapping the inter-tidal habitats of the Wash estuary on the East Coast of England. A strategic objective of study was to test the feasibility of incorporating all the processing functionality into a single integrated geographical information system. The project concluded satellite data from existing sensor systems can provide habitat data at a good level of detail but that to develop a fully operational processing capability would require considerable development of even the most advanced of the existing commercially available IGIS software package.

Digital analysis of a Landsat TM satellite image and field measurements were used to assess vegetation and substrate. The 14 breeding colonies ranged in size from 13 to 96,300 nests, and number of breeding pairs was estimated at 218,460. Colonies were only located on islands. Digital analysis of the satellite image showed that the proportion of area with shrub-steppe vegetation was significantly higher at IC than at INC (38.6 vs. 4.9%), whereas percentage of rocky substrate was lower at IC (33.6 vs. 64.8%). Percentage of vegetation cover was positively correlated with island area and with number of brooding pairs. Most nests (98.6%) were located under bushes, whereas the rest were burrows dug into the substrate. Mean size of bushes used for nesting was higher at IC (4.47 vs. 0.99 m(2)) as was the percentage of silt-clay substrate (47.31 vs. 1.98%). Coast minimum slopes at INC were steeper than the slopes of entrance routes at IC (27.6 vs. 5.7degrees). Probability of occupation of islands increased with amount of shrub-type vegetation cover and silt-clay substrate, and decreased with increasing slopes and amount of sandy substrate. Magellanic Penguins selected islands with shrub-type vegetation and soil that allow building nests with adequate cover. These results are consistent with other studies showing vegetation cover is an important nesting requirement for Magellanic Penguins.

J	Wimberly, MC; Spies, TA				Wimberly, MC; Spies, TA			Modeling landscape patterns of understory tree regeneration in the Pacific Northwest, USA	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Vegetation maps serve as the basis for spatial analysis of forest ecosystems and provide initial information for simulations of forest landscape change. Because of the limitations of current remote sensing technology, it is not possible to directly measure forest understory attributes across large spatial extents, Instead we used a predictive vegetation mapping approach to model Tsuga heterophylla and Picea , sitchensis seedling patterns in a 3900-ha landscape in the Oregon Coast Range, USA, as a function of Landsat TM imagery, aerial photographs, digital elevation models, and stream maps. Because the models explained only moderate amounts of variability (R(2) values of 0.24 - 0.56), we interpreted the predicted patterns as qualitative spatial trends rather than precise maps. P. sitchensis seedling patterns were tightly linked to the riparian network, with highest densities in coastal riparian areas. T. heterophylla seedlings exhibited complex patterns related to topography and overstory forest cover, and were also spatially clustered around patches of old-growth forest. We hypothesize that the old growth served as refugia for this fire-sensitive species following wildfires in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Low levels of T. heterophylla regeneration in hardwood-dominated forests suggest that these patches may succeed to shrublands rather than to conifer forest. Predictive models of seedling patterns could be developed for other landscapes where georeferenced inventory plots, remote sensing data, digital elevation models, and climate C Z maps are available.

Landsat data from 1972 to 1998 and a 1963 aerial photograph are used to monitor the snow line fluctuations on a selected part of Sajama volcano. We assume that a few months after the rainy season, the snow line is representative of the previous rainy season, if no recent snowfall has occurred. By observing precipitation from the stations surrounding Sajama volcano and by verifying snow presence on surrounding summits, we detect images with recent snowfall likely to disturb the climatic significance of the snow line. A snow line evolution model takes into account the different image acquisition dates and adjusts the snow line elevation accordingly for the middle of the dry season. A progressive rise of the snow line elevation is observed from 1963 to 1998 with a sustained rise from 1984 to 1990. The snow line altitude is related to the Southern Oscillation Index. Even after the high precipitation of the 1996-1997 wet season, the following El Nino 1997-1998 leads to a substantial rise of the snow line. The snow line elevation is related primarily to the total rainy season precipitation and to a lesser degree to the maximum monthly mean temperature of the warmest month, thus confirming a greater snow line sensitivity to precipitation than to temperature.

The two measurement methods have a complementary sensitivity to variety of dust properties. The methodology is demonstrated using spectral measurements (0.47-2.21 mum) from Landsat (TM) over the bright Senegalian coast and dark ocean, and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) radiances measured in several locations. We derive (1) the dust size distribution, showing a dominant coarse mode at 1-5 mum and a secondary mode around 0.5 mum effective radius; (2) dust absorption, which is found to be substantially smaller than reported from previous measurements; (3) the real part of the refractive index which varies within the range 1.53-1.46; and we show that (4) the effect of the dust nonspherical shape on its optical properties is not significant for scattering angles < 120 degrees.

The total biomass is estimated, based on the morphology of the dominant species Laminaria longicruris. Kelp-covered and kelp-free areas are differentiated from each other in water depth of 0-6 m and 0-7 m with the HRV and TM images, respectively. The median biomass estimated for the kelp-covered category of the classified image is (1500 +/- 400) g m(-2). The multidate image shows a spatial variation of the kelp beds in 45% of the area. Areas where no change occurred occupy at least 70 ha, while growth and decay of kelp are observed in much smaller areas, in shallow water and at the boundary of kelp beds.																	0143-1161					JUL 20	2001	22	11					2083	2094		10.1080/01431160116919								WOS:000169546300003

An important cautionary note is that the surface plumes visible in the remote-sensing data (even though nearly coincident with flooding) do not represent mass output from the rivers.																	0091-7613					JUL	2001	29	7					659	662		10.1130/0091-7613(2001)029<0659:MFOFCW>2.0.CO;2								WOS:000169671300023

We measured coastline positions from 1963 satellite reconnaissance photography acid 1997 RADARSAT synthetic aperture radar image data for comparison with coastlines inferred by other researchers who used Landsat data from the mid-1970s. We show that these ice shelves lost similar to6.8% of their total area between 1963 and 1997. Most of the areal reduction occurred between 1963 and the mid-1970s, Since then, ice margin positions have stabilized or even readvanced. We conclude that these ice shelves are in a near-equilibrium state with the coastal environment.

The extent of this fragmentation in terms of overall habitat loss, fragment sizes and fragment numbers has not been described previously, thereby limiting the development of conservation strategies for this vegetation type. Patterns of renosterveld loss in three sectors along a west-east gradient were described using LANDSAT imagery and a Geographical Information System-based program (FRAGSTATS) for spatial pattern analysis. These patterns were then correlated with rainfall and topography measures, which are indicators of agricultural potential. Over 80% of the South Coast Renosterveld has been cultivated. Fragmentation levels increased significantly from east to west, with 33% of natural vegetation remaining in the east and only 4% in the west. Topographical variables were the strongest predictors of patterns of renosterveld loss, with fragments being largely confined to slopes too steep for ploughing; they therefore face little risk of future cultivation. These results have implications for conservation planning options for the South Coast Renosterveld. There is the potential for large reserves in the east, as well as corridor reserves along major river valleys, but for only small, isolated reserves in the west.

Airborne radar surveys were conducted on these glaciers to determine ice thickness and bed morphology along transverse and longitudinal profiles of the grounded and floating segments. A new analysis of a Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite image using a tracking technique was used to measure ice velocity at grounding lines and along ice tongues. The integration of radar and satellite data helped to locate grounding lines and to calculate the ice discharge. Changes in ice fluxes of floating glaciers were used to determine basal melting and freezing rates. The ice discharge calculated is less than half that required for a zero net surface mass balance according to the inputs given by the accumulation estimates widely adopted at present. The basal melting rates of meteoric ice represent 50% of the net ablation rate.

J	Mustard, JF; Carney, MA; Sen, A				Mustard, JF; Carney, MA; Sen, A			The use of satellite data to quantify thermal effluent impacts	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Thermal effluent from a large coal-fired electric generating facility located on Mt. Hope Bay in the Narragansett Bay (Rhode Island, U.S.A.) has been implicated in a large decline in fish populations in this region. Detailed information on the spatial and temporal properties of this thermal input (approximately 5 million m(3) day(-1) of thermal effluent 7 degrees C above ambient) is, however, lacking. In this paper it is shown that the spatial extent and magnitude of the thermal impacts can be quantitatively determined by exploiting the strengths of remotely sensed data. Seasonal trends of surface temperature in the Narragansett Bay estuary were derived from a composite of 14 thermal infrared satellite images (Landsat TM Band 6) with a spatial resolution of 120 m. The derived temperatures were validated against independent measures of surface temperature for a number of sites within the bay, and it was shown that the satellite measures were within 1 degrees C of the in situ temperatures. Relationships among thermal properties and physical characteristics were identified through a comparison of the seasonal temperature patterns of 12 regions within the bay. As expected, depth was the primary factor in determining the magnitude of seasonal temperature variation in the estuary, while advective exchange with the coast ocean was the second most important factor. Although the behaviour of Mount Hope Bay was significantly correlated with the other upper estuarine regions, the bay did not experience autumn cooling, which is characteristic of upper estuarine waters. From late summer through to autumn, the average temperature difference between Mount Hope Bay and Upper Narragansett Bay was 0.8 degrees C, which can be attributed to warming from the thermal effluent of the Brayton Point Power Station in Mount Hope Bay. An unsupervised (statistical) classification of temperature as a function of season revealed the natural boundaries between areas with different seasonal temperature signals, and statistically identified Mount Hope Bay as a unique area in the upper estuary which had anomalously high temperatures throughout the year. Among the scenes included in the unsupervised analysis, Mount Hope Bay was on average 0.8 degrees C warmer than the rest of the upper estuary, and the total area affected is 36 km(2).

Landsat TM data were useful in the geomorphic interpretation of a desert, aeolian environment to distinguish the mineralogies found in the Wahiba area, and in extending the identification of sand mineralogy beyond the point-specific grid produced from field sampling. The Wahiba Sand Sea has been previously divided into upper (north and higher in elevation) and lower (south and lower in elevation) portions, based on dune morphology. Large-scale spatial distributions of mineral composition follow a similar pattern to that of the geomorphic regions within the dune field. Field and Landsat TM data suggests the upper Wahiba is comprised of well-mixed carbonate and quartz sand with some areas of significant mafic content. Surface sand in the eastern and western margins of the upper Wahiba originate from the lower Wahiba and from local wadis. Sand in the lower Wahiba was likely derived from southern sabkhas and the coastal area and is quartz-rich with isolated locations of carbonate-rich sand. We suggest that these carbonate-rich patches in the lower Wahiba were derived from reworked aeolianites (lithofied sand dunes) which underlie most of the sand sea, and not directly from the coast, as previously reported.

J	Liu, JT; Chao, SY; Hsu, RT				Liu, JT; Chao, SY; Hsu, RT			The influence of suspended sediments on the plume of a small mountainous river	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												A comprehensive field experiment was conducted to monitor the plume of the Tsengwen River, a monsoon-regulated small mountainous river located on a wave-dominated micro-tidal coast in southern Taiwan. The field work included the deployment of a tripod near the river mouth that measured the salinity, temperature, tide, waves, current, and turbidity at 1 m above the bed. Shipboard profiling of the salinity, temperature, and turbidity was also conducted. In addition to the ground survey, a Landsat TM image taken during the time of the field work was converted to a map for suspended sediment distribution in the study area. Our results show that the expansion and contraction of the river plume is largely controlled by the river discharge, tidal phase, and the wind field. Horizontal advection, downward settling, and the resuspension are the three mechanisms that control the near-bed suspended sediment concentration near the river mouth. Both forms of hypopycnal and hyperpycnal plumes from the river have been documented. Our study shows the type of plume of small rivers not particularly rich in suspended sediments on wave-dominated coasts have greater variability and is subject to the influence of the suspended sediment dynamics. In the presence of weakened runoff and absence of runoff, stratification can become unstable in the farfield when vertical movements of suspended sediments are present. In summary, the plumes observed in this study represent three types of plumes in terms of relative dominance between the river and nearshore suspended sediment dynamics.

J	Chuvieco, E				Chuvieco, E			Measuring changes in landscape pattern from satellite images: short-term effects of fire on spatial diversity	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Satellite images can be considered a very convenient tool to measure landscape patterns since they provide a digital mosaic of the spatial arrangement of landcovers. This paper describes a practical application of several indices frequently used in landscape ecology to measure changes in the spatial mosaic as a result of large fires. These indices were computed from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index images of Landsat Thematic Mapper and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer data acquired before and after a large fire affecting the Mediterranean coast of Spain in 1991. The following landscape pattern indices were computed: standard deviation of spatial profiles, spatial auto-correlation, texture, number of patches, diversity, compactness and fractal dimension. To avoid potential bias in the results, these indices were calculated for several scenarios. The modification of the study area limits and spatial resolutions of the images, the measurement scale and the number of categories were tested in this study. All the indices computed showed a short-term increase in spatial homogeneity after the fire. Spatial auto-correlation increased, while texture, number of patches and mean diversity decreased. Compactness was reduced and fractal dimension increased, which also suggests that the fire created more elongated and complex forms. These effects were observed in both high- and low-resolution images.

J	White, K; El Asmar, HM				White, K; El Asmar, HM			Monitoring changing position of coastlines using Thematic Mapper imagery, an example from the Nile Delta	GEOMORPHOLOGY					Symposium on New Techniques in Geomorphology	JAN, 1998	UNIV SURREY, GUILDFORD, ENGLAND		UNIV SURREY			Coastline movement due to erosion and deposition is a major concern for coastal zone management. Very dynamic coastlines, such as sections of the Nile Delta coast, pose considerable hazards to human use and development, and rapid, replicable techniques are required to update coastline maps of these areas and monitor rates of movement. The synoptic capability of Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery enables monitoring of large sections of coastline at relatively coarse (30 m) spatial resolution. By comparing positions of the Nile Delta coast in 1984, 1987 and 1990/1991, mapped using a region-growing image segmentation technique, areas of rapid change can be identified and targeted for more detailed monitoring in the field, or using higher resolution images. Rates of erosion and deposition can be estimated crudely, and areas where change appears to be accelerating can also be identified, Areas of severe erosion along the Nile Delta coast are found to be confined to the promontories of the present day mouths of the Nile at Rosetta and Damietta. Eroding shorelines are mostly flanked by accreting shorelines, showing that some of the eroded material is redistributed along the coast. The technique outlined here has potential to augment conventional field-based surveying for monitoring shoreline changes over short timescales. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Siegel, H; Gerth, M; Mutzke, A				Siegel, H; Gerth, M; Mutzke, A			Dynamics of the Oder river plume in the Southern Baltic Sea: satellite data and numerical modelling	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The Oder river discharge into the Pomeranian Eight of the Baltic Sea was investigated in a combined study using satellite data, numerical modelling and shipborne measurements. The aim was to understand the dynamical processes forming the freshwater distribution patterns during the prevailing winds. From an analysis of typical distribution patterns of the river discharge in relation to the main wind directions and in comparison to seasonal wind statistics, the two main transport directions were determined. The prevailing westerly winds produce an onshore transport and a downwind coastal jet which transports the river water along the Polish coast, in certain cases over a distance of 300 km to the Gdansk Bay. During a period of stable westerly winds in June 1994, the calculated time scale for a water transport over 250 km corresponded to the observed time of 12 d. In spring, the period of maximum river runoff, easterly winds dominate and transport occurs along the German coast into the Arkona Sea. The river water is guided by upwelling processes in front of the Polish coast. During occasional northeasterly winds stable plumes form in front of the Swine river mouth; this occurred in May 1991 for several days. The numerical model showed that the stability of the plume is caused by an interaction between the alignment of the coast, the large-scale circulation in the north, the buoyancy of the freshwater and the Coriolis effect. The underlying anticyclonic eddy is indicated by warm rings in a high resolution Landsat Thematic Mapper scene. From the different datasets the range of the spatial and temporal scales of a stable plume were determined. The volume varied between 0.14 and 0.9 km(3), and the suspended matter and chlorophyll load between 1120 and 7200 t and 2.8 and 18 t, respectively.

J	Ruiz-Luna, A; Berlanga-Robles, CA				Ruiz-Luna, A; Berlanga-Robles, CA			Modifications in coverage patterns and land use around the Huizache-Caimanero lagoon system, Sinaloa, Mexico: A multi-temporal analysis using LANDSAT images	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Human activities, such as agriculture and shrimp farming, have influenced the Huizache-Caimanero lagoon system, modifying the landscape and diminishing its natural productivity. Four Landsat MSS (multi-spectral scanner) and TM (thematic mapper) sub-images, taken between 1973 and 1997, were analysed to evaluate trends of changes in the lagoon, saltmarsh, mangrove, agriculture, secondary succession and dry forest classes. The scenes were enhanced by principal components analysis. A thematic map for each sub-image was produced using supervised classification with the extraction and classification of homogeneous objects algorithm (ECHO). Aerial photography and field verification of testing points were used to validate the classification and to assess its accuracy using the Kappa Coefficient. The area covered by class and year was estimated and the temporal trends were defined by linear regression. The natural covers (lagoon, mangrove and dry forest) showed a significant reduction in 1997 when compared with 1973, whereas the agricultural areas, secondary succession and saltmarshes showed an increase in cover. The frequency distribution analysis of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) confirmed the observed trends. The Huizache-Caimanero region is a highly disturbed landscape, mainly caused by agricultural practices, that must be rehabilitated to maintain its natural productivity. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

Through satellite remote sensing this study investigates the distribution of these plants along a southern section of the Kenyan coast. The visible bands (red, green and blue) and the near infra-red band of a Landsat Thematic Mapper image acquired in 1992 were combined in order to detect seagrasses and algae in 10 sectors along the section of the coast. Ground truthing was done at three locations along the same section. Results indicate that two distinct zones of vegetation can be recognised, and ground truthing reveals their identity is rocky substrate with mostly algae and seagrasses, respectively. The extent of the vegetation in the two zones has been quantified in square kilometres for the 10 sectors. However, care is needed in the interpretation of the satellite images when dealing with artefacts such as clouds. The zonation of the algal vegetation is discussed for one of the study sites.

J	Testa, V; Bosence, DWJ				Testa, V; Bosence, DWJ			Physical and biological controls on the formation of carbonate and siliciclastic bedforms on the north-east Brazilian shelf	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The continental shelf of the State of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, is an open shelf area located 5 degrees S and 35 degrees W. It is influenced by strong oceanic and wind-driven currents, fair weather, 1.5-m-high waves and a mesotidal regime. This work focuses on the character and the controls on the development of suites of carbonate and siliciclastic bedforms, based on Landsat TM image analysis and extensive ground-truth (diving) investigations. Large-scale bedforms consist of: (i) bioclastic (mainly coralline algae and Halimeda) sand ribbons (5-10 km long, 50-600 m wide) parallel to the shoreline; and (ii) very large transverse siliciclastic dunes (3.4 km long on average, 840 m spacing and 3-8 m high), with troughs that grade rapidly into carbonate sands and gravels. Wave ripples are superposed on all large-scale bedforms, and indicate an onshore shelf sediment transport normal to the main sediment transport direction. The occurrence of these large-scale bedforms is primarily determined by the northwesterly flowing residual oceanic and tidal currents, resulting mainly in coast-parallel transport. Models of shelf bedform formation predict sand ribbons to occur in higher energy settings rather than in large dunes. However, in the study area, sand ribbons occur in an area of coarse, low-density and easily transportable bioclastic sands and gravels compared with the very large transverse dunes in an offshore area that is composed of denser medium-grained siliciclastic sands. It suggests that the availability of different sediment types is likely to exert an influence on the nature of the bedforms generated. The offshore sand supply is time limited and originates from sea floor erosion of sandstones of former sea-level lowstands. The trough areas of both sand ribbons and very large transverse dunes comprise coarse calcareous alg;al gravels that support benthic communities of variable maturity. Diverse mature communities result in sediment stabilization through branching algal growth and binding that is thought to modify the morphology of dunes and sand ribbons. The occurrence and the nature of the bedforms is controlled by their hydrodynamic setting, by grain composition that reflects the geological history of the area and by the carbonate-producing benthic marine communities that inhabit the trough areas.																	0037-0746					APR	1999	46	2					279	301		10.1046/j.1365-3091.1999.00213.x								WOS:000080189400004

The timely updating of landform maps is of critical significance beyond geomorphology itself, into broader fields of environmental management and sustainable development. Existing techniques need to be tailored and refined towards the operational mode for full functioning of landform mapping. This study presents an example of the application of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data and image processing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques to geomorphologic mapping in a large deltaic lowland environment. Data acquisition, processing, integration, analysis, interpretation and presentation were performed under a GIS environment, in which a terrain mapping unit database linking both geospatial and attribute data was built up. A terrain classification map was produced and further validated with Global Positioning System-guided field checks and observations. Results show that TM interpretation with a GIS allows an accurate geomorphological classification of terrain in accordance with the level of mapping scale used. With some caution, this method might be used in highly dynamic deltaic environments.																	0143-1161					MAR 10	1999	20	4					659	681		10.1080/014311699213127								WOS:000079206600003

This coastline is microtidal and dominated by wave action; and abundant sediment is supplied by rivers draining the uplifted mountainous interior of this tectonically active region. The coastal plain has prograded up to 40 km since relative sea level rise slowed down around 6000 years BP. The inland parts of the coastal plain are dominated by parallel storm beach ridges whilst the coastal fringe exhibits a diversity of symmetrical to asymmetrical wave-dominated deltas and spit-deltas encompassing cut-off lagoons. A genetic model to explain the variability of wave-dominated deltas on the Albanian coast is proposed showing a spectrum of forms between prograding symmetrical cuspate deltas formed by bi-directional longshore drift and highly asymmetrical spit-deltas formed by uni-directional longshore drift. Avulsive switching causes abandonment; the symmetrical forms become smoothed out by wave action whereas the spit-deltas become detached barrier beaches that migrate onshore by washover, welding themselves onto the coast. The back barrier cut-off lagoons in this setting have a very low preservation potential. Two much larger lagoons, now partly reclaimed, at Karavasta and Narta, lie within the belt of beach ridges; both have a straight seaward margin parallel to known post-Neogene faulting. The lagoons exhibit differential subsidence which is regarded as neotectonic in origin; the presence of a 60 km long graben or half graben structure linking the two areas of subsidence is suggested to explain the observed phenomena. Subsidence up to 5-10 m is indicated within the last 1,000-2,000 years.																	0749-0208					SPR	1999	15	2					345	354										WOS:000079567500005

The Tropospheric Aerosol Radiative Forcing Observational Experiment (TARFOX) was designed to reduce this uncertainty by measuring and analyzing aerosol properties and effects on the United States eastern seaboard, where one of the world's major plumes of urban/industrial haze moves from the continent over the Atlantic Ocean. The TARFOX intensive field campaign was conducted July 10-31, 1996, It included coordinated measurements from four satellites (GOES-8, NOAA-14, ERS-2, Landsat), four aircraft (ER-2, C-130, C-131A, and a modified Cessna), land sites, and ships. A variety of aerosol conditions was sampled, ranging from relatively clean, behind frontal passages, to moderately polluted, with aerosol optical depths exceeding 0.5 at midvisible wavelengths. Gradients of aerosol optical thickness were sampled to aid in separating aerosol effects from other radiative effects and to more tightly constrain closure tests, including those of satellite retrievals, Early results from TARFOX include demonstration of the unexpected importance of carbonaceous compounds and water condensed on aerosol in the United States East Coast haze plume, chemical apportionment of the aerosol optical depth, measurements of aerosol-induced changes in upwelling and downwelling shortwave radiative fluxes, and generally good agreement between measured flux changes and those calculated from measured aerosol properties. This overview presents the TARFOX objectives, rationale overall experimental approach, and key initial findings as a guide to the more complete results reported in this special section and elsewhere.																	2169-897X	2169-8996				JAN 27	1999	104	D2					2213	2222		10.1029/1998JD200028								WOS:000078242200026

Reflectivity and Doppler velocity measurements were obtained in vertical and horizontal planes that extend from the flight lines. Data from three consecutive days were used to examine echo structure and microphysics characteristics. The clouds appeared horizontally homogeneous and light drizzle reached the surface in all three cases. Radar reflectivity is dominated by drizzle drops over the lower two-thirds to four-fifths of the clouds and by cloud droplets above that. Cells with above-average drizzle concentrations exist in all cases and exhibit a large range of sizes. The cells have irregular horizontal cross sections but occur with a dominant spacing that is roughly 1.2-1.5 times the depth of the cloud layer. Doppler velocities in the vertical are downward in all but a very small fraction of the cloud volumes. The cross correlation between reflectivity and vertical Doppler velocity changes sign at or below the midpoint of the cloud, indicating that in the upper parts of the clouds above-average reflectivities are associated with smaller downward velocities. This correlation and related observations are interpreted as the combined results of upward transport of drizzle drops and of downward motion of regions diluted by entrainment. The in situ measurements support these conclusions.																	0022-4928					DEC 15	1998	55	24					3540	3564		10.1175/1520-0469(1998)055<3540:FSAMOC>2.0.CO;2								WOS:000077690600002

These images were utilized together with a series of topographic maps dated 1909, 1922, 1944 and 1955 to cover a 86-year monitoring period. Changes documented in this study include: areas of shoreline erosion and accretion, evolution of Damietta coastal spit and changes in the lagoon margin and contiguous islands. The analysis describes areas of erosion along the promontory tip adjacent to the river mouth (-0.51 km(2) yr(-1)) reverted to downcoast accretion along the promontory flank (0.30km(2) yr(-1)). Part of this sand is carried south-west along the shoreline as a seaward sand spit. This spit is actively migrating to the south-east (0.17 km yr(-1)) and is accompanied by changes in width (0.06 km yr(-1)). Local areas of erosion and accretions are also detected along the Manzala lagoon sand barrier. The pattern of erosion versus accretion along the coast of the Damietta promontory is attributed to the construction of dams on the upper Nile River, first the Aswan Low Dam in 1909 and particularly the Aswan High Dam in 1964 that cut-off almost all water discharge from the river and the delivery of sediments to the coast. In the absence of a sediment supply, the continued transport of beach sand by waves and currents toward the east has resulted in beach erosion of the promontory close to the river mouth, while shoreline accretion has continued further to the east. An analysis of changes of the total area of Manzala lagoon has indicated that the lagoon has progressively shrunk in size with an average rate of - 5.2 km(2) yr(-1), while its embeded islands have accreted at 2.93 km(2) yr(-1). The changes in the lagoon area and islands have resulted from extensive reclamation of the lagoon margin, weed growth and siltation processes.																	0143-1161					JUL 10	1998	19	10					1901	1912		10.1080/014311698215054								WOS:000074702300005

Classification accuracy of CASI data was higher than Landsat TM for all methods, and more mangrove classes could be discriminated.

Ice-surface velocities in Marie Byrd and Ellsworth Lands, West Antarctica, range from the fast-moving Thwaites, Pine Island, Land and DeVicq Glaciers to the slower-moving ice shelves. The average ice-front velocity during the time interval of Landsat imagery, for the faster-moving outlet glaciers, was 2.9 km a(-1) for Thwaites Glacier 2.4 km a(-1) for Pine Island Glacier, 2.0 km a(-1) for Land Glacier and 1.4 km a(-1) for DeVicq Glacier. Evaluation of coastal change from the early 1970s to the early 1990s shows advance of the floating ice front in some coastal areas and recession in others, with an overall small average advance in the entire coastal study area, but no major trend towards advance or retreat. Comparison of average ice-surface velocities with changes in the ice front has yielded estimates of iceberg calving. The total iceberg calving from the Marie Byrd Land and Ellsworth Land coasts during the study period was greater than 8500 km(2) (estimated volume of about 2400 km(3)) or an average of about 550 km(2) a(-1) (more than 150 km(3) a(-1)). a a Almost 70% of this discharge is contributed by Thwaites and Pine Island Glaciers.																	0260-3055		0-946417-22-9				1998	27						33	40										WOS:000079713100005

Velocities of Thwaites Glacier range from 2.2 km a(-1) above the grounding line to 3.4 km a(-1) at the limit of measurements on Thwaites Glacier ice tongue. The glacier increases in velocity by about 1 km a(-1) where it crosses the grounding line. Over the period 1984-93,Thwaites Glacier ice tongue accelerated by about 0.6 km a(-1). Velocities of the floating part of several minor glaciers and some ice shelves are also determined: Land Glacier, 1.7-1.9 km a(-1); DeVicq Glacier, 0.7-1.1 km a(-1); Dotson Ice Shelf, 0.2-0.5 km a(-1); Getz Ice Shelf, 0.2-0.8 km a(-1) and Sulzberger Ice Shelf, 0.01-0.02 km a(-1). The high velocities along the Marie Byrd Land coast are consistent with the high precipitation rates over West Antarctica and, for some of the glaciers, the lack of buttressing ice shelves.																	0260-3055		0-946417-22-9				1998	27						47	53										WOS:000079713100007						
J	Ward, DH; Markon, CJ; Douglas, DC				Ward, DH; Markon, CJ; Douglas, DC			Distribution and stability of eelgrass beds at Izembek Lagoon, Alaska	AQUATIC BOTANY												Spatial change in eelgrass meadows, Zostera marina L., was assessed between 1978 and 1987 and between 1987 and 1995 at Izembek Lagoon, Alaska. Change in total extent was evaluated through a map to map comparison of data interpreted from a 1978 Landsat multi-spectral scanner image and 1987 black and white aerial photographs. A ground survey in 1995 was used to assess spatial change from 1987. Eelgrass beds were the predominant vegetation type in the lagoon, comprising 44-47% (15000-16000 ha) of the total area in 1978 and 1987. Izembek Lagoon contains the largest bed of seagrass along the Pacific Coast of North America and largest known single stand of eelgrass in the world. There was a high degree of overlap in the spatial distribution of eelgrass among years of change detection. The overall net change was a 6% gain between 1978 and 1987 and a <l% gain between 1987 and 1995. The lack of significant change in eelgrass cover suggests that eelgrass meadows in Izembek Lagoon have been stable during the 17-year period of our study. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

The objectives are to assess the regrowth pathways followed by different species populations after a disturbance, to analyze the speed of recovery in the years following fire, and, finally, to estimate rates of regrowth. The test area is located in the north of the province of Alicante, on the Mediterranean coast of Spain. This area, especially prone to forest fires, shows a remarkable land-use history and human pressure. The test areas belong to different microclimatic zones, show diverse vegetation communities, and have different degrees of stoniness; so we attempted to discover their postfire behaviors according to their biogeographical conditions. To accomplish these objectives, we used nine Landsat 5 thematic mapper images from 1984 to 1994 to which geometric and radiometric corrections were applied. Once the comparability between images was guaranteed, we generated a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for each date. First, we demonstrated that the differences between NDVI images were suitable for mapping burned areas. Second, we undertook a nonlinear regression analysis between NDVI values and the time elapsed since the fire to assess the recovery processes. The exponential adjustment between NDVI and time was in accord with the asymptotic behavior observed when the recovery process is complete. The parameters supplied by the proposed method are helpful in quantifying the effects of fire on different ecosystem processes. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

Temporal variation in surface albedo was determined using an extensive data set from six tower sites with multiple years of data. Four distinct patterns in evolution of the seasonal trend in daily albedo were discovered for the six sites and appeared to be related to vegetation and surface moisture characteristics. All sites showed an albedo response to solar zenith angles greater than 60 degrees, at smaller zenith angles hourly albedo was a good representation of daily values. TM imagery from a dry year (1984) and a wet year (1991) were used to derive maps of albedo for the study area. Spatial variation of albedo was examined within representative training areas centered on the six tower sites. The magnitude of spatial variation in albedo was typically less than 0.04 for all sites. Spatial variability was slightly greater in the wet year. A one pixel transect of albedo across the study area showed the largest difference between lakes and terrestrial surfaces. However, within the terrestrial zones, alternating patches of open forest and tundra and differences in wetness create a coherent pattern in albedo across the landscape.

This paper describes simultaneous uses of held sampling and remote sensing approaches to understand salt marsh ecosystem functions and species distributions and discusses the implications for salt marsh monitoring using remote sensing. Three sites along the Petaluma River near the entrance into San Pablo Bay, California, which represented a range of soil salinity, water content, and nutrients, were studied. Standing biomass was directly assessed by field sampling and indirectly estimated through canopy reflectance. The sites were dominated by almost monotypic stands of Salicornia virginica, Spartina foliosa, and Scirpus robustus. For Salicornia, we found a positive relationship between salinity and biomass up to a threshold of 42 g/kg, after which biomass declined monotonically with increasing salinity. No Scirpus or Spartina were found at soil salinities >20 g/kg. Although significantly different levels of nitrate and ammonium nitrogen were found in the interstitial water and soils at these sites, no strong relationships were found between biomass and nitrate nitrogen. Soil ammonium nitrogen, in contrast, was positively related to biomass. Soil redox and salinity increased with elevation and distance from the shoreline, while soil moisture and H2S decreased. Canopy biomass was estimable using remotely sensed spectral vegetation indices at 58-80% accuracy depending on. species. Simple Vegetation Index (VI) and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI) measured by handheld field spectrometers were the best estimators of green biomass for high cover of Salicornia. Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Soil Adjusted and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (SARVI) gave the best estimates for Spartina while the Global Environment Monitoring Index (GEMI) was the best estimate for Scirpus. The relationships between vegetation indices and biomass were developed from field spectra. The VI was used to estimate spatial patterns of biomass across the salt marsh from Landsat satellite Thematic Mapper (TM) data. The TM image showed spatial patterns corresponding with species zones and biomass abundance. Narrow band reflectance features measured with a handheld spectrometer can be used to predict canopy plant water content (R-2 = 63%). Interpolated estimates of water content from field-measured canopy reflectance were shown to relate to variation in salinity and soil moisture. Canopy water content was estimated from Airborne Advanced Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer data, which showed similar spatial patterns at the site. Results indicate that both biomass production and canopy water content can be accurately determined from remotely sensed spectral measures. Species-specific differences in these characteristics may be used for monitoring species distribution and abundance from airborne or satellite images.																	1051-0761					AUG	1997	7	3					1039	1053										WOS:A1997XQ08100026						
J	Skidmore, AK; Turner, BJ; Brinkhof, W; Knowles, E				Skidmore, AK; Turner, BJ; Brinkhof, W; Knowles, E			Performance of a neural network: Mapping forests using GIS and remotely sensed data	PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING												Neural networks have been proposed to classify remotely sensed and ancillary GIS data. In this paper, the backpropagation algorithm is critically evaluated, using as an example, the mapping of a eucalypt forest on the far south coast of New South Wales, Australia. A GIS database was combined with Landsat thematic mapper data, and 190 plots were field sampled in order to train the neural network model and to evaluate the resulting classifications. The results show that the neural network did not accurately classify GIS and remotely sensed data at the forest type level (Anderson Level III), though conventional classifiers also perform poorly with this type of problem. Previous studies using neural networks have classified more general (e.g., Anderson Level I, II) landcover types at a higher accuracy than those obtained here, but mapped land cover into more general themes. Given the poor classification results and the difficulties associated with the setting up of suitable parameters for the neural-network (backpropagation) algorithm, it is concluded that the neural-network approach does not offer significant advantages over conventional classification schemes for mapping eucalypt forests from Landsat TM and ancillary GIS data at the Anderson Level III forest type level.

J	Morrison, RIG				Morrison, RIG			The use of remote sensing to evaluate shorebird habitats and populations on Prince Charles Island, Foxe Basin, Canada	ARCTIC												Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper imagery was used to produce a 17-habitat classification of Prince Charles Island, Fore Basin, Northwest Territories, through a combination of supervised and unsupervised approaches. Breeding shorebirds and habitats were surveyed at 35 study plots in July 1989. Habitat-specific breeding densities calculated from these observations were used to estimate total populations of breeding shorebirds on the island based on areas of habitat derived from the classified image. Breeding densities were further modelled in two ways: first, to adjust for distance from the coast, where regression analyses found a significant relationship between distance and density, and second, to include only those pixels of areas considered suitable for breeding, using results of a proximity analysis to determine habitat associations between known breeding locations (pixels) and other habitats. Six species of shorebirds were found breeding on Prince Charles Island, with a combined population (after modelling) estimated at 294000 pairs. Comparison of breeding densities and estimated populations of shorebirds with those recorded at other arctic locations indicated that Prince Charles Island supports highly significant numbers of shorebirds, especially white-rumped sandpipers and red phalaropes. Comparison of reference areas of known habitat with those on the classified image indicated classification accuracy averaged over 90%. Remote sensing appears to offer a reliable method for assessing habitats and regional breeding populations of birds in at least some areas, providing that classification methods are carried out in a carefully controlled manner. Use of the method over broad areas of the Arctic would require considerable work to recalibrate imagery for different geographic regions.																	0004-0843	1923-1245				MAR	1997	50	1					55	75										WOS:A1997WQ21000007						
J	Coops, N; Delahaye, A; Pook, E				Coops, N; Delahaye, A; Pook, E			Estimation of eucalypt forest leaf area index on the south coast of New South Wales using Landsat MSS data	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Research over the last decade has shown that regional estimation of Leaf Area Index (LAI) is possible using the ratio of red and near infrared radiation derived from satellite or airborne sensors. At landscape levels, however, this relationship has been more difficult to establish due to (i) logistic difficulties in measuring seasonal variation in LAI across the landscape over an extended period of time and (ii) difficulties in establishing the effect of understorey, canopy closure, and soil on the spectral radiation at fine spatial resolutions (< 100 m). This paper examines the first issue by utilising a temporal sequence of LAI data of a Eucalyptus mixed hardwood forest (E. maculata Hook., E. paniculata Sm., E. globoidea Blakely, E. pilularis Sm., E. sieberi L.Johnson) in south-eastern New South Wales and comparing it to historical Landsat Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS) data covering a 9 year period. Field LAI was compared to the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Simple Ratio (SR) derived from the MSS data. Linear relationships were shown to be appropriate to relate both transformations to the LAI data with r(2)-values of 0.71 and 0.53 respectively. Using the NDVI relationship, LAI values were estimated along a transect originating from the monitoring site and these were compared to percentage canopy cover values derived from aerial photography.

J	Rowland, SK				Rowland, SK			Slopes, lava flow volumes, and vent distributions on Volcan Fernandina, Galapagos Islands	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												Digital elevation data from TOPSAR, an airborne synthetic aperture radar system that uses interferometry to derive topography, are used to determine slope distributions and lava flow thicknesses on Fernandina Volcano, Galapagos Islands. Four extracaldera slope regions are defined (from the coast inland): A coastal plain (average slope similar to 2 degrees), an apron (6 degrees-12 degrees), steep slopes 250-600 m high (20 degrees-43 degrees), and a 0.5- to 1-km-wide Summit platform (similar to 10 degrees). Lava Bows and vents are mapped using Shuttle Imaging Radar-C (SIR-C), SPOT, Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), and air photos. Over 500 flows are identified and categorized as young, intermediate, or old based on albedo, vegetation cover, and margin preservation. By area, young flows constitute 55% of the island, 34% are intermediate, and 7% are old. The aa:pahoehoe ratio of the young flows is 85:15, whereas for the intermediate flows it is 58:42. Of the 423 vents that were classified, 236 are radial and 80% of these are in the apron, 143 are arcuate and 94% of these are in the summit platform, and 46 have transitional orientations and are about equally divided between the steep slopes and summit platform; 95% of all vents are within 13 km of the caldera center. TOPSAR data allow flow volumes to be estimated, and young flows range from < 0.01 to 0.12 km(3), with a total volume of 2.3 km(3). By volume, 91% of the young lava erupted from radial vents below the steep slopes, many of which are concentrated within the SE apron about 5-6 km from the caldera. Similar concentrations to the NE, NW, and SW consist of young and intermediate flows. Different proportions of lava flows and vents form the different slope regions; the coastal plain averages 0.1 vents/km(2) and the slightly steeper apron averages 0.6 to 0.9 vents/km(2), increasing inland. The summit platform averages 4.7 vents/km(2), and this concentration supports previously proposed mechanisms for producing higher elevations and steeper slopes in the central part of the volcano. Temporal changes in the plumbing system and/or magma supply. rate are suggested by the change in aa:pahoehoe ratio; it appears that in the past, low effusion rate eruptions were more common (perhaps from a filled caldera), whereas more recently, high effusion rate eruptions have dominated.																	2169-9313	2169-9356				DEC 10	1996	101	B12					27657	27672		10.1029/96JB02649								WOS:A1996VX66300002						
J	Yates, MG; GossCustard, JD; Rispin, WE				Yates, MG; GossCustard, JD; Rispin, WE			Towards predicting the effect of loss of intertidal feeding areas on overwintering shorebirds (Charadrii) and shelduck (Tadorna tadorna): Refinements and tests of a model developed for the Wash, east England	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. The limitations of a model developed in an earlier study to predict the effect of salt-marsh reclamation on shelduck (Tadorna tadorna) and seven wader species (Charadrii) feeding on the Wash, east England, are addressed. The model related the numbers of each species feeding down-shore of the marsh in a 1-km broad transect to the area of mud or sand present, and thus to the width of the shore itself. 2. Three censuses of the intertidal feeding grounds were made during the winters of 1989-90. 1990-91 and 1991-92, in addition to one made in 1985-87 on which the earlier model was based, to incorporate annual variations in bird numbers into the model and to re-affirm the constancy in bird distribution. Sediment distribution was determined by satellite image analysis, The model was reformulated to include quadratic relationships. 3. The model was tested both within the Wash and on the Essex coast of east England, Within the Wash. its predictions improved as each year's census was incorporated and as predictions were made for areas of increasing size. Outside the Wash, the model predicted the numbers of all species with reasonable precision, suggesting it can be applied over a wider geographical area. 4. It was concluded that the model gives satisfactory predictions of how, in general, bird numbers would change in response to changes in shore width and sediment composition. BY converting numbers to percentages, its predictions can be applied to particular areas for which the pre-change bird numbers are known. The model may also be applicable to predicting the effect of other changes that directly or indirectly reduce the shore width: for example, barrage construction, sea-level rise and disturbance.																	0021-8901					OCT	1996	33	5					944	954		10.2307/2404676								WOS:A1996VY72900004						
J	AlSaifi, MM; Qari, MYHT				AlSaifi, MM; Qari, MYHT			Application of Landsat Thematic Mapper data in sabkha studies at the Red Sea coast	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Salt-enriched flat areas are known as sabkhas in the Red Sea coasts. Previously classified sabkhas north of Jeddah city, Saudi Arabia were examined by remote sensing techniques. Confirmation, of ground studies was reached with the synoptic coverage and spectral characteristics of the Landsat digital data. New maps were produced utilizing satellite data; this may include geomorphological and sabkha zonation maps. False colour, ratio and principal components composites were used in this study by image analysis system. Three main parameters, i.e., moisture content and its salinity, salt content and water-table level are exhibiting themselves as different colours in the coloured images. The approach described herein is recommended to be applied along the Red Sea coasts and other similar areas in order to present a preliminary but precisely identification of sabkha environments utilizing remote sensing techniques.																	0143-1161					FEB	1996	17	3					527	536										WOS:A1996TX65900007

Landsat Thematic Mapper and Spot XS satellite images were processed to create pasture growth status maps describing timbered and cleared areas, and priority areas for phosphorus fertiliser application. A digital elevation model was used to describe slope and aspect, and as a basis for interpolation of monthly surfaces of rainfall, temperature, radiation and evaporation from the Australian Climate Surfaces. These data were combined with a simple growth index model to create production surfaces for tropical, subtropical and temperature pasture types. The property was classified into zones defined by the seasonal growth patterns of the 3 pasture classes. The database was used to identify potential areas for further pasture improvement by a series of logical rules and map overlays to define pasture suitability for currently timbered areas with a slope of less than 20 degrees. The northern section of the property with the highest rainfall, best suitability for temperate pasture and good road access was chosen for land capability and fauna impact studies on the basis of this analysis. The study provides an example of the application of spatial data to practical management issues in pastoral agriculture.

J	PUNKARI, M				PUNKARI, M			GLACIAL FLOW SYSTEMS IN THE ZONE OF CONFLUENCE BETWEEN THE SCANDINAVIAN AND NOVAYA-ZEMLYA ICE SHEETS	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The glacial geomorphology of the eastern Kola Peninsula, northwestern Russian Plain, Pechora lowland, northern Ural mountains and southern Novaya Zemlya (1,000,000 km(2)) was mapped using Landsat satellite imagery. Glacial flow-parallel lineations and marginal and interlobate features were identified. The directions of glacial flow and the patterns of deglaciation were reconstructed. The Scandinavian Ice Sheet expanded northeastwards into the southern Barents Sea, while the Novaya Zemlya Ice Sheet spread southwestwards into the same area; the two coalesced in the Kanin region and subsequently flowed from the Barents Sea towards the land. During the deglaciation of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet, flow was initially oriented from the White Sea region towards the Barents Sea; subsequently several ice streams, controlled by the regional topography, were formed. The growth of the Novaya Zemlya Ice Sheet occurred east of the islands, whereas during the decay there was more ice on the western side. A compilation of dated sequences up to 300 km inland from the coast indicate a Late Weichselian age of deglaciation. Separation of the two ice sheets occurred along the saddle between the Kanin and Kola Peninsulas at about 13,000 BP (15,500 cal. years BP), which became the locus for discharge of the proglacial Dvina-Pechora lake into thr sea. Beyond the presumed Late Weichselian limits, older flow patterns are recognised. These patterns, along with dispersal of erratics, suggest that the growth of a more extensive glaciation started in the Novaya Zemlya region; later the Scandinavian Ice Sheet occupied areas previously covered by the Novaya Zemlya Ice Sheet.																	0277-3791						1995	14	6					589	603		10.1016/0277-3791(95)00026-L								WOS:A1995TJ33300003

False color composites generated from Landsat Thematic Mapper and SPOT image data, digital elevation models derived from stereophotogrammetric analysis of SPOT data, and field observations document that a approximately 10-km-wide swath inland from the coast is covered in many places with coalescing alluvial fans of Quaternary age. Wadis cutting through the fans exhibit several pairs of fluvial terraces, and wadi walls expose alluvium interbedded with coralline limestone deposits. three distinct coral terrace are evident along the coastline. Climatic, eustatic, and tectonic uplift controls on the overall system were simulated using a cellular automata algorithm with die following characteristics: (1) uplift as a function of position and time, as defined by the elevations and ages of corals; (2) climatic variations driven by insolation changes associated with Milankovitch cycles; (3) sea level fluctuations based on U/rh ages of coral terraces and eustatic data; and (4) parameterized fluvial erosion and deposition. Results imply that the fans and coralline limestones were generated in a setting in which the tectonic uplift rate decreased over the Quaternary to negligible values at present. Coralline limestones formed during eustatic highstands when alluvium was trapped upstream and wadis filled with debris. During lowstands, wadis cut into sedimentary deposits; coupled with continuing uplift, fans were dissected, leaving remnant surfaces, and wadirelated terraces were generated by down cutting. Only landforms from the past three to four eustatic sea level cycles (i.e., approximately 300 to 400 kyr) are likely to have survived erosion and deposition associated with fluvial processes.

A partial Landsat TM scene of the upper Texas coast was classified according to the NOAA CoastWatch-Change Analysis Program landcover classification scheme. Thirteen major wetland, upland and open water landcover types were identified using a series of supervised and unsupervised classification procedures. The classification accuracy was estimated using two accuracy assessment methods: ground truthing 407 sites located with Global Positioning System (GPS) and direct overlay of wetland categories with comparable United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) National Wetland Inventory (NWI) data. Comparisons of the accuracy assessment estimates found that the ground truthing method consistently produced higher accuracy estimates than that of the direct overlay method. It was concluded that ancillary data as a means of accuracy assessment for classified imagery as an alternative to ground truthing should be used with caution.																	0025-3324					SUM	1994	28	2					4	9										WOS:A1994PQ19700002

Two scenes from different dates were processed using a conventional maximum likelihood classifier and a fully constrained linear mixture model. The Landsat TM data was atmospherically and radiometrically corrected to allow meaningful comparison to be made between the scenes. The data were geometrically rectified and incorporated into a coastal monitoring Geographical Information System (GIS) along with information acquired from previous ground based surveys. The relative accuracy of two mapping procedures was assessed by cross tabulating the satellite imagery with ground based surveys. The results show that both classification techniques adequately delimit over 90% of the intertidal vegetation. However, both methods had difficulty in discriminating between the Pioneer zone vegetation and intertidal sediments. Linear unmixing appeared to be the most accurate method for mapping pioneer zone vegetation and this should form the basis of further research.

J	ZAINAL, AJM				ZAINAL, AJM			NEW TECHNIQUE FOR ENHANCING THE DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF SHALLOW MARINE HABITATS	MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL												A new method is described for enhancing the visual interpretation and quantitative analysis of shallow marine habitats. The method is based on the principle of exploiting the critical depth range of each habitat using a Degital Elevation Model (DEM) generated from a bathymetric map of the study area. The DEM is used as an input into a mathematical model derived by regressing known depth data with their thematic mapper (TM) spectral values over the dominating depth-variable sandy substrate. The resulting depth reflectance image is then combined with the TM bands to minimize the effect of depth variation within the image. The new method proved to be effective for enhancing the visual interpretation of submerged habitats and particularly sea-grass beds off the coast of Bahrain which could not be detected with conventional image processing techniques. The technique also proved to be useful for enhancing areas of high suspended sediments in the water. In the quantitative analysis stage, the technique was found to increase the final classification accuracy of the subscene substantially. The slope and aspect variation of the topography caused confusion in classification between some of the habitats. Ways of improving the technique are suggested for future investigations.																	0025-3324					SUM	1994	28	2					68	77										WOS:A1994PQ19700010

Gold mineralization on Wetar island, Maluku, was first detected in 1986 as a stream sediment bulk leach extractable gold response of 10 ppb. Stream float mapping and sampling with systematic soil and rockchip sampling gave up to 13 g/t Au, with associated high Ag, Pb, As and Ba values at surface from W5 (Lerokis), one of seven promising initial anomalies. Detailed mapping and rockchip sampling, followed by scout diamond drilling, showed that most significant Au values were associated with barite-rich rocks in basinal structures. Systematic follow-up of the more promising anomalies began in 1987. The best results were obtained from W5 where a number of zones up to 200 X 500 m in size were outlined, with soil and rock values of 1 to 13 ppm Au. Ground geophysical surveys including electromagnetics (EM), induced polarization (IP) and resistivity gave several broad anomalies indicative of shallow conductors. Between 1987 and 1988, aerial reconnaissance was undertaken to locate other areas of visible alteration. This was integrated with Landsat thematic mapper data and defined seven red-stained anomalies in addition to W5, occurring within 5 km of the coast. Ground checks showed that only one of these anomalies, KK3 (Kali Kuning), contained significant surficial Au values. From 1989 to 1992, almost 20,000 m of diamond and reverse circulation (RC) drilling defined geological resources of 2.9 Mt at 3.5 g/t Au, 114 g/t Ag and 40% barite at Lerokis and 2.2 Mt at 5.5 g/t Au, 146 g/t Ag and 60% barite at Kali Kuning. Most other anomalies were then mapped and/or systematically sampled to delineate prospects outlined previously. Regional work is ongoing to define additional resources, using airphoto-based mapping and stream sediment sampling as the principal tools. Integrated exploration has discovered over 20 tonnes of near-surface Au on Wetar at a low cost. Mining operations began late in 1990 at Lerokis, and will begin in 1994 at Kali Kuning. This has formed the basis of an enterprise capable of giving direct employment to over 250 people for more than seven years and providing a return on exploration expenditure.																	0375-6742					MAR	1994	50	1-3					337	350		10.1016/0375-6742(94)90030-2								WOS:A1994NG55200012

Using a mosaic of 23 Landsat thematic mapper scenes (5x10(5) km2) together with field, geochemical and geochronological data, we identified and mapped lithologic units, mobile belts, and terranes within the Arabian and Nubian Shields. Features best align if Arabia is rotated by 6.7-degrees around a pole at latitude 34.6-degrees-N, longitude 18.1-degrees-E. Implications of our reconstruction include (1) the amount of continental crust underlying the Red Sea is small because the restored Red Sea coasts are typically juxtaposed, (2) only a single pole is needed, implying that the Arabian and Nubian Shields were rigid plates during Red Sea rifting, (3) coastlines reorient to align with preexisting structures, suggesting the rift propagated in part along pre-existing zones of weakness, (4) large sinistral displacements of up to 350 km along the Red Sea are not supported, (5) the pole is inconsistent with the Pliocene-Pleistocene motion along the Dead Sea transform (pole: 32.8-degrees-N, 22.6-degrees-E +/-0.5-degrees [Joffe and Garfunkel, 1987]), indicating that more than one phase of motion is required to account for the Red Sea opening. However, our pole is similar to that for the total motion along the Dead Sea transform (pole: 32.7-degrees-N, 19.8-degrees-E +/-2-degrees [Joffe and Garfunkel, 1987]), suggesting that the motion between Arabia and Nubia was parallel to the total motion along the Dead Sea transform.

The study area is located on a tectonically stable part of the Brazilian shelf which presently shows a minor uplift rate of 0.2 mm year-1, to the north of Natal in the State of Rio Grande do Norte. This submerged shoreline is characterized by the occurrence of a large number of long beachrock outcrops (> 3 km in length), observed by diving, which are comparable to their analogues seen on the present-day beaches of the adjacent coast. The good state of preservation of this shoreline and the large number of carbonate rock 'reefs' on it suggest abruptness of a return to transgressive sea-level trend with high growth rates subsequent to a long-lived sea-level relating to the 11000-9000 yr B.P. band. By reviewing high resolution paleoclimatic data from this period, we conjecture that this stillstand could be a consequence of the Younger Dryas cold event in the north Atlantic, which might have also had importance as a driving morphogenetic process for coasts in a global scale.

J	JOSHI, MD; SAHAI, B				JOSHI, MD; SAHAI, B			MAPPING OF SALT-AFFECTED LAND IN SAURASHTRA COAST USING LANDSAT SATELLITE DATA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Coastal salt-affected land is subject to variation in area as well as magnitude with time because of influence of coastal processes. In order to take corrective and protective measures, it is essential to have accurate information about such an area in the form of maps. Using conventional ground methods, mapping of such an inhospitable area is not only difficult and time-consuming but also expensive, laborious, and associated with vagaries of weather. Hence an attempt has been made to use remote sensing techniques for the purpose of preparing a map of one of the coastal areas of Gujarat state, providing information about the extent and magnitude of salt-affected land.																	0143-1161					JUL 10	1993	14	10					1919	1929		10.1080/01431169308954012								WOS:A1993LR84800007						
J	KUNTE, PD; WAGLE, BG				KUNTE, PD; WAGLE, BG			REMOTE-SENSING APPROACH TO DETERMINE NET SHORE DRIFT DIRECTION - A CASE-STUDY ALONG THE CENTRAL EAST-COAST OF INDIA	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Thematic Mapper imageries of Landsat 5 are visually interpreted to determine long-term sediment transport direction also called net shore drift direction along central east coast of India. Two approaches are adopted while utilizing the remote sensing data for this purpose. Net shore drift direction is determined firstly by studying various coastal landform indicators and secondly by studying offshore turbidity distribution patterns. The results of both the approaches are compared and presented here. Landform indicators study suggests that shore drift direction is towards the southwest direction during northeast monsoon and towards northeast direction during southwest monsoon period. From offshore turbidity pattern, shore drift direction is determined as towards the southwest. Based on these studies and other related evidence, it is concluded that net shore drift direction is towards south-southwest. The present study demonstrates the capability of satellite remote sensing, which provides periodic, integrated and synoptic views, for determining net shore drift direction correctly, economically, and quickly.																	0749-0208					SUM	1993	9	3					663	672										WOS:A1993LK50300005						
J	KUNTE, PD; WAGLE, BG				KUNTE, PD; WAGLE, BG			DETERMINATION OF NET SHORE DRIFT DIRECTION OF CENTRAL WEST-COAST OF INDIA USING REMOTELY-SENSED DATA	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Landsat images along with aerial photographs of the central west coast of India were studied to mark drift cells and determine shore drift of the area. For this purpose, coastal landform indicators like stream mouth diversion, spit growth, recession of cliffs, beach width, mid-bay bar and tombolos and man-made structures interrupting shore drift were studied. As many as 42 drift cells were marked. It is found that within some drift cells, drift direction is due north though net shore drift direction of the area is towards the south. As a result, shore drift is eroding sediments from the cliffy coast of the northern sector and is depositing them in the southern sector causing recession and accretion of the respective coastal sectors. It is concluded that geomorphic landform indicators studied using remotely sensed data provide a quick, reliable and accurate solution for determining the net shore drift direction.																	0749-0208					SUM	1993	9	3					811	822										WOS:A1993LK50300015

From January through April, this open water periodically exposed the shelf to sediment entrainment by suspension freezing. This process requires turbulence and supercooled water, which results in the formation of frazil and anchor ice. The resulting granular, sediment-laden ice was observed to extend over 100 km seaward of the outer continental shelf after having been advected offshore. It was sampled to determine sediment type and to quantify the particle load. The particle size was mainly silt and clay, with local admixtures of as much as 27% sand and coarser clasts. Melted ice samples contained from 31 to nearly 600 mg L-1 of sediment. Combining these data with over 400 km of shipboard and aerial observations, photographs, and computer analysis of a summer Landsat image, we estimated the sediment load per unit area of sea ice. Seaward of the shelf, in regions of dense pack ice, a conservatively estimated sediment load was over 289 t km-2. Using a westward summer drift rate of 3 cm s-1, the sediment transport through a 1-km-long north-south segment is 67,418 t during 3 mo. In terms of regional sediment dynamics (littoral transport estimated at 10,000 t during the same period) and sediment budget (continental denudation estimated at 10 t k-m2 during the same period), this number is very significant. Benthic microfossils indicate that bottom sediment incorporated in the ice came from water depths ranging from the inner neritic seaward to 50 m. The large load of shelf-derived sediment observed seaward of the continental shelf indicates that ice entrainment and transport cause shelf erosion. Nothing is known about sediment release over the Arctic Ocean Basin from these pulses of dirty ice that are periodically introduced into the Transpolar Drift.																	0004-0851					MAY	1993	25	2					83	98		10.2307/1551544								WOS:A1993LC44700001
