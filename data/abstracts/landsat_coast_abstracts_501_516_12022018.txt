The exclusive use of traditional surveying tools may not be practical for monitoring large, remote, or rapidly changing areas. This paper investigates the utility of multispectral Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite data for documenting changes to a Caribbean coastal zone using the change vector analysis processing technique. The area of study was the coastal region near the village of Buen Hombre on the north coast of the Dominican Republic. The primary habitats of interest were the intertidal mangrove forests, and the shallow water seagrasses, macroalgae, and coral reefs. The change vector analysis technique uses any number of spectral bands from multidate satellite data to produce change images that yield information about both the magnitude and direction of differences in pixel values (which are proportional to radiance). The final products were created by appending color-coded change pixels onto a black-and-white base map. The advantages and limitations of the technique for coastal inventories are discussed.																	0099-1112					MAR	1993	59	3					381	384										WOS:A1993LC77500010

The raw data comprized several digital TM images acquired between 1985 and 1992 during different tidal conditions. Following pre-processing and registration to a digitized UTM marine chart, the image processing proceeded in two parts. In the first part, visual interpretation was employed using a combination of principal component and false color composites (FCCs) of the multi-temporal images to identify the changed areas. Then, and in conjunction with extensive field data, the changed areas between the two dates were identified. In the second part, post-classification comparison was employed in combination with digital elevation data to quantify the magnitude of habitat change in the identified areas. The spectral similarity between some of the submerged habitats and, in particular, between seagrass and deep water, and between seagrass, corals, and algae caused confusion in classification. However, it was found that the problems can be significantly reduced by subdividing the images around the change areas and then classifying each subscene independently after appropriate masking of deep water areas. The results indicated that between 1985 and 1992, an estimated total of 38,700 m2 of dense corals, 1.8 x 10(5) m2 of lower density corals, and 10.2 x 10(6) m2 of seagrass areas were lost. On the other hand, an increase of 4.3 x 10(5) m2 of algae (Sargassum) was detected in the study area near a large industrial outfall.																	0099-1112					MAR	1993	59	3					415	421										WOS:A1993LC77500015						
J	EKSTRAND, S				EKSTRAND, S			LANDSAT TM BASED QUANTIFICATION OF CHLOROPHYLL-A DURING ALGAE BLOOMS IN COASTAL WATERS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Simultaneous acquisition of Landsat TM imagery and sea truth data from sample sites in Himmerfjarden bay on the Swedish east coast was conducted on 10 May 1988, and 7 May 1990. The data were used to develop and verify regression models for the estimation of surface chlorophyll-a concentrations. The case 2 waters studied partly hold suspended sediment concentrations known to complicate the mapping of chlorophyll-a. The disturbing spectral influence from suspended sediment was reduced by using a process based on an existing Landsat TM sediment retrieval algorithm and a priori knowledge about water depths, bottom sediments and river outlets. The results suggest that a ratio of TM bands TM1/(log TM3 + 1) should be used in waters influenced by terrigenous influx and the earlier suggested ratio of TM bands 1/2 only in ocean waters. The discrimination power indicated a capability to quantify chlorophyll in connection with algae blooms.																	0143-1161					JUL 10	1992	13	10					1913	1926		10.1080/01431169208904240								WOS:A1992JC99800010

To test between the two hypotheses, we used a digital color mosaic of 23 Landsat thematic mapper (TM) scenes with field, geochemical, and geochronological data to identify and correlate crosscutting geologic features on the African and Arabian sides. Faults, shear zones, sutures, granitic complexes, volcano-sedimentary units, and dike swarms align if Arabia is rotated relative to Africa by 6.7-degrees around a pole at lat 34.6-degrees-N, long 18.1-degrees-E. This. solution implies that the amount of continental rust underlying the Red Sea is small because the restored Red Sea coasts are typically juxtaposed.

J	MYSAK, LA; HUANG, FT				MYSAK, LA; HUANG, FT			A LATENT-HEAT AND SENSIBLE-HEAT POLYNYA MODEL FOR THE NORTH WATER, NORTHERN BAFFIN-BAY	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY												The Pease latent-heat polynya model is coupled to a reduced-gravity, coastal upwelling model in order to simulate the formation and maintenance of the North Water (NOW), the Arctic's largest polynya, located in northern Baffin Bay. In this region, strong northerly winds during winter and spring drive ice southward as fast as it is produced locally (the Pease mechanism for polynya formation), and also produce upwelling of warm subsurface water along the west coast of Greenland. This upwelling provides an upward heat flux that melts ice near the coast (a sensible-heat mechanism for polynya formation). This combined latent- and sensible-heat Polynya model is formulated as an initial-boundary value problem with uniform winds. Its solution gives the time evolution of the upper-layer velocity and depth, and also the polynya width as measured southward from the northern boundary of the polynya. There are two fundamental time scales in the problem: a fast one (of the order of days) that characterizes the polynya opening by the Pease mechanism, and a slow one (of the order of weeks) that describes the evolution of the upwelling of warm subsurface water along the Greenland coast and hence the gradual southward extension of the ice edge in this region via the sensible-heat mechanism for polynya formation. The steady-state (asymptotic or limiting) polynya width is a strong function of the air temperature, but a weak function of the wind speed. The model results show that in the upwelling region near the Greenland coast, the limiting polynya width is considerably larger than farther offshore, where it is a constant (the limiting Pease width). This ice-edge configuration is in general agreement with that seen in recent Landsat satellite images of the NOW. For a spatially varying wind field, the southern ice edge of the NOW has an offshore profile similar to that of the wind stress forcing. In a north-south channel domain formulation of the model, upwelling occurs in the eastern part (i.e., near Greenland) and downwelling in the western part (near Ellesmere Island). Thus, the polynya is wider near Greenland and narrower near the Canadian islands.																	0022-3670					JUN	1992	22	6					596	608		10.1175/1520-0485(1992)022<0596:ALASHP>2.0.CO;2								WOS:A1992HX27700003

In this study, band 1 and band 2 data were used for mapping of subtidal coastal habitats in the Abu Ali Bay, Gulf Coast of Saudi Arabia. The method used here is based on eigenvector rotation of the two bands to enhance bottom type variations. The eigenvector rotation reduced the effect of water depth variations on bottom types. The results are presented as a colour-coded image showing five major habitats in Abu Ali Bay.																	0143-1161					MAR 10	1992	13	4					605	614		10.1080/01431169208904140								WOS:A1992HG84500003

The study area (30 km x 30 km) is swept by unidirectional, wind-driven, tidally rectified currents, under the influence of the North Brazil Current. The study was made by use of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data of the seafloor down to 40 m depth, digital bathymetric data from smooth sheets furnished by the Brazilian Navy, echo-sounder profiling and underwater surveying by SCUBA diving. A mesoscale shore-parallel natural zonation of the sandstream was observable on the TM-images: (a) an inner zone dominated by sediment resuspension caused by wave-driven turbulence and tidal currents; (b) an intermediate zone dominated by sand ribbons and other longitudinal bedforms; (c) an outer zone dominated by large-scale sand waves (underwater sand dunes) limited offshore by shore-parallel sandbanks. Image-assisted in situ work, carried out on the latter zone, gave the following results: (1) Morphology and sand composition-the asymmetric sand waves are made of medium quartz sand, with almost straight crests of lengths up to 4 km, heights between 3 and 7 m, and avalanche lee slopes of 30-degrees; on the stoss sides we recorded the presence of ripples and absence of megaripples and benthic ecosystems; on interdune areas, benthic ecosystem patches dominated by foliaceous and calcareous algae were found. (2) Sediment transport-active bedload transport was observable only during the winter season, when the strongest wind-forced currents induce flow separation at the crests and avalanche streams on the lee slope. Within the interdune areas, under the influence of the lee vortices, benthic community data confirms no appreciable abrasion due to sand transport. (3) Biology-species composition and biomass estimates from the algal patches in the first upstream trough are presented, and species composition of bryozoa observed as epibionts on live gastropod shells are analysed. This sandstream shows some similarities to one described from the southeast African continental shelf, which is also under the influence of unidirectional currents.

During winter, the central lake usually remains open, while sand-charged ice formed in coastal waters in displaced lakeward from the western shore in long, sinuous bands by offshore winds. Under some conditions, these ice streamers are dissipated within 2 to 20 km from the coast. This occurred during offshore collection of ice-rafted sand and gravel, demonstrating a net loss of beach sand from the windward shore to deep water. Under other conditions, ice streamers can cross the lake, leading to ice accumulations at the downwind or lee shore. Northwesterly winds dominate winter weather, so ice accumulations form mainly in the southeastern end of the lake, where they ultimately melt. Thus, ice rafting may be partly responsible for net sediment progradation at this southeastern, lee shore during the last few thousand years, and adds course grains to basin muds.																	0749-0208					SUM	1991	7	3					653	664										WOS:A1991FW19500006						
J	LEGG, CA				LEGG, CA			A REVIEW OF LANDSAT MSS IMAGE ACQUISITION OVER THE UNITED-KINGDOM, 1976-1988, AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR OPERATIONAL REMOTE-SENSING	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												A review of Landsat MultiSpectral Scanner 'Quicklook' images in the National Remote Sensing Centre archive indicates that, on average, only one satellite pass in six over the United Kingdom results in cloud-free imagery. There are significant regional and inter-annual variations in acquisition of cloud-free imagery. Coastal districts are relatively less cloudy than inland upland areas, while the south-east of Britain and the western coast have the highest percentages of useful imagery. Inter-annual variations suggest that the chances of acquiring data from currently operational satellites within the precise date intervals required for automated crop mapping on a regular basis are very low. A wide range of other operational applications of remote sensing with less rigorous acquisition requirements are possible in the U.K. with current sensors. The study highlights the need for more frequent imaging by sensors of Thematic Mapper and SPOT HRV types, in order to minimize the effect of cloud cover, and the longer-term requirement for development of all-weather microwave imaging systems of comparable spatial and spectral resolution to current optical sensors.																	0143-1161					JAN	1991	12	1					93	106		10.1080/01431169108929634								WOS:A1991EV59800007

This coastal flow is discussed in the light of both barotropic and baroclinic models so as to be able to set up the appropriate dynamical framework for the observations. The surface signal of the warm, fresh river water was deduced from NOAA 9 and LANDSAT satellite imagery, and is shown to form a large anticyclonic eddy (40 km in diameter) at the mouth of the river, and subsequently to flow southwards along the coast in a narrow (15 km wide) plume at 20 ms-1 for some 120 km. An unusual aspect of the satellite observations was the very clear thermal signal seen on 8 and 11 March 1988, which can be ascribed to the fact that very light winds prevailed at this time. Such a flow is to be expected from the theoretical dynamics in the absence of local wind. Later observations showed that after the south-easterly wind increased on 16/17 March, the surface river plume responded by flowing to the north. Measurements of surface salinity were made from the RS Benguela on 12 March and showed very fresh water (22 x 10-3) at the surface in the region of the eddy at the river mouth. Lower than usual salinities (28-34 x 10-3) were measured as far south as Hondeklip Bay, about 200 km south of the Orange River.																	0035-919X						1990	47		3				307	330		10.1080/00359199009520245								WOS:A1990ET04200005
